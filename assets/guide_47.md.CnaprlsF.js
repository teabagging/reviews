The text is dry to say the least and often vague or incoherent. For example things are explained in methods such as \\"assume there 4 processes and no more are coming\\" well okay there bud. And every other reviewer has said it and I'm going to say it too, the labs are horrible! The objectives are vague the suggestions given are among the most convoluted ways to approach them, and the concepts and skills neccissary and no where to be found in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deadlock or Deadwrong","review":"Mr. Nutt is a terrible author. He teaches at the University of Colorado, Boulder and it is also well known that he publishes an update every semester forcing his poor students to buy the new edition. As the other reviews pointed out, not only was this book poorly written it is poorly edited with an onslaught of errors. If you are a college teacher looking for a book to use in your Operating Systems class, DO NOT USE THIS BOOK, it is a concatenation of all the bad parts of other good books on Operating Systems."},{"rating":"1","title":"uninformative and incoherent","review":"Gary Nutt is incapable of writing. He is verbose and repetitive and spends a lot of time on pointless topics, such as notation for sets. Like so many mediocre authors, he fills the text with pseudo-mathematical notation to make it seem more sophisticated. The typesetting is deplorable, and I recommend he learn LaTeX.Nutt assumes the reader is a complete idiot. The book is an overview of the concepts of operating systems, which aren't remotely sophisticated. You will not learn anything practical about Operating Systems, and the concepts he covers are so trivial that you could learn in all in a day (once you extract them from the hundreds of pages or jargon and silly diagrams).I recommend \\"Operating Systems: Design and Implementation\\" by Andrew Tanenbaum and Al Woodhull instead of this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book ever","review":"I've been forced to buy this book and unfortunately using it for a month. The chapters are totaly inconprehensible, the information is scatered all over the book. He starts a subject, skip to another and get back to it a few chapters later. The problem sets are bogus. They ask about things that are not in the chapter and you can spend hours trying to figure out what he wants, just to find out after a few week that the answer is five chapter s later. The diagrams don't make sens whatsoever, some of them have so many lines you mistake them for abstract paintings. Don't try to use the code from the book, as it crashes all the time. Instead use the updates from Nutt's page, that also crash. The bottom line is : don't buy the book if you don't have to, and if you must, just copy the problem sets, because reading the book won't help you solve them. I would give this book 0 stars, but unfortunately it is not allowed."},{"rating":"1","title":"If your a teacher read this !!!","review":"This book is pretty criptic and not recommend for use in the class room. there are many other books which do a better job of covering more topics and providing better descriptions and solutions. if you are a teacher considering this book for an operating systems class please consider your students and look at something different. if you don't you will spend lots of time decifering the authors wonderful mathmatical formulations of the topics he does cover"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst CS Book I have ever purchased and had the displeasure of reading","review":"I bought this book because it was required for my Operating Systems class and boy is this book terrible.

If you are a professor, please find a better book for your CS students."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long-winded, overly-redundant, difficult to follow","review":"I'll admit that writing a book on operating system is difficult, but this book is a huge disappointment for being a \\"3rd Edition\\". I agree with the other reviewer who said this book \\"does more harm than good.\\" Another issue, is that this book is out of date and hasn't been revised to reflect the current state of operating systems. Many of the more interesting concepts such as monitors and thread safety are not given enough treatment."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE SAME AS 3RD EDITION","review":"Beware, this book is NOT the same as the 3rd edition book.

Unfortunately I didn't know this until after a special trip to the drugstore to get the film developed.

Read the whole thing or just read the first installment over and over and over again. It won't make the slightest bit of difference. For all it's supposedly clever feints, I found this book a grinding test of patience. Once you read the frist chapter, you've about got it. Characters, plot, and style are all thin to the point of banal, and the whole somehow manages to be even less than the sum of these thin ingredients. Among the other chores the reader must accomplish to reach the finish is to join in the narrator's conceit that his excessivly adolescent notes for a book would somehow interest a publisher, much less a reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"The most amazing part was watching it on Mother's day and the twist at the end.

I should have looked at that review before my purchase. I gave the movie two stars, the extra star was just for the the actors. The actors were good and deserved a much better script.

I have a 65\\" 3D LCD led HDTV that I spent 3 thousand for. After talking with amazon for 20 minutes I had to unplug the tv, loose some of my settings and loose interest in the movie cause it was off so long. So after about 50 minutes the movie was back on and I asked if I can get a credit and his response was didn't the movie come back on. I said for my inconvenience!

Every once in a while I feel the pressing need to add my opinion and this time is one of them. Rebecca De Mornay should have waited for a much better vehicle to try to make her entrance back into film. Oh, and one more thing? She looks just like Hillary Clinton and that creates an odd impression also of our secretary of state slashing and killing all the way through a movie.

The helmet was on sale else ware, so I got it cheaper, but it is nothing like on the box. Instead of a properly shaped brass/gold color it looks like oxidized bronze, not to mention the cheek pieces stick out, unlike the picture. For the thirty dollars I paid I would say it was not worth it.

I would also like an easier way to control the volume.Great buy and overall tough product."},{"rating":"2","title":"immerses you in the world of the wolf and the blues","review":"In a word: spectacular. These writers have filled in what was, until now, the blank slate of Wolf's childhood and early life. They also describe every facet of his long career in detail, all the way from when he first started playing with Charlie Patton in the 1920s up to his last big show in Chicago in the 1970s. All the major players are in here: Willie Johnson, Hubert Sumlin, Sam Lay, Jody Williams, Eddie Shaw, Jimmy Rogers, Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Sonny Boys I and II, Little Walter, and on and on. So are an amazing number of fists, knives, bullets, and other instruments of mayhem-a lot more than you'd expect any human could survive in one lifetime. This is the big book about the big man that every blues fan's been waiting for for many years. It'll probably be the definitive biography and maybe the only one needed about the Wolf. Blues biographies don't get any better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Providing new details about his youth and later years","review":"Howlin Wolf was born in 1910 as a poverty-stricken sharecropper in Mississippi who began his career singing for two decades in juke joints with the first Delta blues stars: James Segrest and Mark Hoffman's Moanin' At Midnight: The Life And Times Of Howlin' Wolf provides a powerful definitive biography of the blues musician which delves into his early years. These years are often overlooked in competing biographies which focus on his successful years, so Moanin At Midnight stands out on this point if nothing else, providing surprising new details about his youth and later years. Highly recommended for any prior Howlin Wolf fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"This is a great book, has a lot of incredible information and you can tell it was thoroughly researched. Some great stories and info on Wolf that you can't get anywhere else.The only thing holding it back is it's very meticulously presented. Well researched but not necessarily well written. The listing of every single recording session listing the musicians and doing quick, generic reviews of some of the songs was OK, but I would've rather heard some stories from the musicians about the sessions than just that they happened. There was some of this, but not enough for my taste.Still, overall, it's a great book, well worth the read for any blues fan or even music fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moanin in the Moonlight","review":"Great book- this will rock your world and more people need to know of the Wolf's power in and on music ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moanin'","review":"Interesting.

The author spends more time listing every single bluesman he has every seen or heard of. The author is more concerned with showing off his knowledge of blues than telling Wolf's story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite a disappointment","review":"When left at room temperature on the kitchen table the indoor temperature reading was about 4 degrees higher than the outdoor temperature. (I expected both readings to be the same.) Once installed in accordance with the instructions, the outdoor temperature reading stays about 10 degrees higher than readings on other thermometers placed along side the sensor. In addition, the thin strip of liquid in both glass tubes make it difficult to read the temperatures.

But no matter, for I am content to have the group's 1970 seminal release by the same name which features said track; one of their most complex and intricate arrangements, and a song that for many defined CSNY's signature harmonious stylings. Still, an otherwise great anthology by a timeless quartet. Glad to hear--and see--them still rocking in all their glory even now in 2006!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent \\"Best Of\\" collection","review":"Two CDs packed with great songs; I'm very happy with this collection. If you have some CSN or CSNY albums, you are obviously going to repeat more than a few tracks with this collection, but it covers so much ground, and includes a few unreleased or hard-to-find nuggets (such as the amazing version of \\"Horses Through a Rainstorm\\"), that you won't regret getting this set too. There are going to be critics who lament the omission of certain songs, but that always happens with compilations like this one. Personally, I think the compilers did a very complete job putting this set together. And if you ARE new to this legendary group of musicians, this is a great place to immerse yourself in some of the finest melodic folk-rock of the 1970s. As another reviewer noted, this is a much better deal, and offers a better overview, than the single \\"hits\\" collection. Great songs that have stood the test of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"((((BEWARE)))) NOT WHAT IT CLAIMS TO BE !","review":"This isn't the excellent collection it appears to be. There are TWELVE alternate versions (demos) in this collection. That would be fine, if they had said this anywhere on the outside packaging, BUT THEY DIDN'T.So now I'm stuck with an expensive double cd of demos songs I cannot stand because they don't sound like the versions I wanted, and because they remind me of how much I want to throw this at Graham Nash's head. Shame on you Nash!!!Also, as another reviewer said, the sound quality is less than stellar. With music of this (potential) quality, you should not waste your money on inferior versions and inferior mastering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst purchase I've made for CSN","review":"This 2 CD album, which is rated 4.5 stars by many people is actually one of my WORST purchases!

Perhaps it's because I read it in \\"isolation\\" and didn't even realize Diaz is the critics darling. In my opinion it's decent, but it's far from one of the most interesting books I've ever read. It's difficult to understand--it reads like a novel, but it's really a collection of short stories. The reoccuring characters get confusing, and one cannot discern who was in which story and when. The stories for me just lack that certain *umph*. I've read many other, better, books about the American-dream-gone-awry experience. Try _Native Speaker_ or _White Boy Shuffle_ to see what it really means to be an outsider living in the U.S. Or _The House on Mango Street_ for a Mexican girl's perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Short Story Collection in Years","review":"This is the most exciting and impressive short story collection to emerge since Denis Johnson's Jesus' Son. It's rare these days to come across a collection of stories which work so well together, as a whole--but these do.

I picked up his first book and wished I had read it sooner. A great and wonderful book. The reviewer who criticized it seems to want to down grade a popular book. This is no fade. Mr Diaz writes of humans in their greatest potential and cruelest reality, but give us a sense of self and humanism. The people, the places, the stories, he knows how to capture. He is a great writer. It may be cliche, but I could not put this book down; no matter how busy I was. I looked forward to his new release and his new novel too, does not disappoint.

More raging-into-manhood than coming-of-age, the stories in \\"Drown\\" each reflect different aspects of a young life: from hard-edged, yet tender humor (\\"Fiesta, 1980\\" and \\"How To Date A Browngirl, Blackgirl, Whitegirl Or A Halfie\\"), the heartbreaking (\\"Ysrael\\") to the bittersweet (\\"Negocios\\") and angst-riddedn anxiety (\\"Drown\\").Diaz' prose does not contain one false note and his work will be greatly appreciated for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"It deserves not a 10, but an 11.","review":"When this book first came out I approached it with apprehension because it had been received with such fanfare by the literati and laymen alike. Indeed, so great was the hype that I honestly believed that regardless of the quality of the book, It would fail to live up to the praise bestowed upon it. Thus, you may imagine how pleasantly surprised I was when I realized that, in fact, Junot Diaz is an incredibly talented writer. I've read collections of short stories that showcase the skills of some of the most gifted writers of the 20th century, and, honestly, Diaz has written some stories that surpass anything I had read before. True, some of Diaz's stories are not as effective as the majority, yet that is because most of the stories in Drown are bona fide gems. I know I'm getting too effusive here, so I'll stop. Still, If you like to read good literature, this is a book that you definitely should consider. I look forward to reading Diaz's first novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"good, but not great","review":"I've heard such good things about this book and was disappointed once I got around to reading it. It was good, but not great. I get the sense that this is one of those over-hyped, over-rated books that come down the pipe every year by the latest \\"new, young writer.\\" I'll look forward to reading what Diaz writes in the years ahead. For my taste, he hasn't hit the mark yet -- but maybe in the future he will. Worth a look, but no big deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Junot Diaz- Refreshingly new and unabashed","review":"Junot Diaz's work in Drown was a refreshing change from the often stale world of modern literature. I recently heard Diaz speak and read excerpts from both Nilda and his novel-in-progress at the University of Vermont. Diaz in person was the same as Diaz on paper; a clear voice unafraid to confront the difficult and cruelly humorous world in which we live. It was a moving experience to hear and meet him in person, and I consider him one of the most promising of today's young writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short and Sweet","review":"After reading Junot Diaz' \\"Oscar Wao\\" one would think that no other book would live up to it! but I was wrong!

Diaz is a decent writer, but by no means excellent. Many of his stories stop instead of ending. The story \\"drown\\" is particularly disappointing. I also noticed that he only uses spanish to say vulgar words. This seemed to me that he was just throwing spanish in to seem more cultural, and that the words were not a natural result of him being bilingual.He does get some things right, though. He has the beginnings of interesting characters and situations, but they are never fully developed, and seem to be lost in the larger waste. I do not agree ... that Diaz characters were all stereotypes. I found his characters to be diverse, distinct characters, and therefore reject the idea that his characters were cookie-cut outs.In the end, though, I would say this book is not worth reading, ... you would be much better off reading \\"The House on Mango Street\\" by Sandra Cisneros."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressed","review":"I must be honest I did not know who Junot Diaz was or any of his work.

To \\"Drown\\" the reader in a story that really is not credible nor really reflects the urban experience is completely irresponsible. Just like \\"Soul on Ice\\" or \\"Monster\\" this writer uses \\"sensationalism\\" and the erotic lure of the \\"Latino\\" culture, to get critics raving for his lack luster material. This book is highly offensive to anyone who is familiar with Latino literature or the Urban experience. The writer should have been more responsible for the book's content and its characters, who are only imaginary reflections of the Dominican/Puerto Rican/Latino experience in America. Its one thing to observe life in the Barrio, it's another to actually write about it with respect and honesty. The writing is terrible and the characters come out of a comic book. I give this book a thumbs down for its writing, depiction of characters, and flow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stories, prose problems","review":"Diaz writes some moving stories; it is hard not be emotionally involved with his characters and their circumstances. But one must wonder about Diaz's prose. The street slang is everywhere in these stories, and the effect, which I'm sure was intended to help the book, hurts it in the end. Diaz deals with serious issues in each story, and as a reader, it is harder to relate to what he is trying to get across when you have to read through vulgarities and street slang, some of which will probably become outdated real soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice guy, poor collection","review":"In this collection of ten stories, the narrator is a young Dominican Republic boy who grows up with his father in America and is waiting for him to send for the rest of the family. The stories explore everything from his parents' marriage falling apart to interracial dating. However, I disliked the style of stories going back and forth in time, it was confusing, and sometimes it took it a while to tell if we were in America or the Dominican Republic still, or how old the narrator was, I liked how the author used Spanish words thrown in to the story; it helped it sound more realistic. However, his spare style bugged me. I got to meet the author, and he read us a story from another collection, which I liked a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Boring selection of stories.

I re-read many of them for the sheer joy of being surprised, delighted, and angered again. Mr. Diaz is an artist with an unmatched eye for the telling detail, the telling moment. I felt, too, that the arrangement of the stories delineated a pattern that may or may not have been intended.

Perdomo takes this nameless, faceless character and gives him a name, a story, and a place in the world. It is amazing to me the way he is able to capture the essence of someone who is addicted to drugs, and plaster their story in the form of a poem.

This can be read without reading the first collection of stories, \\"Heroes in Hell,\\" though it's useful to know what comes before. The stories are loosely linked, and their charm comes mostly from the authors' choices of protagonists: Robert Silverberg's \\"Gilgamesh in Hell\\" is the standout, and the best in the book: see how HP Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard deal with the \\"2/3s god\\" Gilgamesh. There's another volume of stories if you care for this one: \\"Crusaders in Hell.\\" All three are good reads and entertaining to fans with a knowledge of history and literature (or just an interest in them)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Portable CD and Speakers","review":"This is an excellent portable CD player with a set of small portable speakers.

You get it all - raunchy jams like \\"Black-Eyed Blonde and \\"Nevermind\\", softer melodies such as \\"If You Want Me To Stay\\", and even a masterpiece instrumental called \\"Grand Pappy du Plenty\\". I've listened to this CD over a thousand times, and I'm not even close to being sick of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Funky","review":"This CD is excellent. I was a diehard chili peppers fan since I got Californication, and I gradually bought the older CDs.

My personal favorites are If You Want Me to Stay (Sly & the Family Stone cover), Jungle Man, American Ghost Dance, and Catholic School Girls Rule. Anthony's rapping vocal talent is highlighted here, as is Flea's excellent bass work.

She doesn't go into detail on what women like in men, how to ask for that date and how to be more interesting to her while on that date. You would think she would have this, but she doesn't. This book was a big let down for me. She went on too much on how couples interact with one another. Something a single guy doesn't need to know.

This book gives lots of details about the Characters and the Author. The Grey King is a North Wales Legend it is about a Golden Harp hidden in a certain hill. Two boys named Will and Bran will go against the Grey King's Evil powers. This book speaks two weird Languages: Welsh and Great Britain only in some parts of the book. They also speak English in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will finally makes sense","review":"Overall, the Dark Is Rising series hasn't really lived up to my expectations. It's good children's fantasy, but not great. This fourth book, though, is the best so far. Will, this time in Wales instead of Cornwall, continues his quest for magical objects to be used by the Light to battle the rising Dark. Unlike the second book (\\"The Dark Is Rising\\"), here Cooper manages to balance the two aspects of Will's character, both as a boy and an Old One. And the farms and countryside of Wales are vividly described, the other characters clear and believable. Perhaps because this book doesn't have a lot of other magical characters running around in it, the plot makes much better sense and the characters' motives seem more clearly thought out. I enjoyed this book; it makes me more anxious to read the last one in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I have ever read","review":"Will Stanton, struck down suddenly by a violent attack of hepatitis, is sent to Wales with family to recuperate.

But, once the harp is taken, the rest of the quest must take place in the valley of the Brenin Llwyd, the home of the Grey King, and he is the most powerful individual member of the Dark . . .This book was very probably the best in the series. A new character, Bran, the albino boy, is introduced, and this is not just a fantasy story but also a heart-rending tale of tragedy. It tells how the Dark can destroy love, and how betrayal can sometimes lead to something good, and ultimately teaches us all how to truly love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible book!","review":"This book was the best one of the series.

The scene deep inside the Craig is a bit messy feeling - just not as tight as the rest. Also, the ending comes just a bit quickly. It's amazing how fast Cooper wraps so much up, but the last scene still seems ever so slightly clipped.Positives: Incredible plotting, characters, setting, and overall storytelling. This is a rich read, despite its shortness. The fantasy elements blend very well(except for the scene inside the Craig; they just aren't as fluid there), and the real-life elements are some of the best in the whole series.

There's a silly teenage love story here, replete with a long-term fatal illness involved. If there ever was a place like Dreamland, I'd want to live there and never leave, too. Of course, one of the teenage goddesses is portrayed as a literary genius while her alcoholic love-sick dad can't manage to leave the couch as he moons over his dead wife.

Obviously, you're not buying Rolex quality for $70. For an all-metal watch, this watch is very lightweight. The band is made from hollow stamped steel pieces which are much lighter than the solid forged or cast pieces you see in fancier watches. The electric quartz Japanese watch movement is also much lighter than a mechanical watch movement. This works great as an everyday business-casual watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intro To Reality","review":"The Chili Peppers' playing on Mother's Milk is more metallic than ever, thanks to newcomers Chad Smith (drums) and especially John Frusciante (guitar). Thanks to their presence, Kiedis and Flea sound reinvigorated in their performances, but the material is inconsistent, with too much of the second half in particular seeming like undeveloped, loud-fast-manic schtick. Still, there are more than enough quality tracks to make the filler worth sorting through, most obviously the heavy reworking of Stevie Wonder's \\"Higher Ground\\" and the cautionary, heartfelt \\"Knock Me Down,\\" as well as several others scattered over the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"WARNING!","review":"There is no doubt that if a Chilli fan has started listening to the chilli's before this album, with freaky styley etc. adorning the shelf, you will certainly love this album. It's raw, edgy funk slap is your image of the band so you will know what you are in for. However, if you are a new listener in which album's like californication rest in the cd rack, then be weary, for what you shall hear is absolutely nothing like what you are used to. If you choose to get it, do not discard and forget about it. It should grow on you and you shall begin to love it's contrasting sounds and meanings. If it does not grow on you, then you had better stick to the new stuff cos the early is not your cup of tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"What happened to these days","review":"Sad...This is one of the greatest albums period, and this band has COMPLETELY gone to garbage...a pure example of the death of a band..."},{"rating":"2","title":"An improved classic.","review":"To me, this is the epitome of what the Chili Peppers represented at their peak. Fun funk and rockin' punk. If \\"Uplift Mofo Party Plan\\" wasn't my personal fave, it would easily be this. It opens perfectly with \\"Good Time Boys\\", then drops their first real hit \\"Higher Ground\\". And though I love those songs and \\"Knock Me Down\\", it's tracks like \\"Magic Johnson\\", \\"Stone Cold Bush\\", and \\"Sexy Mexican Maid\\" that make this so damn great. The original album alone is awesome, but then this disc is remastered, and has SIX bonus tracks. All of them are good, including the two more Hendrix covers that they drop. Of the re-issued first four albums, this is definitely the one to get. It'll make you feel 17 all over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"the old funk of chili peppers untill these rereleases i was unable to find, and i thank EMI for rerealeases. these are fun to listen to, i recommend Magic Johnson and Punk Rock Classic and Pritty Little Ditty."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Cd","review":"I have enjoyed listening to this cd many times.

LOOOOOOOOOOOL :p"},{"rating":"2","title":"Remastered? I'll say.","review":"One thing people have neglected to mention about this album is how great the remaster is. The original had a very flat 1980s rock equalization that did nothing for the guitar work or the outstanding rhythm section, as well as using WAY too much echo on Anthony's voice. The remaster has turned up the dynamics big time and the result is something more like Blood Sugar Sex Magic. It sounds SO much better. So much so, I'd consider buying a copy EVEN if you already have it on CD and VINYL like I do.Somebody kidnap this album's producer and make him redo all the grunge albums from the late 80s and early 90s. I can only wonder what magic he could do with Ten, My Brother the Cow, Uncle Anesthesia or Louder than Love..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums I own!!","review":"Absolutely LOVE this album!!! Im on a big Chili Peppers kick lately so I decided to buy this album and the only thing I regret is that I didnt buy it years ago!!! There isnt a bad song on the entire album, I find it incredibly fun to listen to....the guitar and bass work on this album are absolutely rockin and if you can listen to this album without having to get up and start rocking out to it...well then I dont know what is wrong with you!! Anthony Kiedis' vocals arent quite as refined as on the later albums, but they are by no means bad!! The songs are very catchy and fun. It always puts me in a better mood when I throw this album in!

The quality of the DVD is so poor that I have a hard time playing it in most DVD players."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic game","review":"I don't disagree with Devin's points, the game clearly lacks the kind of production that we've come to expect. One camera is used and it pans from one side of the court to the other.However, in my opinion, the game is a classic because there is so little of this period of college basketball available. It also shows that Lew Alcindor was a special basketball player who changed the course of the college game.If you like college basketball, buy this game to encourage the NCAA to release more like it. If you can live without the modern production touches, you'll see a great game of basketball."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems to be a good item","review":"I just recently bought this rack..I don't have that many magazines in it yet so I can't comment on the capacity.

Sure it has it's moments of pleasure...but so does defecating. After a few hours of playing this trash it starts to become repetitive and monotonous. I found most of the levels to be tedious and annoying instead of challenging. This game (if you want to call it that) lacks a basic structure of varying difficulty. Any self respecting gamer would be doing themselves a diservice by purchasing this peice of garbage. Don't even waste your time renting it.

The story is that the Furon empire was running out of DNA to make clone aliens to uphold their empire. So they send down one Cryptosporidium down to Earth to collect more DNA and save the Furons.This game may seem like Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, but its not. Its spawning a whole new generation of gaming. This basically is San Andreas take off the whole gangster crap thing, put in some funny aliens, great humor, and intense action. And you get Destroy All Humans! The missions never repeat themselves. Boss battles are soo intense. I ended up sweating. Parents, this game is completely suitable for kids too. This game just keeps sparking suprisies and new storylines to follow.

You can also fly in a jetpack,pick things up with telekinesis(with your mind) and fling them every which way. This is also a cool game for fans of sci-fi movies and the late 50's. The main character looks like the arbiter from Halo, but his abilities are much,much,cooler, like hipnotize people,read there thoughts, and more. My favorite is the saucer personally, that thing is awesome. I give this game a 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Destroy All Humans!","review":"A few previous reviews were accurate in stating the repetative nature of the game, but beyond that the game is actually an excellent title. The atmosphere is DEFINATELY the game's high point, as the characters are fantastic spoofs off 1950's American Mentality. One level allows you to convince the populace that everything's alright simply by blaming Communism.All in all the game lacks the innovation to make it a perfect title, but is fantastic nonetheless. Definately worth a play!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"This is Grand Theft Auto meets Oddworld.

Great GameplayTHIS IS THE FUNNIEST GAME TO COME OUT THIS YEAR!!!!! The classic 50's take on alien invasion is brilliant. And one of your weapons is an anal probe. That says it all.

However, like a leader inspiring her troops, Suwanai soon pulls the orchestra along in the coattails of her brilliance. It's not hard to see why Suwanai won the Tchaikovsky competition; her playing is extraordinary. Her playing is not clipped, scratchy, forced, or overzealous. She has a strictly lyrical touch that is ideally suited for Tchaikovsky's violin concerto, and with careful precision to boot. The only disadvantage to this recording is that it is live -- however that is more than made up for by the piano concerto played by another gem of a performer, pianist Boris Berezovsky."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book is excellent and very useful.","review":"Every serious trader should read this book.

After reading it I immediately began integrating many of Dr. Elder's ideas into my trading.In particular, I found Dr. Elder's advanced ideas on money management & profit targets extremely helpful. His analysis of the psychological aspects of market participants--the never ceasing battle between bulls and bears, between \\"outsiders\\" and \\"insiders\\"--and how these affect the movement of prices are very illuminating.I thank Dr. Elder for his work.

I have traded for 3 years and must admit his first book was ok, it made me very conscious of expenses and their impact on your profitability. (Most traders make 1 to 2 cents a share so trading costs must be controlled.) Guess what, Elder goes back over this area again and again and again.Elder is not a good writer. He wanders, he repeats himself, he goes off about a \\"loser\\" trading gold futures instead of spending time with his family. He writes about owning a PC with kilobytes instead of megabytes. It's so hopelessly mixed up that I hope he gets to the point. But there is none.Save your money,the guy can't write."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This is a great book.

If you are new yourself this book is a good read but much of the terminology used is expected that you already know but yet the author is trying to right to the 'Amateur' trader. I would recommend finding a more lower lvl book to get those basics that an Amateur needs and after understanding those concepts this book makes a great next step to read. Reading and implimenting are two different things and it would obviously be a while testing and implimenting before any judgement can be reached by anyone on it's successful nature.

So, after hunting around on Amazon, I realized that there are two manufacturers selling the T3 on Amazon, with a significant price difference: Beauty Collection and Discount Jungle. Beauty Collection specifically states in its warranty description that it will honor the 48 month manufacturer.

THe content is great, especially for anyone with more than a nodding acquaintance with British history.However, there is a fly in the ointment with this particular release of the program: THE UNBELIEVABLY LOUD AND INTRUSIVE LAUGH TRACK. It is more than loud, for sometimes it overrides the dialog that is supposed to be inspiring you to laugh.I enjoy Britcoms in large part because of the general absence of any indication as to how funny things are; these shows sometimes challenge, but more often are subte and are evidently funny on their own.Does anyone know what UPC I should e looking for to obtain a full version of the series, but without the yucks?

Season four builds on much from season three when it comes to characters, although Blackadder has more power now.Season 1 is something of the best comedy I've ever seen.

The performance goes bluzy in heavy doses, then ends on a high note that encourages you to start all over again, this time sans Prozac. So ignore the detritus that sometimes passes for music today; get this and confirm that music CAN *send you* to the groove 'n elevate that mood...however be warned, cause this ain't no 'elevator music'!In a delayed intro that comes after four vigorous tracks, the man sez;\\"if you're lookin for reality...it aint here!\\"Highly recommended good time stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtly beautiful","review":"The watch is gorgeous as others have said and it comes in a hard box - very impressive.

At about the 5 second mark, it sweeps ahead quickly and then waits another 5ish seconds.

Aside from the more practical implications in understanding the way our minds work, it has some really radical arguments of the sort that would once have been called metaphysical, dealing with the nature of reality. In particular, it sheds light on the objectivist paradigm, showing that this way of treating the natural world is, after all, just one way of looking at things, useful in certain circumstances, but by no means universally valid (whatever that might mean).Not exactly delightful prose, but clear and well organized."},{"rating":"2","title":"metaphors of reality","review":"This is a very interesting book, which explores the role of metaphors in the English language and argues that the majority of communication is done in metaphors.

Which is, in this reviewer's opinion, at least 200 pages TOO LONG.Many of the examples are either extremely strained, or simply inconsequential. Is \\"happiness\\" ALWAYS equated with \\"up\\"? (How about ROTFLMAO?) And even if it were, so what?By the time I got to the end of this thoroughly academic text, my primary thought was simply WHY?Why did the authors bother to write it?Why did the publishers bother to publish it?And why would anyone bother to read it (if they knew in advance what it was like)?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent thesis, clear presentation","review":"This book will change the way you look at language. Often, when we think we are being literal and direct, we are using metaphors. And we don't even know it. After reading this book you will catch yourself in metaphorical folly.

Buford's condescending assumption that people cannot hunger after and pursue the Kingdom of God at an early age is unbelievably obtuse and shallow. I usually don't waste my time on such drivel. I had to read it as part of a group. That some folks teach this as a curriculum for Christ-followers is just weak and sad.Don't buy this one.

Granted, I am what I would consider to be a 'spiritual person', but aside from that, Buford really hit the nail on the head with many of the feelings that I had been experiencing of late.. That is, the entire notion of putting 'significance' ahead of 'success' in life. Isn't that what everyone would want to leave as his/her legacy?I enjoyed the book, and found it to be relevant, interesting, and a fast read.

However, most of us don't have the millions that allow for extended time off to reflect, seek the help of consultants, conduct low cost probes, etc.If you're looking for a nice inspirational story of one man's journey in faith, this is a good read.

Bob's personal examples are powerful. Unfortunately, it seems to come from the perspective of a wealthy white man, including virtually all the examples of other men which he frequently uses to make points. With the multiple quotations of Biblical scripture the bent is somewhat evangelic.If you are not a devout, fundamentalist Christian, you may find it difficult to mine the nuggests of wisdom.If you are not wealthy, you may also struggle with the book. As you may not have the flexibility, Bob seems to think \\"everyone\\" has for the second half of life. Examples from those less fortunate than he would strengthen the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much religion for my taste","review":"I really wanted to like this book - to get something out of it.

His writing style is a pleasure to read, probably to his detriment, as the simplistic style may convey the idea that this book is not well researched.

The plot is original; the killer is a copycat killer who copcats a variety of other serial killers. I am a huge fan of Holly Hunter and she does not disappoint in this movie. Sigourney Weaver manages to portray a woman who is both strong and fragile. Harry Connick Jr., though playing a serial killer, is one of my favorite characters. He makes the most of his role and manages to stand out in the movie.I could have done without the back story of Hunter and her ex- lover/ ex- partner but all in all it's a pretty good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gripping thriller","review":"The story involves two serial killers and the detectives Mary Jane Monahan (Holly Hunter) and Reuben Getz (Dermot Mulroney) who bring them to justice with the help of a forensic psychiatrist, Dr Helen Hudson (Sigourney Weaver). The problem is that before the first killer Daryll Lee Callum is caught, he torments, terrifies and nearly kills Dr Hunter. As a result, Hunter is agoraphobic and, unsurprisingly, a bit neurotic. This makes her an unreliable expert in the eyes of the police captain. Callum is subsequently caught and torments Hunter further from jail, but now another psychopath has entered the picture using methods of previous serial killers for his own MO. The film is very tense, the plot feasible and the acting, especially of Sigourney Weaver, excellent. The film was directed by Jon Amiel and the incidental music composed by Christopher Young."},{"rating":"1","title":"Copycat (keep case packaging)","review":"The meaning of \\"keep case packaging\\" is that there are English subtitles and you cannot get ride of them to watch the movie. What a bummer...and what a waste of time and money. Had I known this I would have never ordered it. It's also unfortunate because I have seen this movie before and it one of my favorite psychological thrillers. Holly Hunter and Sigourney Weaver and other actors are excellent. If you like real thrillers...this movie is fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Copycat","review":"Excellent packaging and quick. Thanx so much and I will use you whenever possible.

Not to mention this movie has some great actors in it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Copycat Kicks","review":"I love this movie. It's creepy and mysterious and suspensfull. If you are into Serial Killer flicks this is a must see and a good addition to your collection. It's an older movie so it was very hard to find. In fact I checked in every store in my city first and no one had it so I was thrilled that I could not only purchase it but New and on DVD, at a reasonable price too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Copycat","review":"For lovers of police drama, this movie is a must see. Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter are superb. Holly Hunters outfits are quite nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Counterfeit \\"Silence of the Lambs\\"","review":"This is an exploitation movie, pure and simple, professionally done. What is being exploited is the public's fear and fascination with psychopathic serial killers. Sigourney Weaver plays a shrink, who is an expert on the species, gone slightly bananas with fear. We have the usual tinkling music to warn us that evil is afoot, the targeted woman alone in her apartment, the investigating cops one step behind, and of course the mad man-or actually mad men: as in \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" there are two of them, one in jail and one out.Why anybody would want to make such a movie is beyond me. Money doesn't really explain it. I think the desire to show others that you can exploit the public better than they can is the motivation.Holly Hunter plays a homicide detective in a pony tail. She's cute."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best suspense films of the 90's","review":"COPYCAT stands on it's own despite being compared to SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. Truly frightening and suspenseful in scenes, the film works beautifully because of the cast (Holly Hunter and Sigourney Weaver) and the excellent script.Sigourney Weaver character was stalked by a serial killer some years before, and as a result, is confined to her home where she lives in understandable fear. The police now consult with her in her capacity as a criminal psychologist to find the identity of a new serial killer. In the process, her world is once again turned upside down in a way which will make you want to jump up and lock your door.CopyCat is a true gem of the suspense thriller genre but overlooked by so many as a 'copycat' of other great films. Trust me, it really does deserve merit for its ability to remain as fresh today as it was upon first release.Deserves a place in your DVD collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to kill","review":"This show has run it's course a long time ago.

So disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Water weight my ass.","review":"This scale has massive problems. On days of 1500-2000 calories with an intake of approximately 70 ounces of water, my weight would vary dramatically throughout the day. I would lose four pounds in a matter of hours, and gain back another three a few mintues later. Oddly enough, it always measured a 5 pound free weight at the correct weight.

Woven into this description is a wonderful tale of romance, wonder, disappointment and frustration experienced by an American's long-term visits to the island.As the author describes in the prologue, most Americans know little, if anything, about Cuba, even it's geographical location. Please read this book and learn more about our neighbor. You will get beyond the news headlines and their attempt to make Cuba a black or white issue and step into Aschkenas' vivid portrait of \\"Life and Love on an Illegal Island.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected more...

A drag masked as a love story and tale of self discovery. One word... boring"},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating book","review":"Our book group read this book recently.

The author presents descriptions of Cuba: collapsing buildings, cockroaches, hunger, the young wishing to flee, her lover's father imprisioned and yet, never once does she ask or wonder why people are so poor and desperate.How the author can be so oblivious to the suffering all around her and its causes (lack of human rights, due process, freedom of the press, freedom to associate, freedom to think) is sad, even pathetic.So you have to wonder how Alfredo, the author's boyfriend, could love her unless he is a necrophiliac. She must be dead from the neck up.In the book, she menations an American who is looking for weed. The American tells her that she acts normally how he acts when he is stoned.

The best solvent gun is made by Snap On ( Bluepoint ). It is more expensive but what's the point of saving money on a product that doesn't work!!

It presents Mark from a different view than you get in the typical adult Sunday School or Wednesday evening class in that it forces you to look upon the story as a whole, not just a series of unrelated stories about Jesus. The historical background is also welcome as it allows one to better understand Mark (whoever he actually was) and his audience.As was mentioned elsewhere, I could see where some fundamentalists/evangelicals might have problems with the book, though for mainline Protestants and Catholics this will be a gem of a book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mark's Story of Jesus","review":"Excellent resource material.

Materials, refugees and trained underground fighters wer transported back and forth at great risk during the early 1940's. This was a little-known effort between these two countries that greatly stressed the people involved. These dangerous and difficult adventures did not mean a great deal in the big scheme of the war until the Norwegian underground played a key part in delaying Germanys efforts to produce atomic weapons.

The only good tracks on the album are Naughty Girl and Baby Boy and Crazy In Love. You can tell that you should not spend your money on an album when the only good tracks are the hit singles.

There is not use spending your money on the [this bad work]."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album was truly over rated.","review":"First, don't get me wrong, because \\"B\\" certainly does have a smooth voice, but the writing was very bubble gum to me. Kelly's CD was by far much better than \\"B's\\", as far as writing skills, or the producer chosen to write for the album. I think the only reason she won those grammy's is because she's \\"hot\\" right now, and being beautiful seems to have it's advantages in the music business.

Songs like \\"Hip Hop Star\\" and \\"That's how you like it\\" are full of rappers making noises in the background. Most of the ballads are great songs if you are looking for the perfect song to fall asleep to. And most of the pop/R &B stuff like \\"Be With you,\\" \\"Me, Myself and I\\" and \\"Yes\\" are somewhat catchy but can't compare to the likes of Mariah Carey or Aaliyah. \\"Dangerously in Love\\" sounds no different than the song of the same title on the Destiny's Child \\"Survivor\\" album.

I was expecting a lot but she just re-hashes the old Destiny Child formula so it sounds like a collection of outtakes from the horrible \\"Survivor\\" CD.Most of the songs are either over wrought ballads or hip hop dance tunes that never catch and just sputter out after about 3 minutes.She also makes the \\"Mariah Mistake\\" of inviting every rapper from the 'hood to \\"guest\\" and then watching them overtake the song and rob it of any flow or melody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Hyped Effort","review":"I hate to say it, but this was a waste of my money. I agree with others that Crazy in Love is about the best song on the album, and just about the only one worth listening to twice.

However, this CD turned out to be yet another disappointment. With \\"Crazy in Love\\" being the only standout track. Her duet with Luther Vandross is decent, but I've heard it before. It's really nothing special. The Missy track \\"Signs\\" isn't worth listening to more than once. The rest of the songs sound like \\"filler\\" type songs. I'm sure many will not agree with my review, but I was highly disappointed. Kelly Rowland's CD was much better than Beyonce's effort. And even Michelle's CD was better.

The sampling of Summer's \\"Love To Love You\\" is well done. That's it. I can only give those kudos to this LP. It is listenable, whatever that means. Perhaps if Knowles would attempt to sing, instead of sounding as if her vocals were being forced through cotton. I simply do not understand the \\"biz\\" on her voice. Now, having said that: a good voice is NOT necessary to create great pop music, but this attempt just falls short. It's not good. I tell you, it's not good. Perhaps another vocalist, then, yes I would love this LP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wack stuff","review":"Hey wassup with this wack weak-voiced CD?

I think her lyrics are so corny and silly and sexually dumb.A lot of the music on the cd sounds like remakes.She has too many people featured on the cd.I personally don't like Baby Boy even though Sean Paul is hot right now! But then again, maybe it's the Video.I don't know what she plans to do when she returns to her group DC because she has change her image completely with the Solo cd.I think she cross over too far with the sexual, Floetry is the only artist in my opinion who can write that way but keep it creative and tasteful. Beyonce call Marsha and Natalie. They can give you pointers on songwriting."},{"rating":"1","title":"No me gusto","review":"Beyonce es una persona muy interesada, la verdad a ella solo le interesa ganar premios, pero no es nadie :( lastima"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated...","review":"It's not her fault pop music has become an industry of looks rather than talent.. .but she's certainly using it to her advantage."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 .5 great songs the rest sucks","review":"crazy in love great song - baby boy grat song - overplayed to death - yes - me myself and I ok song- beyonce? completely overrated - I mean extrmeley overrated - she is a good singer not great...this album has been completely overrated by the critics."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible CD","review":"I love destiny's child and I love beyonce. She is a great talent, but this CD is crap and did not deserve any grammys. I wish they would have waited for her to release good music and awarded her for that instead. And I agree with a lot of you that Damita Jo is much better. Beyonce may be a better vocalist, but I'd rather have better sounding music with sweet vocals and honesty from janet instead of this pop trash I didn't expect from someone like beyonce. And janet is a legend, beyonce could be too if she released the right music. Maybe next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could have been better","review":"Don't get me wrong, i love Beyonce, she is a verry talented actress and singer, but her album is (to me) just ok. it just seems kind of boring (with the exception of crazy in love).

But seriously this album stinks, do not waste your money. The only people that will like it would be little teeny bopper girls.The songs you should download are:1. Crazy in love - if you dont have it already2. Baby boy - if you dont have it already3. Be with you4. Thats how you like it - can get annoying but her verses are good, and the rap just finsihes it off, if you can crop the song from the beginning and end and make it like 2 minutes long, its pretty good.5. Bonnie and Clyde - again if you dont have it already6. Me Myself and I"},{"rating":"1","title":"Image","review":"I think Beyonce is famous for three reasons:1. She was in Destiny's Child.2. Her image.3. She has OKAY songs.Not very good reasons, if you ask me. I doubt she can hold a note like Christina Aguilera or Avril Lavigne, and I really doubt she writes her own lyrics. Reason number 2 is definately the top reason so many people like Beyonce. I'm one of few who isn't into this whole cheesy rap and R&B; music hitting record store shelves. \\"Crazy In Love\\" is a good song, but I wouldn't waste my allowance money on this CD.

The first single was a promise but the album really really disappointed me. Fortunately I didn't buy it, a friend of mine gave it to me and he didn't like it too (I guess he liked only the girl, *lol*). All the songs are slow and soooo boring, they never change. When I put this cd on the player I feel like I wanna skeep EVERYTHING! The only songs I would save are the singles (Crazy in Love which I LOVE, Baby Boy, Nasty Girl) and maybe Hip Hop Star. It's not so good but has got a good \\"hip hoppy\\" rhythm, which I really like. If you don't wanna feel disappointed like me don't buy this album! Of course if u don't love slowtempo r&b songs...if u expect upbeat songs, better to buy Destiny's Child!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Chi Lites Sample","review":"\\"Crazy In Love\\" was sampled from The Chi Lites \\"Are You My Woman?\\" that came out in 1969. Beyonce is one of the few young artists out there who can actually sing. On this album she definetly reveals that she does not have a style of her own that anyone can mimic.Instead of taking a chance of doing something different, Beyonce just goes with the flow. All of the songs sound like the rest of the [stuff] you hear on the radio: cheesy, [weak], and mass produced.... Beyonce- you can do better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a timeless album!","review":"It's a good cd, but it's not great.

I must say that I this disc wasn't what I expected, but it's nice. I really expected her to work with the BIG heads in music like R.Kelly,Missy,Babyface,JD....you get the idea. My favorite song is probably \\"Dangerously In Love.\\" I have the \\"LIVE\\" version of this song.Oh my GOD! Her voice is angelic! I also like \\"Yes,\\" \\"Signs,\\" & \\"Speechless\\" a lot! She is the total package! I didn't think nobody else could touch my soul the way Brandy does, but Ms.Beyonce' has done that. When she goes on tour, make sure you go. She really knows how to \\"Work It Out!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth the money!","review":"I have been a Destiny's Child fan for years, so when Kelly Rowland's \\"Simply Deep\\" came out, I bought it (another EXCELLENT album, highly recommended) and so when Beyonce had this album out, of course I bought it too.Let me just say that Beyonce is SO talented and SO beautiful and that I love her and this album. It's a little too heavy on the ballads, but whatever. \\"Baby Boy\\" the song featuring Sean Paul is really hot, \\"Dangerously in Love\\" is beautiful, \\"That's How You Like It\\", feat. Jay Z, has a good beat, the song she collaborates on with Luther Vandross, I forget the name, is great, \\"Crazy in Love\\" also feat. Jay Z, is really catchy, my favorite song, \\"Naughty Girl\\" and \\"Yes\\" are also some nice tracks and \\"Signs\\" is good but only because Missy Elliot does her thing on it. Overall it's a great album and it's worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"When I first bought and listened to the album..I was kind of disappointed, but it has grown on me and I really appreciate Beyonce's talent. I was a bit surprised with the sensual lyrics, but I guess it shows who she is as an artist away from Destiny's Child. I think that Speechless, Naughty girl, Rock Star, and Be With You are the best! I think her voice sounds so wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'M GLAD I PURCHASED THIS...","review":"Beyonce did her thang on this CD..from beginning to end. I can't stop listening to it. I would like to see her REMAIN a solo artist.. I NEVER purchased a Destiny's Child CD. It wasn't that I didn't like the music--it was catchy w/nice beats and hooks, but I always feared I wouldn't enjoy the rest of the music (too teen boppy like).. But it was different with B's joint.. Once I heard Crazy in Love.. I knew the rest HAD TO CRANK (not to mention she teamed up with the greatest--HOVA. Anything he touches turns to platinum). I'm impressed. If you ain't got it...GET IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.....","review":"This cd was not what I expected. I knew it was going to be different because she didn't want it to be another DC record but this cd was not all that good. Beyonce has a great voice but this cd was all over the place. There are a couple bright spots on the cd but not many. I think she should have not remade the closer I get to you. Please leave that to Donny & Roberta Flack, I was so disappointed in that remake. If you have not purchased this CD yet, Please listen to me and do not. If you really want it for your collection buy it used because its not worth the full retail price. Trust me I was disappointed and wished I didn't buy it. I recommend the Kelly Rowland CD instead of the Beyonce cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre!","review":"Boring, dull, put me to sleep. Only bright spot is the duet with Luther Vandross, \\"The Closer I Get To You.\\" Nothing really grabs the listener's attention, and definitely doesn't have the power to hold it. (ZZZzzzzzz!) Do yourself a favor and just by the single of \\"Crazy in Love\\" because that is the best it gets on this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Debut!","review":"I am thoroughly disappointed by Beyonce's debut album. The songs tend to give me a headache, as she is screaming through them all. Some of the songs have a great beat to them, but there seems to be too much going on i.e. too many sounds and beats mixed together. I would have preferred for her to simplify the songs a bit. I think she has great potential, but this album is not worth the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Average it hurts","review":"If, as some of the people who've written reviews for this CD claim, they're true music aficianados, they wouldn't be gushing all over this CD like it's the second coming. News flash: it's not even the 9000th coming, OK? It's AVERAGE, that's all. She's AVERAGE. And hopefully, someone will take her place as flavor of the month soon. REAL soon. What's real interesting is that the same people drooling over this CD like it was honestly something special will be writing the same kind of reviews for whoever the next big hype is. If you feel you MUST have this record, like someone else said, wait a while and pick it up in the discount bins.... because it's DEFINITELY gonna end up there."},{"rating":"1","title":"dangerously overrated","review":"i can't believe this album got 5 grammys!,she had good choices for singles but this album is so generic.its no different from what ashanti,or aaliyah would have done.i tried to keep a open mind about this album because i don't wan't to becaome a up tight music critic.but theres nothing special about it.....none what so ever.i think shes fine as hell,but i don't think shes fine enough for me to give this album 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dull","review":"Beyonce is super hot and talented but she is basically a singles artist.

I've listened to this all the way through and there are only about three songs that I can say I really like (and one of them is NOT Crazy In Love) I really don't know what Beyonce was thinking here. She was really good with Destiny's Child (refer to The Writing's On The Wall for a good example) What happened?? I skip a lot of songs because their lyrics are too corny to me or I just dislike them.

Please, hardly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Overrated!!","review":"I've listened to this album several times and I can say with complete confidence that only 2 songs are decent: \\"Crazy in Love\\" & \\"Baby Boy,\\" both of which were released as singles. The rest of the album is crap filler and a waste of time! I think I would have had more respect for Beyonce if she had released a 2-track CD rather than a 15-track CD with 13 bad songs! I'm still shocked and somewhat offended that this album won 5 grammy awards when so many other albums are 100 times more deserving! I advise you not to waste your money on this highly mediocre album!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyonce?? No Way!!!","review":"This CD sucks!! Who told her that whining and screaming is singing?

As usual, the only good songs were the ones released as singles (Crazy in Love, Babyboy, Me, Myself and I and Naughty Girl).....the rest are mostly fillers. Big surprise? No, I'm pretty sure the Sony record label had it all planned from the release day.With 10 slow songs......how could anyone stay awake? That is way too much. For a good R&B; CD, try Alicia Keys' \\"Diary\\", Toni Braxton's \\"Secrets\\" or Brandy's \\"Full Moon\\". That's what a good album should sound like."},{"rating":"1","title":"beautiful but not as talented...","review":"Sure! Ms. Knowles is tall, beautiful and sexy but to think of it... there are other singers as well who is much taller, more seductive and effortlessly talented than her. Songs like \\"Crazy In Love\\" and \\"Baby Boy\\" can be easily forgotten as a lot of songs with similar flavors are being thrown away in the bin these days. Knowles has to do something with her songs or do something shocking and different before she is totally forgotten. The album is fairly good for a solo debut, and that is to be respected and be given credit as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Less Than Average","review":"I'll get right to the point: Beyonce's CD has about four good songs, and the rest are filler tracks. \\"Crazy In Love\\", \\"Naughty Girl\\", \\"Baby Boy\\", and \\"Hip Hop Star\\". After the first four songs end, the CD just goes downhill, as it will bore you more than a PBS special about the chemical compounds of rocks. Even her great voice can't save those flat tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerously Deceiving","review":"For the record I am a big fan of Destiny's Child and Beyonce. I loved their last 2 Cd's. I thought the songs were great, most if not all of them written by Beyonce. So i was excited when I heard she was recording a CD. I absolutely LOVED 'Crazy in Love'! I couldn't get it out of my head. So I bought the CD but was very dissapointed. What a let down! The first single is very deceiving. I really didn't like Baby Boy. Me, Myself and I was just decent. There are no other good songs on this album, Im sorry to say. Crazy in Love is good, baby boy and me myself and i are just so so. The rest are just fillers. So if your like me and loved crazy in love, just buy the single."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated, Period.","review":"How did Beyonce win 500 billion Grammys?

The only acceptable songs are the two singles \\"Baby boy\\" and \\"crazy in love\\" and I wasn't even too crazy about those two songs. The Gold-member song always sounded hysterical to me. All other songs are simply boring. Especially strange is the last song about \\"I want a man like my Daddy\\". That really makes one shudder. This album is a no-go for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another lipsynching fool","review":"Beyonce...believe it or not, her name is not half as obnoxious as her image! She never sings live which should give you an idea of what this album is like.

Girl this Cd is Dangerously in need to become a mirror or something useful. I don't mean to hate, but if you listen to this cd you will understand. I was a big Beyonce fan. I really think this album was rushed and had to many guest artist. I seriously think if she were to tape sounds of herself going to the bathroom and try to sell that she would get the same results. The only good song is \\"Crazy in Love\\" backed by JayZ. Sorry Beyonce better run back to Destinys Child. You nor Kelly Rowland are going to make it far by yourselvs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous 2 listen to","review":"Everybody thought this cd would be real good because of the 1st single \\"Crazy in Love\\" with it's famous booty dance but after the booty dance is gone this cd is nothing but a BIG dangerous disappointment. A couple songs on the cd are alright, not very good but it wasn't bad enough that you had to skip them, which i did a lot because the cd is WHACK!! The song with the legendary Luther Vandross is a very good song she actually song real good. I thought this cd was going to be awesome but it wasn't, so don't waste your money buying the cd listen to it first online then if you like it buy it but if you have a musical taste like me you do what you gotta do. I personally think Monica's \\"After the Storm\\" cd was WAY better then Beyonce's cd so if you looking for a good cd this summer Monica is the right one, just look over this poor excuse for a cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just buy the singles","review":"If you heard the excellent singles and thought the album might provide some more, stop. After two stunning tracks 'Crazy in Love' and 'Naughty Girl', the album lurches through some forgettable collaborations and slushy, sentimental ballads. There is little to look forward to when the bits you already know are removed. 'Bonnie and Clyde 03', another single, is welcome partly because it heralds the end and a quick change of pace that helps forget the middle tracks.Perhaps it's naive to expect tracks like 'Crazy in Love' to fill the album, but it quickly steps down a gear and seems to stop trying. I'm glad I own the tracks that persuaded me to buy the album but would probably not buy it in hindsight. No danger of loving the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 good song...","review":"dangerously in love is honestly the only good song on the cd. i was very disappointed. let this be an example to the music industry of why people pirate music. beyonce' has talent, i just hope she shows it in her next cd. download dangerously in love off of ITUNES for .99 and pretend the rest of the cd is one of those AOL disc you get in the mail....stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyonce cd...1 word..GREAT!","review":"I've always been a DC fan..and when i heard beyonce was going to have a solo cd..i had to buy it!

But to say Pink Floyd has no talent, and give Beyonce a 4 star rating is absurd. Beyonce can sing you say. So can a million other people just like her. None of the material is written by her, and you say Floyd was a mass marketing device. Take a look at Beyonce. Hmmmm...This music I have no taste for, and I dont like it, but I will say that her voice is OK, but for the rest of her music, ummmm...NO...and Lets see if Beyonce can stay on the Billboard 200 for 17yrs, thats 17yrs in a row!! Learn about music dude before you make comments, That Music Theroy class has your name on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than I expected","review":"This album really falls very short to me. It lacks depth in the lyrics. Beyonce or her voice just does nothing to stop the album from just coming off as generic R&B; (if even that much). It almost sound like a rushed effort to me. But hey that's what i'd expected from lead singer of DC.Best Songs: \\"Signs\\" & \\"Me, Myself, & I\\"The rest if the songs are all just generic pop based R&B; songs with catchy (uncatchy/annoying) hooks. Its just to repetitive and bland. If you're looking for some really good R&B; try Aaliyah's \\"Aaliyah\\" or even Brandy's \\"Full Moon\\". Both albums are far more innovative and add much more to the genre in all honesty.

Now i think she went and slutted up her appearance as much as possible to sell cds. The photo of her on her solo cd looks like the coverbox of a porno movie. I don't think any of the hits off her new cd are remarkable at all. If the songs Crazy In Love and Baby Boy are supposedly the best songs on the cd then that's not saying much. Once again we have another example of an artist who used to be good as part of a group who went solo and came up with a big disappointment. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"unoriginal as can be","review":"This is not music. Yes, Beyonce has a good voice and has broad range but this CD is nothing more than recycled R&B music that other people have already done, perhaps because at least half the songs are sampled. The lyrics are very basic and childish, and it is overproduced with the same beats as every other song out there. The songs aren't horrible; 'Crazy In Love' is pretty good......and that's about it. The one word I would use to describe this CD is unoriginal."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST ALBUM OF 2003!","review":"I bought this album the day it came out and I can't stop listening to it. It has all types of music and she really can sing. Her voice is so beautiful and so powerful, she's one of the few artists that really can sing live, and I'm sick of people that is saying Ashanti is a good singer and that she can sing. She's an studio artist, I'm sorry but Ashanti CAN'T SING and she's horrible live, like all murder inc artists. I've Beyonc?'s Live At Wembley DVD and I'm amazed how powerful is her voice live. She can sing and dance at the same time, which is soooo hard.About the album: Although it is the best album of 2003, she didn't reach her potential. I was expecting this to be the most energetic album of the year, which is not and I was a little disappointed about that.

She consistently tries to achieve high quality work. Although she demonstrates talent as a performer, a sound image, and mass appeal, since this review is about her cd, it is necessary to review her musical talent. Despite the obvious attention to detail on behalf of this singer, and production staff, I find most of her singing uninspiring and boring. She uses the same old licks and her voice is just not a big deal. Perhaps she has potential to contribute more to her music. Maybe this cd is dull because everyone involved was holding back on the creativity, for fear the commercial appeal might not follow more original music. Modern Hip Hop and r&b was founded on a long and soulful tradition of varried singing styles and voices, inspired orchestration, and overall originality. This cd could have provided a refreshing and welcome addition to the genre. Frankly, it just doesn't deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uuuh.....just pure garbage","review":"I have listened to the whole album just to tell all you people reading this right now. ALL I have to say is this album only have a few good songs which are Baby Boy, Me, Myself, and I and thats basicly it...not Crazy in Love even though alot of people liked it....but I just thought it was not good enough...don't hate me just because I gave this CD a 1 star...it just didn't blow me away...buy it if u want to cause I don't care...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure CRAP !","review":"I bought this CD because I really liked ''Crazy In Love''...God what a mistake !!! There's only like 3 good tracks on this CD : ''Crazy In Love'' ''Bonnie And Clyde'' ''Work It''...the rest is pathetic ! And the hidden track ''Daddy'' oh my God this is so Nasty ! What was she thinking ??? Anyway, I'm really not happy with my purchase, I want my $$$ back ! There's another album comming in 2004...believe me I won't fall in the trap this time, I've learned my lesson...Buy Nelly Furtado or Sarah McLachlan's new CDs...now that's what I call MUSIC !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerously Over-rated","review":"Bought it based on the first cut single- big mistake. rest of albums stinks, trite corny lyrics ala: the signs song, baby boy also corny lyrics, only thing that made it radio-playable is the beat. bottomline:not to buy"},{"rating":"1","title":"love beyonce, hate this album","review":"you're just better off sticking to destiny's child instead of this CD that portrays her as a trashy whore singing medicore songs that would suit j lo's weak vocals instead of the mad talent she has but is hiding with this commercial pop crap she puts out"},{"rating":"1","title":"Primadonna strikes again","review":"I am so sick and tired of that Diana Ross imposter Beyonde Owls. Diana Ross IS the ORIGINAL diva whom paved the way for people like Mariah Carey(I don't care for), Donna Summer(whom is one of the greatest singers and a fellow Bay Stater like me) and this poor excuse of a singer who desperately wants to be like her. Crazy in Love, which features that loser boyfriend of hers Jay-Z is a stupid song. Baby Boy is a duet with Jean Paul Delux and is about the baby son she never had. Me, Myself and I is a rotten song. Plus, she's so horrible and with each disc(be this or any Beyonde and Destiny's Child disc(she is basically running that band with her egomaniacal tirades by kicking members out), she continues to make a mockery of music. I really hate this album. I think you should get The Darkness, they are the next great rock band!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THAT ASHANTI WANNABE!!!!!!","review":"Beyonce can sing but I think that she should've made a better cd..Her Arrangements are horrible I bet she just made that cd in minutes putting anything together take my advice if u wanna buy a cd buy Ashanti Chapter 2 now her cd holds it down for both fellas and da ladies"},{"rating":"1","title":"Miss All That...Is Truly Not..","review":"Even with Ashanti's not so tuned voice, it would be more worth while to buy her cd than to buy this Crap that Beyonce won a million awards for. (So Unfair to the singers who are actually Saying something with their music.) She seems to have no inspiration and is going along with the low of the degrading industry. She is merely another puppet of the industry and her talent shown more through Destiny's Child! That's Real! No Gimmicks! Peace. One."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of talent","review":"Beyonce is obviously talented. She has written and produced Destiny's Child's greatest hits and when the group had problems and was about to disappear, Beyonce kept it together. Of course she's hated: she's strong, beautiful, powerful and extremely TALENTED, with an amazing voice. But this album is just a confused mess, there are a few good tracks but they're not enough to make it a real good album.....it's very disappointing, she has the talent to make great music but I can't hear any talent on this album....I still love her though and hope she'll come back stronger than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Don't underestimate Beyonce ya'll. She's not just another Ashanti. She can sing and this CD proves it. Her earlier work that she did with Destiny's Child really prepared her to be able to tackle R&B and so far she has just done that. I wish Beyonce the best of luck. Forget the hata'z. Standout tracks include:Naughty GirlMe, Myself & ICrazy in LoveSignsPick this CD up now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Job Well Done","review":"I bought this album wondering if it was going to be another pop, giddish album, similar to some of the albums recorded by Destiny's Child; boy was I wrong. I am an R&B fan right down to the heart of me and I truly loved this album. Beyonce deals with mature situations on this album and returns to her roots with some of the older sounding songs such as \\"Be With You\\". My all time favorite song on this record is \\"Me, Myself & I\\" because it relates so well to just about anyone's life. It is truly a timeless song. Overall, I would say get the album, but listen to it with an open-mind because if you are expecting to hear Destiny's Child shining through you won't, and that's not such a bad thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"His CD is the bombs","review":"This cd is so cool i like all the songs more i like the song Daddy and Crazy in love, naughty girl, and baby boy and the others too.It is so beautiful this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy In Love With This Album!!!","review":"Beyonce Has done it again but, this time she did it on her own with out the help of her fellow friends Kelly & Michelle! This C.D. Is a must have for any True Beyonce Or Destinys Child fan!This Album has some club type Party music & If you want some jams for your party I suggest you pop this C.D. in your player! Plus The album has a booklet with tons of sexy & amazing pictures! This album has appearances from Sean Paul,Big Boi,Sleepy Brown,Luther Vandross,Missy Elliot & don't forget the most important of all Jay-Z! Plus the other great thing is she writes most of the songs on the album instead of copying or taking credit for others music! If you love Destinys Child You should enjoy Beyonce's Dangerously In Love C.D.!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dangerously In Love","review":"Is one of the best albums of 03 Beyonce did her thing and I'm extremely happy to see that so many people have supported her I look up to Beyonce cause she has came a long way and she's a very strong young lady LLLLLOOOOOVVVVVEEEEEEEE Bee forever"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 5 good songs out of 15","review":"I expected a lot out of this CD but there's not much to it and is kind of boring. The good tracks are:1. Crazy In Love (featuring Jay-Z)... you all know this one, it's great. In danger of becoming overplayed, but it's great.2. Naughty Girl... I like the beat a lot and it's a cool song.3. Baby Boy (featuring Sean Paul)... probably the next single. A Middle-Eastern type of beat.4. Hip Hop Star (featuring Big Boi and Sleepy Brown)... A lot of people on here don't like this song but I love it! The chorus is the best part.11. The Closer I Get To You (featuring Luther Vandross)... I absolutely LOVE this song! It is so beautiful! Excellent job by both!So, if I were you, I'd just burn these 5 songs off the Internet or someone else's CD, because they're the only songs you'll need to hear, because the others aren't necessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyonc'e's first solo effort.","review":"This album did exceed my expectations.I was at first dissapointed at all the remakes and the Luther Vandross duet was out of place.But the part that I really disliked was the hidden track at the end stating \\" I want my husband to be like my daddy.\\" That was the corniest thing I had ever heard. Other than that the album was well worth the wait. The song with Sean Paul is flawless and also the Hip Hop Star song. I thinkBeyonce' is so very talented and even though her CD isn't the best I've heard, Ashanti will have to work hard to top it! Congratulations Bee!"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY disappointed....","review":"I am just gonna make this review short and not very sweet unfortunately....The CD is a waste of money unless you feel like buying a album with one good song on it which is the first single \\"Crazy in Love\\"...Honestly the rest of the CD is a joke. NONE of the songs are like or as good as \\"Crazy in Love\\"I mean Beyonce has a powerful voice and all but the songs are just really bad..not too many catchy tunes and not really worth it..Nice try Beyonce!I reccommend Monica's \\"After the Storm\\" Album or the Not yet released Mya's \\"MoodRing\\" Album."},{"rating":"1","title":"all the glitz&Hype can't hide average Material","review":"for all the Hype&whatnot that comes with Beyonce the bottom line is that She just doesn't cut it as a legit Solo Artist.She has the Diana Ross Persona but the Mary Wilson Material&that doesn't equal a Legit Solo Career.Catchy Stuff&She Sings alright but She isn't close to where She must go to Being what the Hype will lead you to believe.She needs to take a cue from Her Group Mate Kelly Rowland: drop a Real Catchy first song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Service!","review":"My service was wonderful.

The only song, well, I'll say two, that are good are crazy in love and baby boy, but even those aren't THAT great. She has an okay voice, I actually think Kelly Rowes sings better than her. Anyhow, this girl is too overated AND this album. Christina Aguilera can top her any day, songs and voice. I recommend Stripped to this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This CD is way too sexual for my taste. I am disappointed that Beyonce sold out to the sexual trash that pervades the music industry these days. I will be selling this mess back to the record store this weekend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed with this purchase.","review":"With all of the guest appearances on this cd you would think that Beyonce's first solo attempt would be wonderful. Unfortunately it isn't the songs have no direction and only one song actually grabs your attention.(Crazy In Love) Beyonce's duet with Luther Vandross is laughable at best and is another attempt to label Beyonce as a credible artist when she is far from it. Save your money buy Monica's cd instead or better yet wait for Alicia Keys' new cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad...","review":"Stale songs, bad beats, uninspired lyrics, and just an overall boring feeling. I used to like pop, until I discovered rock. Hearing instruments and lyrics that aren't always about love gives you alot more to appreciate than hearing somebody with a crooning voice singing love songs overtop of synthesizers and processed beats. I gotta admit, some songs are a little infectious though, Crazy In Love is good, Naughty Girl and Baby Boy are mediocre, but besides that this is pretty damn bad. For good pop musicians who write every song, play their instruments and cover many lyrical topics try: Maroon 5, Outkast, Good Charlotte or Blink-182."},{"rating":"1","title":"She could've added at least one more upbeat song...","review":"First of all the songs \\"Crazy in Love\\" and \\"Baby Boy\\" are tricks. They are tricks to make you think that the rest of the album will be upbeat and danceable. WRONG! Those two songs are the only two that even come close to being good, with the possible exception of \\"Naughty Girl\\". \\"Hip-hop Star\\" and \\"That's how you like it\\" are full of rappers making nonsensical noises in the background. \\"Signs\\", \\"Speechless\\" and \\"The closer I get to you\\" are perfect songs if you are looking for the perfect lullaby. \\"Be with you\\", \\"Me, Myself and i\\" and \\"Yes\\" have immature and bland lyrics(i.e., I love the way you make me feel/it slows down time/come in my bedroom and turn off the lights.) And even the two hit singles are not that great. God have mercy on your soul, Beyonce."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyonce - A Solo Star","review":"Minutes after buying this cd, I took it home and listened to the entire cd, and ket me just say that Beyonce should strongly follow up this cd. The single \\"Crazy In Love\\" gives you a close look and her personal life. \\"Baby Boy\\" shows her sexual side. I also think that the single \\"Me, Myself and I\\" showed a more softer side to her. For the money, this cd is totally worth it. I hope that after Destiny's Child releases and tours for their upcoming cd, that Beyonce release a new solo cd. Trust me, I will buy it, if it anything like the first."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Concerned Fan of Music","review":"I am so very sick of Beyonce at this point because they killed all her songs.Her first single \\"Crazy In Love \\" wasn't really that good anyway.Jay-z made it better.And when she dance her dress is shaking for her.All her other singles was good.But I really got tried of her performing everywhere especially the same songs.And I really don't know why she win about 2 awards at every show she attend.I believe she is not the only gifted female snger.They should give awards to some new people."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've definetly heard better songs !!","review":"I guess the CD is ok. I think that Miss Knowles receives way too much credit, definetly more than she deserves. Only the first three songs are good, the rest sucks. Oh yeah, and the hidden track about how much she loves her father and how she wants her husband and son to be like him is the WORST song I have ever heard. It's pathetic and sort of disgusting/disturbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half & Half, Upbeat! and Boring!","review":"Wow! if there is any way that I can describe this album to you is, the first 5 tracks are good!, the rest it's just boring!, and what about the title song! the same track from her Survivor album? without the background vocals? not a smart move!. Crazy In LOve, Baby Boy are the best tracks!, Naughty Girl it's ok!, the rest of the album is sooooooo booooooooring......but the leading single(Crazy...) makes its worth it to buy it. \\"Hip Hop Star\\" it's nice, \\"Be With You\\" it's the last song that you can handle!, \\"Me Myself and I\\", yuk!, \\"Yes\\" whassup with this?, \\"Signs\\", I'm sure Missy hates her, she produce the worst song ever, The rest it's not worth it mention it, the song are just boooooooring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give it up!","review":"Save your money. Trust me, why settle for these really bad remixes she attempted to make when you can buy Mariah Carey's \\"Remixes\\". She knows how to do it. Just face it Beyonce, Mariah's \\"Heartbreaker\\" with Jay-Z is better than your \\"Crazy in Love\\" with Jay-Z. Mariah's duet with Luther \\"Endless Love\\" is better than yours with Luther. Please get original or give up."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING...","review":"Ok, since when I saw for the first time \\"Crazy In Love\\" in Tv I wanted to buy this album as earlier as possible, but some friends told me that the album sucked, but after Baby Boy and Me,Myself & I were released I just bought it no matter what my friends say.

IT WAS TOTALLY CRAP!!!!don't but this cd, buy the singles!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bore-yonce","review":"Who told this woman that whispering and moaning is singing?

She's got style and she's got grace, I'd elect her miss United States! Beyonce does a really good job on this Cd, if you don't have it, i would recommend for you to buy it. My personal favorites on this Album of hers are:(2) Naughty Girl, (3) Baby Boy, and (6) Me, Myself, and I. Ofcourse there are many more that i enjoy, but those are that main ones.I hope my review has been helpful to you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HOT HOT HOT","review":"BETTER THAN ANY DESTINY CHILD ALBUM...I STARTED TO NOT LIKE DESTINY CHILD AFTER THE ORIGINAL BREAKUP.

I CAN NO LONGER BE A HATER. I LOVE THE BEGINNING TO THE VERY END OF THIS ALBUM. I THOUGHT THE VIBE WAS GREAT. MY FAVORITE IS HIP HOP STAR JUST BECAUSE IT HAS A FUNKY EDGE TO IT. THIS WAS SO MUCH BETTER THAN MONICA'S CD WHICH IS JUST AWFUL. BEYONCE IS MATURING IN EVERY WAY. I LOVE HER SPEED AND ENERGY.

The listener is left wondering if she really can sing because she is SO not exploiting her vocal range (if indeed, she has one). Nonetheless, she will no doubt do well with this album because with Sean Paul, Jay Z and Luther who wouldn't. On a lighter note, the first track is very catchy and will be an instant success for her. For what it's worth Beyonce - well done !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Did I Buy This Cd?","review":"Oh ya cuz of Crazy In Love? Beyonce is very talented I think this cd was a misstep though. After huge success being the frontwoman of Destiny's Child all 3 decided to do solo albums. Beyonce writes her songs, acts, sings and is very beautiful but I find her album to be dull and one dimensional.I bought this album after hearing Crazy In Love which is one of the top songs of the summer and has an awesome beat. After listening I found several good songs but Beyonce doesnt sing sometimes she sorta forcefully whines or something in songs like Naughty Girl. Then she has another song with Jay-z which is too much. Songs like Signs I found myself very bored listening to. There are other highlights like Baby Boy the second single with Sean Paul which is a great club banger.Beyonce you may want to rethink your next solo album and I suggest you pick up Kelly Rowland's Simply Deep which features Stole which is a classic! Or for this summer try Ashant, Monica and even Blu Cantrell"},{"rating":"1","title":"it's not beyonce's destiny to sing so low","review":"This c.d. was so dissapointing. I am a big fan of Destiny's child, and bought Kelly Rowland's cd and Michelle's and loved them, but this c.d. was so bad. Crazy in Love sounds like the only decent song to listen to. I tried listening to this cd 3 times, but i can not stand it anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dosent deserve the hype","review":"I bought this CD because I couldnt get enough of \\"Crazy in Love.\\" When \\"Crazy in Love\\" is playing you feel like you could be in for something. After the player moved past Crazy in Love, it was downhill all the way. Songs like Naughty girl, Baby Boy, and Signs have cheesy beats, whil the rest of the album sounds like she slumped together some lame ballads for the sake of making the album long enough. The songwriting is horrible((...), and her singing is only so-so. Get a Destinys Child album for good beyonce material."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best","review":"I don't even know how to describe it. Just not really great. Kind of wish I hadn't spent the money on it. Sorry Beyonce, I love you, but this just didn't do it for me. Mediocre that is a good way to describe it. I just have to turn it off after a while because it bores me. I never have done that with a DC disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best","review":"I don't even know how to describe it.

All of the songs sound the same, and it sounds like Beyonce's screaming/wailing throughout the album. The only song that's worth mentioning is \\"The Closer I Get to You\\" with Luther Vandross. Don't get me wrong, Beyonce has a good voice, but doing the solo album bit is not for her. Her music sounded a WHOLE lot better when she was with D.C. The only reason why she's sold so many albums so far is because of all of the marketing/promoting that they're doing for it. In a month or two, all of the \\"hype\\" should be over, and her CD will probably end up in a discount bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Let Down","review":"I always thought of Beyonce as a talentless, doe eyed tool with a knack for riding the trends to death but then I saw her sing the national anthem during the infamous Super Bowl, a.k.a \\"the Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake\\" show. Seeing her rendition gave me a brand new respect for Beyonce Knowles and all the hard work and training she puts into her voice.Bolstered by my newfound respect for her as an artist I bought this CD hoping to find some hidden gem. Here was an opportunity to reveal herself as a force to be reckoned with musically and vocally and she missed it. Just more of the same trend pandering. It's really not her fault though. I blame the spin doctors and music producers that market her career and belittle her talent.For people who like Beyonce exactly like they like her then this CD will be a great addition to your collection. But if you are looking for another side of Beyonce other than a gyrating female cliche in every rap video ever made, save your dough."},{"rating":"1","title":"get this barbie doll outa here","review":"beyonce you can not sing. this best song on here was crazy in love and baby boy. all the rest is just plain stupid. if you think about buying this cd please dont. she is all made up with no talent. i don't like jz eaither. stay away from this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Below five star reviewer is a nut case","review":"Please ignore the rantings of the previous crazy five star reviewer who needs to be reported for being inappropriate for using vile and hateful language against other reviewers.Beyonce is awful and is not recommended to people who like good music.Get any Led Zeppelin album instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So For The H0","review":"This album is not too bad but it's nothing to run through the store and knock people out the way to get. Beyonce is a decent singer but she's still need some work here and there. The album is better then then their latest DC album which is probably they're worse album. All in all this album is listenable but it does have it's moments were you have to skip here and their like everything. So if you are a fan of R&B dont buy this but if you are a fan of DC or Beyonce then get it. When you are a fan most likely your artist cant do no wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple...Amazing.","review":"... Being a huge fan of Destiny's Child, and Kelly & Michelle's solo albums. I bought it! I had downloaded a few songs, and was extremely impressed. But, WOW! This CD is filled with 15 (one hidden track, \\"Daddy\\") incredible songs that range from flat out pop (\\"That's How You Like It\\" featuring Jay-Z) to sultry and sexy R&B/Soul (\\"Signs\\" featuring Missy Elliott, \\"Speechless,\\" and the ultra irresistable \\"The Closer I Get To You\\" featuring Luther Vandross.) This album is purely a work of art. ... If you're still undecided after readin multiple reviews, .... I might get in trouble for saying that, but oh well. It really is an amazing album and I highly suggest you buy it. BYE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow, yet sensational","review":"Beyonce's album proves her talent and ability to write amazing music. When I purchased the album I was expecting a lot of club hits, however, most of the album is slow jams- which is a suprise. Although, slow, the songs are intricate and are great to \\"chill\\" to. I definitly recommend it to anyone who likes artists such as Kelly Price, Floetry or Whitney. There are a number of Jazzy/blusey tunes. Great solo Beyonce!"},{"rating":"2","title":"phenomenal","review":"Beyonce is a beautiful and talented woman.

I was hoping to learn more about her as an artist but I was left hanging. Well I guess she has to be nasty to compete. I was expecting her to give more vocally and more creatively. I wasn't impressed and to use a song off of the survivor cd was just plain tacky, she should have saved that song for CD in the first place. The Daddy song was sweet though!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's the rest?","review":"If the record industry want to know why sales are dropping, no further evidence is needed than this album.For weeks or months now, radio stations have been playing Beyonce's version of the 50 Cent track In Da Club. Yet out comes her album, and no sign of the track.The UK version of this album is more generous. It includes Work It Out, her track from the Austin Powers in Goldmember movie, and her '03 Bonnie & Clyde track with Jay-Z.You just know that in 3 months they'll try to sell us the same album again with these three additional tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"fell short","review":"by the looks of the first single i thought this was a sure hit, but it fell a little short. the only hot singles are the ones with jay-z. sean paul collabo, missy and big boi were half assed! the signs tracks were cheesy. tracks me myself and i was cool. doesn't matter cuz it'll still be the heavy hitter this week, but i would download it rather than pick it up if i were you, but pick up that monica!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rediculous","review":"When I received this cd in the mail I was so excited to listen and hear the songs I missed hearing for the last few years since my cd was misplaced.

I was completely scammed by the seller and cannot listen to the cd at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dangerously Perfect!","review":"Dangerously In Love is a perfect solo album debut by Beyonce. Crazy in Love is a totally enjoyable introduction. Beyonce and Jay Z compliment each other perfectly. Naughty Girl with it's belly dancer rhythms is a total delight. Baby Boy with it's reggae theme is such a delight. This album is like eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich,it is good to the last bite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.","review":"\\"Crazy In Love\\", \\"Naughty Girl\\", and \\"Baby Boy\\" were good songs until they were played to death. That leaves one more track that made this album almost worthwhile and that's \\"Hip Hop Star.\\" After track four the rest of the album falls to pieces with slow, uneventful ballads and lame qausi-up-tempo tracks litter this waste of time.If you like Beyonce, then grab the \\"Austin Powers: Goldmember\\" album for two great tracks. Otherwise, stick to Destiny's Child and pretend Beyonce's [father's] ego didn't lead her down the path of lame music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Live Up To The Hype","review":"Beyonce is very beautiful and talented, so it pains me to have to write a negative review of her CD. I wanted to give an objective review, so I listened repeatedly and drew the same conclusion each time. I found the music uninspiring and just plain dull. The lyrics were typical fluff and lacking in creativity and substance. Her singing was just ok for me but a tad bit dull and annoying after repeated listens. While I did find three songs to my liking, I rather generously give this CD 2 stars. I am really excited for Beyonce for doing her thing but was unimpressed with her first solo effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love The CD But it's a little MEDIOCRE","review":"Beyonce has extemely beautiful voice but she does too many collaborations. I would have liked it if she used some rock, pop, soul, and alternative influences in her music. What is this I Hear about her making out with Hayden Christensen? Here is how I rate her songs.1. Crazy In Love - 9/10Her Voice is Great on this record.2. Naughty Girl - 8/10Could have been better.3. Baby Boy - 9/10It seems as if this more a Sean Paul song than hers.4. Hip Hop Star - 2/10I really don't like this song.5. Be With You - 10/10This song is on fire.6. Me Myself and I - 5/10Mediocre.7. Yes 9/10I lOVE THIS SONG!8. Signs - 8/10I love The way she put all the zodiac signs together, but the hook is not good.9. Speechless - 20/10YO, THIS SONG IS THE BEST ON THE CD. THIS COULD OF BEEN A SINGLE.10. That's how you like it - 6/10Alright.11. The Closer I Get To YOU - 8/10Good collaboration.12. Dangerously In Love - 10/10Good Song.13 through 15 is just wack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dangerously In Love","review":"I remember this album when I was 16. This album is very diverse and the music is groovy and soulful. The musical influences from hip-hop to rock to jazz. The album is equally divided between seductive mid-tempos,lush ballads and fiery club bangers, providing a sharp focus on who Beyonce is right now as a performer,woman and as a creative force. This album is the sound of a grown woman clearly staking her claim in the world and redefining expectations of who she is. The vibe is more mature,more playful,more deeply passionate and sexually aggressive. This album has been certified 4x Platinum. Remember,this was 2003-2004."},{"rating":"2","title":"She left me Speachless","review":"I gotta say that for the longest time i would not listen to this CD because im not a big Destiny's Child fan, much less Beyonce on her own. It was the sounds of Speachless one night while i was listening to the radio that got me to listen to the song. It reminded me of one of the ol' skool funk songs that i AM a fan of, like \\"I'd Rather Be With You\\" by Bootsy Collins in wich i found that she sampled for another song of hers \\"Be With You\\". It wasn't too bad I must admitt to that too. The slow songs on the CD is really what kept me on it honestly. At the same time tho, the fast tracks do have enuff energy to keep your head and body in motion. So i gotta say girl done did it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangeroulsy Boring","review":"I sadly got this for as a gift. I was excited becasue I liked \\"Crazy In Love\\" but then I grew sad after listening to it again and again. I tried to like it but it's so awful. It's filled with boring deutes, too many samples, and annoying songs. Pop music has really gone down hill. If you want REAL R&B I suggest you pick up Ashanti's \\"Chapter II\\" or Monica's \\"After The Strom\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disaster","review":"Not as good as expected. Her voice lacks strong emotions and the songs don't really go along with her voice!!! The only good songs are Naughty Girl (which showcases good music production and TERRIBLE plus \\"don't give a damn attitude\\" vocals), Me Myself And I, Baby Boy, The Closer I Get To You, Dangerously In Love 2 and Daddy. Her lyrics are not deep enough. Tracks like Speechless, Be With You, Yes, Signs and That's How You Like It really [stinks]! Ashanti's album definitely kicks this album's [booty]!!!!!!!!!! At least she writes good lyrics and blends strong emotions in her album. Maybe next time, Beyonce. Go back to Destiny's Child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not so in love with the album","review":"Yeah Beyonce's on her own. Wow never saw that coming. SIKE!I really think beyonce's a diva but my sister had the album and i listened to it. Here is the breakdown:1) Crazy in love- 1st single catchy beat good2)naughty girl-ok3)Baby boy- hot joint!4)hip hop star- stupid!5)be with you- nice song catchy ballad love it!6)me myself & I- nice joint7)Yes- ok not really good or bad8)signs- love it! by the way i'm a gemini9)speechless- bad10)that's how you like it- stupid song w/ BF Jay Z11)The closer i get to you- nice love song w/ luther vandross12)dangerously in love 2- don't be fooled same recorderded as #113)Beyonce Interlude-...(SKIP IT)14)Gift from virgo- um dumb song15) BONUS TRACK!- DADDY- talks about daddy & what hes done 4 her but the only thing i don't get it when she says \\"i want my husband to be like my daddy\\" Please Jay z definetly ain't Matthew Knowles. I could do without this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWWWWNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I hate spending hard earned cash on crap. I don't get all the hoopla over this cd (you know, winning awards and all). It is unoriginal and quite frankly, not very entertaining. I think Beyonce, the person is big, but the music is lacking. It sounds like everything else out there in this genre (Mya, Ashanti, etc., etc.). Do yourself a big favour, ignore this and go to the Aretha Franklin section in your record store, now that is something sweet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre album from an exceptional singer","review":"I bought this album thinking it would be tight: \\"it's Beyonce so they're gonna give her nothin but hits for her album...\\" how wrong I was. Crazy in love was hot, Baby Boy was hot, Hip hop star was a hot mess, Be With You was hot, The Closer I Get to You was a dissapointment, Yes, Me Myself and I, and just about every other song on the album I didn't mention (espescially The Closer I get to You) were flat out boring and that daddy song just made me uncomfortable, why was that on there??? I loved Dangerously in Love on Survivor and was excited to see what she would do differently with it on this album... the b*tch didn't even resing the vocals!!! She just put different production behind it and called it a day, but whatever. Anyways I'm kinda sorry I spent my 8 dollars on that album instead of just downloading the few songs I liked on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired","review":"The fact that this won 5 Grammys speaks on the state of music, the joke that the Grammys have become, and what stylish packaging can do. Her voice is better than the likes of Britney Spears yet I found Britney's album to be more entertaining minus the even more limited vocals-- this coming from an R&B fan. Like Ashanti, her song-writing ability is elementary. The difference is, with acts like Ashanti you are not set up to expect much. It is what it is, like it or leave it. Beyonce, on the other hand, has been branded a 'diva' as if she is a standard for the new crop of singers. Sporting high heels and weave doesn't make a diva. This album is garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"True Diva\\" Beyonce","review":"Like T. Turner, Cher, C. Lauper and S. Nicks, Beyonce has an incredible vocal gift. She is a real Diva, who knows how to use her voice in a most sensuous way. She is blessed with a great vocal range, and excels on almost every cut throughout this award winning CD. The younger teen pop sensations of today need a lesson from her and her other talented contemporaries, in showing what makes a \\"True Diva.\\" She is a perfect example of one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only the first 2 single's she released are good other then..","review":"...That the album is realy realy bad!I feel like it's not worth it to buy it dosent have quality in the songs they sound realy realy bad!I hope you guy's believe me because this is my honest truth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great start to a long career","review":"I was definitely not disappointed with Beyonce's first solo effort. Each track is beautifully sung with energy and passion. Stand out tracks are Crazy in Love, Signs, Naughty girl, Me Myself and I and Baby Boy. The only song that I could have done without was Speechless, but all the rest are great! She brings something fresh and innovative to the music scene, which was much needed.I think that her next effort will iron out the tiny and sporadic problems with this album and will be a far superior effort..cant wait!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerously Dissappointing","review":"Her single \\"Crazy in Love\\" is really fantastic, I love that track, \\"Naughty Girl\\" is a great song too. The rest of the CD. Crap, I wish it had more songs like those 2 singles. Painful to listen to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmmm","review":"Ok, this album was pretty awful. (before you freak out, I'm not Lewis Tatem, he's my dad, and I wrote the review of the DEJ7855 sony cd walkman, and the one about the animatrix dvd, and By the Way by the red hot chili peppers) In fact this album verges on horrible. But the track \\"crazy in love\\" is well worth the disc. All the other songs, excpt. \\"baby boy\\" suck. This disc is good if you are a 14 year old amuter DJ, for junior girl scout meetings (me). Otherwise, just buy the \\"crazy in love\\" and \\"baby boy\\" singles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"save your money for a real cd like: Artist: Big Tymers Album: Big Money Heavyweights Realease: November 18, 2003"},{"rating":"1","title":"Miss wanna be the center of attention","review":"She was okay when they first started out, now she got the big head and thinks she better than everybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look at me!

The best songs are the first three: \\"Crazy in Love,\\" \\"Naughty Girl\\" and \\"Baby Boy.\\" \\"Hip-Hop Star\\" is energetic, but Beyonce dosen't really sing, it just whispers. The album gets temporarily back on track with \\"Be With You.\\" \\"Me, Myself and I\\" and \\"Yes\\" are somewhat catchy but are filled with a variety of annoying dighital sounds. The rest of the album, except for \\"Dangerously in Love 2\\" is way too underproduced, and provides the perfect soundtrack for drifting off to sleep. The soloution: Beyonce, try to just let it flow, and have dighital sonds take precedence over your singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"She could've added at least one more upbeat song...","review":"If you hear \\"Crazy in Love\\" or \\"Baby Boy\\" on the radio and think that's what the rest of the album will sound like, sorry. Those songs are tricks to make you think the rest of the album will be upbeat and danceable, and they are the only two good ones. Songs like \\"Signs\\", \\"Speechless\\" and \\"The Closer I get to You\\" put you to sleep, \\"That's how you like it\\" and \\"Hip-hop star\\" are full of rappers making nonsensical noises in the background and \\"Be With You\\", \\"Me, Myself and I\\" and \\"Yes\\" are full of annoying dighital sounds and beats. And even \\"Crazy in Love\\" and \\"BabY boy\\" are really not all THAT great. If you value music at all, do not buy this TRASH. Buy Aaliyah or a DC cd for good Beyonce material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerously cheesy","review":"Her album sucks. The ballads are long and boring. With the exception of \\"Crazy In Love\\" and \\"Baby Boy\\" the fast songs sucks, or are good and then just get boring. There are only four good songs on this CD. If you are going by the singles, save your money. The only thing good, is that I borrowed the album from my cousin, so I didn't waste my money. And too many of the songs sound alike.. it's just a boring, repetitive, put-you-to-sleep kind of album. It could be a lullaby, it's so boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I'm a huge fan of Destiny's Child, so of course I was first in line to get Beyonce's solo CD. And while it is definitely not like a DC album, it's still the best solo female CD to come out since Alicia Keys' Songs in A Minor. My favorite songs are Crazy in Love, Hip Hop Star, Be With You and That's How You Like It. The songs that I'm not really crazy about (yet) are Daddy, Yes, and Signs, which is kind of a pointless song because it's just about the astrological signs. Anyway, this is a good CD, definitely worth the money. It'll hold you over until the next DC album."},{"rating":"1","title":"it was alrite, expected better:","review":"I wasnt really wasnt feeling this one. Theres only like 3 good songs on here. Crazy in love is the best one. Second one is thats how u like it with JayZ and yes.

Other than that, B is nothing but an overrated, unoriginal woman who's trying to copy the likes of Tina(a great music icon) Janet, Mariah, Mary and so on. Her songwriting skills are dumb as hell and ppl appraise it like she originated it. THere are way more talented ppl out there who deserve more attention. B is nothing more than a puppet who happens to be dating Jay-Z. If you want to listen to someone with great talent, go for Heather Headley, Erykah Badu, Lalah Hathaway, India Aire, Me'shell Ndegeocello(she even plays her own instruments). So stop following this puppet and soon she'll realize that she's nothing but a poor imitator."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dangerously In Love More Like Dangerous In Skills","review":"Beyonce Giselle Knowles, showcased her writing skills, her vocals, parts that she has not shown the world. This CD is worth 10 stars. It is on the same level as Aaliyah's Aaliyah CD. Her collaborations are perfect. Missy Elliot did a good song, Signs. And the Luther duet, Closer I Get To You, was sung much better by these two than Donnie And Roberta. Her ballads, and her uptempo songs balance out with giving u enough of both. Speechless, to me that is the best song on the album, its sexy and it is just the .... All in All, this is a CD for 03 & 04. U did ur thang Beyonce. Im so happy 4 u. U representin Texas. Bee~"},{"rating":"1","title":"beyonce????","review":"her cd cover looks like christina aguilera's, her voice is ok, her talent is ok, she is an ok artist. sorry it is an honest review."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this cd","review":"Although some may think that this cd is bad. I think that this is a good cd. It took me a while to get used to it, but after a while it grew on me. It has a lot of good songs such as Baby Boy, and Crazy in Love, which was my fav song of 2003. I think that Beyonce is a great singer,with good talent. Even though I think that if she comes out with a second cd, maybe it could be better then her recent group effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyonce's a Good Singer...","review":"... With A LOT of talent- and I wasn't disapointed when I got this album.Although all of these songs were very nice- I have to admit I liked the songs in the beginning, more than the songs in the end. They got my attention more, and they were songs I could listen to all the time. But the songs in the end were more slow, and much more serious- and I guess I kinda lost interest.But, none-the-less, this was a very good debut album for Beyonce to come out with, and I applaud her for doing soooo well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hip Hop Star","review":"This is a very good solo debut album. Thats what I thought until I came to \\"Hip Hop Star\\". That one partictular song just ruins the album. It sounds like shes moaning, and the first thing I think of when I hear moaning is sex and Im pretty sure thats also what most guys think of too. Im a girl and I dont want to be thinking of sex just because of the way a song s being sung."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerously In Love=DANGER!!","review":"i bought this CD thinking that it would be amazing and mind blowing and when i put in my CD player...i wanted to throw this CD away...i really like Beyonce but going solo isn't exactly her destiny...my favorite song(s) were Crazy In Love, Dangerously In Love 2, and The Way I Like It.....sorry B"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BELIEVE A WORD!!!","review":"From these obvious fanatics of Beyonce. I was expected a lot from her solo project but it is so boring, some of the songs will literally put you to sleep! Nothing on the album deserves a 10, at best it deserves a C+. If you like buying average to poor music that you can hear on every radio station across the country get this one. Otherwise, you should pass this one up. It sounds rushed, the lyrics are very childish, and the ONLY reason why this album is getting any attention at all is because it's from the Destiny's Child front woman.It's really not worth the buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"She is HOT, but she stinks!","review":"Beyonce is really hot. That does not mean that she is a good musician. She is horrible. The only thing she can do good is \\"Shake her stuff\\". If I were any of you people I would not buy this cd or even think about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's got the Midas Touch","review":"THis album shows that Beyonce is here to stay!! THe girl is an incredible writer, singer, and performer,unlike Ashanti. This album is extremely soulful. Her voice is like none other of the female artists today. She is in a class all by herself!! Her ballads are beautiful!! This is definitely an all-purpose album."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!!!!!! Hot!","review":"this album is happening. it is awesome. i feel that every track could be a hit. i think she put a 110% into her album. and it payed off. i definetly think you should buy this album it is awesome"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like Destiny at all","review":"I'm a reasonbly big Destiny's Child fan, though not a really huge fan, and I thought I'd pick this up. How awful! None of the playfulness that characterized her work with Destiny Child is present in this album.Basically, you can sum this album up in three categories:1) \\"Crazy in Love\\", which is a really good song.2) All the other collaborations, most of which hardly feature Beyonce at all.3) Boring, slow, downtempo R&B grooves.For me, that wasn't enough to enjoy this at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy","review":"I think this cd is gr8. I love baby boy and crazy in love. ppl who like sean paul and beyonce should buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Hit Wonder","review":"I liked her radio hit 'Crazy In Love' enough to try out the album. It turned out to be the only track worth listening to more than once, but be warned that the version of 'Crazy In Love' on this album is ruined by some guy (Jay Z) trying to rap in the background. I would recommend trying out a few of her other tunes before spending your money on this album, and if you only want it for 'Crazy In Love' you're better off going with the single."},{"rating":"1","title":"1st opportunity: wasted","review":"Beyoncè has a great voice and a lot of talent, but the tracks of this album are not allowing her to show either of them.

Try again, Beyoncé (and . btw - less ballads, please)."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Grown Up","review":"Beyonce has taken care of her business on this album. She's proved what a prolific writer she is, a strong vocalist she is, and shown a maturity that today's pop stars couldn't begin to display. It's very rare to have a truly talented artist at her age in modern pop music. My favorite songs on the album are \\"Me, Myself and I\\" and \\"Yes\\", which are most likely to be strengthening anthems among young women all over the world who have faced the situations in the songs. Great job, Beyonce!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fun \\"little\\" book","review":"Sure the authoress is a harpie, but it still is a funny read.

I always knew the name, but never really searched to hear the voice of the divine one, lady sass. To me and my family, Sarah is the first and last word in singing. I've listened to Ella, Billy, Carmen, etc before I actually heard Sarah. There is no dispute, Sarah moves me with every song she touches, the vibrato, contralto, the control that those previously mentioned greats could only dream of. I would have to write a novel to express what I feel for Sarah let alone this album. You listen to her then you listen to those other singers, see who moves you the most! You will love this lady and this album for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sarah Vaughan's Idea of a Great Album","review":"This album was produced by Sarah Vaughan herself - she chose the tracks, the arrangements, the playlist, the cover art - so if you want to know what she considers her best shot, here it is.

Could have been a good gag on japanime if wouldn't been too harsh and Ninja Scroll haven't been such a neat movie. The story is horrible (as it was supposed to be). The storyline is worthless (well, they made a point there). Characters are hollow and their development is sketchy and jumps as a mad rabbit (whatever). Final fight scene is a total embbarassment although funny. Graphics were taken from Ninja Scroll (mostly). Extra star goes for consistent efforts to embbarass otaku :-)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"As stated by others, no true relation whatsoever to the excellent Ninja Scroll movie.

Demon Rape2. Demon Ninja fighting with his intestines.3. Dismembered Demon finger crawling into a womans uh..nether regions (and why? WHO THE HELL KNOWS)4.

This movie, however, has nothing to do with Ninja Scroll. It would have been nice for ADV to tell us this. To be honest I did like the animation and the last 10 to 15 minutes of the tape are really good, but that's it. The rest of the movie stinks.... BAD! This movie has to have one of the most boring and slow-moving story lines I have ever had the misfortune to experience in my life. It claims to run for only 50 minutes, but I felt like I sat through Titanic by the time any action gets going (the last 10 to 15 minutes I was talking about before). My advice is watch Ninja Scroll again and stay away from this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than the first one, still can't compare to Ninjascrol","review":"This second volume is actually a bit better than the first one, it has more plots that involve jubei(that what gives better at rating than the first one). It also contains a lot of senseless killing with serious vilolent in a bad way. I don't mind the blood or violent stuffs, but they don't look very artistic as ninja scroll. Overall it better than the first one but still didn't convince me this is a verygood series, hopefully the next volume will turn out to be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Ninja Scroll, and Not Samurai Showdown either","review":"I really did not like this DVD. I felt ripped-off to tell you the truth. Maybe because I had such high expectations. The violence is high, and yes there were a couple of 'naked time' scenes (with apolgies to Dana Carvey), but I came away from this anime feeling empty. First, on the VHS, the box said that it was Jubei from Ninja Scroll. Not so. This is the classical/mythical Jubei that is told of in legends. Kinda like Musashi. And, it is not the Samurai Showdown Jubei, despite the fact that they share the same name, and have an eyepatch. While Showdown modeled their characters (up to part two at least) after their historical counterparts, NInja Resurrection did none of this. THey just took the names and ran with it. Final Diagnosis: Not Recommended to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ninja Resurrection - Revenge of Jubei/Hell's Spawn","review":"this movie is just triening to be a copy of ninja scroll. if you want to see a go anime see ninja scroll, akira, wicked citey, ranmo 1 1/2, or records of the lodoss wars. not this crap the ation parts aren't even worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"They were wrong...","review":"This is the kind of anime you throw in and impress your friends who believe anime too \\"fruity.\\" Too much gore?

Yea, unfortunately, this film is not even a full cinema. IT is \\"...to be continued\\"!With an artistic vision, this film is well drawn. However, this is not a slide show. I also have Ninja Scroll, and while buying this I thought this was the second part. But no, don't be fooled. This Jubei is Jubei Yagyu from Samurai Spirits. Sounds good, but don't be fooled with that either. 'Cause... Um well I already said it that film is bad. It is too short too. 70 min.

The violence in Ninja Scrolls was inherent to the story.Ninja Resurrection has that childish, low detail artwork. The story is VERY weak. The characters have little development (you barely see Jubei in the second episode). The ULTRA, ULTRA violence belongs in something like Legend of the Overfiend - a repugnant anime of sick and twisted proportions. Contrary to popular belief, this show is not for adults. It for violence loving perverts.I just received this DVD, just finished watching it, and just finished dumping it into my garbage bag.

Now moving onto the film itself the story is just terrible and random it never really develops or gives explanation for much of the films events which as I have said are very random. The characters, much like the plot, have little to know development and are almost instantley forgetable. Add all this up and toss in the gratuitious and excesive gore and a few scenes of nudity and you have one of the worst anime films to have ever been made.

It wasn't realy worthy of the $[dollar amount] asked for the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive Title","review":"ADV should be ashamed at themselves for the marketing ploy of calling this Ninja Scroll 2. The Jubei character does not remind me of thye original, except for the swordsmanship. They should also check the running time. It sure seemed shorter than 50 min. They should have just put parts 1 and 2 on one tape but they were greedy. Don't buy this video thinking you'll get a good storyline as in \\"Ninja Scroll\\". The storyline didn't grab me or hold my interest. I won't rent or buy part 2 because I don't think it would be worth it. Borrow the movie from a friend if he has smashed it already. The animation is decent and there is a lot of blood and gore near the end. But a good anime must have more and this does not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceiving Title","review":"Maybe I wouldn't have been so harsh with the rating had they not deceived people by claiming the movie to the excellent \\"Ninja Scroll\\". I also felt cheated by the short running time. I don't understand why they couldn't package parts 1 and 2 on the same tape. I guess I do, it's all about the money. The problem with that being that after viewing part 1, I had no desire to go and rent or buy part 2. The animation is decent but the storyline wasn't interesting. I have seen lots of anime and a good anime has more than just blood and guts. It must have an interesting story. It fails in that respect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Ninja scroll but what is?","review":"The animation is very smooth and the fight sceans are done with style. It is not as good as Nija Scroll true enough but then again what really is?

The character Jubei depicted here has absolutely no similarities to the original Jubei. The plot moves by without even attempting to develop characters or suspense. The cheapness of this movie is perhaps best reflected in the many still shots of ancient Japanese artistic prints. It seems like that was done to fill up time on the video cassette without having to go to the expense of creating animation. The animation that was present was second rate and not at all comparable to Ninja Scroll"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was wack","review":"I thought that this movie was pretty wack.

Animation and fight scenes are very well done but's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Not Ninja Scroll 2!","review":"Don't be fooled like I was. This company obviously comes as close to stealing ideas as any that I have seen. I saw the Legend of Crystania (stolen from Lodoss War) which I admit was good. Once I found out that this was not Manga, i still had high hopes, thinking that this could still be good. It wasn't. Maybe I was just too disappointed at the fact that this was not NS2 that I didn't give myself a chance to like it, but even if i did, it just didn't run that well. There are some nice bloody scenes, but that is all of 5 minutes, and the movie (part) itself is only 50 minutes long. This is definately not worth the money, as the whole thing is a lie to get your money. Please don't be fooled. It is very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word...evil","review":"THIS WAS THE WORST ANIME I HAVE EVER SEEN! ...if it was possible I would have given it negative stars, as many as I could. It had a boring story which was confusing and hard to follow, as it jumps between times and places with NO explanation whatsoever. Sure, it had a lot of fighting, but it was absurdly graphic, to the point where it wasn't enjoyable because it was so unrealistic (they would cut off someones arm and the blood would spew like 30 ft and cover an entire room). This anime was bad enough that ADV didn't even bother to translate the second half! Running into a dull grey brick wall untill you lose consciousness is more entertaining (trust me on this-that's what I was doing after renting it and realizing that it sucked)...stay as far away from Ninja Resuriction as you possibly can!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Claims to be Ninja Scroll","review":"Ninja Resurrection: Jubei's Revenge has nothing to do with Ninja Scroll which seems to be a major misconception about the film. It's another film on the legend of Jubei Yagyu which is akin to the legend of Robin Hood in English lore. In this film the Shogun of the area wants to destroy Christianity in his realm, which results in a 'Jesuslike' man being born, and coming into power. Jubei is sent to stop this man/being, which leads to an even larger scale battle against pure evil. On it's own the film was enjoyable, and despite what some people think, it is the beginning of a series, and it did have a somewhat tidily drawn up ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ressurecting a Genre","review":"Lets face it with the exception of Ninja Scroll most Anime titles that deal with ninjas absolutly bite! Yet with Ninja Ressurection, no this is not a sequal to Ninja Scroll, ADV Films brings us a series of epic proportion. The detail to histroy is a nice touch on the series and the story line is stronger then that of Ninja Scroll. Where does this seem to fall short? Mostly in animation, which is good don't get me wrong but it is a bit rusty compared to the animation quality of Ninja Scroll. I will also say that events in this first installment, such as why Jubei has a patch on his left eye, are explained in volume 2 of the series Ninja Ressurection: Hell Spawn. For all the flaws though in this title it is still a strong anime that is worth worth seeing if you liked Ninja Scroll."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope","review":"this was a big waste of time! It took to long to start (thanks to that little history lesson) and once it did it left to many questions. This movie is low buget! ADV tried to create a run off of ninja scoll and failed. This has no connection to ninja scroll so all of you who are looking for more ninja scroll action...watch ninja scroll again because this is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why are people so hard on this film?","review":"I enjoyed it, I took it for what it was - a good action flick. Maybe people were actually offended by the religious themes in the movie? Maybe people bought this DVD thinking that it was Ninja Scroll 2 and are mad about that? Who knows...This DVD has a lot of entertainment value and I want to see the rest of the series when it comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Ugh....talk about s DVD regretting to get. If you have any tastes at all don't touch this. Ninja Scroll was better...but not by much. Both movies are overrated pieces of garbage.Try Samurai X if you want a decent DVD. Otherwise, save your money for something else...Cowboy Bebop would work, yes"},{"rating":"1","title":"dont buy this","review":"This piece of junk is nothing compared to its predecessor. The only way it relates to ninja scroll is that Jubei the main character Ninja scroll is in it. Jubei is a completely different character and not nearly as cool as in the previous movie. Trust me I may not be very descriptive on this review but dont buy this unless you have to. TRUST ME SERIOUSLY. IF you just want an anime get, Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust, Princess Mononoke, Akira, Ninja Scroll (OF COURSE) and Spriggan. These ones youll need to add to your anime collection. This movie is very very gory. You got internal organs popping out when ever theres a fighting scene. Always you see like woman get raped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff.","review":"I'm 46, still prone to a breakout now and then, large pores, and very oily skin. This product is great to reduce the appearance of pores and even out skin tone. Better yet is that it does a great job of keeping shine away! I wear a light liquid foundation over it when I go to work; use it on its own on the weekends. But, as the other reviewers have said, a little goes a long way and you DO need to let it set up for 2 minutes. (I put my body lotion on while waiting for it to set; that way I don't \\"forget\\" to wait to put my makeup on.) Oh, and it smells FABULOUS! I believe it has lavender in it.I also bought a tube of the Supernatural face tint with SPF. For some odd reason, I don't like it.

The result is a big mask of goop that feels horrible.Yes it will eradicate lines, only because it's so thick and therefore covers everything.I've never had success with this. And I really gave it the old college \\"go\\" -I nearly got halfway through before just tossing it in the trash because I can't use it anymore -it's useless to me. It just looks AWFUL. I had much more success with Covergirl Simply Ageless Serum primer w/Olay and Sally Hansen Natural Beauty Luminizing Face Primer. They're much thinner, set up faster and provide a nice canvas for makeup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the miracle advertised in magazines","review":"Does make a slick surface when applied, dried for 2 min as instructed; but, does nothing to minimize pores which it claimed to do....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough for now","review":"I see a lot of rave reviews and wonder what age the reviewers are. I think it makes a difference. I was tired of the commonly available makeup in stores that target older women. They are so heavy and pasty, and look terrible as the day wears on. Rather than minimize wrinkles and fine lines, they seem to accentuate it by settling in the creases.I switched from that regimen to this along with the Philosophy powder foundation. I've been using this for about 2 months now. The primer alone is fine for weekends, but I need the additional powder for work/more formal settings. I'm pretty happy with the results compared to the above. It wears well throughout the day as well; I don't cringe when I look in the mirror after a long day at work. However, if a product is going to call itself 'perfect', it sets the bar really high for reviews. I do plan on trying some other products after I use up my current supply, so the jury is still out on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WHAT I THOUGHT","review":"I was also very excited to try this primer. I like philosophy products but this is just horrible for my skin. I have sensitive, oily and acne prone skin. Have been using it for 6 days and I have broken out after not having not even one pimple for months. Specially in the cheeks and chin area. I applied it, the consistancy was good liked that, let it dry over the 2 minutes and then applied my foundation. Really like how my foundation looked with this and it did not make me oily. But the BIG problem once again it made me brake out, so ladies dont waist your time if you have similar skin. I will continue on my quest for the best primer!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product not a miracle for me","review":"This seems like a good product. If you're used to wearing liquid foundation like I am then it's not going to be a miracle product but it does make the foundation that you do wear look smoother. I will most definitely use this for special occasions under my foundation when I want to look flawless! I have some discoloration and other marks, this product doesn't conceal any of that but I don't think it is meant for that. I think it would work best on those who wear mineral powder foundation or no makeup at all, needing just a subtle improvement. It aslo seems a bit drying and the next day my skin is a little flakey so if you have dry skin I suggest wearing an oil free moisturizer underneath."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was on the search for the BEST primer that didn't add shine to my already combination skin. I LOVE Philosophy & thought I'd LOVE the Present too (& the price was GREAT), but it didn't hold up to my expectations. It's much thicker than most primers & very little is needed. It states to wait 2 min's before applying make-up & I've tried between 2 min's - 30 min's to see if that made a difference. By mid-morning I'd find my make-up was starting to look cakey on my oily areas. I really wanted to LOVE it and used it consistently for a couple of weeks trying different methods of application, time, etc... Finally, gave up & spending the $ for Smashbox. So far, it's holding up to the hype...even received compliments about something being different about me after using it a couple of days. I just smiled & said thank-you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smashbox Photo Finish's kid sister","review":"This stuff doesn't hold a candle to Smashbox's Photo Finish primer. I will still use Smashbox for important days, and just use this for other days until I run out, but I won't be buying more. The feeling of The Present is very sticky/tacky whereas Smashbox's Photo Finish goes on like air and then you don't feel it, and makeup is smoother that way. Just wish Smashbox wasn't so expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"I really wanted a product that I could wear all year no matter how light or dark I got. I also have splotchy skin occasionally that I wanted to have covered up. This product fits the bill nicely. After I put this on I put a light layer of translucent powder from bamboo wear.

I bought TAAW hoping to get one or two gems, but I don't think I've listened to it in years."},{"rating":"2","title":"YES","review":"a much overlooked album by one of the greatest progressive rock bands of all time.....the music here is more classical and jazz oriented then later albums, this was the beginning of the end for the original lineup and guitar player peter banks would soon be replaced by steve howe......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost there guys, just one more change to make...","review":"I will not review the album but they did a good job on the sound which is better than I remember with the LP. Nice to have the original album cover too but it you flip the booklet over it is the American version to promote the joining of Howe (which happened before this was released). Some great cuts on this one as always.As I get older I am appreciating the first two albums more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting Early Yes","review":"This Yes album was a favorite of my older brother, back then when it came out we have listened to it many times at home and on 8 tracks while riding in his 1964 Plymouth Valiant.

Rather than more complicated game play, this game could have been helped by1.) More intense violence.2.) Bigger, better explosions.3.) More gunfire.4.) Better graphics.Having to keep other troops alive is just a pain in the rear, IMHO. The European theatre is getting old as well.

That is, fighting in the WWII pacific theatre."},{"rating":"1","title":"they can definitly do better","review":"okay so the graphics are descent but this game irritates me because of the historical inaccuracy. since when was there an american in a British comando unit. and in the africa campaign they would be no way they would ever let an american in to the desert rats. they were completly british. and in russia they didn't even trust the americans never have probably never will. and the game posts no dificulty i beat it an two hours. okay before you say i have no life you should rent it and see how easy it is. its too simple. if you like games where you go around killing things and games that have no point this game is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a good game","review":"i don't know why people give this game such bad reviews.i've been playing FPS's since half life and unreal tournament and this game is a GOOD GAME!great graphics- good reproduction of WWII weapons- lots of nazis shooting at you- lots of nazis to shoot back- great explosions- it gives you a sense of actually being out there on the battlefield.great sound and audio as well.i've played through to the last set of missions,and have started over on easy because it gets to hard-yes- your squad gets F'd up easily-YES you take real damage from bulets-- i don't worry about the team too much,though--i heal them once in awhile-but if they don't make it- you don't need them to finish the mission.you have to keep your head down and make real decisions and real shots to get through and i think that makes this game great.worlds better than rising sun!!!like a whole different game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse one of the Medal series","review":"I was really disappointed in this game. For one your squad members never listed to you when you issued a command and they ran around where they pleased. There were hardly any check points in the game and especially in the last level where you played for over a half hour and at the very end if you aren't on the ball and get killed you have to start over again.

I'm also a WWII buff and this is a very accurate game. It isn't the easiest Medal of Honor, but it's deffinitely the best!!!

My only disappointment is the information states 100 watt bulb, which is one of the reasons I chose this lamp, but when I assembled (very easy) it shows 60 watt max. The lamp also seems smaller than described, but that was ok. I was thinking it would be taller and the base a bit bigger. When I measure to the tallest point on the lamp it is shy of 25 inches and the base is 5 x 8 inches. But, all in all it's a nice looking lamp, very unique. Looks great in the bedroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality!","review":"My fiance and I bought this lamp to match our existing lamp of the same manufacturer and we love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful design.

I had hope the manufacturer had also read feedback and corrected the problem. The lamp arrived with a leaning, swinging post as described by others. My husband already has the felt pad removed and is attempting to fix it. So if you want a \\"project\\" lamp , go to a flea market. I do not recommend this product or price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Table Lamp Review","review":"The lamp is unusual, could be comtempory or Oriental. Colors will blend with any decorating styles.

I do enjoy the style, made me think of Frank Lloyd Wright. I would purchase this lamp again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged","review":"I received this and the lamp was leaning to the left, I don't think it was a shipping error, it looked like it was a manufacturing error.

The incorporation of almost every aspect of every legend was in places clever, but a bit too much of a stretch to be believable. The characters were one dimensional, and Guinevere, in particular, just seemed clueless as to the world around her. In my opinion, she was not at all a likeable heroine. I much prefer Nancy McKenzie's The Child Queen and the High Queen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Capturing Trilogy!","review":"I would definitely recommend Sharan Newman's \\"Guinevere Trilogy\\" to anyone. Having little background in Arthurian legend did not stop me from becoming thoroughly engrossed in the characters in this series. I read all three books in a matter of three and a half days! Newman develops the characters very well and creates a connection between the reader and the people in the books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too simplistic","review":"I found this book a bit to simplistic. The writing was rather...basic. I would have found this book simple enough for a young teenager to read. I just didn't feel that the talent was there in comparison to Miles, McKenzie, Cornwell and Zimmer-Bradly. The story gets across, but it is filled with silly childish things like the unicorn - a total waste of pages. I also found the development of characters like Caet, Flora and the brother and sister living alone in the wilderness are all very poorly done. I didn't \\"KNOW\\" them and therefore, their motivation for doing things was also not well understood.If you are looking for a fast read (short book) and like the Arthurian legends - you may find some interest here. However, there are about 10 books I'd suggest before this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you John Gardner!","review":"Like many of you I was forced to read Beowolf in high school Lit. class. Then my teacher gave us Grendel, and I fell in love. What fun to get another perspective on the whole dreadful business. Even today it's one of my forever-favorite books, and my dog is named Grendel as well! When someone's face lights up when they hear his name, I know they're kindred souls.

Both childishly written (yes, I've heard the theory that the author intended this)and grossly modernized, \\"Grendel\\" is worthy only of a toss in the nearest garbage can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Overrated","review":"This book, like others before it (such as Ishmael) has attempted to use modern literature as a guise to pass on its author's nihilistic and/or otherwise incoherent religious beliefs. I cannot stand that. It does earn points, however, for its completely original style of writing. It also has some pretty gory scenes (such as people's arms getting ripped off) which, in my book, gets a star or two. Other than these two things, the book is completely worthless. Not even the plot is original. It is a twist on a medieval folk tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are a high school senior...","review":"If you are like myself a high school senior reading this book for English class, GOOD LUCK!

It's all about different ways of thinking such as idealism and reaalism ect. I just don't think it was a good book because it just wasn't holding my attention; I guess because I didn't understand it.

I've had it since my junior year of high school, from when we readBeowulf (Signet Classics)and I think I bought it to read for extra credit, or because I had genuinely likedBeowulf (Signet Classics)... but I never got around to reading this book. We rented the movieBeowulfand afterward, I decided to pull this book off the shelf. I found it to be very boring... so boring, in fact that I almost didn't finish it. Maybe if I had readBeowulf (Signet Classics)more recently... well, I don't know, but really, it was boring! It was hard to get involved in the story and mostly all it made me want to do was to pullBeowulf (Signet Classics)off the shelf and read that instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beowulf is better...","review":"I read this book for class after reading Beowulf, which I surprisingly enjoyed. This book focuses on the monster from the original poem, Grendel. While I liked the fact that the character was developed more and made sympathetic, the structure of the book was a little strange. I also felt like sometimes I was missing was the author was trying to say. I think this is quite problematic since the book is marketed to a young adult audience and I'm out of that age group. I would only recommend reading this if you read Beowulf and want a different perspective, otherwise, leave it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grendel: Not for everybody","review":"Although the author's idea to write a story in the view point of the \\"bad guy\\" is a good and interesting one, I must admit I thought the book was rather boring. Half asleep, I had to read lines and sometimes paragraphs over and over again, and in many cases (even when I managed to stay awake through this grueling novel), I still couldn't not quite understand what the author was trying to say. I'm not saying this book is terrible, I just don't think this book was for me. (You must understand I was required to read this book for my English class, and I don't usually agree with what I am forced to read.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beowulf's monster, child, philosopher!","review":"Earlier this year I read Seamus Heaney's excellent translation of Beowulf. Grendel is a retelling of this epic poem from the monster's eyes, versus the heros eyes. Darkly comic (laugh out loud), wildly surreal, a mixture of childish pranks and philosophical dissertations into the meaning of life. Gardner's prose is lyrical and finely wrought. Many stop-and-read-again lines. This version shows the side of mankind lingering in the back of my mind when I read Beowulf originally. The essence of man. Grendel stands nicely alone, but is also a tremendous compliment to the traditional poem. I se Grendel becoming a classic. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cerebral and Successful","review":"This novel not only provides an alternative viewpoint for the Beowulf epic, but is a brilliant experiment in style and structure. Each of the twelve chapters represents a different school of Western philosophy, showing how each is applied and contributes to the Grendel character. The chapters also each represent a sign of the zodiac and the implications thereof. Gardner often changes styles within the book, effectively exhibiting the change of the Grendel character. Defenitely a worthwhile read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good Book!","review":"Grendel is a great read. I read Beowulf prior to this, and I was not anticipating another boring tale. Grendel was not boring or hard to read. It was really interesting to find out Grendel's thoughts. It made me laugh. I am sad for the poor monster. He just wanted a friend. I love John Gardner's style of writing. I thought it was pretty good. I didn't give it five stars because I wouldn't say it was on of the best books ever, but it was definitely near the top of my list."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT GETS BETTER EACH TIME","review":"I have read Grendel several times and each time follow it with a second reading og Beowulf. Grendel is the Beowulf legend written from a different persective and as such, imparts a better understanding of the original. A very enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A reflection of man!!!","review":"Grendel is the reflection that Hrothgar sees in the mirror. A frightening look at man and his personal dreams of success, the initial price and its eventual cost. The book also explores the conflict between clarity of thought and obscured vision, in very subtle ways. This read is completely absorbing and absolutely incredible. Perfection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most existential book I have ever read...","review":"Gardner took the legend of Beowulf and breated life into it. When I first read Beowulf, I wondered \\"What's the point?\\" Having read this book, I realized that there is something important about mythology depending on your interpretation. Grendel has the best statement on the human condition ever to come from the mouth of a nonhuman narrator."},{"rating":"1","title":"This books blows a huge one....","review":"Utterly disappointing I wasted 5 hours of my life reading this book. It is just repeated stuff. Grendel's feelings and other things stated in the book are so inconsistent to the original Beowulf legend. It was so dragged on. You can read the first chapter and skip to the last and not have missed anything at all, you would get the same effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, yet hard to finish","review":"I just can't seem to finish GRENDEL, which is funny, because the first 100 pages are among my favorites in English literature.Yes, I am talking about Beowulf from the monster's point of view, written by John Gardner. The self-referential whininess and nihilism are a bit hard to swallow, but the intrigue, meaning, and poetry make the beginning one of the more fascinating essays in literature. It's at chapter 8/pg. 111, when suddenly the narrative slips into mocking Norse poetics, that I just find sluggishness (which started around the same time Wealtheow showed up) overtakes me and I cannot keep going. The inevitable emptiness of any nihilist writing makes it difficult enough; the shifting styles don't do this book any favors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nihilism","review":"Well written, depressing, and ultimately boring story of postmodern nihilism. The theme is that life is meaningless and achievement of values is impossible. Those who attempt to gain value in life or to act virtuously are fools or liars, and are to be despised more than the ordinary wretched people who recognize that depravity and misery is all they can achieve.Conveys the Existentialist view that men have choices, but that they are ineffective and arbitrary. Along the way the reader is given some insights into human behavior and some aspects of the role of art works, but this is not balanced by human benevolence and the influence of reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star","review":"ok this book is just too weird for me too read. i never knew it would be so gruesome. i can't believe i pick this book for summer readin book for skool. well, let just say that i hope i pass this test."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grendel Book Review","review":"Grendel is a 'monster', who lives with his mute mother inside of a cave. As Grendel grows and becomes more curious he comes into contact with humans, and begins to watch them from afar. Grendel sees the humans as ignorant and wasteful and begins to torture their villages. Grendel knows that no matter what he will always be the 'monster' to the human race and his only existence in life is to scare the humans.John Gardner does an excellent job trapping Grendel in the meta-fictional story. The story was interesting and kept me wanting to know what Grendel would do next because he was constantly changing his mind. The writing style that Gardner uses is very different from any of the books that I have read. The way he shows Grendel maturing by the way the grammar changes with each passing chapter. Another thing was the way Gardner combined Beowulf and the more in depth story of Grendel by adding a sort of modern touch to it. I found that that made the book a lot easier to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monster's Eye","review":"I read this book for the 1st time when I was 12 at the suggestion of my older brother, and just loved it. I knew the myth because I just read practically all the time.I liked that this book took the story of this big huge bumbling monster and turned that monster into an intelligent creature who was, just like most humans, only trying to figure out who he was and why he was alive. I found the philosophies and the concepts fascinating. This is an excellent book, and was very well written. I liked how John Gardner(RIP) stayed so close to the storyline of the myth, and didn't try to change it and make it all his own. Just filled out the story from Grendel's point of view. That alone must have been difficult to do, and I admire that Mr. Gardner was so successful in this case. It's a great book, and I'd recommend it to anyone who loves to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grendel","review":"Spinning-off from human history's original epic, Grendel tells the story from the monster's perspective. Philosophical, humorous and very well thought out, Grendel raises captivating questions. Deceptively complex, Grendel depicts the life struggle of innocence and experience, structure and chaos, purpose and chance, throughout the ages of time and existence. Who knew Beowulf's monster was so deep?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had liked this one.","review":"I was so excited when I saw this book at the library. I thought the concept of the story seen from Grendel's eyes was a fascinating one. But, I was unable to get into the story after 2 chapters. I'm not sure why, but the author was unable to connect with me and make me care about this Grendel...well, how do you care for a troll you might ask...well, I didn't even dislike him enough to keep going...does that make it clearer? Again, not sure why it didn't grab me. I wish it had."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Monster, His Mother, and The Meaning Of Life","review":"I found John Gardener's Grendel to be a very good read. It was the kind of book that you could just read, and leave it at that, or you could also go deep into it and discuss it in a book club kind of setting. In discussing the book you get the point that sometimes you have to look at things from the other person's perspective. The main character, a monster of unknown origin, is struggling as he explores the world around him and realizes life's harsh and brutish reality. The book really makes you think about your own view of life and humans. I recommend this book to anyone who has a love for good literature, internal conflict, with a bit of philosophy and a dash of blood."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amusing Parody","review":"Grendel is a wonderful, novel that proves John Gardner is a genius of an author. The viewpoint is that of Grendel, the monster which was slain by Beowulf. But to cut to the chase Gardner uses this novel to show the stupidity of nihilism, soloptism, government . . haha . . just read it carefully and pick up on all that gardner manages to parody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic","review":"It is intimidating to even write a review about such a great work of literature. How do you do justice to this? I can only say it is sublime, heart-wrenching , and not least of all, hilarious, absolutely hilarious! The best book I have read by an American author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Retelling of the Old Beowulf Story","review":"I found this novel funny and enlightening. I loved the monster's humor and the role the Shaper has in setting him straight. This is a wonderfully told story that will keep you entertained and make you think a little."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardcover is a Ripoff.","review":"Great book, but don't waste your money on the hardcover: it is a paperback edition pasted (not bound) into a hard cover. Save your money, buy the paperback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Read!","review":"This is the second CrossGen title that I have read the first being Sojourn, which I unequivocally recommend. It's a total surprise how good these titles are, because I have resisted reading them. I've read DC and Marvel exclusively. I decided to purchase Negation Book 2 and was blown away by the artwork, the characterization and pacing. Each chapter if filled with tension and you quickly catch on that there is more to this band of former prisoners than meets the eye. I was impressed to say the least and I have read more than my fair share of comics. I will have to go back and purchase book 1. It's kinda exciting and yet frustrating to be hooked to a new title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brief book review","review":"This book (both volumes) is widely known, but really shows its age.

I always recommend that first-time business buyers purchase and read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"early days","review":"This is what the Rads sounded like on Wednesday nights when they played for free at Luigi's on Elysian Fields in the early 80's. Maybe some of you newer fishheads blew off this cd because it's 20 years old. Big mistake. If you've listened to the Rads' recently, this cd will give you an idea of how timeless their music is. This is good cruising music."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a fan of the Rads, but not this CD / album.","review":"I have seen the Radiators live about half a dozen times and I always have a GREAT TIME. So why is it that their live recordings never give me that same feeling? IMO, it is because the recordings always sound dull, and lifeless - just like this CD. I don't know if it is the actual performance or just a poor effort by the recording engineer. I tend to think the latter.Thing is, I really don't like ANY of the live material put out by the band, including on DVD.I'm guessing that to truly enjoy the Radiators \\"Live\\", you really have to be there. And that is a shame, because I totally enjoy seeing them in concert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"This is more of a pamphlet than a book.

There are much better books for you"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste.","review":"Usually when someone writes a 'cookbook', it's because they have something special to share. This book (booklet is more appropriate) is essentially worthless if you have any other barbeque book around. I own many BBQ books and like to cross reference them to see how each makes a particular item. This little book does not get checked, as it adds nothing to the mix. This is not the first time I've wasted $5.95 in my lifetime. I suggest you don't waste your money or time with this booklet.

I should have rented it from the library first. I bought Dr. Earl Mindell's Prescription Alternatives and LOVED it (buy that book instead). The info in the book is not detailed enough for me. A lot of times it recommends you to take something like \\"barberry: as directed on label.\\" This does not give me any info. What is barberry? How do you take it? So I would have to go to the store, look it up, and basically do my research at the store. I hate this book. Skip it and buy his other book instead. This is a worthless waste of money that doesn't help at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Legendary\\" by Rick Springfield","review":"AS A HUGE RICK SPRINGFIELD FAN, I LOVE THIS CD SET...I GIVE IT A 10+ RATING OFF THE CHART...GLAD IT GOT TO ME AS QUICK AS IT DID, TOO..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"The topic is great. The participant's guide is a stretch in relating to Proverbs and we wonder at times \\"How did she come up with this?\\", so you have to make your own connections. The video is only fair as the leader is not engaging and very difficult to watch her mouth move. We probably won't buy any more from this series as we rate it only \\"fair\\". The leader's guide has some questions for discussion, but not enough connections to the scriptures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sisters Bible Study","review":"I enjoyed the bible study. It gives you a lot to think about. For the ones who want a deeper study it is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"His best yet!!!!","review":"John Edward is an amazing and inspiring person. I've read all of his books and seen his t.v. show. I consider myself a devoted fan. This was his best book yet. His writing style is easy to read and he seems to make what he does sound so simple and easy for him. He has changed my perspective on life and the AFTER life. He's trully gifted and makes me happy whenever I read his books. His insights have helped me and my family in many ways. Get ready to shed some tears with this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Old Same Old","review":"I totally agree with the spotlight reviewers review above. I have read ALL of Mr. Edward's books. When they first came out they were exciting. But this one is a REPEAT of all the others. I guess since they canceled his series he needed to make a buck fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing At Best","review":"I found this book disappointing at best. Somehow reading this book I got the feeling that this was the same old same old rehashed. I can't think of a thing I learnt from it, nor was it very entertaining. So what's the point to reading it?I hope that John is not taking his que from Sylvia Brown & trying to mass produce books for the buck. I would much rather read one good quality book from someone in this field once a year than three books of fluff. I am giving him 2 starts for somewhat of an effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peacemaker","review":"I found it to be everything we need to know to enhance living a peaceful and purposeful life in this world. John's description's are like an Irish Fairy{Leprechaun} mixed with laughter and tear's because we need the rainbow after the tear's to be able to see the sun again. His personality resonates peace and he is not afraid to show human trait's that we all feel and live with, while trying to live better lives for ourselves and loved one's. Energetically his written word's impact to the reader a sense of everything will be OK and to trust yourself when all other's doubt you.With Love, Jillie Sharples, Canterbury, New Zealand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unresolved Feelings","review":"One of the great features of this book by John Edward is his personal story of the difficult relationship he had with his father.Reading his story and his belief in continuing the healing process even after biological death can be a significant comfort for those who never had the opportunity to say they were sorry, they really loved the other person, or whatever should have been said that never was.I would recommend this book to anyone facing such a daunting task as continuing to live while a loved one died not knowing the depth of love left unsaid."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"I purchased this book for my mother after my little brother died and she reads it every night for comfort and some understanding of his passing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read. Very interesting.","review":"I liked this book because I, myself have been doing psychic readings for many years but haven't been able to move into the mediumship area of it,and after reading his book I thought it is only a matter of experience and determination. The book showed he is a normal guy who after many years of practice has opened his psyche. He is an awesome medium, and he is also a great person, father and husband. A normal person with talent. Gives me hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope...not enough meat or potatoes","review":"I like John Edward, and watch his TV show, which is fascinating. I liked his second book - crossing over. But this book just goes on and on with the same, and no new information. I just read a book by Tiffany Snow that gives exercises on how to see ghosts, stories about helping with unfinished business, and also stuff on the \\"bump in the night\\" kinds of ghosts. I liked hers better. John never talks about the other kinds of invisible forces there are out there - and I needed to know that too. Not all ghosts are dead people trying to say they love us. Maybe its the folks NOT on TV that are the cutting edge, I don't know. But, what I do know is that I'm going to a book store next time and thumbing through his next book before I buy it. If it's more of hte same, I'm writing him off."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book","review":"This is the second John Edward book I have attempted to read. The first one was \\"What if God Where In The Sun.\\" I have never seen one author driveling over their mother so much in my life. It is obvious that the man has \\"issues.\\" So I decide well surely he has matured, perhaps he is a better writer now. Well, I was sadly disappointed. This time he also rattles on about his father. You would think that someone with this sort of talent would apply himself in such a way that it would better society. He explains little to nothing about the afterlife, & I had a sense when I was reading it that he most likely didn't even write the book. The commercial plugs in the book are downright shameful as well. This book is about lining John Edward's pockets plain and simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant reading......","review":"Reading this book was like sitting down and conversing with a friend who shares his experiences with you. I love John's natural style. He comes across as someone I would like to know. In fact, it seems when reading his books, that you do know him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Signed","review":"This book was OK, but I don't think this book quite measures up to some of his others; however, on his tour for the book I got him to sign a copy at Costco after a very long wait in a serpent like line, one Saturday in WA State."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reba","review":"Reba is the best.

Add to that the squeezing of 22 episodes onto 2 discs. The discs are double-sided, with seven episodes on one side and four on the other. The picture quality on the seven-episode sides is dreadful. The set itself consists of the two discs and a flyer - no episode guide at all.Fox really shouldn't have bothered if this is the best they can do. I'll stick with watching the broadcast versions I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Season!","review":"I love season 5 of Reba. Every season was great but this one was my personal favorite. So many great episodes that are extremely funny! I have seen every episode of this show at least 10 times and I laugh everytime. Reba McEntire is such a great actress and the rest of the cast is so good also. They all have great chemistry. I'm sad the show ended but glad I can buy it on DVD.

In the first fifty episodes of Dragon Ball Z, there were actually bits and pieces from 70 episodes from Japan.

If you want these episodes earlier, you can get subtitled Dragon Ball Z DVD imported box sets with 27 episodes for only $30 [...] in the imported DVD section."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a clunker!","review":"Rushing To Paradise reads more like a sub-par novel from Michel Houellebecq or Alex Garland and pales in comparison to almost every other J.G. Ballard title. This one far and away is the worst of the lot. It's not that the writing is bad or that the plot is terrible. It's just that NOTHING ever really goes anywhere, the characters are two-dimensional even more so than is common in Ballard books. In most Ballard books we are confronted with a \\"normal, professional\\" person subjected to some sort of extraordinary situation that reveals something about humanity and the world that we live in or one day might find ourselves in. However, in Rushing To Paradise we are given no chemistry for this process to happen. The characters and location never really click making any revelation impossible.

It's a shame that the authors have so little respect for themselves or their audience that they couldn't be bothered to proof the galleys and eliminate some of the more egregious errors.

It goes into pre-RAW WWF and NWA, but doesn't hit on a lot of key parts. It never touches Japan, which is truly sad. And there is no section for ECW, yet there is one for the AWA.My only question is, what was the point of the book? Was it to introduce fans to today's wrestling market? If so, why mention older wrestlers and why not use that space to talk about ECW and some other WWF and WCW stars?If the point was to introduce people to wrestling altogether, then why not talk about Japan and ECW?The constrictive nature of a \\"how to\\" series book won't allow as many pages as is needed to do this project justice.

If you don't know anything about professional wrestling, and want to spend a weekend learning a lot, then this book may be suitable for you.That is, if you can survive the torturous writing styles of the authors of this book. Keep in mind that the book is written by a person who wrote about how he wanted to have the writing quality of his website be as good as possible.

The ultra egotistical and 'all knowing' writing style is disgusting, and it gives you the feeling Scott Keith was not hugged enough as a child. If you are a diehard wrestling fan, I suggest checking out titles by actual wrestlers that have some interesting backstage knoweldge, and skipping this one by some wannabe bookers no one has ever heard of who spend all their times on the couch in their mom's basement re-watching WrestleMania III, which is why they claim to be such 'experts.'This is such a bushleague production he doesn't even have his spelling and grammar right, let alone some of his facts.

These are in no way the fault of the author, as anyone who knows anything about publishing will tell you.As for the book itself, it's a great overview of the business over the past 50 years that reads like THE GODFATHER meets Meltzer. Keith is hilarious and you're guaranteed to learn something here. This is simply the best book to get you up to speed on the real goings on behind the scenes--and these stories are often more dramatic and entertaining than what you see in the ring.

I found countless grammatical errors as well as spelling mistakes. Was this book proofread before released? The proofreader should be pile-drived into a concrete floor. The author should be put into a figure-four leglock until he passes out. Can I get a refund with double my money back for wasting my valuable time?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"This book was horrible. He completely discredited any of the \\"bigger\\" wrestlers, even though that's who fans come to see.

Not worth your time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOGAN AND UNDERTAKER RULES","review":"Scott Keith is so anti-Big, slow workers that it is sad.

Every song on the cd is good and the blends a perfect mix of soft and hard tunes. The Ballads like unwell, Hand Me Down and Bright Lights sounds beautiful while harder tunes like Feel and Cold still bring that edge to the group. Excellent cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matchbox Twenty Does It Again","review":"Once again Matchbox Twenty, with the help of Rob Thomas' wonderful song writing, has scored another great CD. While maintaining the ability to write songs as if he were writing about you, the songs are edgier than past songs showing a whole new side to the band. Paul Doucette also showcases his writing ability with \\"Could I Be You\\" that matches Thomas' angst ridden yet catchy flair.I would definitely recommend this for all MB20 fans, if you haven't bought it yet, or for people that didn't care for the pop sound of previous work. From the harder sound of \\"Feel\\" and the almost Elton John sound of \\"Bright Lights\\" to the 60's feel of \\"You're So Real\\", there is something for everyone. My personal favorite (and a hint for the next single!!) is \\"Unwell\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT! AAA+++","review":"I'm a huge Matchbox fan and I listen to a collection of all 3 albums ALL DAY long. I never get tired of it! Rob Thomas has such a powerful voice that it just beckons to me. His lyrics are soul searching and speak directly to me.What a great band! What a great album! What a great musical ride!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth your money!","review":"I'd heard the song \\"Disease\\" on the radio and was in the mood for CD buying, so I decided to pick up this CD. I was not at all disappointed! \\"Feel\\" and \\"Disease\\" are fun, but Matchbox 20 really shines on beautiful, soulful songs \\"Downfall\\", \\"Hand-me Down\\" and \\"Bright Lights\\". I recommend this CD to everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoying all the songs","review":"This is the first Matchbox 20 CD I've purchased, and I'm quite impressed with it. Usually when I buy CD's it's because of one or two of the songs on it, and that was my initial reason for purchasing More Than You Think You Are. But to my surprise, I enjoy all of the songs on it, even after listening to the CD hundreds of times. I'm very excited for what Matchbox 20 has in store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"You know how when you're listening to a CD and you can usually pick out the better songs, the ones that are probably going to be released as singles? Well, I couldn't find a single good song on this CD. I really liked MB20's other 2 CD's, I listened to them quite a bit. This new CD doesn't really have any great songs. There wasn't a single one that I thought, \\"You know what, that song is pretty good.\\" The whole album was just blah. It could just be me, most of the reviewers here seem to love it more than life itself.If you are a casual MB20 fan, this CD probably isn't for you. If you live, breathe, eat MB20, then you'll probably love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Third Time Isn't A Charm","review":"Well lets just say that Matchbox 20 was a fluke. Their first album was great, having many songs that I still listen to today, including Real World. But on the new album Matchbox tosses beats for a more country feel. Then lets not bring up the single Disease. It sounds as if Britney Spears and Garth Brooks got together to break glass. Where did the band go that wrote Bent and Last Beautiful Girl?But then again, many of the lyrics are like those songs. But that is the point - this band has not moved on lyrically, while the beats have hit rock bottom.There is not one good song on this album, and worse they don't even flow together. Hopefully this album doesn't sell many copies because it is utter trash.But don't let this garbage discourage fans of Matchbox's former music, a far better album that has been unnoticed was released this fall: Rip it Off by Stroke 9... check it out if you liked the old, tolerable Matchbox. Ugh, this was a horrible dissapointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"man..i love these guys!","review":"jeezus! these people are awesome. i have all three of their albums and i cant believe how every album they improve themselves. its crazy! you should definitely pick this album up..and the other two. MB20 never fails to have great lyrics that make you go..whoaaaaa! just Rob thought that up?! completely satisfied. love these people!"},{"rating":"2","title":"every song is brilliant","review":"Rob Thomas doesn't write bad songs, every song on this cd is great, it is definatley an album you can listen all the way through with out skipping a track. Ive been listenin to this album for a month now and I'm still not sick of it. I never bought any of their previous stuff, although ive heard all the singles, so I know they are a quality band, and this new stuff is just as good as all the singles.Highlights for me include 'bright lights, unwell, could I be you and soul.' get this cd"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I am doing this.....","review":"I can't believe I am actually giving a 2 star review to anything associated with Rob Thomas. I am pretty disapointed with this CD overall. I like the first single \\"Disease\\" and there are a couple of others that aren't too bad like \\"Unwell\\". Overall it seems like Rob isn't in control of the writing like he usually is. I think he is trying to not stand out so much as the focal point of the group on this CD. There is a noticable difference in their sound to the point where some of the songs don't even sound like them at all... I am for evolution within a band but this is a bit too different too soon. \\"Mad Season\\" was in my opinion the best of the three so far. However, much of that opinion is due to the overplay of the first CD. I only hope that this is not the beginning of the end for them as there isn't really any standout hits on this CD like the last one had... or the first one for that matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock on, Matchbox Twenty!","review":"Matchbox 20's latest installment is a true rock CD, and Rob Thomas is matched only by Bono when it comes to modern rock frontmen. He has a unique voice, and is perfectly suited to the sort of music on this CD.Every song on \\"More Than You Think You Are\\" is catchy, and the beats in all these songs are amazing. Credit to the band for not letting standards slip in any of the twelve terrific tracks. My personal favourite tracks are the opening two, \\"Feel\\" and \\"Disease\\", which are simply great rock tracks, and \\"Downfall\\", which features great background vocals from a group of choral singers to contrast with Rob's rockin' style. My only possible complaint is that some of the songs are quite similar, but I like them all anyway!If you like either \\"Unwell\\" or \\"Disease\\", the songs receiving airplay at the moment, then I suggest you buy this album and discover that every other song is just as good. A great rock album, and well worth buying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Matchbox 20 Album!","review":"This has gotta be one of the best album releases of all time and the best Matchbox 20 album ever.I own the other two Matchbox 20 albums but was never a major fan until I listened to this CD.It's way better than the previous two albums and every song is worth listening to.Ignore those people who gave only 1-3 star reviews.This album is a must have and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Rush To Record & Release Shows.....","review":"many people do not realize the 4-yr span between Matchbox Twenty's first two albums. All I can is they should have taken another 4 years.This albums sounds rushed & over-produced. Every song leaves you saying \\"Who does that sound like\\" and it's because the album simply has no consistency, no flow, no 'theme'. It simply sounds like a collection of songs that have the writer as their only common bond. There are only one or two songs that 'sound like' Matchbox Twenty. While some may say that is good and that they are developing, the simply fact is that their original sounds was obviously fine as-is. This album comes across as a \\"well, we're big enough now we can do whatever we want\\" project.I am deeply disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best one yet!!!","review":"This is an awesome CD. I got it expecting some of the same styles as before, but MB20 serves up new style with all sorts of sounds. My favorite songs are 3 and 4. I love this CD its so good, you should buy it!!!! It's one of those Cd's where you can listen to the whole thing straight through."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rockier sound...","review":"This new release by Matchbox Twenty leans toward a rockier edge and away from the soulful sound of SMOOTH, YOU'RE GONE, PUSH and BENT. The first 5 songs on the cd....FEEL, DISEASE, BRIGHT LIGHTS, UNWELL and COLD all are heavy on percussion and intensity. The second half of the cd along with a hidden 13th track is slowed down and contains more of soulful sound from their last effort....with this new release and Rob's terrific vocals it lets it be known that this band is still a force to be reckoned with in modern day pop/rock. I look forward to more cd's by this great band!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland light pop!!","review":"I am 25 and a rock fan and back in the day when their 1st album came out I thought these guys were cool alternative rockers. Since then they have changed their sound and put out boring pop songs. Do not buy this album unless you want boring put you to sleep music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Going down fast","review":"There are 12 songs on this CD. 11 of which aren't worth air play. CD's like this are the reason I burn most of my music off the internet."},{"rating":"1","title":"godawful crap!!!","review":"Unwell, the most annoying song kicks off this SELL-OUT CD!!!Back in the days of Yourself or Someone Like You. Matchbox 20 was a CRAPPY acoustic band, but atleast Rob Thomas's awful voice went well with the rest of the band's so-called music. In this akbum, they go electric, which does nothing for me. UNfortunately, my roomate blasts this CD from hell so loud that I can recite the cheesy, childish lyrics for every ficking song on this CD down to the stupid hidden track. This CD does nothing for me, as if I tried to discard of it by running over it with a truck, it would be no use because my roomate would burn a new copy from his music library. I guess I can hope for the best and see to it that all MB20 products are boycoted!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another bland, heartless, boring band for the masses","review":"I ask you one question: Why bother?More questons: Why does this music exist? So conservative middle Americans can a have a bland, risk free group to go see once a year at the local arena when wrestling or tractor pulls aren't in town?? I mean WHY!!?? What is appealing about this half baked, uninspired, low brow poorly written tripe? Why would anyone be interested in a band of Southern frat boys? Does the Hootie and the Blowfish crowd need a new band to follow? Lord help us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait...","review":"I thought that Matchbox 20 was never plannin' on releasing a new cd, but then I heard disease on the radio while driving and almost got into a car accident I was so shocked. They are fantastic. \\"Downfall\\", \\"Unwell\\", \\"Feel\\", and \\"You're So Real\\" are my favorites, but they're all fantastic tracks. Yet another good job by Matchbox 20."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Than You Think You Are is inspirational","review":"The new album More Than You Think You Are from the spectacularly talented band Matchbox Twenty is to say the least inspirational. It's a new and refreshing sound from the band and promises to be as amazing, if not more incredible than their previous albums. There is one song in particular that seems to get into your soul. Unwell is the fourth track on the album and is by far my favorite. Pick up more than you think you are and if you aren't a fan of matchbox twenty by now you will be. Rob, Kyle, Adam, Paul and Brian amazing me with each new album and they will amaze you too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW, THEY'VE DONE IT AGAIN!","review":"RUN **do not walk** to go buy this CD, you will not be disappointed!! I keep playing this CD over and over again and cannot get enough. Bright Lights, Unwell, Downfall, Hand Me Down, some of their best songs ever are on this CD! How can you go wrong with Rob Thomas' soulful lyrics and performances and the bands sense of rock, soul, country and pop, its all in here, I cannot reccommend it highly enough, I cant wait for the tour!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More than you think it is","review":"Matchbox Twenty got their third album out, and I am impressed. Mixing the more upbeat flavor of Yourself or Someone Like You with the calmness of Mad Season formulated a superb album. Having all three, I'd say that Disease is one of the best songs they have made. Also, listen for the bonus track after The Difference. At about 4:15 into the track, a second bonus song with no name plays. That song it very upbeat, and is worth listening to. Buy this album and enjoy some of Matchbox Twenty's finest music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shazam!","review":"This is now one of my favorite albums in the world, no question. I have always been a huge Matchbox fan, but I see a lot of growth in this album. There has always been a divide between Matchbox 20 bitter rock songs like 'crutch' and Matchbox 20 ballads like 'shame', but here they blend. Rob Thomas's edgy vocals haunt the songs and give them power, but there is still a much greater depth and soul than what you hear on the radio right now. Matchbox 20 has finally defied the limits of genre music, and the result has been a collection of definitively Matchbox songs. I adore it."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than you'll think it would be","review":"Ever since matchbox released If your gone i've been a fan. Although some of their music is sometimes too soppy the majority is brilliant. And this album does not dissapoint. Although this is not the usual genre of music i listen to i still enjoy MB20.So buy it even if you do not like this type of music, you will find something in it for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best is yet to come","review":"Somehow each mb20 CD gets better and better. I love this CD, the soulful lyrics of Rob as well as a a few of the other bandmates are amazing and Rob's voice never fails to captivate me. There are a few good hard rockers as well as the usual haunting ballads that everyone can relate to. WONDERFUL CD, can't wait to see what they do next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"3rd Album Is a Charmer!","review":"I just got this CD a couple of weeks ago, and I can't stop listening to it- it's like an accessory I keep dragging around with me: to the car for the commute, into work to pop in the computer, back home to listen to while I fix dinner, and so on! I can't seem to get enough! I've been a Matchbox Twenty fan since their debut, and I have yet to be disappointed! The tracks on this album are great, my favorite being \\"Unwell\\". This is the track that grabbed me immediately, and it's why I bought the CD. I am never worried about buying a Matchbox Twenty album, even if I haven't heard but one or two songs- I always end up with a new \\"accessory\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Once more the guys from Matchbox Twenty have created a great CD. Not surprised at all though. They are awesome!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A ROCK GEM","review":"I'm a matchbox twenty fan I love YOSLY and Mad Season but I thought MTYTYA was not going to be good, they had done two amazing and incredible records I thought that the 3rd one wasn't going to be as good.The first time I heard it I was like OMG..what's this?but after haring it over and over I found out it's an amazing record, Unwell, Hand Me Down, Bright Lights, Downfall, Could I be you, Soul, So Sad So lonely are my faves so far, but I change my mind every 5 seconds.This is a MUST HAVE if you have a good taste you gotta buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD worth buying","review":"Matchbox Twenty has done it again, i think this is a great album. very different from Mad Season but still has the same unique feeling that matchbox twenty is known for.The best tracks on this album must be Unwell, Bright lights and feel. But there are still many great tracks that i like. this is a great soft album, only one disapointment for me is, i wanted a few harder tracks, but thats okay, the rest of the album covers that up. More Than You Think You Are, is a great buy for any old or new matchbox twenty fans. Great Soft rock album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"'More Than You Think You Are' is a hit!","review":"I was absolutely stunned when I listened to this album. I'm a huge Matchbox fan, and so when I heard 'Disease' I was excited, but I was hoping the band would have stuck with more of the 'Mad Season' stuff. Although MTYTYA is a far cry from MS, it isn't like Yourself or Someone Like You, either. It's an eclectic mix that at times reminds me of the Beatles, and at other times reminds me of Mick Jagger, but all the time screams Matchbox brilliance. The lyrics are great, and the songs rock--hard! There is a song for every mood on this album, and I would recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Taking music to a new level","review":"Put Matchbox Twenty's other albums aside. Start fresh with this one. We know what they've done in the past with their other two records.\\"More than you think you are\\" is in the CD unit. First song, not that good. Possibly the worst song on the album. My opinion. The album picks up from there with \\"Disease\\", \\"Bright Lights\\", and \\"Unwell\\", three smashing songs, all possible radio hits.From there on, the album delivers, in a big way. Matchbox Twenty raised their game to a new level with this album. In fact, they have set a new standard in the Alternative Rock category. If this album doesn't win Album of the Year for 2002, something is wrong. It's that good.\\"Downfall\\" could be the best Matchbox song to date. Give it a listen. I sure hope they release this song on radio, because it is the kind of music that can lift the spirit and brighten our days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something positive amidst all the negativity","review":"I loved this CD. I bought it when it hit stores and listened to it for weeks. I love how everything kinds flows together all the tracks and songs, with just subtle differences. Rob Thomas has an awesome voice, and apparantly the critics don't know what they're talking about because how long has Matchbox 20 been around for now?? Definitly buy if you are looking for something new to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than I thought it would be","review":"Let me start by saying \\"WOW!\\" This is an amazing album. If you liked either of Matchbox 20's previous albums, prepare to be blown away. The band has really outdone themselves this time. The cd features a variety of music; some songs that are upbeat and make you want to dance, and some that are a little more serious. This cd was worth the wait and a definite must have. I only wish I could give it 6 stars instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"UTTERLY BRILLIANT!","review":"Myself being a huge critic of music, I love Matchbox Twenty. MTYTYA's predecessors were great. But this is beyond even that. The lyrics are as touching as before, but yet somehow more so. Rob tops himself with lyrics in the songs \\"Bright Lights,\\" \\"Hand Me Down,\\" and \\"Unwell\\" especially, in my opinion. The music is as beautiful as in Mad Season along with some more rock tracks like YOSLY. The most powerful song on cd, in my opinion, is \\"Hand Me Down.\\" Rob puts so much emotion into this song that it is just tantalizing. When he starts singing from the start it touches you. This is an almost unbeatable album. If you liked Mad Season you should definitely get it. If you're a Matchbox Twenty fan in general, this is more than you can expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Longing for the early years...","review":"After Matcbox Twenty hit sophomore slump status with \\"Mad Season\\", I still had hope for the band's third release. And I'm listening...and listening...and listening...nope! Still can't find much worth hearing again other than \\"Disease\\" and \\"Unwell\\", which you can hear by buying or downloading the singles. Or just listen to the radio! You'll hear them more than you ever want to! There's a reason these guys are hiding their faces on the cover of this album!! Because they've sold out! All the songs pretty much have the same lifeless sound. Definitely doesn't hold a candle to their debut, \\"Yourself or Someone Like You\\"! Buy the debut instead...and embrace it, because it's Matchbox Twenty's only good album!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"unbelievable","review":"I listened to the cd on vh1, truly amazing, the emotion pours out of the songs, Rob Thomas is the best songwriter I have ever experienced1 He writes songs everyone feels an immediate relation to.

Could listen to it over and over again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST BUY","review":"I love this CD. It is now one of my faves.

Since their first album, Yourself or Someone Like You, Matchbox Twenty has changed their sound and not for the better. Yourself was a powerful CD with great lyrics that really showcased the band's writing and singing talents. The sound that sold millions of copies of their freshman effort, however, disappeared with Thomas' collaboration on Smooth and the MB20 sophomore album Mad Season. It's not that the second and third CDs are terrible; they just don't sound like the same band that produced Yourself. And while there's not a track on Yourself that I don't like, I found my finger frequently brushing the forward button when I listened to Mad Season and More. Here's hoping the fourth album sounds like the Matchbox Twenty of Yourself fame."},{"rating":"1","title":"paba for the masses","review":"Sorry, by reading the reviews, I am going to assume that I am the only one who did not like this album. I loved the first two they put out \\"Mad Season\\" being my favorite, but just cannot get into this latest album. to me every song sounds the same, and none of them grabbed me, I personally would not recomend it, and in fact will be selling my copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best rock album, I've heard in a long time...","review":"I was not a Matchbox Twenty fan until this release. I had heard their radio hits, but never bought a cd. I heard the song 'Disease' and thought it really rocked. Bought the cd and was blown away by its diverse sounds. Its spans the realm of hard rock, bluesy ballads and is sprinkled with a touch of attitude reminscent of the Rolling Stones.(It doesn't hurt that Mick Jagger co-wrote one of the songs.) It does all this without losing its identidy... Matchbox Twenty through and through. I bought the cd as xmas presents for my music loving freinds and each one has been surprised by how much they like the entire cd. It is a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"omg this album is awesome, i didn't know if i would like it but when i heard their new single disease i was like omg i gotta buy this CD, and i was surprised to find that all the songs are awesome. i love this CD, it's one of my favorites. definatly go out and buy this CD if you are a MatchBoxTwenty fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful music to the ears","review":"This third coming of Matchbox Twenty is more elegant than even the prior two. Rob Thomas never fails to write lyrics that sooth our soul. The words so carefully relate to our own feelings that one can't deny the musical realness that is Matchbox Twenty. You can't listen to it just once. This album is one that you can put in and play over and over again. A must have for long drives, even if your going nowhere. A pick among the best of great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Matchboxtwenty","review":"I love Matchbox 20, I think is the best band in the world.

Every song on this album is incredible. The lyrics are powerful, deep and almost disturbingly introspective, which I love. Each song has it's own unique style which keeps the album sounding fresh each time you listen to it. I will admit I listened to it for quite a while before I realized how great it was and how much I loved it. It was well worth the money and I would recommend it to everyone who liked the first two albums. You will be blown away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"Yourself or Someone Like You is one of my favorite CDs, and Mad Season eventually grew on me... maybe that's what it will be like for this CD, but after listening to it once, I'm disappointed. The majority of the album seems so bland. The only songs that stood out were \\"Disease\\", \\"Unwell\\", and \\"You're So Real\\", and \\"The Difference\\". If you're new to Matchbox 20, I'd suggest you get Yourself or Someone Like You instead of this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Sonics, Bad Interpretation -- judging just by Egmont Overture on this Recording; WARNING: Don't get your ears pierced!","review":"I promptly got rid of this CD. The sonics are atrocious. Thin and overly contrasty with pierce-your-ears treble on louder portions. The Egmont is poorly done too. No meaning. Grind-thru and then pierce-your-ears on the loud parts.

I had the pleasure of seeing them live many times and was always impressed with their songwriting capabilities and pure power. Tony Emmons, the lead guitarist and vocalist (on most of the songs) is perhaps one of the most over-looked singer-songwriters of the mid to late-90s. If you want to rock, then buy this album.

I just hope that Stacie reads this to realize how much she has turned down all her fans, and the little children out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"come on","review":"Well, stacie orrico is not genuine anymore. She's just another pop singer who really just wants to be another brittney spears, but will never admit it. Wasn't she christian? I guess not anymore. It's a shame that she was a christian artist only until she got high enough on the popularity chart where she could cross over and people would still listen. Her 2 hit songs were pretty big and i think i even sung along with them before(which scared me). that's why she gets two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm.....puzzled","review":"Hmm....I honesly really do not know what to say...after buying her CD,except for the first week I really do not listen to it. For me, usually I like a song based on the how it sounds, but if it has no substance in it then after that week it's boring. Like the first week was good and I liked Stacie, but now her songs are annoying after a couple listens. \\"Strong Enough\\", \\"Stuck\\", and \\"More To Life\\" are the best tracts. Her lyrics are mosttly pretty superficial and shallow. If you like to think about what you're listening to then don't get this. Also, it's pretty annoying after a couple listens and most of the songs sound the same! So be warned!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing for Christian fans...","review":"I bought her first album a few years ago and liked it mainly for its strong Christian aspects. Now, she admittedly sounds better, but the tone is your basic Britney (or any other belly-button girl), teeny bopper style. I hope her next album has more Christian Contemporary rather than secular pop. Otherwise she'll just become another MTV icon, not Dove awards candidate."},{"rating":"1","title":"dime a dozen","review":"it's bad enough Brittney Spears is almost 5 years deep into her career&saying that alone truly Scares me.the same with Jennifer Lopez.stacie orrico has a better voice than both of them combined but yet isn't that much better yet.very factory machine about Her music&vocals thus far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs more time to mature","review":"This is exploitation of teenagers to make a quick buck for the managers/producers.

My parents are both 'good' Christians and are still iffy about this disk!!Overall, the content is definately spiritual, with the exception of the first song, which is about a guy she had a crush on.

I really like Stacie she is my #1 singer. On her new CD it has all three of her singles wich are: Stuck, More to life, and Strong Enough. Her first single she made was \\"Stuck\\" and then she made a music video to go with it that appears on TRL. She has an amazing voice, and if you only have her debut album \\"Genuine\\" you haven't heard nothing yet. So if you like Christina Aguilera you'll love Stacie Orrico."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who ever said christian music sucks","review":"I think this CD is the best Stacie Orrico has done awsome thingswith it.I don,t know why people ever said Stacie Orrico,s music is for girls because i,m a boy and i find the music amazing.Stacie Orrico is beautiful in every way i think this album would make a great christmas present.I give this the thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for her","review":"I think this is the way to do it. I have read some reviews that say it's not \\"Christian\\" enough. Christian people listen to Christian CD's. Sneaking Christian lyrics in like Stacie does in this album can help to minister to people who would normally not listen to Christian music. Christians don't need to be ministered to. This makes people really think about what she is saying. If they like the CD enough to buy it, then maybe they will listen to what she has to say. I bought it thinking it was pop and was thrilled when I found out it was much more. She knows what she is doing. Great CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stacie is the real deal","review":"This CD is HOT. The whole inspirational tip is cool too. Stacie brings songs to the table that actually make you think. \\" I Promise\\" and \\"Maybe I won't look back\\" are the two best songs on the cd. And Who dosn't love \\"There's gotta be more\\"? Stacie has the voice that a girl needs to stay in the business. Get this CD you'll love it. Hey, I'm still litening to it and it came out a year ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I am a 25 y/o woman who has always loved pop music. When I heard the song More to Life I automatically loved it.

I enjoy just listening to it as background music, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened","review":"I am a christen girl who really used to like Stacie Orrico.Then she started making songs that were talking about boys not God. Now I could have lied to my parents and said yes these are good christen songs. But I knew in mt heart they werent. Now all I have to say is that it is wrong.Its not just Stacie Orrico. But to all whom do it, I believe God looks down on you. How could you . I personally will never buy a Stacie Orrico CD again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD for any teen","review":"This CD would have to be one of the most popular CD's of 2003.

A truely inspirational album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Stuck on Stacie!!","review":"I love Stacie Orrico. She is such a wonderful artist. Ever since the debut of Genuine, Stacie's first album, I have been a huge fan!! Trust me if you have a teen who is into pop/r&b; Stacie Orrico is a perfect CD to give them.I also salute Stacie for always sticking up for her faith!On a final beat, buy this CD. You will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stacie- all the way","review":"This album is truly the best. Stacie's song'Stuck' reminds me about a boy, who liked me but then lied and said he like someone else. I truly hate him but i still love him and i can't stop thinking about him. Another favorite song i like is 'Strong Enough' that song to me expresses the way she feels about God. I think Stacie should stick to writing her own songs. All the one's she writes are the most beautiful. Keeping working hard Stacie, i'm sure each new album will be better and better.-Peace out, Love!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stacie Orrico CD","review":"I bought this CD because I loved Stacie Orrico's More to Life and also enjoyed Stuck. I was expecting the other songs to be similar to More to Life and Stuck, but they were very different, and not much to my taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch out for ideologues","review":"Get ready for a review of how the nation was dishonestly and cold-heartedly led to another war by men who cared more about spin than national security. For those who are too young to remember the reasons the United States went to war in Vietnam - remember these ominous words:\\"Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\\" 60 Minutes is notoriously biased to the liberal agenda, but this segment should make everyone aware that any ideologues can become too powerful if left unchecked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Affordable and Enjoyable","review":"THE SHOCK is one of the Lon Chaney movies long available to collectors and fans, as it was, for many years, available in 8mm. and 16mm. formats. The source material for this release suffers from a \\"grainy\\" look, to me, but sitting further back from the screen helped a lot. The musical score is, I think, appropriate, and, overall, I recommend this disc, not only because it is one of Mr. Chaney's best, but also because, for the price, I don't think the quality is bad. I'm personally grateful so many of the great silents are being made available in \\"bargain\\" editions, not always the most desirable editions, but, more often than not, I've found, very watchable. Here, Chaney plays disabled villain, Wilse Dilling, and this film has to be one of the more suspenseful movies of the twenties. I believe that, if you're going to rely on video to see classics such as this, this release is fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some abridgments stink","review":"I read an abridged version of \\"The Cloister and the Hearth\\". A book of 750 pages is compressed into a slim volume of 176 pages plus limited annotations. Boy, did I feel like I was missing something. Yet I have no desire now to buy the unabridged version and hopefully better annotated, I know the plot. So my advice on this book is \\"Don't get an abridged version!\\" Is the book worth reading? I can form no true opinion, I can only say that what I got was not worth the price. To save the reader the effort, my version was English Literature Series #118, Macmillan and Company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable!!!","review":"I first read this book about 40 years ago as a teenager and have never forgotten it, indeed it lived up to my memories the second time around.

(Heart Like a Rock) By the time Gatton solos in\\"Love My Baby\\", he's burning so hot he nearly levitates off the stage. It's easily one of the greatest guitar solos in rock and roll history.

Before and after I ordered this item it said that there was one item of this in stock. Before AND after? Seems fishy. And rather than offering to send this to me (which is what I wanted) they refunded my money. I kinda thought seeing this item for sale was too good to be true. And you know what they say about somethig seeming to good to be true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious junk","review":"The first third of Mating is promising enough - good writing, good characters, etc. By the end of the book I was so nauseated by the boring psuedo-intellectual conversations. It was a bit like \\"The Blair Witch Project,\\" only instead of idiot kids freaking out in the woods, you get self-satisfied Ivory-tower types freaking out in Botswana.Rush's erudition is praised in several reviews. Just because the man makes you have to look up foreign phrases doesn't mean his writing is any better or more intelligent than others. Just more pretentious. In fact, while Rush does a fantastic job of playing \\"stump the reader\\" with his snippets of vocabulary from several language, he manages to use Japanese incorrectly. It's a \\"yukata\\" not a \\"yakuta.\\" Which just goes to show that even pompous gits need good editors too.Try Rush's short stories to see if you can tolerate him before embarking on this queasy whites-whine-in-Africa waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beg, Borrow or steal this book and throw it . . .","review":"in the first open flame you can find. Don't waste your time with this waste of paper unless you feel the need to believe a good writer is one who hides any semblance of an interesting plot in a sea of unnecessary vocabulary jargon. Just say no."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too wordy...","review":"I picked up this book since it was in the 25 best american novels ever written according to the New-York Times. Initially, I was interested since the story unfolds in Africa and I knew little about that continent, however, Norman Rush's prose feels really heavy, and, in the end, it wears you out.I don't recommend this book, instead, pick up A fine balance by Rohinton Mistry. Much better story unfolding in another country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it with a dictionary and laugh","review":"What an unusual vocabulary this man has. You have to read this book with a dictionary like you're in high school, which makes it fascinating because he uses words so well. Also, a man writing a strong female lead is unusual, and I think he succeeds. In all, an excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"Don't waste your time with this falsely hyped, lousy novel. I hear Rush made a bar bet that he could write a novel using over 100 of the least-spoken words in the English language. Looks like he won the bet and I lost my patience and several hours of my life I cannot get back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out in Africa","review":"I'm intrigued by the strange point of view of the egotistical, quirky protagonist, in her search of love (or at least sex) and fulfilment in Boer Botswana. I find this book humorous,rich in interesting notations on the human quirks, and the style reminds me of Nabokov's Lolita, Thank God without humbert humbert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"Improbable people in implausible situations driven by too-convenient motivations. A thin veneer about anthropology, development, political philosophy, and Africa that drags the story along but does little to enlighten. Obviously written with a well-thumbed thesaurus at hand, the author's expansive vocabulary is more tortured than inspiring. (Or, as Mark Twain put it, \\"it grates on the fastidious ear.\\") A decent plot, but a snoozer in its execution. The characters are drawn with multi-layered histories that are informational but exact no empathy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give us another, please, Mr. Rush.","review":"Don't read this book if you do not have an academic turn of mind. The vocabulary is out of sight but is just part of the fun. I did not know what I was getting into. I saw on the cover that the book had won a national award and I knew I was going to be spending two weeks in a hammock in Panama so I bought it and was thrilled to learn that it takes place in Botswana where I had visited before with the terrific books of Alexander McCall Smith and the Miss Marple of Botswana. I read every sentence and laughed out loud many times. The ending itself is funny. The protaganist gets herself so zonked out on her honey that she has to repete exactly the foibles of her predecesor when he is for once, just trying to be honest with her. Of course, she is young and believes in everything she learned in college. I certainly hope Rush is rushing to get another big fat careful novel out to us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly an amazing book","review":"This is a book that is beautiful in so many ways. Reading it was like living this love story, with all the intellectual discussions (sometimes a bit pretentious), and the applications of theory into practice. It was a book that is so female (all told from one woman's point of view) that I could hardly believe that Norman Rush wasn't actually a woman. If I only had a few books to take to a desert island this would be one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"A couple of academic bags of hot air","review":"Go to Africa and pontificate. I don't know why this book got the great reviews it did. I found it almost embarrassing to be stuck in the heads of characters with such inflated self-images. Seeing the world through their eyes was like being stuck on a long car drive with your spouse's uncle, who thinks he knows everything and never shuts up. Some people may have liked the \\"famous social scientist\\" who is just a self-satisfied man, pleased to think he is king of his small kingdom. I found it utterly boring. Occasional attempts at wit or insight didn't redeem this book for me. I'd say avoid it diligently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who talks like this?","review":"This book was WAY too much work given the payoff. Sentences meander endlessly and are strewn with 25 cent words--and those 25cent words don't help establish the character, but just seem to be an opportunity for the author to throw them around. I don't mind getting an education but the incessant use of \\"big\\" words diminished the credibility of the main character. Who really uses this kind of vocabulary so frequently either in thought or in speaking? Instead of visualizing a character all I could see was an author with a thesauraus by his side looking for opportunities to flaunt his penchant for polysyllabic and obscure words. And following the sentences/character's line of thought is a constant chore. The main character is smug and seems to feel she's funnier (especially with her wordplay) than she actually is. This book just made me feel dumb...like I'm not smart enough to \\"get it\\". Overall a pretentious, elitist book that makes James Joyce's stuff seem light and breezy."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont waste your time","review":"I really did not like this book, it is so full of cliche intellectual discussion of all issues it is so desperately trying to address, feminism, development and socialism.There are so many words in the book that are not known to the average reader(myself and i saw in the reviews that someone else made the same comment, so I dont feel as bad). The fact is the use of these words does not make the prose any better, merely harder to read. It is almost as if it was written with the help of a thesaraus (and dictionaries from other languages).I do not think this is a genuine portrayal of a relationship either, I mean, does anyone think that the dialogue between the lovers can be for real? That is what is wrong with this book in general. It is not genuine and way too pretentious."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pedantic Display","review":"This was a book that had to be read with the dictionary in the other hand. There are several sentences with at least three or more words that are unknown to the average reader. I read and reviewed this book as a member of a women's book club. There are 11 members of this club and I was one of five that finished it. We didn't see how Rush managed to win an award for such literature. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave me a headache","review":"I love books, and I love to read, but this book was a waste of both my time and money. I needed a thesaurus, a dictionary, and a bottle of aspirin to complete this book (which I did.)I was highly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Rush's Mating was an interesting story and a captivating look into a society that I know little about. At times it dragged, but the exotic setting and progression of the love affair helped move the plot along. A word of warning to prospective readers: a cursory knowledge of French is required to to undrestand parts of the book, the very end in particular. Otherwise, I recommend as a good but heavier read."},{"rating":"1","title":"look behind the \\"Five star\\" reviews","review":"Of the 35 readers who gave this book a five star review, 18 have never reviewed any other book; 5 have reviewed only one other book; two have reviewed only two other books (and in both those cases one of the other books was by an author who was one of the blurb-writers for \\"Mating\\"). What does, or should, this tell you? We all know, or should know, that Amazon's reader reviews are highly subject to manipulation, including \\"manufactured\\" reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"A woman at Powell's Bookstore in Portland (OR) recommended this book. I have had it in my stack of \\"to read\\" books for about 6 years and finally, I picked it up. I wont bore you with many details, I am not one of those intellectuals who write reviews on Amazon or elsewhere. I am, a lover of books, of good stories. This book is awful, worse than awful! Who in their right minds honored this book with the \\"National Book Award\\"???? Are they nuts?"},{"rating":"2","title":"a love affair with language","review":"My second reading of Mating left me exhilarated, much like the first. This remains one of my favorite books of all time. One of the reasons is the author's love of language: not only does he know how to capture nuances in feeling and intellectual discourse; he knows that language is what distinguishes human from animal mating. The author loves to make up word endings, or new usages, and this is as thrilling as any other discovery, and this book is full of them, including the reader's realization that the author's abandoned thesis is re-written as nothing less than a study of Denoon, or the intellectuall male as viewed by the equally intellectually precocious female anthropologist. Margaret Mead meets Margaret Atwood. After a while, i just put away the dictionary and plunged on. The book is rewarding. I recommend it, with the caveat that parts of the journey are difficult, but ultimately well worth taking. Pourquoi pas?"},{"rating":"1","title":"pompous garbage","review":"\\"Mating\\" just may be the most nauseatingly pretentious book of the 20th century. There is an important difference between being articulate and being bombastic, and Rush painfully demonstrates to his readers that he has utterly no appreciation for this difference. The main characters are whiny, and perhaps like Rush himself, so consumed by their intellectual narcissism that they become increasingly annoying and dislikeable as this interminable book progresses. Rush does show glimpses of being a writer with sensitivity and talent in certain passages of the book; however, these strengths are unfortunately burried under a barrage of needlessly recondite ramblings, undue length, and smug pseudo-intellectualism."},{"rating":"1","title":"literary masturbation","review":"I picked up a copy of this pretentious garbage at a library used book sale. I paid one american buck for it, which was about 100 cents too much.It's obvious from the start that Rush is extremely impressed with his massive vocabulary. Probably giggled himself to sleep each night after he finished his writings, imagining all the ignorant folks who would need the same dictionary he used to write it, in order to decipher his blather.I would recommend any of John Steinbeck's novels to any human who plowed his or her way through this dire drivel, simply to clean their mental palate.Dumpster fodder."},{"rating":"1","title":"How & why did this win the National Book Award","review":"It got so boring by the second half of the book that I had to skim the first line of each paragraph to get through it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The extensive work of the university","review":"The \\"Work of the University\\" is extensive, as this collection of speeches by the president of a great univeristy demonstrates. Dr. Levin recognizes the job of our institutions of higher learning to help fuel our economy and hatch ideas that make a difference in a global society. At its core, however, schools are still about teaching, and I especially enjoyed the speeches to students and graduates.

Trade paperbacks with original material should represent a milestone in the characters life but Marz manages to maintain the ho hum status quo that he had established in the abysmal Emerald Twilight story arc. The art is okay...I guess. My only real complaint with it is that the artist made Carol Ferris look about as appealing as the Elephant Man. In my opinion, save up a little extra money and get the Green Lantern Archives v. 1 or 2, the golden age GL archives, or the Green Lantern/Green Arrow Hardcover. They are all quality reads and definitely worthy additions to the library of any GL fan...unlike Fear Itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Green Lantern I've Read","review":"I hate to negatively review something and don't often but I really have to say this is just bad.Reading it I got the impression that artist Brad Parker painted a bunch of pictures then asked Ron Marz to write a story to tie them together. The idea being three generations of Green Lanterns sharing a common enemy over half a century of time.A good idea maybe but the script seemed completely phoned in. The painting (which is certainly the main attraction here) looks like it took a lot of talent and time but isn't fun or interesting to me. It kind of reminds me of some lame high school textbook painting in health class or something. I had the feeling that book would end with a \\"say NO to drugs\\" warning.I keep almost everything but this one's going on ebay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!","review":"Wow! This book is bad! I bought it because I'm a huge Hal Jordan/Green Lantern fan and I keep an open mind for all interpretations of his story. Unfortunately, the artwork on this project is so muddy and dark that it's nearly incomprehensible. Had I not seen this type of \\"let's be artsy\\" approach before, I would have assumed my copy was messed up by the printer and asked for a new copy.If (like me) you think Hal Jordan's best work resulted from the Denny O'Neil/Neal Adams pairing in 1970-'71, be aware that \\"Fear Itself\\" is 180 degrees different in every way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of time","review":"The art almost looks like computer generated that is painted over, it has an amazing level of detail, but then it is kind of \\"smudged\\" or something. The storey is AWFUL. It is boring, the resolution is lame, the characters are thin, and the book is way to short. $20 is WAY to much to spend for this, I probalby wouldn't even spend $5 for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"The art work on this book is absolutely brilliant. If you thought that a good job had been done with the art of Kingdome Come, think again. Fear Itself wins all awards in that department hands down. However, some fans may find it difficult to get used to, oweing to the drastic change from your conventional, run-of-the-mill cartoon-type art.As for the story, it is one of the best in terms of binding the different generations of Green Lanterns together. I particularly enjoyed Hal Jordan's part of the book, as I did Kyle Rayner's ever witty one liners.The book, however, is lacking in terms of devoting sufficient material to the characters' personalities, and concentrates more on the battle scenes.Nevertheless, it is a great read, and as I said before, the artwork more than makes up for any flaws in the storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"A life changer","review":"I wish this book wasn't so expensive.

The fat % was very close to the number from my fitness trainer. As it has aged, it seemed to be sticking on a number until I'd lost over a lb, then it would change. I needed a second scale and purchased the Omron HBF-500. When I stepped on that scale 5x in a row, all 5 weights and fat % were different. Not only was it not consistent, but the fat % was 5% higher than the one from my trainer. It made me appreciate how well done the Homedics is and forgive it for the 'sticking'.

There is no text, except for a one-page introduction, and another one-page tribute to George Freeth. Comments that accompany each photo are superficial, repetetive, and often just plain dorky. After 35 years of surfing California myself, and reading all the magazines, books, etc. over those years, this was a big letdown.

She performed with a painful intensity. I actually found myself feeling uncomfortable about how much she was willing to reveal of herself through performance. She is the best singer I have seen, the real deal. I can't believe that she has not become as well known as a Diana Krall - maybe if she was white and blonde?I bought the album at the concert and was blown away. Great covers of some not so well known songs and beatiful moving compositions of her own. Singers as accomplished as Carmen don't usually marry this talent with the ability to compose.The sound quality on the CD is top notch.If you are feeling flush, take the plunge and pay the outrageous price - unforunately I don't see many people rushing to sell a CD this good."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Wonderful Surprise !!","review":"Just Listen to Track N5 (FORGIVE ME).Everything on this Album is very good,the quality of Sound almost became a trademark from JVC Label.All Songs have good lyrics, arrangement, and are well produced.

Unbeknownst to them, the boy has brought home the wrong snake from the pet shop. Instead of a harmless serpent, he's now in possession of a black mamba, the deadliest, most aggressive snake in the world! This is bad news, as it quickly escapes it's box and bites the maid (an accomplice) in the face. She dies in minutes, leaving the two would-be kidnappers, the kid, and his grandfather trapped in the house with their scaly friend (they can't go outside, since Reed's character shot a cop on the front stoop).

In fact, I'd think people who saw the movie about the same time I did will probably ONLY remember those scenes, really. Plus, as a bonus, the snake used in the movie is an actual Black Mamba snake, not some cheesy special effects knockoff. If you are afraid of snakes, this won't be the movie for you, as at least one death in the movie will almost certainly give you nightmares.This skilfully made thriller also has a top notch cast including Klaus Kinski, Oliver Reed, Sarah Miles, Nicol Williamson, Susan George and Michael Gough. Plus a REAL Black Mamba as..., well, the scary Black Mamba. (I gave this movie an extra star for the use of the Black Mamba in a starring role.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Cast Wasted","review":"Oliver Reed and his gang plan on kidnapping a rich kid. They screw things up and wind up having to take him hostage while the townhouse is surrounded by police. The kid has a pet poisonous snake which gets loose, but it is such a minor part of the story I think the title perhaps refers more to the bad temper of the guy Reed plays (or else some producer forced it upon the film).There is no suspense, barely any action, and no humour (intentional or otherwise). Mainly, characters argue with each other a lot and often stumble around since they keep all the lights off to evade being seen by the police."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book is a decent read","review":"I had problems sleeping, but here in a colorful package is the solution to all my sleep needs.

This opera is a hilarious love comedy. The melodic inspiration is on the highest level. (I'm reminded most of Weber. rather than the Italians with their florid and pretty but rather artificial and trite diatonic tunes.) The melodic and harmonic inventiveness is on the highest level. It's a tragedy that this opera is not more well known. Several years ago Sarasota (FL) Opera did his \\"Halka\\"...I wish they'd do THIS one.

It makes great espresso if you do not let the water run to long, i.e less water stronger espresso. The person who returned his PA-1600 because he could not get the water to come out needed to know that you must let the pump run a very long time to prime it and it helps to open and close the steamer a couple of times.

The book is divided into four parts, with the first part explaining the basics of how an economy works. Part II delves into how economic progress happens, and how the government can work to further it. Part III focuses primarily on the how the US Government is interacting with the economy for good and for ill (more of the later, than the former, sadly). And finally, Part IV brings the subject of economics down to personal finance, giving good advice on how you can further your own economic progress.Overall, I found this to be a great book. The authors did a great job of explaining how economics works and how it malfunctions, using simple language and simple analogies to make complex subjects quite understandable. If you are not knowledgeable about economics, but you would like to be, then this is a very good book to begin with.

Okoshi heads a tight quintet consisting of himself on trumpet plus Mike Stern on electric guitar, Gil Goldstein on piano, Dave Holland on bass, and my main man Jack DeJohnette on drums. This group is capable of playing at high energy levels without ever sounding frazzled, and the music is a real bop romp, mixing a few standards (\\"On Green Dolphin Street,\\" \\"Yesterdays,\\" \\"My Old Kentucky Home\\") with a cover of a Japanese song (\\"Yuki No Furu Machi O\\") plus some Okoshi originals.

The cuts are way over-produced. He's swamped by the sidemen. Usually you have to strain to hear the piano, and even that is pretty weak, knowing what the man could do.

I also really enjoyed \\"Crossfire\\". But this book I almost didn't finish at all. The characters in the previous two books were solidly drawn and acted with intelligent and interesting motivations. Here, they seem almost random. The plot is strung together from coincidences and blatant contrivances. Like reviewer Sparks, I too became convinced that the author had no idea what this book was supposed to be about. Furthermore, it seemed to me that key background information about the story was repeated almost verbatim every few chapters, making the author look like a student trying to hit a page count. This is a bad book and wholly unworthy of a writer of Kress's obvious talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a satisfying finish to the trilogy","review":"While I thoroughly enjoyed the previous two books in this trilogy, I feel that the third volume falls somewhat flat. Kress alternates between two main storylines (one following Amanda Capelo, and the other following Lyle Kaufman) both of which are at best reactionary and at worst aimless. The absurdity of the plot devices in the Amanda storyline are only outdone by the impossibility of the plot devices in the Kaufman storyline. Motivations for the characters are often unclear.Halfway through the book, I was convinced that even the author had no idea where it was going. Somewhat late in the game (about page 200) the book does find its pacing and races to finish things off, but I found the conclusion unsatisfying.I would only recommend this book to fans of the first two books who are obsessive compulsive completists. Casual fans would be better off reading Kress' short fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasing conclusion to the trilogy","review":"I was sorry to see it end, and wish Ms. Kress would write another so we know what happens to our favorite couple on Mars, not to mention the famous physicist learning to cope with a headstrong fourteen-year-old daughter.The action really got intense there near the end, and was very imaginatively done. I was worried about that beforehand after encountering some of the padding and the verbatim paragraphs of science explanation from the previous books. A few typos, an incorrect attribution. Don't these things get any proofreading when they're popular? I guess not.Still a good read and I'd do it again. And probably (!) will with another Kress epic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this book?","review":"Probability Space is a very disapponting conclusion to the probability Trilogy. The two first installments definitely had their moments even though they were not up to the best of Nacy Kress' contributions, but this book reads as if it was written be a completely different author. Half of the book is a silly juvenile which could have been skipped completely and the second half doesn't answer most of the interesting questions raised in the first two books. When we leave the book we know next to nothing about those who created the space tunnels. We know next to nothing about the Fallers, and we know nothing about the new society developing on World and about those who remained there.So who wrote this book? I guess it could be Charles Sheffield stepping in to help his wife (the writing style and the two-dimensional charachterization of persons in Probability Space matches his writing to some extent) or it could be somebody else. But it definitely was not Nancy Kress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Channeled material from F.W.H. Myers","review":"Classicist and scientific investigator of psychic phenomena, Professor Myers was one founders of the British Society for Psychical Research. His *magnum opus* (while still alive) was a massive book called *Human Personality and It's Survival of Bodily Death* Myers is credited by many with anticipating the work of both Freud and Jung in his analyses of the human psyche. Geraldine Cummins was a British lady of some social standing but who was not particularly well educated & who supposedly would have lacked the detailed & deep knowledge of philosophy and the Greek classics exhibited in this channeled material. The work purports to give a detailed account of the *Other Side* I found it plausible, possibly even evidentiary, but not conclusive proof. But that is the maximum I would say about any work such as this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dull diatribe on something that never happened","review":"The author writes with a 20-20 hindsight that doesn't even begin to try to understand the bomb, the Cold War, or the nature of those times.

To think that someone in the Cold War era might think it was just fine to detonate nuclear devices near an ancient community--in my backyard--baffled me.But then, I missed such days. This book therefore was an excellent insight to the diminsions of the Cold War that would consider such explosions. The author ovbiously spent years researching the project, the people and the purpose; his work speaks well for Alaskan Intellect. But beyond that, the story is facinating and the reader is drawn in. (However, it does miss that fifth star because it drags around page 60...enough that I put it down for two months.)My next stop after this book was the Bikini Atoll and Marshall Islands, as THE FIRECRACKER BOYS absolutely peaked my interst in Cold War nuclear testing.

I was fortunate enough to be in acreative writing class where selections from Siegel's bookwere read. It had us all laughing hysterically. I was theneven more fortunate to attend a stodgy coffee hour at whichSiegel himself read poems that even the most serious readercouldn't stop and subject to close scrutiny withoutlaughing.

He has a very typical voice, which changes nicely with his volume.It's on def jux, but it does not have the typical def jux feel from the cold vein or fantastic damage. There are no el-p beats. The production is handled by some other less-known cats. I believe some of the beats are quite weak and not what a top class emcee like c rayz deserves. This is mainly because of the clean drumsounds... There are enough standout tracks.The first song has a horrible beat. The second song, the essence, is the real opener. It has a laidback thumping beat. Guns And Butter is a nice banging beat, slightly unoriginal.Protect My Family sounds like [stuff] to me, but that's just taste.Thug Melody is a really cool track. Heavy as hell.The best production is from Belief.Over the entire album C Rayz compells with wicked metaphoars (down to earth like a meteorite) and crazy flows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mysery Stories","review":"Was excited about the title and thought my 8-year old grandson would enjoy it.

Well, because he controlled access to Nixon and carried out all his negative decisions. He was also the one who demonstrated the greatest loyalty to NIxon as well. What you get in this memoir is recounting of devoting their career to the service of another individual and what happens when that loyalty is not repaid by that person whom they devoted their future too. He explains why he did what he did, and why he thought his actions were justified. Primarily, he thought that his boss had all the answers, and as a result, was doing the country's bidding by doing his boss's bidding. Thus, you see he was a deeply misguided patriot.

It really makes it clear how myopic some ideas of \\"progress\\" can be. Technology is a great tool, but too much investment in an abstract system can cast aside the real people who the system is supposed to serve anyway. For example, he uses an example of the computerization of social work to show how the REAL purpose is lost in the system. People can more accurately accustom themselves with the real, tangible world by interacting with it than if they interacted with a simulation.

However, within the first few pages, my excitement gave way to disappointment. Mr. Kurth clearly does not view the Romanovs in high regard and makes that clear throughout the book. In addition, the photographs are all well known, nothing rare. I was quite annoyed to have to read a chapter regarding ms. Anderson's story. Apparently Mr. Kurth didn't think his previous work, which dealt entirely with Anna Anderson, was sufficient. He insists, yet again, that this mentally ill imposter is indeed the slain Grand Duchess. He also makes it clear that dislikes the empress, Alexandra, in particular. As a supporter of Alexandra, I found his statements abut her to be harsh and a bit offensive.

The \\"borderless prints\\" were rarely aligned correctly. There is no visual print preview which was very aggravating because I had no control over cropping. The printer cropped at will. I wasted alot of ink, paper and time trying to get the printer to print the way I wanted it to. The software is very poor and so are the guides and documentation. I was very relieved to return this printer. The high quality black and white prints are just not worth the aggravation.

The largest borderless print media is 8 by 10, and no one makes that in two sided print surfaces. I returned the Epson and got the HP. What a relief, it does exactly what I want and is not finicky, lots of options for acceptable paper. I did have some trouble installing software however. I had to shut down and remove all other USB devices and then load the printer before it would install properly. Otherwise 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible printer","review":"I cannot find anything good to report about this printer, except that it was easy to set up. All of the moving parts just feel cheap and junky, like they are ready to break at any moment. The print cartridges jam about 50% of the time.

No thanks, no mas, I am returning this clunker back."},{"rating":"1","title":"The decline of HP","review":"Having owned several HP printers over many years, I have noticed a steady and unforgivable decline in the quality of this company's printers with each successive model. The final straw for me is the 7960, by far the worst HP printer I have owned. While producing acceptable prints under most conditions, this printer's liabilities far outweigh its benefits. The workmanship of the unit itself is the flimsiest and most disappointing I have encountered. And the printer's lack of consistent compatibility with the two separate computers I have used it with is both annoying and inexcusable for a supposedly renowned printer company. Bad drivers have caused numerous problems and the driver updates usually make the situation only marginally better. Plus the printer's general overuse of ink and poor paper and envelope handling make the overall experience of owning one distinctly unappealing. This is my last HP printer - I'll be switching to Epson."},{"rating":"2","title":"HP Photosmart 7960 Printer and Outstanding Customer Service","review":"I must say that this is one of the best amazon transactions I have ever done--it has been outstanding all the way through.

All the pieces and brochures were included. The new printer is really outstanding and I am so happy with the quality of the pictures.

Thank you for such outstanding service and this great printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing HP - Canon Outperforms.","review":"I seem to be one of the few disappointed by the HP 7960. I found the photo print quality lacked depth. The machine itself felt too light weight, the intertia of the printing caused it to skid across the desk. The machine was prone to paper jamming. After a week, I returned it in favor of a Canon i900D.The Canon machine is much more substantial and gives much warmer pictures. Downsides - LCD isn't as clear as it could be and the machine takes a little longer to set up. Overall though, the Canon is the winner.

I am the opposite of impressed. Even with the $20 for 20 pages of photo paper that HP practically forces you to buy to insure getting the best possible pictures. In fact, I've tried both glossy and matte finish and while the matte is just a little better, it's just not doing it for me. Now, if you're trying to hide blemishes or wrinkles in a photo, then this is the printer for you, because all details are washed out and all of the photos are an odd non-color. Further more, and most disturbing of all, are the black streaks that just appear randomly all over the prints. And when you go to the HP website for a solution, it actually says \\"The issue will not be resolved by servicing the printer\\" and their solution is to buy a better quality of their paper!!

Not enough is known about his upbringing in Barbados, and what specifically compelled him toward the New Thought Movement and away from his New York theatrical career. According to Neville, the ascended master who became his teacher was awaiting him.Any serious student of Manifestation, New Thought, Law of Attraction, etc. should not be without this fine compendium of Neville's words...and should seek further, namely to recordings of Neville's public lectures. His voice delivers his convincing rhetoric and case histories elegantly. Once one hears it, returning to the written words, that voice echoes within, as though Neville himself was speaking aloud again, from each page.Astute learners would do well to have significant grounding in Old and New Testaments and Kabbalah, as did the author, himself. Some of his subtler assumptions bespeak a pedagogy that far outranks his more popular contemporaries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Medal Of Honor entry....","review":"What is the biggest improvement over the other 2 Gamecube MOH games?

This wouldn't be bad if it was only for occasional use, but the punches are not 90 degrees and flush to the brass anvil on mine and therefore it doesn't punch clean holes, you have to clean out the scrap with a knife.

After the first song, Obsession, I about drove into the side of a McDonalds just to make my CD player stop working. He should have just titled the song, \\"I'm going to whine like a little baby, how much can you take?\\". It makes the whining Boyz II Men did on \\"I'll make love to you\\" look like a mild temper tantrum compared to this onslaught of bawling.Also, you'd better be Secada if you're going to try to pull off the sing in two languages thing. Secada can do it, this clown can't. If I were a chick, first of all I'd be totally hot. Second, if some latin guy came up whining at this level, I'd slap him and tell him to grow a set. Nothing is more pathetic than a guy who cries like a toddler. Frankie needs to be put in timeout and given a wiggles video to watch until he's ready to be a big boy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Obsession (No Es Amor) - I LOVE THIS SONG","review":"There is a Latin radio station in our area and even before I copmpletely understood the lyrics (my Spanish is very shaky) I loved this tune. When I heard it on mainstream radio in English I was screamingly happy.It's addictive, with the staccato rhythm of the verses going into the long, smooth notes of the girl singing the chorus. In the English verion, the hip hop part throws it off for me. It's like they threw in everything but the kitchen sink but it's enjoyable even for all that, from beginning to end.I'm definitely going to pick up the CD now that I FINALLY know who this is."},{"rating":"1","title":"'What's A Man To Do?' was much better","review":"I loved his 2003 CD, 'What's a Man to Do?' The man has a wonderful voice. In my opinion, he's the Latin Usher. But with this current CD, it seems he's trying too hard to come across as hip hop. Too many hip hop flavored songs. His strength is his voice so he should stick to singing R & B and slow jams. I can only count 4 songs that truly met that criteria on the CD. And what's up with the 4 bonus tracks? I didn't like the fact that only 10 songs were actually new. Then 2 of the bonus tracks were 'Obsession' as a Reggaeton mix (which I liked) and a Spanish Version. Then 'Don't Wanna Try' is there, for some reason. We know that was your most successful track Frankie but come on. It's like he put it there for those that didn't remember or something. And 'Suga Suga' is not even his song. It's Baby Bash's song, Frankie just sings the hook.Bottom line: not all that impressed with the CD. There were some good songs but his 2003 CD was MUCH better."},{"rating":"1","title":"'The One' CD You Should Skip At All Costs","review":"Amazon.com's editorial described Frankie J's album as suitable for \\"long, late, and lonely nights.\\" I don't think so. Anyone with any real taste in music knows that on a \\"long, late, and lonely night\\" you listen to some Sade or Al Green! Anyway, I couldn't get into this album because it's totally boring. I'll tell you one thing: Frankie J is definetly obsessed with Jon Secada and Usher especially. Sorry, Frankie J! But combining the singing styles of two different artists doesn't make you original! \\"How To Deal\\" sounds way to much like Usher's \\"Let It Burn!\\" I mean, golly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Muy bueno!!!!","review":"I had to pick this album up number one cuz I like What's a Man To Do and number two cuz I can't get enough of the single Obsession(No Es Amor) and I was not disappointed.

You needn't be a history buff to be moved by this compelling novel. Marshall Ney had to be the \\"Bravest of the Brave\\", both in battle and in political suvival skills.

The story is an entertaining blend of fantasy and humor, and is well enhanced by Jill Pinkwater's cartoony illustrations.This book tells the story of Norman Gnormal, a boy whose parents have raised him as if he were a puppy. A kid who doesn't quite fit in with the average crowd, Norman finds a fairly supportive peer group in an after-school club for students who hapen to be werewolves. The club members go on a mission to help their faculty advisor, Mr. Talbot, with a dilemma invoving the magical relic of the book's title.This book reminded me a little of the film \\"The Little Vampire,\\" but is sillier (and hairier). The text opens with a spoofy werewolf Q&A, and incorporates some clever references to werewolf films and lore.

But as anyone who has finished it will tell you, it's well worth it (and more). When deciding which translation to opt for, do yourself a favor and get the Maude translation (Norton), edited by Gibian. Only in this edition will you find the interesting and invaluable scholarship Aylmer Maude so painstakingly assembled.If you are poised to read \\"War and Peace\\" for the first time, the last thing you need is a wordy review by some git on amazon.com, so I'll exercise modest brevity. There's no need to mention the love triangles, mystical persuasions or the finely wrought battle scenes, all of which are so prominent in \\"War and Peace.\\" This book is, simply, life. Like the course of time, chugging it's way ad infinitum, the truths, ideas and emotions in this monumental work are universal; like earth, fire and water, Tolstoy is elemental!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Briggs translation","review":"This is a review of the Kindle edition, not the novel itself. The Amazon page indicates it is the newer Briggs translation. Actually it is the Maude translation from 1920. The Maude translation however is very good and would make this well worth downloading except for one unfortunate thing: the notes have not been hypertexted.

Plenty of grip, but the arch support feels like less than others. Great all-around shoe!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for kids of all ages","review":"What a pleasant surprise! Not only was the book loaded with action, suspense and humor, but it's (don't tell the kids) educational too. The story follows a modern teenage boy as he's forced to retrace Perseus' perilous quest to rid the ancient world of the evil Medusa, and in doing so, he confronts a few demons of his own. The authors have effectively worked Greek mythology into a fun and rollicking story that kids and adults alike will find interesting and relevant, and they did a beautiful job transposing the teenaged protagonist's modern world with his adventures in ancient Greece. The human characters are well fleshed out, and the gods are all appropriately larger than life and amusingly flawed. Great action pieces that lead up to an explosive finale, and no less than the fate of the world hangs in the balance on every page. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Informative","review":"I purchased this book to help me with my senior thesis in college and what a wealth of information it is.

(or does he?)I feel like a hard hearted wench, but the hardships he endures after the age of 10 are not only deserved they are well earned.And any clever insights gained in the end bring little comfort for having read an excess of 500 pages.Dickens however does great justice to the characters the voices and the personalities of the far ranging characters he invents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor print quality for the price","review":"For the price of the Everyman edition, one would expect the pages to be cleanly printed.

From the beginning of the book, I was swept up in the ever changing lives of the central characters. I can understand why people waited anxiously for the next chapter when this book was released serially back in 1849 & 1850! There are many dramatic buildups and twists and turns that keep you turning the pages and wondering how it will all turn out.In this remarkabe novel, Dickens created an incredible cast of characters and painted a vivid portrait of 19th-century England. The characters are complex and interesting, and I found it satisfying that the characters who are courageous enough to choose love over pride are ultimately rewarded.If you are going to only read one book by Dickens, this is the one to choose. It is very interesting, memorable, and well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"David Copperfield is worth reading and re-reading.

I've read it many times and agree with Anne Bernays that it is perhaps the greatest novel ever written. It ranks with Dostoevsky's THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV, Joseph Heller's CATCH-22, and Cervantes' DON QUIXOTE: quirky, sprawling, loaded with wisdom and sensitivity and keys to reality and the human condition itself. One must experience the novel in its totality, savoring its sweep and depth and scintillating characters. I admittedly loathe Dora and David's marriage to her, yet I know the center portion of the book is a necessary link to the stunning beginning and ending. I love the line, \\"Only my hair looked drunk.\\" I love the chapter \\"Tempest.\\" If I had but three books with which to be marooned, this would be one: it would keep the memory of what it is to be human alive and flourishing.

Copperfield's and Dickens' childhoods were classically the same and many critics believe that David Copperfield was actually a Charles Dickens autobiography. He modeled many of the characters in this novel after people he knew; for instance, Micawber was modeled after Dickens' own father who was sent to debtors prison. However, Micawber becomes a humorous, amiable character who was quite different from Dickens' own father. This book is definitely of 5 star quality and I will teach it in my College English classes when I begin teaching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Victorian Trash","review":"A potentially exciting tale of a young mans trials through life, which is ruined by oversentimentality. I found the characters very thin, and lacking in comic relief- with the notable exception of Betsey Trotwood and Uriah Heep. The plot itself is unimaginative with a very predictable ending. As a female reader, one of my dislikes of this book is the unmemorable female characters, who are either weak or full of undying patience and gratitude. If you are looking for a book to put you to sleep at bedtime - this one's for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"David copper field","review":"This is a very boring story. Pale. Nonsense.

Also i have to do a lot of school work with this book and don't like that! but other wise the book was okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious!","review":"Here's the deal: you have to wade through many, many pages to find a good scene that is involving and then the book dies again. fast forward to another 20-30 pages to find something else interesting. Lots of detail and description-more than I ever needed. Call me a vulgarian, but the damn movies of this book condensed it into something endurable and mildly entertaining. The novel is seemingly endless-so much so that I wondered why I was suspending my much more interesting life with all of its mundaneness to read David. In the end, David won but Dickens will not win again. An author needs to write more engagingly in order to expect readers to stop and put their life on hold and pick up a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I agree!","review":"I just want to add my voice to the other 5-star reviews. I would say that David Copperfield is one of the three best novels of the 19th Century (the others being Moby-Dick and The Brothers Karamazov). It has one of the most memorable collection of characters and situations between Don Quixote and Ulysses. Even though neither of us has read the book in over 30 years, my wife and I often refer to it--to things like Littimer's imagined \\"But you are very young, sir,\\" or the coachman warning young David about \\"the school near London,\\" or the menacing sound of \\"Brooks of Sheffield,\\" a character who is only a stock phrase, but a Murdstone stock phrase. The one thing I do not agree with in the reviews here is the idea that one should read Great Expectations before reading this. Although David Copperfield is twice the length, it is nonetheless the easier and more immediately engaging of the two masterpieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dickens tells it like it was/","review":"It is hard to choose a favorite Dickens' book as they are all so good. David Copperfield is, however, one of my favorites--along with Tale of Two Cities and Great Expectations. The first time I read it, I didn't want it to end. It is more autobiographical than the others. If you have not read these, get them from Amazon. They have good taste in books. Anne Gillespie"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read in first person narrative!","review":"David Copperfield is one of my favorite first person narratives. This is especially interesting because it progresses from a child all that way into adulthood.However, the entire progression is interesting and believable - whether you are an adult or a child.The themes are complex and it was tragic to see Lil Em'ly ruined by a cad and scondrel. But, like a lot of Dickens books all the stories threads are nicely bundled and even Lil Em'ly is restored to a new life. I love classics and this book is definitely one of them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The broad sweep of life","review":"This picaresque novel highlights themes of social justice which illuminate most of Dickens' fiction while drawing a host of unforgettable characters both appealing and loathsome. The title character, thought to represent quite closely the author, embodies likable qualities of morality, industry and human caring. I loved the depiction of David's aunt whose lightning wit and loyalty made up for her eccentricities. Rosa Dartle's portrait is magnificent, a work of astonishing virtuosity in the use of dialogue to depict clearly an unsympathetic character. Mr. Macawber and Uriah Heep are also characters drawn with most particular unique qualities of speech and body language. These are but a few of the fascinating people one encounters. The novel is a tour de force."},{"rating":"2","title":"An epic of human experiences","review":"I read this book about two years ago,when i was 14.I found it absolutely spell-binding and marvellous.i literally wept when david left the house of steerforth and spoke:\\"god forgive thee for extending the passive hand of friendship\\"becuase i myself have experienced a similar incident in my life.similarly,i cant help but awe at dickens' way of describing the progress of his life from a pampered son to an ill-used boy at the school to the intimate friend of mr micawber and tommy traddles to the caring husband of agnes.i strongly recommend this book for the readers"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dickens at his best...","review":"Dickens referred to this book as his favorite and this is not surprising. It does contain more than the usual autobiographical details than probably any other book. However, this is the book in which Dickens reached the height of his powers as an imaginative artist. It is in some ways the fulfillment of a promise made in his earlier works of fiction.The story of David Copperfield is familiar, the orphan boy who escapes hard times with a cruel stepfather to a more secure homelife with an eccentric aunt and then makes his way in world amid humor and tragedy. While the story is one of the best in the Dickens cannon, it is the characters that stand out as some of the best approximations of humanity ever put on papper. Mr. Murdstone, Mr. Macawber, Aunt Betsy Trotwood, Barcus, Uriah Heap, and Lit'le Emily are all mouments to the art of the novel and a testament to the greatness of Dickens."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!","review":"I was forced to read this book my freshman year of high school.

I've read four of his books, Hard Times, David Copperfield, a tale of two cities, and Oliver Twist and out of all these great books {all of them some of my top 10 at least} David Copperfield was the best. I had just finished reading A Tale Of Two Cities and thought that nothing could beat this book then I read David Copperfield and immedietly loved it.In the book David goes through all kinds of periods. He goes from being poor,to happy,to sad,to being in love,to having friends, to having no friends at all. The books makes you cry at the begining because it is sad and it makes you cry at you feel very happy for him.The also has some of the worlds best characters like Uriah Heep,Dora,David,the peggotyes, mr.Micawber,and many more.If you are a literature fan this is a must read.

I put the old battery back in and still won't come on. It seems to be completely dead.

I've owned other scales, so I know that foot placement, surface, and movement, is important. Nothing helped. So aside from from a different weight everytime, now its decided to start displaying the too much weight for scale \\"EE\\" reading every time I step on it. I weight 230lbs, and the limit is 400lbs.

He identifies the 10 most common fatal mistakes salespeople make every day in every business. These oft-overlooked errors in approach and strategy can chase away sales and, in the worst cases, destroy careers. Duncan explains how common blunders such as asking for the sale before establishing a connection (\\"begging\\") or failing to ask questions to ascertain your client's needs (\\"arguing\\") often kill the sale. If you've read even a few books about sales techniques in the last decade, you are familiar with much of what Duncan preaches. In fact, he has addressed the topic in other ways in his previous books, but his sales advice is solid. We believe it will be helpful to the sales neophyte, and can serve as a handy refresher for experienced salespeople."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Definative Guide To Lead Guitar","review":"For a long time I was struggling with teaching myself the guitar.

Both Aja and Gaucho have excellent studio production and should be studied by audio engineers (I know I test out stereos using Steely Dan albums). But the perfectionism that makes Aja so vibrant makes Gaucho seem lifeless by comparison. There are exceptions, I found Time Out of Mind and Hey Nineteen to be as good as anything on Aja. But ultimately they are just that, exceptions to the normally bland material. The only reason I bought this album was to complete my Steely Dan collection; and the only other reason to buy it, Hey Nineteen, is on Classic Rock radio enough that you don't have to spend the money to buy the rest of the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Making sure they wouldn't be missed","review":"Anyone who objects to describing this mess as elevator muzak has no defense - the sad fact is that Gaucho is playing in elevators and restrooms around the world at this very moment!Where to begin? The backup singing is absolutely atrocious, the piano tinkling so lame you find yourself swallowing hard to keep from vomiting, and the list goes on and on. Mark Knopfler was apparently in the studio for one song but the only evidence of it is the song credits. To top it off, this CD finally concludes the series of new liner notes by Becker and Fagen written for the re-mastered discs. Following the trend from the previous CDs, these notes are pretentious, uninformative, and too cute by several orders of magnitude.Thanks to Aja and Gaucho, few in the late 80's or 90's bothered to wonder where Steely Dan had disappeared to - the concensus was that if this was all they had to offer then thanks for the first five albums and so long - it's been good to know ya."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going Down?","review":"This is the worst Steely Dan Album.

If you have DVD Audio capability, pony up and order, now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tribute towards an end of an era in American music:","review":"The sardonic brain trust that comprised Steely Dan in this outing, explore with delicious irony and wit various ills and taboo associated with American societal organisation; moreover, in the decade that followed the one undeniable theme that comes from this album and its predecessor (Aja) is that despite the inevitable innovation, production advances and marketing associated with the music industry, that those lyrics and music, which will stand the test of time comes from both individual musician and songwriters whose passion is to tell us a story or to evoke through music both pleasure and pain that has been either masked or embellished. Something the popular music failed to accomplish in the eighties, thanks goodness these musician and lyricist saw fit to utilise, jazz, pop rock and words to suggest to the next generation of musician and songwriters that it is indeed about the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who is the gaucho amigo?","review":"Danfans rejoice!! The remastered version of Steely Dan's final album for MCA has finally been released, more than a year after the reissue of \\"Aja\\". In the liner notes Becker and Fagen make light of the lengthy delay of this re-release. From the accidental erasing of one of the songs slated for the album(The Second Arrangement) to Walter Becker being hit by a car, and the two plus years spent in the studio making this record, this obviously was a trying time for Messrs. Becker and Fagen, but the strain doesn't show. For years \\"Gaucho\\" has been unfairly compared to their previous album(which is a masterpiece, but we don't need to get into that now), this album is just as strong and stands very well on its own. Great songs like \\"Babylon Sisters\\", \\"Time Out Of Mind\\", and \\"Hey Nineteen\\" are classics that have held up well and will sound great years beyond now.

Gaucho follows the pop-jazz path of their previous release Aja. The album has all the Steely Dan trademarks: impeccable production, cynical and venomous lyrics and undeniably catchy songs. \\"Babylon Sisters\\" opens the album with silky aplomb and then it moves into maybe the best Steely Dan song, the incredible \\"Hey Nineteen\\". The title track is an underrated song that doesn't get enough play and the album closes out with the crisp \\"Third World Man\\". Gaucho often gets lost in the shuffle as it followed Aja, but it is every bit a good as that album and ranks right up there with anything this great band has released."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd.","review":"the sound is spectacular,just a minor flaw in one of the songs.But over all the cd is pretty damn good"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't go wrong!","review":"One of the best bands - one of their best albums.

Its sad because this is one the greatest albums ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey Nineteen, that's about it","review":"\\"Hey Ninteen\\" is a great track, and \\"Babylon Sisters\\" rocks, but the whole thing sounds like the Dan on auto-pilot and, though it is a bit tiresome to judge records this way, doesn't come close to mid-70's classics like Countdown to Ecstasy and Katy Leid. The middle sction drags, and its a chore to listen straight through, even though the album only runs to 38 mintes. Still, \\"Hey Nineteen\\" is one killer tune. \\"The Cuervo Gold/ The fine columbian/ Make tonight a wonderful thing.\\" Indeed, but read between the lines and this is as unsettling a song as the band ever wrote. It belongs elsewhere, apart from the remainder of an insipid record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Production! Bland Material!","review":"This album finds the dynamic duo of Becker and Fagen putting out a bad album(gasp)!!!!!!!! Yes it is unfortunately true. This record has immaculate production (like Aja). Gaucho, like Aja, has great wordplay, excellent arrangements, and top notch players, but something is missing! Fagen sings like he's bored and most of the songs go on and on with nothing even remotely memorable in the music. 'Hey nineteen' (one of the Dan's best) is the exception to the rule. But the rest is just plain boring. Oh well, I am willing to forgive Becker and Fagen because they have given us so many other great album's like 'Pretzel Logic', 'Aja', and 'Countdown to Ecstasy'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant album from start to finish...","review":"Just as with Aja before it, an album that I can listen to all the way through, enjoy every track without skipping through any, and never get tired of it.

That is a tough act to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like All Steely Dan Music-High Quality All The Way!","review":"Whereas this record can not comapre to Pretzel Logic or other earlier releases, it is without a doubt worthy of high qualiity status. Again like Aja it is more of a smooth jazzy flavoring and has limited moments of upbeat pizzazz. However, the arrangements and songs were constructed with such fine detail you can not help but admire the beauty of the overall work. The lyrics are just so out of the ordinary.

I bought the robe as a birthday present. My sister did not want it because it was the wrong style and the wrong color. I sent it back, and now I'm only getting $37.00 back when I paid $47.00. Besides I paid $9.00 for shipping when I received it, and $10.00 shipping when I sent it back.What does that mean. It had hardly been taken from the plastic bag because she saw immediately it wasn't what she wanted.How can a company reduce the refund by that much? Altogether it cost me $66.00, and I'm receiving a credit card refund of $37.00.I disgusted and am a lot smarter now.

I liked the book so much that I ordered copies for all my siblings.

This concert came out recently, showcasing a number of hits from her Loose album and some older ones. I brought this concert because of the simple fact that I love the Loose album and wanted to see it come to life in front of my eyes. I was disappointed!!!! Nelly's performance was so boring, I almost had to force myself to keep watching. With songs like \\"Wait for You\\", \\"Afraid\\", \\"Say It Right\\", and \\"Give it to Me\\" being performed, I expected nothing short of an amazing concert. She absolutly murderered her own songs making me hate the live version of them. At times, even the crowd was silent and appeared stunned at what they were looking at. Stick to the CD and do not purchase this DVD, you'll regret it! I've brought some pretty crappy things in my life, but this is by far one of the top of that list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointing","review":"First off I love Nelly Furtado, she is an extremely talented musician and very beautiful. But this DVD was so disappointing. Let's start with how every song is completely different than the studio recordings now in some cases this is a good thing but here it's not. Nelly's performance is so-so but the thing that really ruined it was the band and her dancers. Also you can tell that the song's were doubled-over, meaning that the studio song is playing in the background and they are singing in harmony with them which is lame. So over all: Don't buy this DVD just watch a couple of clips on youtube and see for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME for Nelly fans! Must have!","review":"If ur looking for her to entertain on stage like Pink or Madonna, this isn't it. Nelly don't play dat...

Others are correct that the aspect ratio is not anamorphic and is not good on a widescreen tv, especially with an upconverting dvd player.

Having said that, the book has one slight problem that keeps it from being great. Red rambles occasionly, going off on tangents and later repeating himself, discussing the same event he wrote about several pages earlier. On the much larger up side; the book does more than just chronicle the 1947 baseball season. It is also an interesting biography of Branch Rickey, Larry MacPhail, and Jackie Robinson. Weaving their stories plus historical background of the Dodgers, Yankees, Cardinals and the authors own experiences as an early brodcaster far outweigh any problems in writing style. He also redeems himself in his decsription of the 1947 World Series; as dramatic a reading of baseball events as you could want. Overall---Very Good-just short of Great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jackie Robinson? Wasn't he what happened in 1947?","review":"Red Barber has lot of anecdotes on baseball. A lot. Barber sat on the front row when Jackie Robinson was put forward to be the first black man in baseball by Branch Rickey, he was the Dodgers' broadcaster at the time. He knows a lot. Het lets us know he knows a lot. But Red Barber is not a writer. And no historian, for that matter. It just seems that this book is a transcript of Barber speaking into a recording device. Stories pop up twice, there is no clear line of events and thus, despite Robinson being the greatest, however long overdue thing that happened to baseball, no buildup to this great occasion. Jackie Robinson is just a sideline in this book, that even has Robinson on the cover. A wasted opportunity, I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent keyboard - for mac users and others.","review":"As a programmer, I bought this keyboard to use with a debian linux workstation running on an x86 PC. After remapping caps lock to be an additional control and learning that the alt key is slighty shifted, I am as fast and accurate with this keyboard as any other. The satisfying feel and light contact of the keys lets me type longer, and it is almost the perfect size. Having two USB ports on my desk is also a nice addition.There is at least one \\"dead key\\" issue: I use control-alt-right (which works fine) and control-alt-left (which is dead on this keyboard) to switch desktops, so I had to reconfigure, and the \\"clover\\" keys are not mappable as modifiers - only as individual keys.It would get one more star if there were no keypad, or if the keypad were seperate and I could free up the desk space to get my trackball a little closer to the action."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love This Pan","review":"This is a great pan.

I love the Melvyns, though, so I got this - it completely rocks.It sounds more like Biafra's album than the Melvyns, but the Melvyn's are so muscular (Rutmanis on bass has been and continues to be a huge addition to the band) that they really bring the songs to a very high quality level, and Biafra's vocals are to Punk what Easy E's were to RAP.Great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"hmmmm, well it's been almost 30 years","review":"wow, it's been almost 30 years since fresh fruit, and jello still has it. or is holding on to it. he's still a great lyricist and I respect him a lot.

The honeymoon was over quickly as I pushed the switch (too stiff), experienced the beam (not bright by today's standards, three modes: blue, more blue and yellowish), and the need to cycle through all three modes any time the flashlight is used.On the Palm Blaze 3C you push the switch once for high, again quickly for low, or press and hold until it enters flash mode.

My second favorites are Nelly was a Lady, and Camptown Races. My third favorites are Don't Bet Money on the Shanghai, and Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair. The biggest disappointment for me is Oh! Susanna. Michelle Shocked curiously decides to sing her own melody for the verses and not Foster's own. An odd interpretation given the spirit of the album.

This is the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for toddlers","review":"These are not thick shoes so I wouldn't take my son out in these in really cold weather, but otherwise, we love them. They are soft and flexible in all directions, so you can twist and turn to get them onto wiggly feet. As long as we tighten the tab thing, he can't pull them off but we don't have any trouble. I'm here ordering the next size up b/c he's going to outgrow them soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun times on the water.","review":"These water shoes are great. The construction is good. As a parent I have peace of mind knowing my little one's feet are protectect from hot pool decks or debris at the beach. The rubber soles offer great traction on wet surfaces. Easy on, easy off. They stay on the feet with a simple drawstring. Overall a great buy. This is a product that I will repurchase as my child grows."},{"rating":"2","title":"so good, i bought 3","review":"light and airy but with good soles that do not get shredded if kids walk on pavement or poolside. they cost a bit more but I tired some cheaper ones and the opening was too small for my son's feet and we could not even get them on! I would still prefer if there was a better elastic at the top to stretch more but these work pretty well. My 3 year is picky about how his shoes feel and does not mind these at all. I got our 1st pair last year and got 2 additional sizes this since they were the best we found. His pair from last year I will keep for a siblng or donate- they are in great condition despite a lot of summer wear and swim classes throughout the year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blister-inducer","review":"The water shoes wore blisters on my daughter's heels after the first wear.

These were great - easy to put on and our daughter loved them. However, the adjustable elastic to hold them onto her foot pulled right out after only wearing a short while. Thankfully, we received a replacement but was disappointed with the initial pair breaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Water Shoes","review":"These water shoes run a little large, Our grandson wears a size 8, so these 8-9's are a bit big on him. They go on easily and the drawstring top tightens them up fine. I do wish the botton was just a bit more grippy, but they serve the purspose and protect his feet around the pool. The colors are bright and they are well made enough for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"The sizing chart is wrong","review":"The sizing chart indicated that a size 5 Toddler is 4.75 inches long. However, when I ordered these, the 5T size was longer than 6 inches. I had to return the shoe, because it was too big for my toddler.Do not trust the sizing chart on the shoe. The shoe itself looks nice, but unfortunately, I didnt get to try it out on my child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right Shoe is not properly stitched right.","review":"I bought two different pairs to see if the first one was defective but its the way the shoe is made.

She has enjoyed her \\"beach shoes,\\" finding them very \\"comfy;\\" they are sufficiently tough to withstand salt water, chlorinated pool water, sand, and rocky shores without falling apart.

I think I'm about to list all of the songs. It's a calm soothing album. A very unique artist with a unique sound. It is amazing how she and Cameron Stone play their instruments on this album, making them very versatile. It has an Eastern flavor infused with contemporary sounds with a hint of classic symphony. You must buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Butterflies litter bag","review":"I love the bag it is much more stylish than having a plastic bag in my car to put trash in. The only thing is that it comes with a sticky strip that you can stick it to something or a strap so you can strap it to a seat.

As far as i know it's been out of print forever.... but get them to reprint it, it's worth it. This is a stunning novel, by far Dick's Best..... far better than any of the popular ones (Valis, Do Androids..., A Scanner Darkly,etc.)If you see it, get it......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good early novel","review":"This novel is best enjoyed if you know nothing about it and just read it cold. I was fortunate enough to have done just that, and got a lot more out of it, because the back blurb gives quite a bit of it away.Eye In The Sky is another expedition into PKD's favorite theme: \\"what is reality?\\" As such, the reader spends the first half of the book learning what the \\"game rules\\" are, and once the fun of that has played itself out, the back half is spent trying to figure out who the \\"game master\\" is -- which purposefully shifts several times. Because of this, there are two levels of enjoyment in the book.Normally, I'm a bit wary of PKD's early works, especially his short stories (which were written for pulp magazines with an obvious looming deadline and word limit.) Eye In The Sky surprised me at how well it was written (for someone still early in his career) and I believe it ranks up with the classics of his later days."},{"rating":"1","title":"for me, disappointing","review":"let me preface this by saying that Philip K. Dick is one of my favorite writers. this is the 14th of his books that i've read and it is so far my least favorite. i don't want to spoil anything for anyone who reads the book so i'll merely say that it starts off interestingly enough, but for me it degenerates into what feels like a plodding episode of night gallery. and then it ends with an anti-communist storyline that seems silly to me, speaking from 2005. i've also read most of his non-scifi from this period and would say that i like his 60's work best. happy reading to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fabulous one-sitting read","review":"My favorite PKD book was Time Out of Joint--not any more! This is a tremendous effort and isn't dated in the least. The ideas expressed in here seem to have been written for the US social situation of 1997, not 1957. I think PKD was looking into the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Literature????","review":"I started reading one of these Philip Dick books for a few reasons. First, all of the great reviews. Second, I like the concept of stories based on \\"what if history turned out different\\". It is an interesting speculation. Third, the price was right (i.e. $1). I started reading them and the writing is simply pure garbage. The stories are disjointed and you can't tell where the writer is going for many pages at a time. The characters are ugly and very forgettable. For the life of me I can understand why people love this writer so much. Perhaps they are all on drugs while they are reading this stuff which is apparently, what the author was doing at the time he was writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged CD","review":"I purchased a used music CD proported to be in good condition.

If you like those movies you will like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Largely a disappointment","review":"GHOSTS OF BERLIN is certainly not what I had hoped it would be. It features poor quality paper, rather poorly reproduced photos (one gets the sense it was created on a good personal printer), and captions that, for the most part, are fairly uninformative: I knew what I was looking at, but I am pretty familiar with Berlin's recent history. If you are not, you won't have your world enlightened by the captions. Taken as a whole or in parts, I would never have bought this book if I had know how inadequate it would prove to be. Save your money, seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant and Enjoyable","review":"A lot of jazz recorded in the \`50s and \`60s has been making its way onto CD lately, and this 1962 recording by Coleman Hawkins (tenor sax), Tommy Flanagan (piano), Major Holly, Jr. (bass) and Eddie Locke (drums) of jazz arrangements of show tunes is a typical example. As usual, JVC has done a great job of mastering and a great job of packaging. The music itself is pleasant and enjoyable, if hardly inspiring. The main drawback that I can see with this CD is its length--just over 35 minutes. I suspect, however, that only true-blue Coleman Hawkins fans will be willing to shell out nearly a buck a minute for this recording. If they do, though, they will be well rewarded."},{"rating":"2","title":"The basis for future AI theories?","review":"Have you ever wondered if Artificial Intelligence is possible at all? And if so, can it be achieved by a neat and simple construction, rather than some highly complex system that nobody could understand? This book proposes a theory answering both questions in the affirmative. The idea is easy: use a universal model class, treat observations in a probabilistic (Bayesian) way, and do an optimal far-sighted decision on this basis. In the book, this construction is mathematically elaborated, and many properties are stated and proven, such as asymptotic behavior, optimality, etc. On the other hand, no efficient implementation is possible at this stage, since the system requires infinite computation time.This is the only mathematical definition of universal AI I know of, and maybe the only one possible. How can it be implemented efficiently? Does the resulting system behave truly intelligent? Hopefully the future will answer these questions - maybe with your contribution!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"I JUST FINISHED THIS BOOK TWO DAYS AGO AND I AM SPEECHLESS.

It took me quite a while to read , when I put it down it was a real- effort -to pick -it -back -up. I found it to be drawn out and all over the place and not a nice flow.

I am extremely pleased that author Tracy Brown did such a fabulous job at coming up with an original story plot. I love that nothing was too predictable. There were very few editing mistakes and I was excited to read the different points of view each character had. I love those types of books and I think she did an awesome job portraying each characters personal opinion.This novel had me feeling like I was right there along the way.

I would definately recommend this book to those looking for an exciting easy to read/quick novel.Great job Tracy, I look forward to reading more lit by you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dope","review":"Tracy really did her thing with this book.

I seen his name and I wasted $10 at Wal-Mart for this piece of garbage. It wasn't even frightening-but stupid and idiotic. Oddball creatures that looked like \\"Critters\\" with legs wants to eat little girl's teeth. I'm still shaking my head how terrible this movie was, and I will NEVER AGAIN trust the name \\"Guillermo Del Toro\\" again. I hated the movie so much I THREW IT IN THE TRASH.

IT'S SERIOUSLY *AWFUL*, STUPID, BORING--A VERY BAD MOVIE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"This movie was probably the worst of its genre I have ever seen. It wasn't scary.

Confidential...So disappointing..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary & creepy","review":"I rented this movie and watched it while I was alone. I was just getting sick but this made for a scary mix. I have to admit I love Guy Pierce, and Katie Holmes,...not so much. I do adore Guillermo Del Toro, though and gave this a shot. I thought the little girl resembled Katie Holmes quite a bit, and oddly enough they have similar acting styles. Their faces don't reveal all that much but then surprisingly their physical reactions (screaming)were pretty good. I won't give anything away. I will just say the little creatures were creepy & scary. I would not let little kids watch this though, too bloody, and violent. The mansion was so cool. I would recommend this movie, probably more for women though. Women themes, and fears probably won't do anything for guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars for Atmosphere, acting so-so, great story.","review":"Love Del Torro, and his hand is obvious in this film. Katie Holmes is her usual blah self, but the atmosphere and story are examples a great horror-fantasy story."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT a horror movie...this is a joke with little furry fairy gremlins!","review":"I thought this was suppose to be a decent new horror movie. It wasn't scary at all. It was basically a boogey-man movie for 6 year olds. The spoooooky whispering, the weird little rat-like gremlin \\"creatures\\" .... Give me a break! Just watch Gremlins and Child's Play (with Chucky) back to back and you've already seen this movie. This might have scared people in 1970, but it's laughable now. Except for the silly cutting/stabbing scenes, they could've slapped a PG rating on this movie. I don't know what the R rating is for. There's more violence & language in the Toy Story movies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I rather enjoyed it.","review":"I wasn't expecting much based on some of the reviews, but I was presently surprised to find it enjoyable to watch and even a bit disturbing - especially the ending. It reminded me a bit of King's Cat's Eye, which is probably why the ending got to me. King's kept me up as a kid for eight days straight. Take a chance; keep an open mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont be afraid of the rats","review":"Overall Dont Be Afraid of the Dark was very lacking in providing suspense and horror. The first few minutes of the movie were very interesting and seemed to build up to something; however, the creatures are revealed way too early in the movie and look like sickly rats, which killed much of the suspense for me. There is not enough violence or language to justify this movie having a R rating. Rent Fright Night (2011) if you want a fun/scary horror movie and dont waste your time on this"},{"rating":"1","title":"more funny than anything else","review":"there are no words to describe how pathetic an attempt for a scary movie this was. i seriously knew it was a dud 5 minutes into it, yet my mom, who was watching it with me, wanted us to give it a try. less than halfway through, we were both making our own commentary, laughing out loud, and fast forwarding (this thing is soooo freaking slow, adding to the absurdity of the story) to the end just to see what happens. compared to katie holmes' other movies (this one isn't even comparable to any of her others), it makes one think if she was really hard up for a role when she did this. avoid like the plague, or rent for a good laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just have fun with it","review":"This isn't scary in the traditional horror movie sense. It's more like a folktale. In fact, it wouldn't surprise if there are elements about it that come from Spanish folktales. I took a couple classes in Folklore in college and this screams folktale. Del Toro seems to taking his ideas from these old folktales ( I thought the same thing when I watched Pan' Labyrinth) and rewriting them and then filming them. If that is what he's doing, there's nothing wrong with it. It's simply a retelling of story that's been told and retold over the generations. The story changes with time and each retelling until it becomes something unique. This movie works because it's different from what Hollywood is passing for horror/suspense. The film is getting eith 5 stars or 1 star from Amazon reviewers and I don't think either is fair. 3.5 to 4 is more appropriate. Your best bet for this film is watch and enjoy for what it is and don't over analyze it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different Look At What Goes \\"Bump\\" In The Night","review":"I wasn't really sure what to expect when I started watching this movie and I guess I was a little bummed when I figured out what was making all the noises and what was talking to the girl, however, the more I watched this, the more I realized that you need to view this movie with a different world in mind. Get yourself out of this everyday world we live in and focue more on the fantasy, mystical world. Once I started doing that it was a much more interesting experience watching this film. I liked it, and I think anyone who is a fan of Guillermo Del Toro will find something in this movie to like as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark","review":"This movie was creepy, it was even a little crazy too, the acting was'nt bad, I really enjoyed the scary scenes.

It gave the movie that classic 1960's feel. Afterwards we have Guy Pearce moving into the same home with his young melancholy daughter, Sally, who would prefer to be with her mom in LA. She also has an instant dislike of Katie Holmes, dad's girlfriend. Eventually the family discovers the basement, which had been sealed. The area is famous for its sink holes that go deep into the earth. Sally is fascinated with shaft/tunnel in the basement.The movie initially keeps you in suspense as to what is in the basement and which travels through the old ventilation system. Good suspense. Good creepy story. Good child acting. Great movie to show when the girls want to have a sleep over. And then when things are good and tense, flip the breaker off and let everything go dark.No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Try not to think too deep and enjoy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Afraid of this Movie","review":"I seriously considered calling Amazon and asking for my three bucks back on this one.

This could not have been a preview before Pan's Labyrinth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment, TERRIBLE acting, poorly written script","review":"I will start off by saying that the cinematography is wonderful and the child actress was a pleasant surprise. I was also impressed by the computer generated creatures.Negatives:Guy Pearce and Katie Holmes are beyond terrible at their craft. I cannot believe that someone actually paid them to do this movie.The script is full of holes and whoever edited the movie should be ashamed.

In the process of making this movie, I'm sure someone was paid...but it's hard to imagine what for. The house...what you can see of it (which is woefully little) is the best part. The rest is a scream/yawn a minute. They scream...I yawn. I wish I'd read the reviews before I clicked the \\"rent\\" button in a fit of boredom. Alas, I did not.... To pay for boredom in time and money really really stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money and time back","review":"I have never taken the time give my opinion of a movie but in this case I will make the exception.Do not waste your time on this movie. If you are looking for a slightly maybe scary movie for a 15 year old this is your pick. This is not a horror film, there is nothing scary about this movie.This movie was a waste of five dollars to rent and my time to watch. The ending was utter crap, watching the movie to get to the end was a chore. I grew up watching Pet Cemetery in 4th grade, I would watch The Grudge before going to sleep.. back when the movie was fun. I love scary movies and this is another movie to add to the latest string of disappointing releases...I've gotten bigger surprises from things dropping in toilet water than watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Monsters, More House.","review":"I thought this was going to be a great haunted/monster house movie. I was sold that Del Toro produced it as I am a big fan of his work, but for some reason this film did not deliver. It felt too much like an Adult \\"Are You Afraid of the Dark\\" episode. I also didn't like that the monsters were so in your face through most of the third act. One's mind makes a movie scary, but seeing the terror over kills it and take away from the audiences own fears. Not to mention to CG looked really bad. Katie Holmes was terrible and the kid was unlikeable, so two out of the three main characters suck......Anyways, all this movie did was make me want to see the original because I hear that is a lot better. There was a lot of missed potential I felt. But hey, you win some you loose some right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gremlins 3 gone wrong!","review":"OK, I'm a fan of Del Toro and he produced this garbage so that made me interested enough to watch it.Yes to a pretty cool Gothic feel to it, although the mansion interior is a total copy of \\"drag me to hell\\" (which was a MUCH better movie anyway).Every time I watch \\"Pieces of April\\" I just can't believe how GREAT Katie Holmes was in it, but here she is a complete mess..she has absolutely NO idea of what she's doing...btw, what else has she done even close to that first movie???Guy Pierce is another talent who's a total waste here...btw, what else has he done even close to \\"Memento\\"???The girl Bailee is just OK...actually annoying so I couldn't wait for the creatures to get rid of her.This is an attempt to do a Gremlins part 3, but that has gone totally wrong!NO humor at all, and absolutely FULL of plot holes.I couldn't believe about how bad it was 99% of the time (and I REALLY wanted to like it! I mean it!)DO NOT waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty to look at, fairly awful otherwise - especially if you like the original!","review":"The look of the film is top-notch; breathtaking sets, gloomy atmosphere, beautiful cinematography - everything you'd expect with Guillermo del Toro co-producing. Too bad the movie's a mess, not very scary, and full of illogical character reactions or actions that will have you yelling \\"What the HELL are you doing?

I believe I read somewhere that this was a remake of a made-for-tv movie. That should have been warning enough. And the writing?? Look, I'm no movie critic and don't pretend to have a better sense of acting or storylines than the next person. But, just by way of example (without giving anything away-which wouldn't matter anyway because it's all totally predictable), something tragic happens in the house, the police show up, and then everyone goes about their business like nothing happened.

While it is clear that the author holds very strong opinions, there is a clear inability to articulate them in the printed word, which is extremely painful. The publisher should have more respect for the reading public than to allow such gibberish to pass as a text under it's auspices. They should have hired a ghostwriter, as the prose seems to have been written by a semi-literate person at best or a wholly illiterate person at worst depending on what passage you read.

This does not however relieve the opressor of any human obligation. Both need to happen.Also, it's not just slavery that African Americans have suffered, but Jim Crow laws as well. These laws kept them from receiving the fruits of their ancestors labor. This continued in many places till after 1970. These victims of legislated deprivation can be found.

But I must agree with the reviewer who said that the book is poorly written. It sounds amateurish and Peterson devalues his own ideas by calling others \\"stupid\\" or \\"crazy.\\" I found this unprofessional even when I disliked the same people.He also gets into peripheral issues that don't pertain to the issue of black leaders, for example, blaming homosexuality as a force in weakening black culture, anachronistic arguments that the man is the president of the house and the woman the vice-president or that Jesus Christ should be the basis of black men's values.

It would be possible to learn the basics of tensor calculus from this book with some effort, and reflection on the implications of the concepts dealt with, however as a complete course in the subject it is insufficient, and I believe intentionally so.The more modern aspects of tensor analysis on manifolds are largely ignored in this treatment, but also intentionally so, an approach which I found useful practically.The book does not aim to be an all-inclusive course in the applications of tensor concepts to all areas of mathmatics, but rather a quick-reference guide supplementing more complete treatments, and as such, is largely successful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful in Learning Relativity","review":"I have been studying a textbook in general relativity.

He does a super job of presenting the Covariant Derivative, but except for the Prove, Derive and Show problems, there are no application problems to practice on -- and only one on Absolute Derivative.

I've tried about every setting possible to adjust, but nothing has helped.2) Not very good in dim light.

The real convenience of this product is that it holds my phone upright even in its protective cover, and it charges & stores my additional battery, which is small and easy to misplace.

What colour were the velvet swatches held by Lint and Herzog in the freezing lot? How high were Herzog's graph paper barricades? What shape were the gnostic knobs Lint manipulated without effect? Did Lint favour short of fuller length gowns when submitting his work? These questions remain unanswered, simply, I suspect, because the author was perplexed by a cloud of choking black dust. But these omissions are flawless fragments of a larger picture. Overall this is a fascinating examination of an underrated mind, written with panache and clandestine mundanity.

It seems to me that perhaps the author has sacrificed authenticity on the altar of innovation. I most recently attempted the banana cheese empanadas, despite my initial misgivings at the absence of fat in the dough. This is the first time I've seen a recipe for empanadas in which the dough consists of only flour and water. Needless to say, it was tough and flavourless. I have not had much more luck with the other recipes I tried, either. What I find especially irritating is the author's decision not to include photographs of finished dishes or diagrams of cooking techniques, but to showcase her own original, and completely irrelevant, artwork."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book was moldy, had to throw it away.","review":"Book was moldy, had to throw it away.Book was moldy, had to throw it away.Book was moldy, had to throw it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read, not that useful","review":"This cookbook is awesome. It has a lot of very interesting recipes that make for good learning experiences. \\"oh, I never thought to pair x with y,\\" is the kind of thing you think when reading it. The whole menu thing makes it less usable than you want it to be, as it's hard to find a recipe to do the job. I've still never made a whole meal using one of the menus.

YEAH!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, poor execution","review":"I loved the idea of this thing, since sometimes I don't record notes in my Palm if the circumstances prevent me from opening it, turning it on, switching apps and writing them down. Unfortunately, they didn't quite get it right; I was prepared for it to be a bit thicker than the OEM cover, but the molding was badly designed so it was hard to open and close, and didn't even close fully. That might have been dealable, but the buttons are raised, and on the outside, which is convenient for using it but means any pressure on the front, even through the heavy neoprene case I bought, randomly presses the buttons and messes up your stored messages. I lost a few before I figured out what was going on. So, two stars for the idea, but I'd really, really like to see a version with the buttons on the *inside*, lockable, or somehow protected, and a better-molded case."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wish it was better.","review":"I agree completely with the previous reviewer. I love the ideaof voice recording quick memos and ideas instead of writing them down,and I think this function is sorely lacking on the Palm III. This attachment adds surprisingly little bulk to my Palm III. BUT, the exposed buttons are activated when it's inside my briefcase pocket (there is no off switch to prevent accidental operation), the fit is too tight and it does not completely close. I also think the speaker volume is a bit too loud and there is no volume control. As much as I'd like to have voice recorder capability, this product just isn't there yet. I'm hopeful Landware (or someone) can improve on this great idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea...Bad creation (IE DONT BUY IT)","review":"This product is an excellent concept. Now make it work! The ability to quickly record a message is great, but the molding is shoddy, and it doesnt close fully.

So, do yourself a favor, and wait till they come out with somthing better b4 you buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop the beep.","review":"I've only had this device for a day but have comments. On the plus side, it has better voice quality and more memory than the Voice It Recorder I used to own. On the negative side, It's hard to flip the cover open. It makes a snapping sound while being opened and doesn't open as smoothly as the orginal Palm cover. The other negative--and my biggest comlaint--is the beeping noise when the buttons are pushed. I use the GoVox most often in a library, where I make voice notes from newspapers and magazines that I read. I speak softly into the device so as not to annoy other library patrons, but I can't supress the beep, although I try to by covering the speaker. Too bad the beep can't be turned off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revolutionary product, But Shinei is a terrible company","review":"The go-vox is distributed by Landware but produced by Shinei, a Singapore based company.

I purchased the product on 19 Jan 01, my credit card charged on 5 Feb 01. I still have not recieved the product.

These two tunes certainly posses something special that you seldom encounter in other Bill's albums. No doubt, \\"At Shelly's Manne-Hole\\" captured one of the Bill's best plays with the bassist, Chuck Israels, and the drummer, Larry Bunker. Although people tend to undervalue the second trio compared to the first one, this album explains that this perception is not always true.

There is a lithium battery that could be replaced if they had just designed it better. The battery is hot glued down!

I am guessing that it is the glue used in the binding, but I don't always like to open up the book for this reason.

She's a girl who has a hard time meeting new teachers and students. That is how I know if she has problems in her life. This book is about what had happened in her girl culture. This book made me feel like laughing when it talked about Cleo picking her nose and not eating properly. This book made me sad when she didn't meet any friends and it also made me sad when she didn't like her new house.

Company flow is just another group of battle rappers with nothing but lame punchlines and boring as hell beats. There is nothing innovative about this album. Just because it was different at the time of its release does not make it great.

I was particularly amazed at the overt references to Christianity throughout the entire poem. As the translator wrote in the introduction, Beowulf is not so much about the battles but it's about the pictures it paints of the characters and society of its time. It was interesting to see, then, how different the Christian worldview was during Beowulf's time compared to now. Noticing these differences, or rather the elements that haven't changed, helps to distill out true Christianity from the cultural morass it resides in today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killing the Dragon","review":"BR's translation in meter is awesome; the style of the book is neat, very slick and easy to carry around.

First off, people write at length about how egotistical he is...did it ever occur to you that that may have been a major part of the story? That his pride, or hubris, was a key factor? I suppose not, you may wish to listen to your English teachers more. As to this story being boring, remember that it was written originally sometime between the 7th and 10th centuries A.D.

I was forced to read this for a British lit class and let me tell you it was money wasted. I continue to be amazed at the belief that just because something is written by the British then that in itself makes it a classic and a must read. We freed ourselves from the British government through war and struggle. What do we have to do to free ourselves from their literature, becuase other than The Cantebury Tales and a few poems and epitaphs, British lit is long, boring, tedious and outdated. Not to mention some of the language is unbearable, I find myself having to re-read passages just to understand them.

This version doesn't even deserve that. I have to admit that Beowulf is by far THE WORST work of recognized literary merit that I have EVER encountered. The story centers around a most egotistical, self-glorifying man, Beowulf. The reader must endure pages and pages of Beowulf's constant bragging and babbling about his numerous \\"brave\\" feats. The only part of the story I enjoyed was at the very end when Beowulf gets killed by a fire breathing dragon. Fortunately, this is a very short book because if it had even been one page longer I would have had to resort to a slow, painful suicide (which would have been more interesting than \\"Beowulf\\"). I promise you will hate this version of Beowulf and you will regret every second of your life you spend reading it. If you are required to read this work, I strongly suggest you skip the \\"epic poem\\" and read the Spark Notes END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best translation.","review":"Sampled at least a dozen versions.

I read them... and I was bored by them primarily, although The Odyssey I liked the way Odysseus finally got his revenge. Anyways, when school started we were assigned to read another epic, Beowulf. This book I found to be a pleasent surprise though. The book is like a fantasy almost, the way Beowulf fights mythical creatures such as dragons, monsters, and such with what seems to be superhuman strength, like a modern day comicbook hero.

If you want a solid overview of the sport of triathlon, this is the book for you.Swim, Bike, Run is written in a very straight-forward style and gives sound, practical advice. I am an avid reader of \\"things triathlon,\\" so I've read just about every book out there. The most telling insight into how much I value this book is that this is the book that I consistently return to and read the night before a race.

The picture quality is great and I like being able to edit the color, brightness and contrast with the included Canon software. I just received the camera and took a total of 34 pictures over 2 days, with the LCD turned on for most of them.

I went out yesterday and bought an external card reader to download from and that works super too. This camera is a bargain at $...! I highly recommend it! I also ordered the Lowepro D-Res 10 AW Digital Camera Bag, and it fits this camera like a glove."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera!","review":"I own a Canon 35mm camera & love it! I've taken tons of pics & always hated waiting to finish the roll, & then to wait & go have it developed. Most of my photos wound up being scanned & posted on the internet. So I firgured a digital camera would be better. I did a lot of searching & reading the reveiws of others about their purchases.I bought the A10 for several reasons: 1)The name Canon. 2)I didn't need the movie mode. 3)Takes 4 AA batteries. 4)I wasn't worried about the 1.3 pixels since I don't print my images. (The A10s image is better than a sharp 35mm pic after it has been scanned)The software to download was simple & the operation of the camera is easy to learn.I use the LCD screen very little, the optical viewfinder is perfect. The viewfinder zooms in & out with the lens.My very 1st image turned out great! I've owned the A10 a week now & LOVE it! I take the camera everywhere I go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera","review":"I have been using this camera for about 5 months now and I love it. The picture quality is great, I have printed out pictures and they look just like ones from a 35mm camera. The only draw back for this camera is if you want prints over 4X6. It only has 1.3MP which limits picture size to only the 4X6, but the quality of those prints is great. If you are looking for a digital camera that gets great quality photos for posting on the net or sending to friends via email and want to print out a few of you favorites at the 4X6 size, then I recommend this camera highly. Another great feature is that it has 3x optical zoom which is not included on most cameras in this price range. Digital zoom is a complete waste(as it is on every digital camera, but the optical zoom is really great. You will be more pleased with a digital camera which has 3x optical zoom instead of 2.1MP for this price. Hope this helped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this Camera","review":"This is a great Camera. If your looking to buy a digital camera for the first time, buy this camera, you will love it. The image quality is so clear. This is a good looking camera with a solid feel. The canon software is so convenient to use, the downloads are fast and easy. This is definetely the best camera out there for the price. Under 200 dollars, i can't believe it. I put the settings on small resolution, super fine, where i can take up to 144 pictures on a 32MB flash card. The cons may be that there still a little red eye in some pictures and battery goes fast, if you have a charger, your fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than my old S100","review":"I used to have a Canon Elph S100. I took so many pictures with it that when it died I didn't know what to do. I was livid after spending [the money} to have two rolls of film developed at the drug store. I pretty much only take pictures to put on the web. I'm not a big fan of hard-copy prints.So, after some shopping around, I decided the A10 was perfect. I never used the higher resolutions of the S100 (2.1Mpix). The larger size of the A10 actually translates into a much better user interface. Plus, you can get lens and filter kits for the A10. I just wish it had a better manual focus mode!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a great camera","review":"Feels very solid, takes beautiful pictures, buy rechargeable batteries and larger compact flash memory, this is a great buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the magic of single remixes","review":"M83 RunIntoFlowers single is my first approach to this band.with no expectations, the sounds blew my routine selection of music adding new sounds and backgrounds...

Like most artists Diebenkorn began with a classical approach to his work and gradually created his own unique style. When we look at his work, we know its his. For any artist needing to be inspired or needing to formulate their own direction, this book shows clearly that the work of an artist is always evolving. Well worth acquiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Different from my expectation","review":"I don't know. I expect this book to have more information than it is. There's not much content but too many interview. In fact the whole book is all about the interview from different people in different architecture backgrounds.It may be a good book to those who want to knwo more about architecture, to architecture students who have never had internship before. Since I already worked for more than one year in architecture firms, I feel this book contains much less information than I expect.Anyway, it's just my personal opinion. Hope it helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Career Source for Those New to the Field","review":"If you are exploring design careers for the first time, this book is a must read! Waldrep skillfully coalesces insights from various faculty, students, and practitioners in order to provide a depth and breadth that is normally missing from typical career guides. There is advice on everything from the definition of architecture to establishing a design career, and everything in between; this advice cemented my intent to apply to a graduate program in architecture and urban planning.I really loved the diversity of viewpoints expressed in the book. Modernists, neo-traditionalists, nontraditional students, traditional students, deans, and admissions professionals all have their own ideas about what attributes are necessary for a good architect, how to choose an academic program, and what employers look for. Finally, the text was so fun to read that I finished it the same day I received it and plan to read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Must\\" to have on any young architects bookshelf","review":"If you know anyone who is an aspiring architect, they need to have this book. It does a wonderful job of explaining what becoming an Architect entails from beginning education, through college, the Intern Development Program, and beyond. It not only covers the fundamentals of becoming/being an Architect, but also gives different views Architects have on the art and profession of architecture. This book was glued to my side while filling out my college applications and it will still be with me throughout my college education, graduate school, and beyond. You are not going to find another book out on the market like this one. There is a new edition out so I would strongly recommend getting the more updated version:Becoming an Architect: A Guide to Careers in DesignThis is an invaluable resource for both the aspiring and accomplished architect and no bookshelf is complete without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amy Brown Moonsprite CD holder","review":"Again, cheaply made material.

This book is for everyone(college student, business owner, corporate employee, athlete, etc..) You'll feel refreshed after reading this book and have a better outlook on life events when you finish it, it will get you motivated towards higher happiness and help keep you there. I found the author to be clearly skilled at getting his point across in a storytelling approach, the poems are an added bonus, and once I started reading it I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing first chapter, pages all mixed up but 5 stars for content and Amazon customer service","review":"I'm not sure if this is just a quirk of my book or indicative of a wider problem but I just received this and the first page is page 37-68 then it goes right into chapter 2. So I went to page 36 hoping to retrieve chapter 1 from there with no luck... pages 37 - 68 are right there in their rightful place. So, be careful if you get this, make sure and check the pages before sticking it on your shelf to read later because by the time you get around to discovering the error it might be too late to make the return.

My friends and I love this show now. This is fantastic stuff for it's time since so many programs from the 70's don't hold up as well and even when things are less than stellar in this show it still entertains greatly since it's a weird mix of good elements and ultra cheesy stuff! I don't want to compare this to Trek, but this show delivers major entertainment value and I'd rather watch Space 1999. What's wrong with being terribly entertained?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Original Zombie Movie: Better than Most Big Budget Flix!","review":"This is a great little movie. If you're a zombie fan, it's definitely worth your time and money.For the most part, these are Romero zombies: Shoot 'em in the head types.It's the survivors who are different. Who expects swingers to also be survivors??? I never had before, but THE STINK OF FLESH changed my mind. Certainly it would take people willing to 'think outside the box' to survive the pending zombie apocalypse.My wife agreed that this was the rarity: a movie where you CAN'T predict what is going to happen next. Wow!The acting is mixed. Some of the co-stars seem lucky to have remembered their lines. That's okay. The main characters do a fine job and the gore is reasonably realistic.And I think I'll have nightmares of Dottie before I'll have nightmares of zombies...!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was a stink of a DVD","review":"If you like zombie movies like Dawn of the Dead and Night of the Livining Dead. Avoid this movie. It has zombies. But that cant make up for the bad acting, stupid story plot, cheesy zombie fist fights, retarded girl with a fake looking head on her side that has no reason to be in the movie. And on a side note no one would want to have sex with a zombie for fear of contracting what ever the zombie had that turned them into a zombie. The only thing that I found interesting was the fact that the director added some of his movies he made in highschool."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALTERNATIVE ZOMBIE FILM","review":"Nathan (Ross Kelly) and his wife Dexy (Diva) have an open marriage. He goes out and finds men for her ...and while they are having sex Dexy's sister Sassy (Kristin Hansen) spanks the man's bottom with an orange plastic ruler. That is her job. Nathan watches, but prefers a zombie he has chained up in the shed. Matool (Kurly Tlapoyawa) who fights zombies with long nails and a hammer likes to save women and harass them for sex. Matool is kidnapped by Nathan and lives there for the perks.In addition to the slow moving zombies there are also fast moving ones. Very original script. Lousy soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, but Oddly Pleasing","review":"I don't recomend this movie. The production value is low. The acting is bad. And most frustratingly, the dialogue isn't bad enough to make it funny, but bad enough to bother me.That aside, there is some very strange stuff going on in this movie that I do not regret seeing. The laughs are sparse in this film. But when I am laughing, it is at things I have never seen.The zombie violence is pretty gross too! Not bad for the low production value. The action though, is horribly repetitive. This is not that kind of zombie film. This is more of an interplay between characters which mostly takes place in a house.The zombies are of the old-school variety. Moving slowly. But they aren't what the show is about. The show is about a swinging couple and the people they abduct, who don't have much of a problem banging some dude's wife.Don't worry, it's not softcore porn. It's a comedy with bad taste and bad timing and a weird imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic.","review":"Dismiss the people that give this movie such a low rating. Rent this and watch it for what it is... a zombie flick that was made on a $3,000 budget in two weeks with the help of his friends and family as actors. No, the acting is not from Hollywood, but it's a zombie movie! You're not watching it to gain some great personal insight. That being said, the writing in this movie IS top-notch. Humor is woven through the story and the dialog is put together quite well (some scenes are reminiscent of Kevin Smith's early writing). I'm very excited to see where this writer/director takes his career. Oh yeah, and there's nudity and gratuitous gore. Can't beat it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better!","review":"I agree with another reviewer below that this film could have had the same point without the zombies. It was a good try but in my opinion failed at a few levels. The zombie make up was pretty good but the pace and overall acting left a lot to de desired. Was it just me or did they not explain why the older sister had that living fact/head on her body?"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad bad movie","review":"This was a really really bad movie. The acting was horrible, the special effects were pathetic and the plot was not worth writing about. Really bad movie.Plot: Matool (a clear reference to Zombi 2), who kills zombies, is kidnapped by a guy because his wife wants to use him for sex. This open marriage relationship goes to the extreme, and if you have the bad fortune of watching this movie, you will know why. They also have to deal with the zombies.The movie is really just bad and the acting is worse than terrible. The dialogue is pointless and the film is just a waste of time. Words can not describe just how bad this movie is. I would rank it right up with \\"Zombie Nation\\" in how just how horrible it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"I took a chance on an unknown film and boy do I want my money back!

No quiet was had at the front desk while reading this original and hilarious tale. Of course being a Texan didn't hurt understanding the story line--the jackalope is legendary here.

Archie's lovely relaxed guitar picking is beautifully accompanied by a few other instruments and he casts a spell over the listener with a series of gentle ballads about characters and places he knows and loves. \\"Ashfields and Brine\\", \\"Shipyard Apprentice\\", \\"Cuillins of Home\\" and \\"Merry England\\" display his love of place, \\"Gunsmoke and Whiskey\\" and \\"Bill Hosie\\" are marvellous evocations of interesting characters. However his \\"love\\" songs are totally stunning - \\"The Prescence\\" is one of the most affecting pieces of music imaginable - achingly poetic story of an ageing spinster's regrets and proud faith. Another highlight is his recitation \\"The Black Horse\\" - brilliant - no effects, no music, just pure voice and perfect delivery. Haunting! Do yourself a favour - buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific poet and singer","review":"This man is an undiscovered treasure. His lyrics are pure poetry. And his music is quite good.

The book delves into the roots/family influences of the two very talented middle distance runners including Ovett's very influential mother and Coe's father and coach. The author captures the excitement of breaking world records, running in the Olympic games and the expectations associated with being athletes at thier prime. Two very different personalities are contrasted both in their private and public impressions. A fascinating read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Rivalry (ever?)","review":"Excellent book for anyone who followed track in the 70s and 80s.Lots of light shed on what may have been the most significant and consistent rivalry on the oval. The backgrounds of both runners are very revealing; Coe's training routines, while widely discussed, were revolutionary. Meanwhile, Ovett is shown as an agressive and confident runner, and nothing like the arrogant antagonist that the media portrayed. Additionally, he was immersed in the science of footwear and helping develop better products for runners. Why he never got the acclaim he deserved is a mystery.A great read for those who have been there."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really enjoyed it!","review":"A wonderfully intimate and sometimes humorous peek into the life of the family of an Orthodox priest.

It helped to focus me on the timeless practices of the church."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly shallow","review":"I had great expectations for this book, and it disappointed me to be quite honest. I expected the author to go much more in depth about her personal journey- instaed only a few pages are devoted to how it happened. Her \\"humor\\" is lost on me; she is judgmental of non-Orthodox: \\"..only a half hour for Easter services\\" line is an example. I am disappointed mainly at her chance to persuade and draw others to her faith. As someone searching myself, I am repelled by her attitude that permeates throughout the book. It left an impression on me like this was a really bad sitcom script. Her cast of charaters (parishnors) might be disappointed at her characterization of them. Finally, if you stripped away the borrowed prayer passages and song lyrics, this book could be cut in half. Could we not find these passages in other sources and instead focus on the building of her faith and her church a little more? We'll see if her next title is different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly Shallow and At Sea","review":"This book was a big disappointment to me, perhaps most of all because these new converts were simply cast adrift by their bishop with no training or experience. As a result, they were hunting their way into Orthodoxy, with an awful lot of false steps. For that reason, the picture it paints is not very true to the life of most Orthodox parishes, and some events are even very inappropriate. In some ways it was more a running commentary on what the author was thinking, rather than what Orthodox people were doing. I kept wanting to know more about this ancient Faith and less about the often irrelevant thoughts going through the mind of the author in the midst of what should have been holy moments. Orthodoxy is sober and relaxed at the same time, but this book failed completely to convey the sobriety. Don't read this if you want to find out about Orthodoxy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irreverent, lacking in sobriety.","review":"One wishes that an author with many widely broadcast avenues of access to the mainstream media would employ a touch more sobriety in addressing the serious matters at the heart of the Orthodox Faith. This book is far too flip about the Church's music, liturgy, iconography, fasting, and other attributes. I pray its author -- and the world -- is progressing since it was written. If you don't know Orthodoxy, don't start with this; go to the services instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent resource.","review":"It all began when my roommate started dating an Orthodox guy. I was intrigued. I had never heard much about the Orthodox church, never thought much about the Orthodox Church. However, since that time I have visited their church a few times, including once during Pascha (Orthodox Easter). I was still intrigued, but I had a lot of questions, and nobody to answer them. \\"Facing East\\" helped. It didn't answer all of my questions, but it gave me a place to start. I'm not going to tell you that I'm going to convert to Orthodoxy because of this book. I don't know yet what I'm supposed to do about the Orthodox church. However, for those who are looking for something that will give you more of an idea of what being Orthodox is all about without having to struggle through heavy theological texts, this book may be just what you're looking for. It's light enough to keep one's interest, yet serious enough to answer some major questions.

Everything he releases, whether it be spoken word projects or Rollins Band albums, is incredible. Rollins' material here, like all of his work, makes you think, laugh and is always worth a second or third watch.Check this DVD out if you are a Rollins' fan or even if you've never heard of him.

This is a fun game that will last a very long if you have friends who also have a DS so you can link up and battle each other. The graphics are great for a small hand-held console. Its sort of difficult to shoot your right hand weapon because you have to aim with your stylus and you don't have a finger to press the R key except for you pinky.

It also gets a little repetitive and the sound is a little annoyin but it's still a good game.8 GRAPHICS - Wow! Now these are some good graphics. Especially for a handheld! some bad things that enemies don't flinch if you hit them so you don't really know if you hit them or not and the people could of looked more creative.7 SOUND - The in-game music can get somewhat annoying because it sounds nothing like 007. It sounds more like a NES game. The gun sounds sound really good though.8 GAMEPLAY - The gameplay is verygood here but it can get a bit repetitive and can get frusturating.8 OVERALL - Overall the game is very good with good gameplay, sound, and graphics.

Janet Ruth Montgomery who plays Martina Garretti, is actually a Brit (you may remember her as Eric Murphy's Assistant in \\"Entourage\\").While the show is un-offensive and mildly interesting, the reason I decided to DVR the 2nd episode is because of Janet Montgomery in a short skirt with heels and legs that go on....

Disabled by a chronic disease, she lost home, job and possessions until she moved onto the old Robe homestead in Marion County determined to survive. \\"If life gives you wild grapes, then make jelly\\" is her philosophy. She began investigating the wild plants that she had grown up with and educating herself in botany and the ways of the old settlers. Her recipes are wonderful just to read. I have tried the Snapping Turtle soup recipe myself and can recommend it as a definite change of pace from clam chowder. She also has a recipe for skunk (!) that resulted from a hilarious end to a hunting trip.

The method could in fact be very damaging to children who actually do have dyslexia. The author's attitude could be very damaging to parental confidence, since the author doesn't seem to recognise that dyslexia is any different from a \\"slow\\" reader, and posits that dyslexia can be cured in a few \\"simple\\" steps.

Some of the missing information was \\"new\\" (last 4-5 years), much of it was not. A well written general survey of neurology for the medical student, the level of omission of significant or critical information suggests that even the family practitioner should exercise great caution in using it as a decision-making guide.

You are no longer invincible wich for me is funner than ever because you actually have to duck behind cover in order to stay alive. I love the rag doll animations. Downsides are you cannot get in vehicles like on halo. No machine gun nests or bunkers on multiplayer. no destructable environments like every game should have. Other than that its a very fun game.

The areas of combat are based in reality, but the missions and battlefields are made up, id rather play Wolfenstein if i wanted that crap. Look, 5 years ago this might be a decent game, but since all the other WW2 games have come out like Call Of Duty, and the phenomenal and authentic Brothers In Arms have come out, it makes it seem that much worse.

Also like many reviewers here have said mine also came with a tear it's barely noticeable but it is their but it's not big deal.

However, you can't overlook the racial politics in the film. Early on the white protaganist fights a huge black man. This black man is torn from the images of Jim Crow literature. The character is huge, animal-like, non-human and very slow. However, don't worry the white man will prevail and outsmart the beast. That is the slant that is given early on in the movie, which continues throughout the film. Every black character in the movie either gets killed or humuliated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost top drawer!","review":"This is not a bad little movie - it may lack a sophisticated plot but it is entertaining enough and effectively carries you along with the race against time confronting the central characters. The intensity of the adventures and action is nicely balanced by the comedy element provided by Nick's (the man on a mission), mother. There is a nice little twist at the end and all in all if you are into Crime Thrillers then this offering, if you just want to be entertained, is well worth a viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"KEEP RUNNING","review":"I PURCHASE THIS MOVIE JUST BECAUSE I SEEN CURTIS JACKSON \\"50 CENT\\" IN THE LINE UP.

In pitch black nights the Nightstar light is useable for the full 20 minutes, but in low light (like at dusk or at dawn) the Nightstar gives a good bright light for the first 10 minutes and then slowly fades out. That is still 5 minutes longer than the Forever Light which is not as bright.

The extra songs are beyond expectation. And, of course, Robert Smith is at or near his creative peak.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are so many better choices","review":"I purchased this West Bend as an upgrade and a complement to my 'ancient' Rival, which still works well. The oval shape and removable pot give a lot more versatility, and ease of cleaning too. The stainless outer skin looks good.Well, the second time I used it (and it always seemed too hot, even on low) the switch sparked and it was fried. So, I called their 800 number - they don't want you to return it to the store - and they sent me a prompt replacement, along with a FedEx call tag. (I had to drive to a Kinkos to drop it off, because their call tag doesn't include residential pickup.)First time I used the new one, it boiled the contents in a matter of a few hours, and when I switched it off, it would not turn on again, even after it had completely cooled. When I returned it to the store it was originally purchased at, they didn't seem the least bit surprised.I think I would avoid this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable and efficient, everything I want in a slow cooker","review":"I purchased this slow cooker more than a year ago on Amazon as a replacement for a Rival crockpot (you can find my review).We use this slow cooker often, more so in the fall and winter than summer. I really like the \\"keep warm\\" feature, which fits our busier nights when we can't eat together as a family.If you read some of the other reviews, this product is rated lower because it doesn't have a timer. Don't let that stop you from buying this slow cooker. After bad experiences with other brands, I hesitated to add my review right after purchase. Now, more than a year after our purchase, I can honestly say this is the best slow cooker I've ever owned.This is easy to clean, easy to operate and holds enough food to feed a family of four. Thank you, West Bend and Amazon.I give it four stars with the only negative being that the handles should be a tad longer because of the product's weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psychology: An Introduction","review":"I thought this was a great book...Also because I aced the course.

The scale is a disapointment. It will not hold zero between throws, and will wander from .1 to .3 of a grain and will need to be re-zeroed constantly while in use. I left it on throughout the night thinking that the circuit need to stabilize and that didnt help. I took in inside where the temperature was warmer and that worked for a while. The scale will hunt for the wieght of the charge.

I have wanted an electronic scale for some time but was told the new electronic florescent ballasts were causing some problems with all scales of this type. I was told that this was no longer a problem. I purchased this item, read the directions and plugged it in. The next day I went through the setup and calibration procedure, as I started my reloaded scession I weighted each powder charge, toward the end of 50 rounds I noticed that the negative weight of the powder pan had increased. I then recaliberated and rezeroed the scale and remeasured all of the rounds, I found that I had powder charges up to 6 grains when I needed a 4.5 grain charge. Maximum charge for this load is 5 grains. This happened twice. I have returned this item to RCBS at thier request, I have not gotten it back. I hope I can change my rating then.

After 3 recharging cycles battery died completely. Still I was not sure who is culprit: my used camera or the brand new battery. I searched Internet, cleaned the battery and camera as people advised. Nothing helped. Then I ordered new original battery from Hong Kong for $60 (compared to $100 in Toronto). In couple of weeks new battery arrived. After 3 weeks of extensive use no problems. Therefore, there is nothing wrong with the camera. Sadly, it is too late for returning it to bestbuy.Conclusion: stay away from non original batteries, in case you can't afford the price in Canada do shopping in Asia."},{"rating":"2","title":"well built","review":"This bucket seat is very impressive.

There were Biscuit and Clifford Thanksgiving books but I settled on this one. Told in the same manner as The Night Before Christmas, it follows really a traditional American Family Thanksgiving celebration including all the activities and preparation that goes into this great holiday. Actually its not so much about the night before as it is the day of, but that's ok. What appealed to me was how much it had in common with my own family's Thanksgiving from waking up in the morning and watching the parades, to family coming over for dinner. My three year old really enjoyed it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Merry Thanksgiving","review":"I love this book. My 2.5 year old daughter also loves this book.

It's fascinating and it keeps you attracted to the story. Above all, the chapters and paragraphs are well threaded. You have a series of questions at the end of every chapter that keep you focused.2 - Content:He tries to smartly undermine the fundamentals of history and philosophy on which the modern Lebanon was built. It's the famous synergy of its communities, mainly middle eastern minorities, fleeing pressure and persecution that bothers Salibi.3 - Conclusion:Salibi is absolutely not a \\"Lebanist\\" and I am not saying it in a pejorative way! When reading his book, he manages to take you around the confusing and complicated history of Lebanon expressing his views with arguments that are not better than those of his opponents, however you won't stop reading.I recommend this book to the \\"History Analysis lovers\\". It shows a different face of things specially during the Maan and Shihab eras."},{"rating":"1","title":"Opportunistic Politics Disguised as History","review":"Mr. Salibi has every right to publish his political theories, but not to disguise them as peer reviewed history. A very disappointing book by (whom I used to consider) a respected historian. Napoleon once said, 'History is the version of past events that people (read: winners) have decided to agree upon'. Apparently, Mr. Salibi agrees. His current version of history is that Lebanon always was and hence should always remain a Syrian province."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money on this book","review":"Salibi writes from a defeatist point of view. He does not support many of his claims with reference but gives a personal opinion. Thanks to modern genetics, Salibi made a fool of himself by making seriously unfounded claims in this book. It is a shame that a person who is supposed to be scholar wrote irresponsibly. Don't waste your time or money on this useless book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good book. Recommended","review":"Kamal Salibi is the foremost living historian of Lebanon, and his new book is even more important than his earlier one because it throws light on the present and future of the country as well as its past. With unique knowledge and insight, he shows how the ideas of the various communities and groups about what Lebanon is and should be are rooted in very different visions of history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very few new facts, disappointing.","review":"A good account of the modern history of Lebanon. The author shows he is clearly an expert on 20th century Lebanon and the intricacies of modern lebanese politics. A major flaw, however, is the abscence of any significant reference to the massacres of 1860 (an attempt perhaps to minimalize them). More importantly, his reinterpretation of the history of the Maronites before the 19th century is not based on any new facts, which strips it of its scholarly value. In this regard the book becomes a vehicle for the author's opinions without adding much to what is known about lebanese or maronite history. He would have done better had he concentrated on Lebanon in the modern times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased Point of View","review":"Mr. Salibi is known to create his own history and dismiss facts that might not serve his point of view. In this book, the events that took place in 1860s are not mentioned, which is very strange. These events are a turning point in the modern history of Lebanon, however since they create a justification for the creation of Lebanon in its current state and borders, Mr. Salibi chooses to omit them.I found it also \\"funny\\" that Mr. Salibi made a great effort to prove that the Maronites are Arabs while it is widely known and acknowledged that they are direct descendants of the Assyrians and still use the language of their ancestors in their mass.For any serious reader interested in the history of Lebanon, I suggest instead: The Breakdown of the State in Lebanon, 1967-1976 by Farid El Khazen (a very objective and serious piece of work)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Early album with dated arrangements","review":"I cringed when I first heard 'Je, tu, ils', and despite my fondness for Zazie's following albums, rarely re-visit it to try and like it. Three years later (1995) Zazie released Zen, which is superb melodic rock with catchy and imaginative songwriting and musical arrangements, but this .... Dated backing synths and attempts at 'funky' guitars, and limp songs.Good things: the great 'Sucre, sale'; 'Snowball', interesting for us English language speakers, a little kid's dark tale, but Zazie in English loses the magic for me.If you aren't annoyed by the dated sounds, maybe you'll be less blind to the charms of the songs than I am. Mylene Farmer's first two albums are older, yet the unique songs shine through to my ears, and hopefully some people will feel the same with this.

So I can imagine I'll cry even more when I read the two other books I ordered (Further Advertures and Final Advertures). Norton is surely every cat-lover's dream cat. But, what I want to say here is that after reading the book, I love my own cat even more. A cat's life is relatively short and vulnerable compares with human being, and so we should cherish the days when we still have our cat with us. Finally I sincerely hope that Mr. Gethers can extend his love for Norton to other cats as well, as, I do believe, that's what little angel Norton tried to teach him."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good cat story","review":"This is a story about a self proclaimed 'cat hater' who is given a cat as a present. Peter 'the cat hater' melts when Norton the cat begins to purr.

All I needed was an affordable pair of mid-range speakers that provided well-rounded sound for those times when I need them. This is exactly what I got.I've owned two pairs for well over a year now, so I'm not concerned about their longevity. These speakers speak pretty much any frequency you need them to with decent volume. In other words, they don't suffer from the lack of bass you see in compact speakers. There's not a lot of power behind the sound, but if you want a house-shaking stereo system then you probably wouldn't be looking at anything without a subwoofer.They're clear and audible, and they're also very compact. I doubt you'd find a better deal for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great speakers for the price","review":"For $35 speakers they sound excelent.

They also have a nice look."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can hear the bass lines in my music now...","review":"I'm really surprised and thankful that these tiny speakers have such a full bass response to them, which is definitely what I needed. I'm using them in an open office where a subwoofer wouldn't be appreciated, and I'm still able to hear the music top to bottom at a volume loud enough for me and quiet enough for everybody else around me.

Best of luck if you buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah sound overall","review":"I was really excited for these affordable speakers after reading the rave reviews, however, I have been extremely disappointed in them. I may have had too high of expectations, but these things put out NO bass whatsoever (it just sounds muffled and cruddy), and the overall sound is extremely poor. I'm really surprised as I've owned JBL speakers in my car that I was extremely pleased with, so I'm amazed at the lacking quality in these. I would recommend either finding another similarly priced set with good reviews or paying a little extra and getting something with a sub included."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the headphone jack, Jack?","review":"These speakers sound great - but sometimes you want to crank it up and in the office that's a no-no. So you reach for your phones and... no place to plug them in! How lame is that? Also whoever designed the Volume/On/Off knob is an idiot. The thing is so streamlined and slippery that when you try to turn it, the whole speaker just slips away from you. They're so light that they don't have enough resistance to stay put. So you have to hold it in place with one hand while you turn the knob with the other (unless you velcro them to your desk or something). Too bad because - like I said - they sound great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointments","review":"Terrific example of style over substance.

Surely it isn't Christianity...anyone with half a brain who knows anything about Jesus' message (non-violence and tolerance, for those without a clue) can see that Bush has violated nearly every tenet of Christianity during his life and especially during his \\"presidency\\".What IS Bush's \\"faith\\" exactly? It's his faith in his own self-righteousness...faith in his corporate buddies to bail him out of any hole he digs for himself...faith in the ignorance of so many so-called \\"Christian\\" folk to support his ignorant, misguided leadership.

To say that George Bush is a faithful man is so blatantly stupid. Its sad that people in this country can be subdued into believing that this man is a Christian.

For many however it seems to simply be a list of dos and don't prescribed to them by previous generations. A connection to god is reflected in ones connections to humanity. It is shown in ones abilities to give of themselves to others and in ones ability to empathize with others.

This movie was filmed in sumptuous Technicolor, but you'd never know it from this DVD. The VHS release of several years back is far superior.

I love this movie and can recite it line by line, which is good because a section of this DVD has no sound. I thought it was a defective DVD, but the second one sent to me had the same problem. The sound and picture quality in general is not good. It looks as if it was recorded from an old VHS. It's a great movie, but I suggest getting it on VHS or recording it next time it's on TV. You'll get much better quality, I'm sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Story, Bad Video","review":"Life with father brings back the traditional homefront from days gone by. In this movie, Clarence Day, played by William Powell, adds a stern, business-like, head of the house-hold type of character. Irene Dunne who plays his wife is a dutiful, constantly-pleasing yet constantly confusing her husband in day to day events. Delightful and up-lifting, viewers will enjoy the story.

It can be confusing.I purchased the DigiCom TV version of Life With Father and I must say it was well worth the money. The picture quality is perfect as is the sound and color.

This film is in the public domain (copyright protection was lost) so Warner Brothers (Turner) will probably never spend the money to restore and release the film in a quality product. Where there is no copyright protection anyone can copy and sell the product. The print used to master the Madacy DVD was probably a 16mm dupe, the negative being made from another print causing the fuzzy generation loss. Finding a good original 16mm or 35mm Technicolor print to use for a master is next to impossible. Unless Turner feels it has enough of a market to warrant the expense of restoring and releasing an unprotected picture, we are stuck with what we get from public domain distributors. Maybe Criterion will come through once again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life With Father - Digitally Remastered","review":"Yes, other DVD's of this title may be much worse, but this one is unwatchable--a major disappointment and a rip-off--with a pale, dull look to it. Also unlistenable. As another reviewer said, the voice pitch is noticeably higher, perhaps to shrink the running time so it would fit on a DVD-R. Also, the words sound clipped, in a botched attempt at noise reduction. The version shown on TCM has good sound and good enough color, so I should have stuck with that instead of wasting too much money on this so-called digitally remastered version. This film deserves better, but until it gets properly restored, turn on TCM and enjoy the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst transfer to DVD around!","review":"They have literally destroyed one of my all time favorite movies.

William Powell stars as the combustible, but essentially kind and loving patriach of a late 1800's family in New York City. A wife and three adolescent boys round out this colorful family.Powell lends irascible charm to his role while Irene Dunne plays the slightly ditsy, well meaning wife marvelously. The supporting cast includes a young and very beautiful Elizabeth Taylor as a flirtatious visitor as well as the future star of the television series \\"Adam 12\\", Martin Milner, as the middle son.\\"Life with Father\\" has plenty of warmth and humor to make it well worth seeing.

But what a shame that the abysmal sound and poor picture quality results in a presentation which seems worse than what I imagine could have been made by a cam corder at a movie theatre showing of the film. Included instructions warn this DVD's sound will not do well with a home theatre system, and so it should be played direct from DVD player to a TV. However, they give no warning of the graininess, and poor color dynamic range. Considering how poor the picture is on any home TV, and the sound issues, I could see using this only on my notebook computerr. I hope the old VHS format is better.Whoever (at MGM or whomever orignally made the movie) should be embarassed at having allowed Madacy Entertainment Group to release this DVD.

We are disappointed with the pan and do not recommend purchasing this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"good while it lasted","review":"this skillet became my designated \\"fish pan\\" and i think that's a testament to its durability. i used it quite often for blackened trout (which requires high heat) and it held up well. also i never had an issue with the fish sticking to the skillet even though i only used a light coat of oil on the fish itself. having said that, i would not recommend using the skillet for anything else once you cook fish on it because it retains the odor, and you have to hand wash it or else everything in the dishwasher will smell like fish too! i should mention that i had to get rid of the pan once a coat of black grease appeared on the bottom (not sure how) but i would probably buy it again even though it's high maintenance for a non-stick."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hidden Gem","review":"Like Corin/Corinna this book is a hidden gem well worth unearthing.As the book starts, you are immediately immersed in the world of the Folk Keeper and intrigued by the mystery that is Corin/Corinna.This book has all the elements that are so beloved in fantasy stories: A mysterious past, villains, heroes, friends, monsters and a satisfying (surprise?) finale.If you like Tamora Pierce or J.K. Rowling, you'll love this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!","review":"Both my boyfriend and I loved this book. I wish more adults would read some of the amazing children's literature out there. Perhaps after Harry Potter they will. This book had all the elements of a good story: a great page-turner, intriguing characters, and surprising turns in the story. I felt like I was 9 again, under the covers with my flashlight squealing with delight when unexpected and wonderful or unexpected and terrible things happen. Great for readers of almost any age."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book!","review":"This was a great read! At first it didn't really draw me in, but as I read on it just got better and better! You feel like you are actually interacting with the main character, Corinna, and that you are right next to her as she goes through different situations. The author gives very in-depth and vivd descriptions of the settings and emotions of characters throughout the whole book. A little confusing at times, but otherwise very believable and enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT IS A RIP OFF","review":"I NEVER RECEIVED IT AND THEY KEPT MY MONEY.

We put this up exactly as the directions said (concrete and all) and within about 30 min of my sons playing the poles were bending. Do not buy this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG! Amazing - so glad I purchased this!","review":"I cannot say enough good things about this frother! I put in cold fat- free milk and pressed a button - that's it. The machine did the rest. I tried to pour the milk/froth out and only a few tablespoons came out - the rest was thick and frothy - and warm. It is just like what you would get at a gourmet coffee cafe. I am so excited about being able to make my own coffee drinks at home now in addition to the recipes for sauces and other creams. This is definitely worth the money and not some poorly-made gizmo. You won't be disappointed. If you did want your milk thinner you simply lift the frother off the base. You cannot submerge the frother but that's not a problem. I put my finger over the opening of the gear tube and rinse the inside out. You will love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Froth 'n Sauce","review":"This is by far the best frother I have seen. I would NOT, howver, recommend the one that froths only. I like the \\"froth 'n sauce\\" version because the paddles are interchangeable allowing you to make froth that is lightly frothed (oopen-hole paddles) or extremely frothed (small-holed paddles).If I had been the manufacturer I would have added a time for a few dollars more since the unit makes froth too thich for me it I leave it on until it goes off automatically. You can, howver, lift the unit off the base at any time in the cycle. I would have also made the froth container clear instead of opaque and put 1 cup and 2 cup fill markings on it.These 2 criticisms are minor in my opinion, as I think is it by far the best frother on the market today and is considerably less that competitive models that are not nearly as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clean up is a problem","review":"I have had this product for 10 months and it made good desserts and was able to make a nice froth for coffee. The downside is that the milk or sauce sticks to the bottom and it is hard to clean even when it is soaked. If you have a large group of people it can only froth milk enough for about 5 people. Once it is done you have to wash the container to cool it down otherwise the machine will not start. You also have to be very careful not to get the underside of the container wet. If you do you must immediately dry it. I used it for a few months and now it sits on my counter somewhat forlorn. If I was able to I would rate it 4 stars for ease of use and quality of desserts but 1 star for keeping it clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nifty little machine","review":"I have wanted one of these machines ever since I got my Keurig coffee maker. It is an excellent addition to my \\"coffee house.\\" However, I would like to say it is a little difficult to keep clean and the machine is quite loud. I searched around before making the purchase and am satisfied with it so far. It cuts itself off when its done so its a no brainer. I can't wait to try the extra attachments. The owners manual leaves a lot to desire. It does not clearly show which attachments are for what - I had to guess. Overall, its a nifty little machine but it has a few kinks that might make it not worth the price for some."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective unit","review":"I was very excited to try this after reading the reviews. However, the first time I tried to use it I discovered that I had been sent a defective unit which didn't work at all-it does not even turn on.

Am returning it to Amazon for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"great substitute for a starbucks","review":"I bought this so I could save some money by not going to starbucks all the time. I've only frothed milk but it works great. And at $5 a latte, it will pay for itself in no time. I gave it 4 stars because it is kind of a pain to clean. As the milk heats up, it leaves a film on the bottom.PS. I have found the key to a good latte is to use whole milk. Skim, non-fat don't froth well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best frother I've ever used.","review":"This little appliance is awesome! For over a decade I've begun my mornings with a cup of cappuccino at home (unless I'm traveling). My Barista cappuccino machine (purchased from Starbucks in 1997) still makes perfect expresso, but the foaming part is cumbersome and unpredictable. For a number of years I made foam with a device that siphoned cold milk and spit it out as hot foam, but milk caked on the many little connectors, and sometimes I couldn't get it to work at all. Last November my husband got the Froth Au Lait, and it consistently makes thick, rich foam. Hooray! You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Spoiler","review":"Maybe the frother works as a sauce maker.But that's not why I bought it. However, the froth I looked forward to adding to my espresso is not possible. The milk remains liquidy and continues to pour as milk rather than as froth to be spooned on top of the coffee. This machine clearly rates as a \\"non-buy\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful. This book will help anyone fall right to sleep.","review":"This book was painfully slow.

Instead, it was pitiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't you just want to tell these folks to GET A GRIP!","review":"OK, OK, I am only abut 400 pages into this (overly) publicized book.

I loved Wally's first book, She's Come Undone but I can't say the same for this. It seemed to go on forever saying nothing in particular. It may have had the same style as She's Come Undone but I didn't like it. I thought there was no point to it & that all those like 800 pages were full of babble. I gave it 2 stars because it wasn't horrible, just boring. If you want something that will motivate you to read....God, don't choose I Know This Much Is True."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute waste of time","review":"I rarely quit books especially if I have invested 400 pages into them, but I quit this one. I know Oprah likes Wally Lamb and I have enjoyed some Oprah books in the past but this was a huge disappointment. The main character is a bitter guy. Lamb does a poor job in character development. Would make a good Lifetime Channel movie.If you read an 800 page book, you should at least learn something if the writing is not so special, but there is no educational value either. There is a mentally ill chracter in the book so Lamb could have used this opportunity to educate the reader on some of those issues but I felt that it was minimally researched. Skip this one. If you want to read other Oprah books try:A Fine Balance (I think this Oprah's best selection so far)House of Sand and Fog"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very memorable story","review":"I love this book. The characters are so real. Some parts will be heart-wrenching, other parts will make you laugh. I finished this book a couple of weeks ago and it still comes into my mind. This book is almost 900 pgs and I read it in 3 weeks. Don't let the size scare you, it is worth all the other summer reading you may give up for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why complain about length?","review":"I have just finished I Know This Much is True and like many other writers of these reviews, agree that it is one of the best books I've ever read. As a psychiatric nurse, I have to say that his writing was as powerful and intense as real life; and as a sister/sibling, his descriptions of familial love, obligation and hatred, rang truer than most. The book's length is part of it's magic; doesn't one read to immerse oneself in a different reality, to understand something one has not understood before? Change takes time, not sound-bytes. So I am amazed at the writers who complain the book was too long. As a home-school teacher I also wanted to encourage my teenage son NOT to be intimidated by things that took \\"too long\\", that a thousand page book just might have more to say than a half-hour tv show, you know?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Put It Down!","review":"I Know This Much is True is one of the best books I have ever read. 900 pages has never gone so fast! Each time you get to the next chapter, you won't want to stop. This is a truly unique story. You see Dominick grow and develop as a person, and how he copes with numerous difficulties. I have never found myself so wrapped up in a book that I have cried at the end...and this book did it for me! After reading She's Come Undone, I couldn't wait to read this book, and I am officially a Walley Lamb fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily one of the all-time best books I've read","review":"There's no way to give a synopsis of this book; and the publisher's attempt, while technically accurate, is far off the mark. You just have to read it! This is certainly not a book for light reading or in small doses. Time must be devoted to fully get into the head and heart of this wounded family. But the surprises are worth the trudge through the shame and tattered self-esteem of the subject and his long dead but eerily relevant family members. Devote some long stretches of time to reading this book, and you will savor it for many years to come. Who could have guessed disappointment and disillusionment could be so rewarding? Its message of hope when all is hopeless is probably one that each of us needs to learn in our journey through life's trenches, but it's not for the weak -- You'll need courage to meet up with yourself in this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"All-time Favorite Book. Everyone I give it to - LOVES IT!!!","review":"No words can describe how incredible this book really is. A one sentence description would be: a twin, whose brother is a paranoid schizophrenic, is making himself \\"crazy\\" (and everyone around him) while he waits to go \\"mental\\" like his brother. This book is an unbelievable ride that will not only make the hairs on your arms raise, but you will cry, laugh, gasp, and ache with a loss after it is complete. I couldn't read another book for weeks because I was unable to find another that could stand up to Wally Lamb's story. I still have not found another book more fulfilling. Because of Wally Lamb, I will never be satisfied with any old book. Coming from another writer - that's a huge compliment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"interminable","review":"To start with the ending: What a fortuitous turn of coincidental fate! Coincidence in real life happens all the time. In fiction it is totally unbelievable. The rest of the book I found to be extremely uneven, repetitious, and sometimes obscured by its own convoluted language. The bouncing from past to present was occasionally confusing, The \\"Domenico\\" papers were written very unevenly until I was saying to myself, is this the old man or the grandson talking here? I was not sorry I read the book, but it took me a long time, a chapter a day as it were, and ALWAYS I was wondering... (I am a writer) How did he ever get a publisher to read his original manuscript?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rewarding Read","review":"I'm going to try to keep this short and sweet considering all the other really long reviews. In short, this has been the best book I have read. With a newborn baby I hardly have time to squeeze in leasure reading. But when I started this book, I made time. Everytime I forced myself to put it down to either go to sleep or take care of things I was consumed with the characters in the book. As if they were real people. After a while I was connected to them like family and wandered what was going to happen next. There are so many surpises through out the whole book. I enjoyed it so much I went ahead and ordered She's come undone, just b/c he is the author. This treasure of a book will be passed along to everyone I know as the must read book of the year. Well, crap I did it - rambled on to long! Scusa..sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievably beautiful","review":"This book absolutely blew me away. I read She's Come Undone and I was impressed...but I never knew that Wally Lamb's second novel could move me miles more than his first.The characters are so rich and full and wonderful that I found myself thinking about them even after I finished the book. The writing and the language is so inutterably real that I forgot I was reading and started living the book.Please read it. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down.","review":"This book had me so enthralled, so eager to find out what had, and was, happening, that I read it in one day. The author captured so compellingly what the main character was feeling, as a child in his memories, and in the present, while trying to cope with everything that was happening. He is truly a terrific storyteller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book!!I loved the way","review":"I loved the way this author brought out the different storylines and characters. This book deals with a variety of things that many of us deal with in our lives. It wove a story of one man's attempt to face what life handed him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down.","review":"This book was a wonderfull awakening of your innerself. I thoroughly enjoyed this book from start to finish, really, I couldn't put it down. There was so much compassion even at the worst of times. Wally Lamb leads the reader on a wondeful and interesting journey of the life as a twin. This is a wonderfull uplifiting, yet very \\"Real Life\\" story, that I found to be very positve experience. One minute your up and the next your down. I was sad the day I finished it, when there was no more to learn about the life of Dominick. I truly enjoyed this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well written","review":"I could not put this book down! It held my interest all the way through. The ending, however, came together a bit too perfectly. The book is definitely worth a read, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mesmerizing read.","review":"Why 4 stars instead of 5? The language. Especially the God's name in vain bit. I would love to give this book to my mother and grandmother, big readers, but they wouldn't be able to stomach the language. Notwithstanding the language, it was a great read. I enjoy a protaganist (sp?) that I sincerely DON'T like, but want to read his story anyway. Makes him, and the story, more real. It's an interesting picture of small-town life - the same characters and their ancestors and descendents keep appearing throughout the story. That doesn't happen in the 'burbs. You feel Dominick's frustration at his brother, who, at the time the book begins, is beyond reason. The story was long, but I started on a Friday and finished the next Tuesday."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pick-it-up-when-you-can book!","review":"I loved \\"She's Come Undone\\"... it made me want more. Now I get it with this great story of Dominick and Thomas (and their grandfather!) I kept this book with me everywhere I went these past 2 weeks so I could read every chance I got. Now, all I want to know is when is Mr. Lamb's next book coming, cause I'm ready for even more!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Family redemption","review":"This book is painful but offers hope for redemption of painful issues such as mental illness, fatherless children, oppression, rage, and divorce. The well-written characters are vivid, particularly the \\"lead\\" twins, Dominick and Thomas, with their failures and challenges and suffering played out in detail. It keeps the reader deeply engaged in three generations' drama illustrating that a father's sins are passed on but can also be learned from. I recommend this book tentatively, it's not a light read. Save and savor it when you have some time and energy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating story full of characters I care about.","review":"Great story told in a way which makes me wish for a happy ending. Cannot out the book down- don't pick it up if you have to go to work in the morning!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books of all time","review":"The first time I read this book, I could not put it down. Although it may not be literary genius, it is compelling, exciting, well-written, well-organized and moving. I have read it many times since and recommended it to friends who have also loved it. The eloquence, especially of the last chapter, is terrific.A recommended book is Empire Falls by Richard Russo--also a great book, with a similar theme and dramatic type of writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"Another wonderful book for Mr. Lamb. Emotionally involving, human characters. Anyone with a heart will be pushed to feel more sympathy for the characters than you would think in a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"This had to be the best book I have read in a long time. It felt like I was part of Dominick's family. Outstanding story. Could not put the book down. A definite must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've read in quite a while!","review":"It is quite remarkable how Wally Lamb is able to write with such intensity! This book is a real page turner all the way to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is great","review":"The characters were quite interesting. Despite the lenght of the book, it reads rather quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, and good for you","review":"This was a nice, big, messy book, full of almost operatic characters. I liked it. It's incredibly depressing, however, to realize that the generations keep making the same mistakes and omissions based on prejudice over and over again.One last thing: reading Wally Lamb is like having a guest therapist sharing your home for a few days. I got some nice insights from this and She's Come Undone that have helped me to deal with some of my own issues. Lord knows, Lamb covers every issue known to humankind! Good reads, and good for you, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A VERY COMPELLING,INTENSE READ","review":"WOW,,What a life,Wally Lamb captured one familys' tortured,complex life with such honesty and gave it so much gripping humanity,,,it made me grateful for my comparatively boring family life. I was so entrenched with this novel..that I could'nt sleep for 3 nights,and 3 days...untill I finished it. Alas the ending was just too neat and packaged too perfectly.But will be remembered on my list as one of my all time favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed, it was too slow and the point was...","review":"I was very disappointed after reading for hours and hours about all the tragedies the character is faced with. By the end I was tired and depressed from all the predictaments the poor man was in. I kept waiting for a climax or a revelation that would make my heat leap and it never happened. The hand removal and the monkey scene were shocking to an extent. Although, I didn't feel the author really went anywhere with all of the shocking events. Due to the topics Oprah was covering on her program I was really hoping for a more positive story or a least a more meaningful one. I was expecting a really great book because it was recommended on Oprah's book club but I came away leary of her recommendations."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book I Have Ever Read!","review":"Not once was this book boring, I couldn't put it down once I started reading. It is very long, but it is undoubtedly one of the best books you will ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, well written novel.","review":"A real page turner, can't put itdown. Have to keep reading till youreach the last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Books I've Read This Year","review":"This book is very entertaining and interesting. I learned a whole new perspective of life that I didn't know existed. It was very well-written and easy to follow. It is the longest book I've ever read, but one of the fastest also, I didn't want to put it down. This book is highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"Bouncing back and forth from past to present makes for some pretty fast reading. Is this the same book as She's Come Undone, just different characters? Hey, Wally, it would be interesting if you stretched yourself and tried a different approach for your third book. I've found both of Lamb's novels to be highly predictable -- in fact, I was on an island in the South Pacific reading She's Come Undone, and found 3 critical chapters in my book completely blank. Never fear, I made up my own conclusions and never missed a beat. She's Come Undone is way more fun than these two cry-baby's story. Besides, I won't hurt my back picking up She's Come Undone. There should be rules about how long and drawn out a book should be. Was the Editor in the South Pacific without a red marker? Also to the Editor, typos are not acceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books ever!","review":"I loved this book! The characters were so real to me and I really was disappointed when the book was done. It is definitely the best book I've read in a long time...and I've been reading quite alot lately. This is a MUST READ - a book that I will be lending to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long, but worth the read","review":"When I finally was the lucky recipient of getting this book after four months of reserve at my library, I started the book with a feeling of trepidation that this seemingly interminable book would be 898 pages of dullness. Instead, I was totally engrossed of the story of Dominick Birdsey, a 40 year-old housepainter. Except for the revealing excerpts of his grandfather's autobiography, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and most definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why ruin it for us?","review":"On January 14, 1999 a person from Wilmington, NC wrote a negative review and I believe told the ending. I sure hope not, although now I feel so disappointed. I had just started the book and was adoring it, and usually like to read these reviews for added interest. Surely it seems one can review a work without ruining it for others. May hurricanes rain..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost a work of literature","review":"Having focused mostly on non-fiction, I admit becoming partial to Oprah's bookclub which introduced me to such good books as this one. Despite its length, Lamb deftly succeeds in grabbing the reader's attention right to the end. That in itself is no mean feat. This is a novel about modern America, suburbans and borderliners, normals and abonoramls, men and women, the I and the other, the system and the individual,love and hate, family feuds, doctors and patients,... Lamb's characters are well-developed, well-researched and brilliantly presented. This book is not about binary oppostions nor black and white; the grey is stressed and thus we find ourselves abhoring then sympathising, repelled but eventually attracted, bewildered but finally understanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"His second is better than his first.","review":"I loved Wally Lamb's new book. I have to admit, the 897 pages intimidated me, but I finished it in less than two weeks. I was engrossed with the storyline and emotionally attached to his characters. I could see a little of myself in Dominick. I could see my family having a lot in common with the Tempesta family. It made me realize how we make ourselves believe that the end of our family tree is truly a dead end. Reality states that what we would find on the other limbs would probably surprise us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad . . . in fact, pretty darn good!","review":"Hardly the rib-tickler that \\"She's Come . . .\\" was. Deeper, darker, and more involving to this reader at least. Mr. Lamb seems to be aiming higher this time . . . and he largely achieve his target. Still, my attention occasionally wandered. And I would have enjoyed a bit more levity -- and a lot more of the author's proven wit and acute observational skills. (Maybe next time, okay Wally?) But again, all in all, it's a pretty darn good read which I would \\"highly recommend!!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"An emotional rollercoaster that leaves you thirsty for more","review":"This book was every bit as poignant as predecessors \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" (Salinger) and Knowle's \\"A Separate Peace\\". It was eloquently written with brilliant candor and raw vulnerability. This was not merely a novel, but an experience...In 900 pages I have felt every range of human emotion. Lamb captured the essence of human nature in \\"She's come undone\\", and he has developed it even further this time. This book has haunted me during the middle of the night, and has reeled me in every morning for more. I revel in the thought of his next masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"All time top 5","review":"Wally Lamb has an uncanny ability to create believable dialogue and situations with almost unbelievable characters. I was sucked in within the first five pages and remained captivated. I absolutely loved this book and strongly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"unenjoyable","review":"I found reading this book a chore - the characters were unlikeable , the story was depressing and i thought i would never finish it !"},{"rating":"2","title":"A treatise on self-discovery.","review":"The first 800 pages are really tough going. Then it lets go of your windpipe just enough for you to take a breath. The struggle is worth the effort--the structure of the novel is probably a metaphor for the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting journey of a dysfunctional family!","review":"I enjoyed reading this lengthy book--a view of a totally dysfunctional family, which ended by giving hope to those who feel trapped by a generational \\"mess\\" The building of the characters was very interesting and when you think nothing more could possibly happen---it does! I found it very entertaining and it was something I could put down and pick up days later and still remember the plot, because the characters where so well defined. For anyone who likes to get into the characters heads, this is the book for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"extraordinary","review":"You could give this book ten stars and it would not be overrated. Wally Lamb is a contemporary literary genius. Iv'e read many great books in the past 40 years; none has surpassed this one. If you enjoy a truly engrossing story, and writing at its highest level, then read this book. You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought this was a biography of the band, Spandau Ballet..","review":"...just kidding. Actually, I thought that this book is incredibly slow moving. The characters are not likable. What's even worse is that they're not even hatable. I felt like the book was like a dimly lit black and white movie. I'm 75% complete with this book and I just don't have it in me to finish it. Life's too short for depressing and uninteresting characters that don't help a plot to develop."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Know This Much is True","review":"I read Wally Lamb's first book \\"She's Come Undone\\" and thoroughly enjoyed it - couldn't put it down.However, \\"I Know This Much is True\\" is a disappointment in comparison. I can easily put it down and walk away for a few days and not want to know what happens yet. The story is slow with too many flashbacks, confusing and generally, it doesn't feel like it's worth getting into."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time with this one.","review":"I have to say that this is one of the worst books I have ever read. The characters are stereotyped and insipid, the prose mediocre at best. This is pop literature. In reading it, I was reminded of a Lifetime television film.The world is full of amazing literature. There's little sense, therefore, in wasting one's praise on this more lacking piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"miserable","review":"I would bet my last dollar that Wally Lamb is an absolutely miserable, depressed person. I'm quite sure that all the money he made from this piece of garbage hasn't even got him out of the dark place he is in. I feel sorry for his three sons growing up around the kind of man who would spend his days trying to pass off cartoonish obcenity as literary genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is awful","review":"If you enjoyed \\"She Comes Undone\\", you will not like this book. Reading this book was an arduous experience. Do not waste your money or time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"#1 New York Times?","review":"I cannot believe this book made the NYT's Best Seller List. Furthermore, I cannot believe it has a rating of 4 1/2 stars. This is one of the most disturbing books I have ever read. It has everything from psychosis, child abuse, murder, and vulgarity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"An uninspired saga of mental illness. Yes, you will be able to put this book down. I simply do not believe Oprah read this boring book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful journey of self and family","review":"This is a wonderfully written novel. I thoroughly enjoyed reading each and every page. Anyone who has siblings will appreciate this book. Lamb does a wonderful job of getting into the heads of his characters and evoking their emotions on paper. Definately well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Portrait of a Disfunctional Family","review":"This book held my interest, beginning to the end. One dimensional characters, yet still interesting. While Dominick was a mixture of all of them. It was solid in writing and emotion. If you love to find symbolism in everything, this book is chalk full. If you don't, you won't be baffled. All I can say is...thank God, I didn't grow up in this family!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A life-long favorite","review":"This is possibly the best book I have ever read. There is such a richness to every character; you feel as if you know them as well as you know a close friend. Even when you don't agree with their actions, you know why they react in the way they do. I have recommended this book to every person I know--men and women; young and old. It feels like such an accomplishment to read such a long book, but it reads so smoothly that it felt like 8 pages instead of 897! I didn't want this book to ever end. It was an absolute pleasure to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hard-to-put-down thrilling story","review":"It took me the entire summer to read \\"I know this much is true,\\" but every time I put it down, I couldn't wait to return! This was THE most interesting story-telling novel that I have ever read! I appreciate the capability of Mr. Lamb, and look forward to another outstanding novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put it down!!!","review":"This is the best book I have read. It is long, but reads very quickly. I didn't want it to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It's characters are well developed and touching. Dominick is a well balanced character and his stories ring true to life. Lamb wrote this book in such a way that he made it easy to relate to Dominick and his trails, he succeded. Please read this book you will be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally engrossing","review":"This was a tremendous read for me. As an Italian-American I was most impressed by the author's use of language - standard and dialect. A great feat, and a great story. Hated to see it end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Know this Much to be True","review":"I just finished this book and, after 900+ pages, feel that I got to know these characters. I felt that the main character was very human. Delt with problems the way many of us do. I feel the book could have been shortened and still maintained its integrity. All in all, it was a VERY satisfying read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"I Know This Much Is True is a very interesting book. Dominik, the protagonist, is one of the most complex characters I have ever read about. The relationship between Dominik and his brother is the finest part of the book. Sometimes Wally Lamn gets a little sidetracked with a lot of sex, which becomes monotonous after a while, but other than that, it is an excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping and true to life account of mental illness","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book because it was so breath-takingly honest and so close to the reality of living or being close to someone with this mental illness and how it effects your own life and thinking. As someone who has had to deal with this first hand - this hits very close to home. I think Mr. Lamb is a wonderful writer and his other book \\"She's Come Undone\\" was written just as gripping and wonderful as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"For anyone with a family member with emotional disabilities","review":"One of the most emotional, inspiring novels I have ever read. For anyone who has a family member with emotional problems, this book relates to the guilt of being \\"normal\\", makes you think about what you have in life, makes you feel, and makes you realize that you can't be truly happy until you accept what's in your past and learn to forgive. You follow Dominicks life and feel his challenges, his guilt, his pain. Though I agree the ending was a bit too tidy, it was worth every moment I invested in that book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One book that I KNOW I'll read again!","review":"This book, although a little slow to start, kept me riveted once things fell into place. The sheer honesty of the writing is a fresh change from other authors. I recommend this book to anyone who's looking for an intense story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you stop and think about your own family life!","review":"I really enjoyed this book and couldn't put it down. The author develops the characters so completely that you feel you know them intimately. I heard about this book on Oprah and decided to buy it to take with me on vacation. I spent most of the vacation lounging on the beach and reading this compelling story. I was, however, disappointed in the ending of the book. I felt that everything was wrapped up too neatly and too predictably. It made this nice long story come to an abrupt halt. It won't keep me from reading other novels by Wally Lamb, he's worth another try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but a little long","review":"Just like in She's Come Undone, Lamb really does a good job of stirring up human emotions. But how can so many terrible things happen to one person? One family? Maybe I am a little too overprivledged, but this book was over the top for me..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agreed with every other 1, 2 and 3 star rating listed!","review":"The novel was long-winded, foul-mouthed and downright depressing. While it obviously had appeal to those who gave it 4 or 5 star reviews, I found no beauty or depth in the characters, plot or writing style. Mr. Lamb obviously sought to shock his readers throughout the novel, but with street-language and sexual references that would only entertain an adolescent with raging hormones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a Mini-Series","review":"I was dissappointed in this book; not only because it was predictable but because it focused on the lowest common denominator of human nature. It lacked any positive message and was told like a tired soap opera...900 pages of trash...I hoped for better...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of my favorites...","review":"I simply found it boring and had to stop about half way through. It's just not my kind of book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelieveable.....The best book i have read EVER.....","review":"Wally Lamb is a great story teller.. His books had captured many emotions, each one touched my heart..I know this much is true, is the best book I have ever read. All 1000 pages kept me reading, to the point where i would not put the book down..Wally your the best,..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chock-full of nuisance","review":"Though well-written, I found none of the characters in this novel to be particularly likeable. The narrator, Dominick, was irritating, insensitive, and selfish, which made it hard for me to sympathize with his plight, especially his love problems. Nothing that happened (with exception to the first mutilation scene) elicited little more than a \\"ho-hum\\" from me. With an opening like that, it outweighed any climax this novel could have had. Where was the climax anyway? I expected the ending to be better, but it was highly unrealistic and (dare I say it) cheezy. I don't recommend this book, but I know that I'm in the minority."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Miserable Can We Be?","review":"This novel is a virtual Wal-Mart of the scourges of mankind: abuse, adultery, AIDS, amputation, auto wrecks (those are just the A's). The main character and most around him are in complete misery for all but few pages at the end of this overly-long 900 page book. A quick, contrived happily-ever-after ending for Dominic, but other important characters just end up dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"So depressing","review":"This book was compelling, but SO depressing. The premise was interesting, and I liked the characters, but the sheer amount of tragedy was just too much. I skimmed the last half, hoping for something good to happen.. and after 900 pages of pain and anguish, it all turns out rosy in the last chapter?! Ugh.."},{"rating":"2","title":"900 Pages of Pure, Real Writing","review":"This book is everything you expect it to be, and all the things you don't expect it to be. It is real - sometimes too real, and yet, it still has a mini fantasy novella inside of the real story. Complex. It draws you in and makes you want to keep reading, while at the same time making you want to stop reading so you do not have feel the next blow, or the next disappointment the characters lives through."},{"rating":"1","title":"String of abusive and self-destructive events followed by a quick \\"happy ever after\\"","review":"I read this book for a book group discussion otherwise I would not have gotten past the first 200 pages. It consists of a parade of relentlessly mean-spirited and depressing events strung together for a glacial 900 pages. The protagonist is a self-absorbed and immature jerk who, in the last few pages, wises up, gains some social skills, reunites with his ex-wife, and becomes a millionaire. I don't think so."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far one of the best books I have ever read","review":"I am a teacher, and a frustrated editor at heart. I majored in English in college and truly appreciate and admire the gift of language. (I would also be the first the recommend what I call \\"fluff 'n stuff\\" like The Beach House to anyone looking for a quick read.)Not since Prince of Tides have I so envied the author's craft. This is a must read. Thank you, Wally Lamb, for your gift. Why haven't we heard from you lately?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Wally Lamb","review":"Wally Lamb never disapoints. This book was so moving. I really didn't want to see it end. The author made me feel connected to the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Know This Much Is True","review":"Wonderful! This book gives you a very realistic portrayal of the dynamics between twins or multiples. Thoroughly enjoyable and insightful, this leaves you, also, with many things to ponder once you're done reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard reading, worth the time","review":"It took me several months to get through this book. The story sometimes drags, especially when he tells stories about working for the city. But each time I picked it up, I easily slid back into the world Wally Lamb created. I've read a lot of books, and this one amazed me because as soon as I thought I knew where the story was going, I found a new curve in the road. I loved the ending and how it brought everything full circle. No matter if you are a twin or have someone in your family with a mental disorder, you need to read this book. Lamb has something in this story that you will relate to and be moved by."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Know this much is truly awful","review":"Absolutely terrible. Poorly written, incredibly contrived to the point of being comical. I only continued reading for the perverse pleasure of discovering what absurdity would next be folded into the plot. 897 pages of reading drudgery -- the reading equivalent of doing 897 push-ups."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I have ever read!","review":"This book was one tragedy after another. There was not one likeable character. I waited to see how this was going to tie in to Lamb's wonderful first book She's Come Undone but never made the connection. Wasn't Dominick married to Delores? Who is Dessa? Dominick was an awful but entertaining character in the first book, and one miserable guy the second time around. I will probably not read anything by Wally Lamb ever again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Cup of Tea","review":"Like others, I was attracted to this book primarily because of the author's name. And after reading it, I've come to the conclusion that it's really two books: \\"I Know This Much Is True\\", an entirely forgettable and derivative novel, and the more provocative manifesto that lies between the lines, which I call \\"True Is Much This Know I\\". True Is Much This Know I takes a harsh stance, and almost mocking tone of African-Americans, the mentally challenged and Jews. And while I take issue with Mr. Lamb's hostile stance on these groups, I admire his courage to candidly speak his views on these \\"difficult and irritating\\" groups, even though all Wally Lamb's speaking is done strictly between the lines. Perhaps the most surprising - and disappointing - aspect of True Is Much This Know I is Wally Lamb's uncompromising and \\"factually based\\" Holocaust denial. Anti-Semitism, bigotry and racism are not my cup of tea. So I guess I'm just not cut out to be a Wally Lamb fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shark Jumper","review":"This book could have been really good... If Wally had edited out some of the ridicules plot twists. It is overly long, and has too much going on to be an enjoyable read. I suppose some people may feel like anything that can go wrong will go wrong in their lives, but come on!The narrator repeats himself so many times, I thought I was the one with the mental illness.I would recommend this book to someone who wants to read something interesting, and likes long-winded, far-fetched tales about a dysfunctional family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forrest Gump meets Prince of Tides","review":"I could only get through the first 300 pages or so. Too many shrinks/MSW's eerily reminiscent of Lowenstein in Conroy's Prince of Tides. Like Forrest Gump, Lamb's narrator Dominick trots between present and past and embraces politically-correct-pop-culture nonsense (Native Americans good, white male fathers bad). The basic plot was less believable than that of Forrest Gump, more believable than that of Prince of Tides. Was Lamb writing for Hollywood? Say it ain't so...I did find Dominick's voice persuasive, perhaps because he was so foul-mouthed. Lamb did a pretty good job developing a basically unlikeable character who held my interest for the first 300 pages. (for a much better job at this - in a much shorter book, not coincidentally - see Ha Jin's Waiting.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars","review":"This book was SOOO long and tedious, I couldn't even finish it. I've tried several attempts to pick it up to finish with no avail. It is the same long, sad story page after page. His first book was much better. I was shocked that so many people liked it. If you have nothing better to do with your time this might be the book for you. So it will remain under the bed collecting dust until the next garage sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"I know this much is tr","review":"The book was captivating . I was given this book in hard copy. I had to travel and did not want to carry such a large/heavy book along with a backpack and luggage. I downloaded it from Amazon, I could not stop reading, \\"I know this much is true\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"At first I was anticipating good stuff; I ended hating the book.","review":"This book is over nine hundred pages long. I resent the author taking up my time and money for this BS. Why? His novel, \\"She's Come Undone\\" was so fine and compasionate in the area of mental weirdness. Here in this book he writes about the same thing, it's much longer, and he \\"makes fun\\" of mental illness issues. He obvious had a bad psychiatrist/therapist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I just finished this book two minutes ago and had to review it. What an amazing read. I hadn't read a novel in a really long time, but this one did not feel like the 880-page monster it looks like (in hardcover). I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Birdsey Twins","review":"I'm a very easily distracted reader (so much to read!) so I rarely read a book cover to cover and so I rarely read novels since one cannot very easily skip around in a novel like one can many a nonfiction work.Even rarer for me is to read a novel of 900 pp.Suffice it to say this novel was very captivating for me and hard to put down. I found it VERY well done and realistic (if one discounts the rather pat ending)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Know This Much is True","review":"A wonderful book, a wonderful author. I have also read She's Come Undone. I would love to read more of Wally Lamb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good","review":"I enjoyed this book but i think \\"Shes Come Undone\\" was a much better read, another of Wallys novels. It could be the characters were male and i related better to the female character in \\"Shes Come Undone\\". Id say it was ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I read Mr. Lamb's \\"She's Come Undone\\" and didn't really expect what I read here.I will have to tell you that sometimes, the story gets too wordy, but once you get started, it becomes hard not to get wrapped up in the Twin's life.Takes a while to read, but if you make it through, I think you'll like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"How dysfunctional can a family get?","review":"I don't enjoy reading about all the tragedies that can happen to one family! The first 880 pages delineate each one in painful detail. Then all is wrapped up in the last 20 pages and everything works out peach keen for the main character. I wish I would have spent my time reading 2 or 3 good books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"XXXX","review":"What a shame such a heartwarming story had to be ruined with excessive vulgarity. If I had wanted to read an X-rated book I would have went to an adult book store. After the third chapter I threatened to throw the book in the trash. I will never buy another Wally Lamb book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tragic Journey Into the Heart of Mashed Potatoes","review":"I started to read this book, but I got a toothache so I stopped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb and heart rendering","review":"Wally Lamb has done an excellent job of weaving the love for one's brother with the guilt for gifts not given. In a true-to-life narrative, the author takes us through what it must be like to live for another person while trying to live one's own life - and the pitfalls in between. I found this book to be a fast read and extremely thought provoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lamb proves a lot with this book","review":"Wally Lamb proved himself beyond doubt with this book. When I judge a book, I not only judge it by the plot and writing skill but by the daring subject matter. For example, I marveled that Ken Follett was able to take a boring subject like building a cathedral, tack on about 1,000 pages, yet keep me glued to the book throughout. Similarly, Lamb takes a sad, rather depressing story of two brothers and digs so deep into their persons that we can't help but dig with him to the very core of what makes people who they are and what makes familial relationships so incredibly horrible or wonderful. Lamb doesn't churn out a book every eight months like some authors. It is obvious that he pours his very being into writing a book that matters. This is really a book you should read. Don't give up if it doesn't grab you in the first fifty pages or so. We're too used to sensationalized action thrillers. Give the book long enough to hook you and you will not put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get it out of my head","review":"I had a hard time getting into this book because it is almost 900 pages. Who has time for 900 pages these days? It seemed so disturbing and slow at the beginning.However, thing have changed drastically and now I can't stop thinking about these characters and their stories. Wally Lamb is a fantastic writer. He does a great job of making me feel like I'm right there, like I know these characters. Be warned, parts are not for the faint hearted but so much of this book is so wonderful that it is well worth the read!I am only half way through and I can't wait to keep on reading this book. I only wonder now about what I will do with my time once I have finished this fabulous novel. Maybe Wally Lamb can write a third book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done","review":"I know a lot of people who are hesitant to read this book; mostly for fear that a novel about schizophrenia would be \\"too creepy\\". Actually schizophrenia only scratches the surface of what this book is really about; what's admirable about it is the way Lamb takes so many different aspects of the protagonist's life and weaves them together so seamlessly. The characters are extremely vivid and true to life, especially Dominick who makes an engaging narrator; his voice rings true throughout. Put your jitters aside and give this one a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"897 pages of Lamb wasn't enough...","review":"'I Know This Much Is True' was the best reading experience I have ever had. The novel wasn't so much about 'loss and redemption' as it was of finding who you really are and where do you come from. Wally Lamb has a genuine sense of how a story should be told and how its charcters should be built -I actually miss Dominic now that I've finished the book. Truly a can't-put-it-down-novel. I can't wait for the next Lamb novel..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a great read.","review":"I brought this with me on a plane trip I took recently and enjoyed it immensely. I'm from the part of the world where the story takes place in (I grew up in Westerly called Easterly in the book.)and that helped me picture what he was talking about but I don't think that would have been necessary. Wally Lamb writes about real New England misfits and I hope his blessings are many."},{"rating":"2","title":"The emotionally unavailable male revealed at last.","review":"I loved this book. As a male author, Wally Lamb amazed everyone when he revealed, so completely, a female character in \\"She's Come Undone.\\" I think what he's done in \\"I Know This Much Is True\\" is even more remarkable for he has revealed the biggest enigma of all, the emotionally unavailable male. I'm from back east and of Italian American heritage. I grew up with many Dominick Birdsey's and I feel as though I understand them all a little bit better now. This is a remarkable book on so many levels and I anxiously await Wally Lamb's next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Second's Always the Best","review":"This book was so well written it was hard to put it down. I found myself getting into it a lot more than his first novel of the two, \\"She's Come Undone.\\" Compared to \\"I know...\\", the first was boring and never ending it seemed. Read this novel, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Gifted Writer!","review":"I read \\"She's Come UnDone\\" and I thought that it was an okay book, but it was very depressing. So I was reluctant to pick up another Lamb book. But I am truly glad I did. This was a book that took you to the edge of despair but brought you back. It was so different from his first book. I will never be reluctant to pick up another Wally Lamb book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Terrific Read","review":"I Know This Much is True is one of those books that once you started you are immediately hooked and is impossible to put down. Dominick and Thomas are two great characters that one will remember always, and I fell in love with Thomas, he was so \\"cute\\". Everyone MUST read this book, it is well worth the time. Once you start you realize how literature is suppose to be, and 900 pages never went by so fast!! I recommend this book to everyone. You will love this book. Wally Lamb writes in such a way that it begs the reader to keep on reading, and wishing that it will not end, but we all know that it must end. The only problem with the book is that it is so good, one gets mad when it finally ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! Beautifully structured! Poignant!","review":"Not only is he an excellent writer, but Wally Lamb deals head-on with the impossible plight of the relatives of schizophrenics. If this were the only valuable thing about the book, it would still be worth reading. He gives us hope through Dominick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I didn't get a thing done the 2 days it took me to read this book. The ending was a bit anti-climactic, but everything else was worth it. The way Wally Lamb guides us through \\"poor\\" Domenick's life was great. There were a few predictable moments but mostly I was glued to the page anticipating what would happen next. I also read She's Come Undone and this book is right up there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful saga, well worth the time invested","review":"A beautiful, mammoth work. Emotionally powerful novel. Extremely moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly the best book I have ever read","review":"I have read I know this much is true twice so far and I am sure there will be a third. I identified with Dominick in so many ways, the book was a paralel to my life. We never had the same things happen to us, but they were so similar it's unbelieveable. I praise Wally Lamb for his accuracy of fact, and his ability to bring this wonderful character to life. Dominick has been instrumental to my life and one line has changed my life for the better. \\"Love grows from the rich loam of forgiveness.\\" I can't wait to read his next masterpiece. Dolorice and Dominick are two of the best characters ever developed."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent, life-altering read","review":"I stayed up until 3 a.m finishing this book, and shed more than a few tears along the way. It touched my heart in more ways than I can count, teaching me that life is full of challenge and change. In \\"She's Come Undone\\" I found beginnings of insights that became full-blown as I read the last few pages of \\"I Know This Much is True\\". Many thanks to Wally Lamb, who has given me and perhaps many others a new insight on life and survival, at it's very basic core."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"I read a lot of books of many subjects and types, but this is definitely one of the best books I have ever read. I love the way Wally Lamb writes like he's talking to the reader personally. Such \\"real\\" comments from the characters make it seem so life-like. He writes the way I think sometimes. I can't wait until his next story! Keep them coming Mr. Lamb, and don't change a thing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for anyone!!","review":"I'm 18 years old and this was one of the best books I have ever read. It only took me two weeks to read, I couldn't put it down! I was hooked from the first chapter until the last."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a well written, long book and depressing at times","review":"Wally Lamb seems to bring you right in the story. The story is about twin boys and their lives. It shows just how different people are, even when they are born just minutes apart.This is book is very well written, but it is very long and it really is depressing at times. The characters come alive and I am not sure which character you feel you want to be or you feel more sorry for...Grandpa's story is the best part for me. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Page Turner","review":"I give this four stars because I am prejudicial about giving five out. But it is a great book. I read it in the course of a weekend, becuase it was impossible to put down. I thought, upon reading the plot summary, that it was going to be a cheesy book about how crappy this particular person's life is due to the abuse he suffered at the hands of his father (what a boring plot. It's been done to death), but this book is really about this man's struggle to separate from his twin, while at the same time his yearning to be closer to him. The book is artfully written, and the characters seem almost real. Even the bimbo girlfriend. What more can I say? Read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"900 pages was unnecessary","review":"I read this book per a recommendation from a friend and I just don't get the hype. The first 450 pages were drawn out story of twin boys that took me 2 months to get thru because I was so uninspired by the story and wanted it to get to the point. At pages 450 on the book gains momentum with the story of the grandfathers life, death of Thomas and everything that follows. But even after reading all 900 pages, the book is about angry men that can't get past all the unfairness in life. It was full of physical and emotional abuse. The last 30 pages finally create resolution for the main character that he can move on with his life - too much turmoil and unnecessary long story to get to the final outcome. If this book was 400 pages, my review may be different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensitive story very well written","review":"One of those stories that builds slowly and brings the reader along on a journey into the emotional battery of the protagonist with a mentally ill brother. Worth reading; worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I ever read!!!!!!","review":"Best book I ever read!!!!!!That says it all, I reccomend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't deny yourself the pleasure of this one.","review":"The \\"truths\\" that Dominick learns are poignant and beautiful. If you must know what he knows is true, simply turn to the last page. But it would be a shame to miss the journey.The story searches the souls of many characters to get to the truths. It isn't always a pleasant trip, and at times it's clear that Dominick doesn't want to take it. But the reward at the end provides peace.Wally Lamb writes characters that you want to get to know--warts and all. If it takes another six years for him to write again it will be worth the wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Literature is Alive!","review":"Wally Lamb's first book, She's Come Undone\\" was a treasure. \\"I Know This Much is True\\" has made me believe that TRULY great books are not just a reality in History and English Lit. I rank this book among the 5 best I have EVER read. It is a fiction treasure as well as a beautiful and sensitive rendering of forgiveness, the realities of mental illness, families, and spiritual growth. I have given it as a gift to everyone I know who has a love of books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've ever read!","review":"This is, so far, *the* best book I have ever read!I'm mainly a non-fiction fan, but this one does, as another review stated 'suck you in'....mainly because of the 'flawed' characters, who are so incredibly believable.....as though they're our own family members, friends or neighbors.It truly seems as though you're reading a true story from the heart of one man.There are a few books that can literally make you cry....this is one of those books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to put down....","review":"When I first started reading this book, I thought it would take forever to get through. It ended up only taking one weekend, as I found it hard to put down and focus on other things. I absolutely had to know how the story continued. I am an avid reader and when a book is this captivating and you start to indulge in it, make sure you have free time on your hands, you'll need it. I also read his other novel and I will say that was enticing as well, this one was much deeper and intricate than She's Come Undone. I don't know how anyone could rate this only 1 star. To each is own, I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psychology and Psychological Health","review":"Of course, this is a wonderful, moving novel, as many of you know. From a clinical psychologist's perspective, I found this book satisfying for a number of reasons. The book includes vivid pictures of schizophrenia, twins, abuse, depression, narcissism, cultural issues, effective clinical interventions, and personal growth. It paints a dramatic picture, but it also gives readers a more general image of how we can improve our own lives in sophisticated ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this, not Correction","review":"This is a wonderful, healing book. It is complex, well written and records the multi-generational impact of family. Lamb has done his research and presents a realistic look at schizophrenia, nature and nuture. He also pulls off an ending that I didn't expect, but enjoyed. This is the book that should have received the awards, not Franzen's \\"Correction.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZINGLY ADDICTIVE-YOU DON'T WANT IT TO END","review":"AFTER READING THOUSANDS OF BOOKS, I FEEL I HAVE EXPERIENCED A TRULY GIFTED AUTHOR. WHEN AN AUTHOR CAN DRAW YOU INTO THE STORY AND CONTROL YOUR EMOTIONS SUCH AS WALLY LAMB HAS DONE. HE MAKES YOU GO DEEP INTO YOUR OWN PAST AND HELPS YOU TO FIND ''THE EVIDENCE THAT GOD EXISTS IN THE ROUNDNESS OF THINGS''."},{"rating":"1","title":"I read it to the end, but I wouldn't recommend it.","review":"I was slightly disappointed when I finished I Know This Much Is True, and as more time passes, the more disappointed I am. I thought the ending too pat (the Native American connection, the ex-wife connection, the girlfriend connection), as if Lamb is attempting to make up for all the horrible anger throughout the rest of the book. In addition, some of the important characters (the social worker, the psychiatrist) were empty. Perhaps I was came with too many preconceived notions--I would have liked to read more from Thomas' perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"I found the book to be far too lengthy for its content.","review":"I really was excited to read this book as I had enjoyed so many of Oprah's selections over the years. With this book, the slow start disturbed me right away. It took me until page 232 to decide maybe it was worth reading. Those first pages could have been condensed into 5-10 pages. Then, the major events in the book were in no way subtle. Every big point had to hit the characters with a ton of bricks (each individual brick weighing two hundred pounds) so ten totally devastating occurences came into play with each event. Please!! It seems as though the author wrote the first draft and didn't bother to go back and edit for content. I loved his other books, but found this work to have potential with proper revisions, but it missed the mark and was not worthy of the time required to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was Sad That The Book Ended","review":"Sometimes it is hard to get into a book. I bought this book a few years ago and tried to get into it, and ended up putting it in the hallway closet. A few weeks ago, I couldn't sleep and pulled it out again. The second time around, I found it incredibly easy to get into the story and am soooooooooooo glad that I did. I'm not an avid reader, really, and what I do read I want to be great...not just good. This book was excellent. I was often shocked at how the author could add a dramatic twist to the story in places that I would have never guessed. I am online tonight trying to find another book that is as good as this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the ride ...","review":"After the thrill of reading Lamb's magnificent \\"She's Come Undone\\" I immediately delved into this book with great expectations. Whilst the story flows enough to hold the readers interest throughout I could not help coming away with the feeling that a good editing of the work would have taken it to another level. Irrespective Lamb's ability to captivate a reader with a great story is indisputable. He puts under the spotlight every foible of which we are all capable and mixes it brilliantly with our indomitable capacity to love, forgive and survive so I am not at all surprised that Oprah gave him two book clubs nods. Well deserved too !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal book","review":"This is the first Wally Lamb book that I have read. It won't be my last. This book is simply amazing. It starts with the two brothers, one a paranoid schizophrenic who chops off his hand to dispute the war. From there the story spins. 900 + pages of the best story, turned into stories, that I have read in a long time.These are real people, with real problems, in a real world. Just when you think, \\"good grief what else can happen?\\" more does. couldn't wait to read what happened next - his care for his brother, navigating the relationship with his step-father and his ex-wife, his employment issues, and keeping up with his friends.The writing is exceptional. The characters deeply developed and believable. The story - simply, profoundly amazing.Worth every minute."},{"rating":"2","title":"I know this much is true","review":"I was a little hesitant to start this book as it is tomblike in size(900 pages.) Once I started though, I didn't want to put it down. I cried for the characters. I got angry at the characters. But, most of all, I got to know the characters and really feel for them. Wally Lamb is a great storyteller and outdid himself with this book. I'd reccomend it to anyone who enjoys a good story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"life as a circle","review":"We are continually reminded, throughout life, of the universal values that effect daily life. \\"I know this much is true\\" truly reflects the values of many different people and therefore can truly impact anyone who takes the time to devour this soon-to-be timeless classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wally Lamb has captured my undivided attention yet again!","review":"I finished this 850-plus book in about three days; I was reading as much as possible amidst my chaotic life. Already, I miss Dominick and Thomas' presence. The author, Wally Lamb, allows the reader to get to know the characters so well that you feel like a part of their lives; you desperately want Dominick to \\"get a break\\" in life. I am eagerly awaiting Lamb's next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most memorable books I have ever read.","review":"I am a librarian and an avid reader. I cannot ever remember finishing a book, closing it, and saying \\"wow\\". But that's what happened with this book. Had trouble getting started (\\"Oh no, another weird, dysfunctional family\\") but by the time the grandfather's story began, I was hooked. A wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware: This book will change your life!","review":"Lessons about life, forgiveness, understanding, life, human beings, honesty, respect, love, and many other emotions are magnificently combined into one, absolutely amazing novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A moving page turner!!","review":"Yes, it's long but very much worth your time. I couldn't put the book down and used every chance I had to read it. Although not for the weak-at-heart, it's a very touching story with elements of love, hate, dedication, betrayal, real life, and real death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truth is, its brutal.","review":"Violent, oppressive, and perverse. Woven into its lunatic fabric are at least four murders, a like number of suicides, and dozens of other ugly crimes against humanity. An encyclopedic variety of aberrant sexual behavior is featured throughout. Most characters are disturbed, unstable, or abusive. Death seems the best solution to many problems.Well crafted descriptions of turn of the century Italian customs, immigration, and living conditions are welcome relief, so is nostalgia from 50's and 60's. Discussion of the unique psychological makeup of identical twins is interesting.On balance, dark and ugly. An easy pick for Oprah because it is chock full of talk show loser types to whom her industry owes its existence."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better books I've read!","review":"I have read many of Oprah's recommendations and I have to say that this was one of the better ones. The metaphors used throughout the book will make for many thought provoking evenings. It took me 5 straight days of reading (I had to sneak a lot of time from work) to finish, but I didn't want to put it down. I am definitely adding it to my top 100 list and will tell all my friends and family to make sure they take the time to read this. I am anxiously awaiting Wally Lamb's next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A slow start to a great novel","review":"When I first started reading I Know This Much is True, I wasn't sure how I would make it through the 900+ pages. However, perserverance paid off! When the plot really gets going, it's hard to put this one down. Lamb does an excellent job of building his characters and weaving a detailed plot. I Know This Much is True is a realistic look at modern family life and the struggles between siblings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh come on, seriously!?!?!?","review":"So, I read this book because I heard that it was supposed to be amazing, and Wally Lamb's other book was pretty good. So when I started reading this, I could that it was his style... written well enough for me to keep turning the page. But after the first 300 pages, I was so over listening to the main character whine about how everything in his life sucks and it's not his fault. The ridiculousness of what continued on with this story resembles a storyline from Days of our Lives. And as I kept reading, the more outrageous the things that happened. HOW could this book be so popular and considered one of the BEST books? I think it makes a mockery of what happens in families with mental disease is hit, who DON'T have the craziest of overly dramatic lives and live day to day for REAL. I'm giving it two just because Wally Lamb puts good sentences together. The thing is, there's far too many of them that gets you nowhere, except further in his unbelieveable soap opera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not proceed after one fourth of the book.","review":"I bought this book because of the subject matter, thinking it could be fascinating and if I could have gotten past the terrible language and the taking of diety's name in vain every sentence, I might have found some merit. Why could'nt the author just have told the story without the garbage. This book is going in the trash. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh please!","review":"Only an avid watcher of Soaps would think this book was good. Unlikable characters, over the top situations and a too good to be true ending made me want to burn this book when I was done. It's perfect material for a bad TV movie!Read Stones from the River, Posionwood Bible, The Mermaids Singing, or just about anything else instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"From the ridiculous to the . . .","review":"Well, to the more ridiculous, actually. I felt my first attack of bulemia coming on during the reading of this cesspool of psychodrivel. It's success proves that the the ore of human gullibility is inexhaustible and that Oprah and her readers are its dependable miners. This baby is the mother lode!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites!!","review":"I was intimidated by the length of the book but when my sister told me she read it twice I figured there must be something to it. I love this book and I didn't want it to end. At some point I thought I knew where the story was going....WRONG! The ending completely fooled me.Read it and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The book that sparked my joy for reading","review":"This is my absolute favorite book. The story is beautiful, touching, suspensful, everything a reader wants. Ever since I read this book I have really enjoyed reading for pleasure. The plot contains enough characters to keep you on your toes but not too much that an over abundance of characters flood your memory. I couldn't put this book down. I would say it's more of a chick book, but I hope guy's would enjoy it as well.Just as a side note, I always thought guys were over exagerating the pain of getting kicked in the crotch, but after reading the description and anguish main character, Dominick, encounters, I will never second guess that pain again.I was completely captivated by this novel. Highly, HIGHLY recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book Ever","review":"This was by far the best book I have ever read. I was sitting on an airplane that was in the process of being delayed 2 hours. I sat next to my brother, and my father was sitting in the row behind us next to a 10 year old girl. I was reading I Know This Much Is True, by Wally Lamb, and I satrted crying. This was the first, and only, time that i have ever cried from reading a book. I didn't want anyone to see me crying, but i desperately needed a tissue, so i turned around in my seat to ask my dad for a tissue. He asked me why i was crying, and I told him that my book was sad, and both he and my brother laughed at me. I bet the ten year old thought i was a big baby. in any case, the book was worth the emabrrassment...it was THAT good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Time Around","review":"I first read this book my senior year of high school. Originally, it was the size that caught my attention (I like big books and I cannot lie). However, reading the description really held me in; I was contemplating on pursuing psychology in college so learning about one of the brothers suffering with schizophrenia, the story instantly said HELLO WHY AREN'T YOU ALREADY READING ME.Honestly, this was so good and I've recommended it to many friends of mine. The emotions were written through perfectly. In general, a perfect book. Truly.I came back here looking to pick up the kindle copy so I can read it again since I had lost my copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Introspective and Well-written","review":"It is unusual to finish reading a (long) novel about family conflicts and secrets and be left with a profound sense of hope. the book is complex, involved, and Lamb keeps the story interesting and profound."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"great characters. excellent portrayal of dealing with mental illness without being too heavyabout it. would recommend this novel without hesitation"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the 900+ page journey.","review":"As a working (and reading)mom with 2 kids, I initially found its size daunting. But once I dug in, I couldn't stop reading...in this case, size does matter, I never wanted this book to end. It seemed to be a combination of some of John Irving's themes (animals, story-within-story) and elements of the movie \\"Rainman\\". Lamb's characters are well defined, his grasp of dialogue excellent, and I loved the nasty old grandfather's life story that started mid-book. The only downfall was the quick 'n' tidy ending, where the loose threads were quickly knitted together (relationships with Ralph Drinkwater, remarriage to ex, coming to terms with Ray, etc.) everthing a little too neatly compartmentalized. Can't wait for his next novel,I'm sure it will be well worth however many years we have to wait for it, as this was."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Charybdis of current fiction","review":"Reading this interminable tome is akin to being sucked inexorably into a swirling eddy that repeats itself until drowning would be considered a blessed relief. If Mr. Lamb is the master of anything, it is of repetition, and I was rather hoping about mid way through that he would make good use of combination of booze and Percodan to end the horror. The endless monologue between old man Domenico and \\"The Monkey\\" was the embodiment of my whole reaction to the book - for God's sake, get on with it. In all, it was the most repetivive, tedious book I have plowed through in many a moon. A friend of mine loaned me the book and I read it from cover to cover. What I should have done was skip all the drivel in between."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading","review":"The story is fascinating and very well developed. I had a tough time letting the book out of my hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging and Moving","review":"This is a very good novel that kept my interest and personal involvement as it wove through a story of brotherly love and conflict, a dysfunctional family and its mysteries, searches for one's identity, life's joys and crushing dissappointments, mental illness, cruelty mirrored by kindness, self-discovery and the acceptance of responsibility, and redemption on many levels for many people. This is very ambitious undertaking and could have been a syrupy melodrama, but Lamb effectivly connects all these factors into a very effective and moving story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Settle in...","review":"This book is going to take awhile.. I typically read really fast but this book took me just over two months to read. It was a GREAT book. This book demonstrates the differences and similarities between Thomas and Dominick identical twins. As you read and follow along, you will learn about where they both came from and where they end up in the end. Thomas's illness contributes to much of the struggles that Dominick deals with in this story. With the help of Doc Patel, Dominick faces some much needed realizations of the past present and future. The ending was awesome. Although this novel took awhile it was extremely good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book!","review":"In this novel Wally Lamb shares the life stories of the people surrounding the central character, Dominick and his schizophrenic twin brother, Thomas. Dominick and Thomas grew up raised by their mother, and their stepfather, Ray. In his adulthood, Dominick takes on the responsibilty of his brother's care.You really get to know the lives of all the characters in this novel. These characters are thoroughly developed; the issues/conflicts presented are also fully resolved. Even though it's quite long you really get into it, and I honestly felt a little sad when I was finishing the book because there would be no more left for me to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"LAMB IS SO PERCEPTIVE AND CLEVER.","review":"I picked up She's Come Undone from my 16 year old, who bought it because she liked the cover. Even though I thought that she was kind of young for some of the material, it was too late she had already read it. We both found it to be a book that you do not want to put down. Dolores Price is a character I will never forget. How can Wally Lamb understand this woman so well? He is so perceptive and clever. I saw his next book I Know This Much Is True and did not hesitate to buy it. He did not disappoint me. My daughter also read this one. As much as we liked the first, this one was entirely different but just as intriguing. There was a wealth of material but I would not complain because I feel like we got to know everything we needed to know about the Tempesta and Birdsey families. For a week, I missed reading it....like a good friend had left town. Mr. Lamb....you are a born writer.....Thanks so much for sharing your talent with the world. Keep on writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the allure?","review":"I dutiflly plowed through all 900 or so pages of this book andjust do not understand why it is considered worthwhile. The book wasso full of unlikely and wholesale turmoil -- even including the improbable life of the dead grandfather (one brother killed for adultery, the other for falling off a roof while seeking to comfort his monkey-mistress) -- that after a while each plot \\"turn\\" just made me laugh. Consider this: if you described this book to someone who had not read it, what would he or she say to you? They'd say, I suspect, that it sounded like a bad Jerry Springer show. The ridiculous \\"plot\\" -- if any there was -- combined with the gratuitous adolescent descriptions of sex and needless profanity, made this book banal at best. The only redeeming feature was the Indian psychiatrist, who was a delight. For my two cents -- use your reading time of 900 pages on something more realistic or at least better written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic and Miserable and Gratifying","review":"This novel is like a trip into a mine shaft. It takes you down, down, down, farther than you'd ever think possible, into the narrator's somewhat depressing and pitiable life. Down past a schizophrenic yet Christian pacifist identical twin, down past a failed marriage to a still unrequited love, down past an adolescence filled with the guilt of participation in racism and sexism, down past a shy, mysterious mother, a cold stepfater, and a quasi-psychotic girlfriend. Once you're down at the bottom, along with the hero, you are somehow, in a jarring, confusing, and eminently satisfying literary treat, brought back up by a mysoginistic grandfather and his almost comically ridiculous life story. It sounds, even as I write this having read the book, like it's too much, like it doesn't and can't make sense. But after finishing all 900-odd pages, you'll see the sense and you'll understand the story and you'll scream to read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating and mesmerizing; Lamb touches your heart","review":"Wally Lamb has this wonderful ability to capture your imagination with a wonderful story. Once you start reading it, you simply cannot put it down.I thought that this book would take me a couple of weeks. I believe that I finished this book in a week, and I'm not a speed reader by nature.Dominick is a tortured soul who has reached a point in his life where he is trying to discover who he is. He has spent most of his life protecting his identical twin schizophrenic brother.Lamb succesfully describes every detail of Dominick's life with much grace. Dominick is like an everyman who has been dealt a heavy hand in life. It really becomes interesting when Dominick reads his grandfather's journal.If you want to escape into the wonderful world of Wally Lamb's imagination, then you definitely want to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"If Wally Lamb had stuck to telling the story of the sibling relationship between Dominick and Thomas, I'm certain the novel would have been much better and a lot shorter. There are entirely too many plot lines within this novel (i.e. Dom's relationship with Dressa, Joy's AIDS dilemma, the crazy Italian grandfather, etc.). Much of the novel could have been condensed with the help of a good editor. The ending was also out of left field. I didn't believe for one minute that Dominick and Thomas were part black, Indian, or whatever. Wally Lamb has about three or four novels going on within \\"I Know This Much is True.\\" My suggestion is that he tell the Ralph Drinkwater story. This character seemed much more interesting that the Dominick Birdsey's throughout most of the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty boring","review":"I loved She's Come Undone, and had heard good things about I Know This Much is True so I picked it up at the library. Despite the size, I got through it pretty quickly and wasn't really satisfied at the end. This book was in severe need of an editor. Once he got into putting in every part of his grandfather's book I lost interest in the novel and it just dragged on until the end, with nothing really happening until the very end of the book. I wouldn't really reccomend this book. If you want to read a great book by Wally Lamb, go read She's Come Undone instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried I honestly tried...","review":"I just couldn't get through it. Not one to ever put down a book even if it has lost me the first 15 pages in, I had to give up on this one. Perhaps I am at a time in my life when dark and dreary and down right depressing just isn't what I am looking for. But I promise I will try again, just at a different point in time when I can tackle the horrific imagary Lamb conjures up and get by the social realities I sometimes perfer not to be reminded of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Congratuations To Us!","review":"One can only surmise that the bewildering proliferation of five stars here relates mostly to the Self Congratulations effect, whereby the readers-- many having just finished their first \\"big book\\"-- are, in effect, slapping themselves on the back for trudging through this monstrosity in dire need of a lucid editor. Reminds me of that weird psycho-syndrome in which kidnapping victims fall in love with their kidnappers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip the audiobook this time!","review":"I love Wally Lamb but this abridgement left a string of tragic events behind and took away all of the detail and character development. I actually grew to hate the reader!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"I also found this book hard to put down. The pages fly by. Lamb is obvisiously a very talented writer. The only complaint I have is the sections with his grandfather's diary could have been abridged a little bit and those sections don't really seem to fit with the rest of the book"},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite book !!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"i have never read an author like wally lamb. his writing just completely grabs you from the first page. this story is very compelling and has everything in it that a good book needs. don't be intimidated by the size. it goes so fast, you won't be able to put it down. i have read it twice now. i am anxiously awaiting wally lamb's next book. he is an incredible author. as soon as you finish this book, you will find it hard to leave Dominick's world. Read this book! you will not regret it!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest book I have ever read.","review":"Despite being more than 900 pages, after I finished this book I wished it had another 500 pages to it. I did not want it to end! Absolutely fantastic from start to finish. You will be overcome by emotions from reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!","review":"Rarely do I think about a book for more than a few hours after I read them. This book is different. It was very thought provocing. I truly enjoyed it. There were parts that disturbed me, but that just made the characters more real, more human. Even though it is lengthy it was very easy to get through and did not take me long to read. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes stories about characters!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing style made this book torturous.","review":"I paid my money, so forced myself to wade through this \\"schlock\\". Subject matter should have made one care about these characters. It was downright silly. Trying to get Thomas out of Hatch was drawn out to the point of being ridiculous and I finally didn't care. This was one very predictable book. I could readily see the need for Mr. Lamb to run off in so many directions that you could scarcely keep track of them. SO VERY BORING. Wish there had been less than 1 star I could've given."},{"rating":"2","title":"paralells","review":"initialy, i bought this book becouse of my father and brothers mental illness. perhaps i could better understand if i had anothers experences to examine. i actually found the charactors attempt to deal with his brothers illness and life in general very much like my own. its a gripping novel written by a talented witer.and even though i found no eppiphanys, im comforted that others, in fact, have dealt with these things, and survived. ability to convey such devistation is a great talent, and wally lamb is just that."},{"rating":"2","title":"I know I love this book","review":"I know this much is true, by Wally Lamb, is without a doubt the best book I have ever read - and I've read a lot of books.I admit the reason i picked it up was because of the size - being a speed reader, I'm always looking for big books, but one chapter in i found i couldn't put it down.It made me smile, it made me think, and, extrodinarily, it made me cry.If you havn't read it before, i strongly recommend that you do - I promise you'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"This is my second experience with Mr. Lamb and it was just as wild a ride as the first time. Upon opening the book i was unable to put it down and those 900 pages just flashed by. Just like Delores Price there were times when my mouth hung open and times when i cried (not until the very end). Oddly it ended with something i had been thinking about in regards to my own life - life is a wild and unpredictable ride, all we can do is love a little, forgive a lot and hold on.; its usually worth it in the end. What a wonderful book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stay with this book and it will stay with you.","review":"During the first hundred pages, I was longing for my unread Spenser novel! Somehow, I got hooked shortly thereafter and now plan to give this wonderful novel to my therapist. He will certainly enjoy it as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get past the first 200 pgs., you are in for a great book.","review":"I had a hard time with the first couple hundred pages, but kept with it and found I could not put the book down. I LOVED it. In fact, I have not read another book in a few weeks because this one left me so moved. Stick with it, it is well worth your time in the beginning and I can't imagine anyone not loving this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't want to put it down.","review":"Didn't want it too end, got tired of reading the Grandfather's history, & was sad when it the whole story did end. I know people who have gone through difficult times in their lives & was able to become stronger because of it once they dealt with the horrible things of there past. It's probably more true to life then people realize!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book reached into my heart and grabbed my soul","review":"I was completely taken by She's Come Undone, but never expected I Know This Much Is True to touch me the way it did. It took me on such an emotional ride. At times it was difficult to read on and endure Thomas' pain or Dominick's anguish, but I did read on and am thankful I did. The end was a little neat, considering the emotional mess the book details. The tears pouring out of my eyes on the last few pages must mean the end wasn't disappointing. Finishing the book was. I feel like I said goodbye to my closest friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Profoundly moving; disappointing ending","review":"This insightfull book has the makings of a great classic: murder, mistery, lunacy, violence, compassion, redemption, self-discovery, altruism, selfishness, cultural revelations, horror and forgiveness. But, inspite of the amazing discoveries and revelations about the depths of the human soul, specially the struggles between a \\"sane\\" and an \\"unsane\\" twin sibling, the ending is rather disappointing. It strikes this reader that the troublesome misteries in the life of Mr. Birdsey, the protagonist, all come to an almost picture perfect ending. Wally Lamb cannot resist the temptation of resolving the disappointing and troubling secrets that plague Mr. Birdsey's life. It seems that the trend in North American literature (novels) is that a discerning public cannot handle anything else than a \\"Cinderella\\" ending. Nevertheless, this is a brilliant book and a magnificent read with incredible insights right up to its \\"perfect\\" end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection in 900 pages.","review":"Wally Lamb has truly written \\"the great American novel\\". The story line, the characters...all were written so beautifully that I hated for this novel to end. The characters were all drawn so well..Domenick, of course but also Ray. His pain and guilt was almost palpable. By the end of the book, I felt that I knew Domenick and was happy to see him get back together with Dessa. He had grown. Some other reviewers have said that the ending was just too sweet. I say what's wrong with sweet? Don't make any major plans for a week. Stay home (or better yet, go to the beach!) with Domenick and really enjoy a great read!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW, what a book!","review":"I read this in 4 days! If you are a reader who appreciates good writing, I recommend this novel about tenderness and human relations. Lamb makes it look easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT A BOOK!!!!","review":"I read \\"She's come undone\\" and thought this book, while very diffrent, was just as good. There were some hard spots to get through, but I read it in less than a week! Their lives were hell but, in the end, Hurray for Dominick. His obstacles were huge and almost never ending but, he made it. I can't wait for Wally Lambs next release!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Know This Much Is False. . .","review":"I was hoping to read something as stellar as \\"She's Come Undone,\\" but was disappointed. I'm still not sure what the whole point of this novel was. At first, it seemed to be a statement about the effects of mental illness on the patient and his family. Then, the author swerved into the grandfather's autobiography, which included some tasty parts about his mother-in-law's Italian experiences (ie. killing a man by adding crushed glass to his food). There were many times when, while reading the book, I felt exasperated and misled. And it was far too long! Why so many pages?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful journey culminating in a mediocre destination","review":"I was thoroughly sucked into this book, including the story within a story of the main character's grandfather. I loved the imperfections of Dominick, et al., but was very disappointed in the neatly wrapped-up ending. Life doesn't all work out in the end and I was not expecting it here. Everything leading up to the last few pages, however, was exquisite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book - but \\"She's Come Undone\\" is still his masterpiece","review":"There's nothing like curling up in my recliner with a good book to read - a nice big, fat one too! There was lots of stuff going on in this book, but it was surprisingly easy to keep it all together. Some things were predictable; others not as apparent. It was a good read. I only question: Are all men this angry??? (Dominick and Ray especially....) The ending was as I'd hoped. I'd read Wally Lamb's stuff anyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thinking person's book","review":"This book is for the thinking and feeling reader. Its universal issues and lovingly created characters and story will enthrall, enlighten and encourage. A truly great work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"i loved this book","review":"this book came to me when i needed some escape. i felt lamb did a great job with the struggles that life challenges you with. the truth to me was that, it's all how you look at it. a great book for personal insight. forgive. how wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!!!","review":"It will make you laugh and it will make you cry. Lamb out did himself on this book! The story kept you wanting more and more! I would definately like to see this one on film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most profoundly human novels I've read.","review":"This novel is the story of one man searching his soul to find the truths in his life. It chronicles the trials and tribulations of the sane twin in a pair of indentical twind one of which whom is schezophrenic. This novel Is about the strenght of the human spirit and how one copes with depression. It is quite possibly one of the best fiction novels by a contemporary novel. Spanning three genrations,Wall Lamb's eloquently written novel is as sad and dark as it is happy and optomistic. It truly pays off for all who choose to read it. It is a true experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT a page-turner!","review":"I actually was depressed the night I finished this book. I didn't want it to END! You will be drawn into this book from page one. Wally Lamb is one of my favorite authors. By the way, if you haven't read his other book, \\"She's come undone\\", do so!This story of twin boys grown into men is such a heart warming one. Lamb can cover the twins' grandfather's past without boring you or getting you 'lost'. I appreciate that kind of writing. It's a great read before bed at night. I couldn't wait to get to it each evening! It's an easy read, too. You won't get bogged down in verbage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like it. Really.","review":"There are 200 pages of meat and 700 pages of hamburger helper in this tome of angst. The occasional sparkling line, gem of dialouge and the great ending in \\"She's Come Undone\\" were the things that kept me reading. I quickly grew tired of the sex, the recriminations about sex, the variety of sex, the endless descriptions of sex and, finally, the sex. The other thing I tired of was the analysis, the recriminations about analysis, the variety of analysis, the endless descriptions of analysis and, finally, the analysis. Those horses, while not beaten dead, were certainly on life support.I look forward to the next Lamb book now that he has this out of his system."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY FAVORITE BOOK!!","review":"Honestly, I am not going to spend time repeating the plot or boring you, all I have to say is this book appeals to anyone and everyone. It is the absolute best book I have ever read and I am an avid reader. PLEASE PLEASE read it as soon as you can. I wish I could go back in time and read it for the first time again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly moving; a fascinating story well-told.","review":"I hesitated to begin this book; 900 pages is daunting. At times it was a bit difficult but by the last third you are HOOKED.!!!I found Dominick to be a bit improbable at times but generally sympathetic. I liked his vulnerability, his intelligence,curiosity and basic goodness. This was a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book that I Read This Summer","review":"If you have the time to spend in a great story, this is the one for you. Admittedly 900 pages seems a little daunting but sometimes those books are the best. This was the case here. The characters are human and imperfect and understandable. The story slows down around page 700 or so but it picks up again towards the end. I finished it fast and enjoyed every minute. My TV hasn't been turned on in 8 or 9 days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wally Lamb isn't John Irving","review":"This book could have worked with the Dickensian touch of someone like John Irving. The suffering of Dominck Birdsey can only be matched by that of another fictional character, T.S. Garp. But Garp's suffering was interesting and poignant, and \\"I Know This Much Is True\\" is simply a collection of bad days. This is one of the few books I've read that I thought was poor enough to want my time back when I was done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring!!","review":"As a psychologist, who loved \\"She's come undone,\\" I was very disappointed by this book. I couldn't bear to read it all the way through. Are you sure the same person wrote both books?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trendy, overated","review":"I picked up this book, expecting to enjoy it as much as I enjoyed \\"She's Come Undone\\". This story reads like too many \\"Jerry Springer\\" or \\"Oprah Winfrey\\" shows. Enough about child abuse. I could not even finish it, I was so bored by it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Long !!!!","review":"I bought this book as soon as it came out because I had read \\"She's Come Undone\\" and liked it . I have tried many a time to try to read this book. But each time I try I feel as though it will never end. I would like to read the whole book or at least know how it ends but, everytime I try I get so bored I fall asleep. This book moves way too slow for me! I feel they take way too long to get a point across in this book. I hope his next book is shorter or at least faster paced. I gave up on it. Maybe his next book will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"900 Pages of Woe is Me & It's Not My Fault","review":"I really disliked this book and quite frankly, was bored by it overall. This was a book club pick and after about 1/3 of the way through it, I read through to the end purely in devotion to the person who had selected it for that months reading...In direct opposition to the book--I'll keep my review short and sweet...The lead male is whiny, and a typical excuse maker and blamer. His entire life is a mess because of someone else, or because he couldn't take ownership--never because of his self-centeredness or poor choices. Nothing is ever his fault. It was all I could do to get through the book. Typical not-my-fault schlock.B O R I N G . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"journey into family relations","review":"I enjoyed the length of the book, in fact, I enjoyed growing attached to Dominick. I enjoyed being able to continue the journey with him as he learned about his past, present and future. I found Wally Lambs book an insightful glimps into a modern man's journey of self discovery. I especially enjoyed being led throught this journey by a man who is trying to come to terms with himself and his family. It isn't often we are granted the gift of a man's perspective as he struggles with his own emotions and turmoil. I found myself lanughing, crying and even urging him on as he draggeed himself through it all. I really liked the end, even though some may critize it's humbleness. I belive that there are no parades for or finish lines in victory, just priceless self understanding. This book is for those who appreciate the subtleness of growth and change."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing and intense","review":"This was an amazing book. It was one of those I couldn't put down, read until 4 in the morning, then picked it up as soon as I had spare time. I read it while cooking, making the bed, anything! It's a great story of ties that bind and unending family love."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book like no other","review":"So many stories wrapped into one. Such a brilliant story-teller is Wally Lamb. You can't predict what will happen when you turn the page and you'll be thinking over what you've read for weeks after you finish. A gifted storyteller. A beautiful work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lamb Misses the Mark","review":"I was touched by Lamb's work \\"She's Come Undone.\\" I was incredibly moved by it. That was not the case with this novel. I had an awful time trying to read it. The plot was dull, I did not like the characters, and I was simply disappointed. This novel was also about 300 pages too long. I was beginning to think Lamb just wanted to write for writing's sake. I am aware that many people adored this novel, but I am not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was so bad, I couldn't even finish it","review":"The dialogue in the book was totally unbelievable, the characters were unlikable, and Wally Lamb was entirely too wordy. I found myself skimming paragraphs and saying blah, blah, blah, get to the point already. A very disappointing read, considering how good \\"She's Come Undone\\" was."},{"rating":"1","title":"depressing, definitely not light summer reading","review":"Depicts the worst depravities of life: suicide, murder, AIDS, SIDS, self-mutilation, spousal abuse, ad nauseum. Is this a case of the emporer's new clothes, because it was recommended by Oprah?"},{"rating":"1","title":"300 Pages to Long","review":"I enjoyed Wally Lamb's \\"She's Come Undone\\"--even though I felt by the end of the book it had gone on about 50 pages too long. Now, with \\"I Know This Much is True,\\" the author really goes on too long. You spend hundreds of pages with the main angst ridden character, who just churns through his same problems and thoughts over and over and over, with no progress in sight. The character becames stagnant and all I wanted to do was shout out, \\"Get over it!\\" By the time I reached page 500, all I kept thinking was, \\"this book needs to be edited down badly.\\" I couldn't even finish the last 200+ pages. Instead, I skipped to the end just to see what, if anything, is finally resolved. Several of my friends and family read the book and felt the same way. In fact, my mother said she lost interest half way through, put it down, and has yet to pick it back up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wally Lamb is a God!!","review":"Even better than \\"She's come Undone\\", and do not let the size scare you. This book is an breeze of frsh air, only take breaks for eating, sleeping, boring job, and the toilette. The only two best sellers I have ever enjoyed have been Wally Lamb's two latest books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, puts you in a trance","review":"I had already read Wally Lamb's previous \\"She's Come Undone.\\" This book, as that one, is amazing. Mr. Lamb has such strong, developed characters and puts them in the many situations of life that test us. This book reminded me occasionly of \\"Prince of Tides,\\" although this is better played out. I would definately advise buying it - as I would all of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've ever read","review":"This book is, without a doubt, the best I've ever read. I was a little put off by the subject matter at first...there are many issues in the novel that I knew little or nothing about. Lamb writes intelligently without being condescending, which is a gift. He is able to explain things in such a way that you feel \\"included\\" without getting the feeling he's dumbing it down for you. As with _She's Come Undone_, his writing is intriguing and the story is woven together like a good episode of \\"Seinfeld.\\" Everything comes together at the end -- the ending is perfectly appropriate with a nice mixture of emotion. An absolute masterpiece!! When will he write another??"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was spell bounding.","review":"This book can be intimidating with its 900+ pages, but it was an easy read. It was like reading two stories. One in the present and one in the past. I do think if you can not stomach the aches and pains of mental illness you may find the book to much to read. I liked the ending, it was like a nice cool drink after a hot day. After reading the trials and tribulations it was refreshing to have a simply yet happy ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book I Have EVER Read!","review":"I Know This Much is True is unlike any other book I have ever read before. From the moment I picked up the book, I couldn't place it down, and I literally mean this-- I brought the book with me wherever I went, never pausing to pick it up and delve into it more...The novel touches on a little bit of everything; it is guaranteed to hold onto and find a spot in everyone's heart.This novel is everything in one, I believe: romantic, suspenseful, and, furthermore, eyeopening and insightful.After reading this book, I was enwrapped in awe at what this book had shown me and allowed me to envision about life in general.Don't miss out on this one! It is just too wonderful to surpass!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book makes you think.","review":"It is difficult to get away with a book that is almost 900 pages in these busy times. However, Wally Lamb pulls it off. It is worth the time and leaves you with a sense of completion when you finish this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow to build, but has a gritty realism","review":"When I first started the book I thought it was very slow to build and wasn't sure whether I liked it. As I got farther along I began to appreciate the slow, first person-like narrative. The story is told the way it would have been experienced -- the way it would have been told to you in person. As a Catholic, I could totally relate to the guilt, the stoic control and the insane need to keep the dirty family secrets secret. That kind of upbringing is overcome slowly by small insights (just as Dominick does). [Although I thought the fixation with the ex-wife was a little romaticized.]Overall good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, Breath-Taking, Heart-Wrending, Emotionally-Gripping","review":"Just when you think it is safe to put down--WHAM--there is another revelation or trial for the Birdsey twins. THE perfect summer novel--big, rich and intelligent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a darn good read","review":"I loved this book. Anyone who has a crazy family (and we all do), a mom, a job, a spouse, a shrink, and a past will relate to something here. It isn't often that a book brings me to tears, but this one did and months after I read it I would find myself thinking about Dominick and Thomas. If that makes me a sentimental fool, so be it. It was hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but not as good as","review":"Wally lamb did an excellent job in writing this book. there were a few surprises in it that somewhat shocked and in the same sense captivated my mind. I thought that it was very well researched in the character of the paraniod schizophrenic twin. The events were very real and painful. However, i found it somewhat more predicatble than she's come undone...which was by far his most breathtaking work. i read the whole thing in two days and each time i read it i had to flip to the front to make sure a man had written the story...outstanding five for undone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very thought provoking, challenging and life changing","review":"The book written by Wally Lamb is probably one of the most life changing books I've ever read. I normally do not write my views but I must say that this book touched my soul. The insightful look into the human soul was graphic, violent, tender and compelling.The way in which Dominick's anger was exposed and assisted toward redemption was done in a beautiful but painful manner. This book touches the very heart of the human experience in all ways. I am deeply indebited to Oprah and Mr Lamb for allowing the world to experience this \\"soul awaking in me\\". The book has compelled me to look within my soul and find ways in which I need to heal. This book is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A roller-coaster ride all the way!","review":"As an English teacher, I am constantly searching for new material for my voracious students. This was a great book, filled with a myriad of issues that sparked countless discussions and debates in my literary seminar class.Thanks, Oprah, for choosing another excellent novel by Wally Lamb!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept thinking it might be too long","review":"Throughout this nearly 900 page novel, I kept asking myself what the author could have left out. Now that I have finished the book the answer is - nothing! The authors ability to weave the story through time is amazing. This is one of the best books I have read in a long while. I was a little worried about \\"easy feeling\\" of the ending. Everything seem to work out just right. Other than that, it's a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I was afraid to read it due to its volume. But before I knew it, I'd finished it. I can relate to this book. Family secrets will always be found out sooner or later. In one way or another. Tis is a must read!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine novel, wonderfully written.","review":"I read this in two days, staying up late, getting up early to find out the next tragic and comic turn in the life of Dominick and his crazy twin brother. The best part of the book is the marvelous voice in which it is written -- actually, two marvelous voices: Dominick, the forty year old housepainter who falls off the roof at the most critical time of his life and his grandfather, Domenico Onofrio Tempesta, a Great Man from Humble Beginnings, whose own story is interspersed with his grandson's. The writing is fine-tuned, strong, and, at times, unbearably funny. The best novel I've read in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I could read one Wally Lamb book after another.","review":"After hesitating to read this book, having heard or read that it was depressing (what ain't?) and focused on an unnatural brotherly bond of some kind, I got it anyway, and, so many weeks later, still remember those great scenes: Dominick and the car salesman (a character I think I went to college with) in the car, easing their misery with a joint and a beer; the poor brother overlooking a cliff. The protection one family member feels for another is such a strong thing - and it made a moving base for this novel. But Lamb's being such a verbal painter of an era, a time, a culture of the now middle-aged, is what's so special about his books, I think. Very few authors can take you back - oh, some can take you back to parts you don't want to go to, but not many can take you back to parts you forgot and feel at home in. I hope he keeps it up incessantly."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I have ever read!","review":"Wally Lamb has done it again! I didn't think \\"She's Come Undone\\" could be topped but it has! This book has changed my life. Even though my life was never even remotely close to the hell that Dominick faced, in the end I could identify with his final learnings. Wally Lamb has become my favorite author, and I can't wait for his next book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read!","review":"Wally Lamb did a superb job taking the reader into the lives of the characters in this book. You want to reach out and take hold of the hero and tell him everything will be alright. There are tons of twists and turns and many humerous as well as emotional accounts of 2 little boys who grew up. I highly recommend this book. It's a long one but well worth every second spent reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERHAPS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ!","review":"OK, so I will borrow from a previous reviewer who said, this book \\"deserves six stars\\". I believe this could be the best book I have EVER read. Wally Lamb writes a story like few authors can. He brings depth to each character and shines light on their flaws as well as their strengths. He understands the complex relationship between twins. Lamb shocks us and then helps us see the folly in our rush to judge the characters. Without repeating what everyone else wrote regarding this book, all I can say is READ IT!! Pick up this book when you have time to linger through each chapter. You need time to savor this novel. It would be a mistake to attempt this one for a quick summer read. Instead, when you have time on your hands, curl up in a comfortable chair and discover the characters in this story. You are likely to wish that it would never end."},{"rating":"2","title":"You REALLY Can't Put It Down ...","review":"... and the reason is the thing is just so massive. Once you get it hefted into a comfortable reading position you feel you must keep turning pages (as I did for a day and a half) or you'll never be able to lift it again. And then, when you finally put it down, you keep wishing you didn't have to leave all these fascinating people. If Wally had just dropped the last chapter from this one, amplified it into 900 more pages of \\"This Much I Know Is True 2\\" I know I could easily (and happily) go the distance again."},{"rating":"2","title":"alluring and shallow all at once","review":"I had a hard time putting this book down, and didn't know why. Nothing real \\"specific\\" was there to grasp on to. None the less, he really grabbed my attention and wouldn't let go. I would only hope that the underlinings of the book weren't made so obvious. I didn't get the opportunity to figure them out on my own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clumsily written, but an excellent paperweight","review":"I've tackled many 900+ page books before, but none of them felt as much a chore as Wally Lamb's emotionally manipulative and overwrought I Know This Much to Be True. Well I know this much to be true: Lamb's book is good at pushing the buttons of reader sensibilities by pushing all the hot button issues, but it fails to tackle a basic understanding of good, lively writing. This book need not so much an editor as a mop to clean up the emotional molasses."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bitter disappointment","review":"I was so ready to thoroughly enjoy this book. It starts out with a good idea: identical twins, one schizophrenic, one not,the guilt, the pain, the burden that brings, but never quite follows through. I get the sense that Lamb is trying too hard to write like a man, after he had done so well writing as a woman in She's Come Undone. The text seemed to me too pre-packaged- tough male who needs to get in touch with his feelings, and while I enjoyed this man's search for and through his past (most esp. the memoir of his ego-centric grandfather), the book offers no meaningful end, just a hollow token so we might feel like Dominick has gotten everything he really wants, but then we have the awful realization that it was just another sugar coated, sell-out, ending that left me for one quite unsettled and unsatisfied. 900 pages leads to this? It seems to me that Lamb fell asleep at the typewriter for the ending and let Danielle Steel finish his book for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the best books I've ever read!!","review":"I identified with this book because I have a schizophrenic brother. The book held my interest right from the beginning through the very end. I feel this is a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Read!","review":"Wally Lamb has done it again! I loved \\"She's Come Undone\\" and was amazed at how a man wrote the book since it was totally about a woman coming undone. Now, in \\"I Know This Much Is True\\", Mr. Lamb has amazed me again. I read the book in less than 2 weeks and hated finishing it. I enjoyed the Italian excerpt as much as I enjoyed the story of the twins. I never got bored. Bring on another one Mr. Lamb! I am a collector!"},{"rating":"2","title":"American male from immigrant to psychotic","review":"Although I found the shere number of setbacks that Dominic had to cope with difficult to swallow, I loved the way they were written, and the believability of his reactions, I also stayed with him through his often hidious mistakes becase of his thoughtful and well intentioned reactions to them. Lamb's different voices, as he spoke as Dominic's earlier self in flashbacks, and the awful chauvenist imigrant grandfather in the memoir were very impressive. (Although the way the memoir started with footnotes and italian words left in for scholarly reasons, and then just lost them annoyed me.) The use of the other Male characters as mirrors in which Dominic could see his own flaws seemed, speaking as a woman very plausible, I look forward to discussing the book with males, and to reading \\"she's come undone\\" which I presume is through to the other side of the looking glass. Can he be this convincing on women?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful...","review":"It is a beautiful story of brotherhood,friendship and the hardships of life. A true story of pain and pleasure. Forces you to look at yourself and take things into perspective. An true eye opener!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I WISH THIS BOOK HAD GONE ANOTHER 1000 PAGES!","review":"The dual stories in this book, kept me turning each page with anticipation. I wanted to know if Dominick could ever bring his life together, and be at peace with himself..........Then I wanted to know the deep dark secrets of Domenico Onofrio Tempesta, and how the two stories unraveled to mesh into one another. This book was well worth the hours spent reading it. There was a surprise around every corner, and never, NEVER could I guess what was coming next! Wally's done it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reflective, ---Could not put it down!!!","review":"As a twin, it was interesting to read about the complex relationship between twins--where one ends--the other begins??? So much pain yet the author weaves a wonderful tale of pride, anger, love, loyalty and responsibility. A recommend, particularly for a snowly afternoon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most excellent... compare to Thomas Wolfe","review":"You fall into the lives of these characters as if you fell into a bucket and became the bucket. I know these two men intimately simply by the tale that dragged me kicking and screaming into their asylums, their internal and external prisons and by their love for each other and for the women in their lives. You'll walk away from this book, but you'll come back to it now and again because it just might change your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impossiable not to get totally involed with characters!","review":"This book is so involved you find your self dreaming about it and thinking you are part of. Very long but didn't want it to end, couldn't stop reading. Anyone who has a family member with a mental illness will cry and laugh and relate. Recommended reading if you have a brother or sister with mental illness. Wally Lamb makes you think you are the person he is writing about. I loved his first book too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't wait for the book to end","review":"I couldn't wait for this book to end. To me, the quality of a great book is that you are sorry that it is ending; this book made me wish it would just be over. I can't understand why so many people are raving about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frustratingly Delicious!","review":"After a slow beginning, I locked in about one third of the way through. A beautifully written profile of family dysfunction and how we have the power to turn it around if only we can forgive others and ourselves. My biggest complaint is the constant, not just occasional abuse of the Lord's name. Was that necessary every other sentence? No one else was disturbed? I am sure Wally Lamb wanted to portray a \\"Godless\\" man, but, oh please!! Take out the bad language it was a perfect read!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A GOOD BOOK, WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!","review":"I thought this was a very good book. I think there could have been a little more to the ending but other than that it was excellent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it.","review":"I'm usually not a quitter, but this book bored the heck out of me about 2/3rds of the way through and I just had to stop. It was sooooo slow and boring. I can't really think of anything good to say about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An idiotically long overdrawn story with Drab psychobabble.","review":"It is typical that Oprah Winfrey would choose such an idiotic tale of woe because she feels that it will let her audience \\"get in touch with thier problems\\". Spend your time elsewhere and let other idiots buy this book to try to get on national television to meet Oprah (A WOMAN LIVING OUT OF WEDLOCK WITH A LOVER AND WHO FLAUNTS IT ON NATIONAL TELEVISION - WHAT A \\"GREAT\\" EXAMPLE SHE IS)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was trashy and I hated it.","review":"I can't figure out what all the hype is about. I found this book offensive, filled with foul language and a deffinite waste of my time. If this is the sort of trash people think is a fabulous must read, I fear for the moral decay of our civilization. I was disappointed that Oprah would suggest such a depressing and lousy book."},{"rating":"1","title":"bleh","review":"This book--not so great. I'm not impressed with Oprah's track record so far. I know I will meet alot of opposition to this, but this book is not interesting, especially considering the fact that you have to wade through 5 million pages of it.I am a twin, and found the book smacked with insincerity as far as that relationship. The writing style was annoying, and the ending a completely unrealistic letdown. Don't buy this book unless you have bad taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh, I Thought It Would Never End","review":"This is the most overrated book I have ever read. I kept waiting for it to get interesting and it just never did. I agree with one critic when he said: \\"This is not writing. This is typing.\\" Unless you like the classic writers of the Russian genre, where every little detail is set down and tramped on, you will not like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"(I'm on bended knee) - \\"Not Worthy..\\".","review":"I see so many reviews, and my only hope is that through the voice of my humble opinion, one more person will pick up this outstanding novel and read it through to the end to be as moved and awed as I was by this truly amazing story.Late at night (very late, because I couldn't put it down), while reading Dominic's grandfather's book within a book (the cherry on the sundae), I would tip-toe to the living room and shut the door so that I could read and laugh out loud and not wake the whole house.If you love a good story that gives you memorable characters - get this one - it is phenomenal."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dissapointment Next to \\"She's Come Undone\\"","review":"Having fallen in love with Wally Lamb's first book, \\"She's Come Undone,\\" I assumed I would enjoy \\"I Know This Much Is True\\" as well. But almost 200 pages into this behemoth of a novel, I was ready to put it back on the bookshelf and move onto something more entertaining, more enlightening, more redeeming. Not only has Lamb failed to make Dominick a character I could in any way relate to, he has failed to make me care about any of his predicaments. Nevertheless, I read the whole thing, hoping that through the ending, at least, I would find something to sink my teeth into, beit language, plot, or humanity. I found none of the above. The summary-like ending was highly anticlimatic - a \\"perfect\\" fit with the rest of the 896 pages. At the heart of this book is a good story. Perhaps Wally Lamb just needed a little more time, and a better editor, to find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"When will it ever end???","review":"I loved Lamb's book \\"She's Come Undone\\" and I suppose that I expected the same here...but I was sadly disappointed. The characters seemed to drone on and become more pitiful by the moment. The interspersed stories of various characters were incredibly lengthy and boring, and didn't add much to the story. Not to mention the fact that suicide seemed the only way out (for me) towards the end! Would only recommend it to someone in need of some serious downers!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly in need of editing.","review":"Tempted by the wonderful memories of Lamb's first book, \\"She's Come Undone\\", I dove into this needlessly thick second book. The main character was a rambling loser, which could have been interesting. Instead, I kept wishing he would gain some insight, or say something clever, or perhaps die. Rather, there was a great deal of cluttering free association and meaningless chit chat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much ado about very little","review":"Again, I am appalled at the outrageous support this novel has received from so many. I bought it with a lot of anticipation, having enjoyed She's Come Undone, even though that book was flawed, it was at least an entertaining read. This tome however, is a depressing mishmash of pschobabble, dysfunctional family memoir, and boring, unnecessary Italian immigrant history lesson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved \\"She's Come Undone\\" but skipped chapters in this one.","review":"I was so stoked when this book came out because I loved \\"She's Come Undone\\" and recommended it to everyone I know. When I started this book I was intrigued by the first chapters - Thomas cutting off his hand and learning about the history of the Birdsey's. But, nothing about this book ever drew me in. I liked Dominick but this book was like a bad joke where one bad thing after another happens. There was no real substance to this and after a while it was so predictable that I could have written chapters myself. Also, I thought the grandfather's story did nothing for the book and could have cut down the size considerably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fatally flawed","review":"I wanted to like this book......I tried to like this book......I really liked large chunks of this book....The subject is interesting, I liked the main character, Dominick, and his brother Thomas, and all of their bizzare friends, family and situations. I don't have trouble with lengthy books. I was buying the whole thing.....until the \\"text-in-text;\\" it didn't work. I know lots of Italians and none of them are obsessed with monkeys. I was really disappointed. I cried at the end...it was touching, but mostly I was discouraged. I thought Lamb had potential as a writer but I'm starting to think maybe not. If you want to read a really well-written \\"text-in-text\\" with plenty of dysfunction to go around, try Posession by A.S. Byatt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honestly, the best book I've ever read","review":"I read this book more than 10 years ago, and I have yet to read anything since then that even comes close. I agree with the other reviewers, that the first 200 pages are kind of superfluous. The beginning is a little slow for my taste, but still has enough momentum for the reader to keep going. Once you round the 200 page mark, the book becomes an unbelievably quick read - all 900 pages! When anyone of my friends asks for a book recommendation before I recommend anything else, I always start with Wally Lamb's I Know This Much is True. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most popular and biggest-selling Salsa albums ever.","review":"Released in 1988, \\"Un Nuevo Despertar\\" was one of the all-time bestselling and highest-charting Salsa albums of all time. While the monster hit \\"Ven, Devorame Otra Vez\\" was a worldwide hit that not only topped the Billboard Latin Tropical charts but also made an impressive showing on said publication's Latin Pop charts (something which doesn't happen every day!), \\"Si Te Menti\\", \\"Tu Iluminas\\", \\"Voy A Escarbar Tu Cuerpo\\" and \\"No Te Voy A defraudar\\" were all big hits as well. Of course, the uninhibited erotic (sexual) content of most of this CD's eight songs gave plenty to talk about back in the day but Lalo Rodriguez was (by 1988) an accomplished Salsa singer whose work with such Salsa legends as Machito, Eddie Palmieri and Tommy Olivencia proved that he had plenty to offer. It sure would be nice to hear new music from him in the future. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Book too basic","review":"Cover of book indicates it is for all levels. Actually the book is very basic and does not adequately go into the advanced features of PowerPoint.

Customer service rep will not refund your purchase after 30 days! The software claims it will compute driving routes for you...but it will crash your PDA instead.

We've launched space probes to the edges of our solar system. We can even remotely drive little vehicles along the surfaces of other planets.But we can't design a simply on/off button.The on/off button for the Blue Logger is one of the most insanely stupid things I've ever encountered. Some mentally-challenged engineer somewhere decided that you have to hold the button 2-4 seconds to turn it on, and 2-4 seconds to turn it off.It doesn't *sound* that difficult to do, but in practice it is infuriating, especially when you are trying to turn it on but end up turning it off. Right now the Blue Logger is sitting in front of me and I cannot turn it off. It simply will not turn off.Oh, and I've had lots of problems connecting it to my Bluetooth adapter, and have yet to get Street Atlas USA 2005 to recognize it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't work for me","review":"I am trying to get this to work for the last 2 weeks ... unfortunately without success. I bought the bundle #3 (Bluelogger & Street Atlas 2005 & Street Atlas 2005 Handheld). The installation went fine, but I had problems in hooking up to bluetooth. I had to reset my HP iPAQ 2215 several times in this process and my IBM T30 (2.4 GHz and with 1GB RAM) was very slow ... not sure why this was.Once I got the laptop to work, I took the Blue Logger out for a trip and downloaded the trip when I returned. Well, I coudn't make sense out the data the Blue Logger logged - the waypoints were almost all over the map. This was not the route I took.I am still within the 30-day risk-free guarantee and try to return it next week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't support windows mobile 5.0","review":"I am very disappointed in this product. I purchased the Blue Logger to use with a new Dell Axim X51v (which I purchased to use with the Blue Logger). I found that I could not make a Blue Tooth Connection between the Blue Logger and the handheld computer. I contacted Delorme & was told \\"At this time we do not offer any support or updates for Windows Mobile 5.0. Hopefully in the future we will be able to offer updates for compatibility but currently there is no timeframe.\\" What a ripoff. Delorme has a product that is not even compatible with the present PC Handheld operating system.I have also found that I cannot upload routes created on Street Atlas 2006 to the hand held. Basically I have a little electronic map with no functionality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delorme Blue Logger","review":"I have used this device for over a year. It is an acceptable GPS device but loses the logging function whenever it is turned off. To enable logging, you then have to use the computer software to enable it. This makes it useless as logger unless you set it and immediately use it. If you turn it off, it loses the data. I have returned it to Delorme for service and was assured it functions perfectly. I assume they are referrring to the GPS function. It is no better than a paper weight as a logger. If you want one, buy mine.

It matched up to my 5d Mk1 and MK II in terms of shots/charge. The only reason I gave it 4 stars vs 5 is due to the quality of the locking switch on the battery, it feels a little flimsy, I am going to take the end cap from my old Canon batteries and just put them on the Lenmark, it is easily done with the removal of two small screws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine.","review":"I charged it, discharged it, recharged it to get started. Also used it until completely discharged and then recharged it. When I use this battery my Canon 1D MKII has from 2 to 5 \\"err99\\"s per charge. It is simple to clear by popping the battery and turning the camera back on. But this is quite distracting. Since this is my hobby, no money has been lost due to this malfunction. I have two other batteries and the err99 does not occur with them, regardless of battery level or type shooting I am doing. Otherwise, it is fine. After using it for a few months all problems went away and it is operating as well as a Canon battery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Third party batteries are a low-stakes gamble","review":"Having recently received this battery, I cannot attest to it's longevity.However, I can comment on how well the one I received fits a Canon EOS 1d Mark II, and the verdict is poor. I have added a product image to demonstrate the gap between the battery and the camera body. You can decide if it is acceptable.I did swap the end cap from the dead (OEM) Canon battery onto the Lenmar pack and surprisingly the fit was no better, leading me to the conclusion that it is the pack itself which is slightly misshapen.I am going to fall back on the \\"you get what you pay for\\" cliche and recommend buying the original NP-E3 from Canon. That's what I did, after realizing the cost \\"savings\\" was more than offset by the stress I would feel using this battery if a rain cloud blew my way.I will keep this in the rotation (on sunny days) in an attempt to preserve life on my new OEM Canon NP-E3."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice paper weight","review":"The Lenmar has never fit my Canon 1Ds.

The original battery I had lasted less than 100 shots, but the new ones been going strong at 400+, and keeps going! For the price, these are the best. The only negative on the batteries, is that the turning pin, is plastic, and looks like it will not last as long in the wear department.

I'm a photojournalist at a smaller daily paper, shooting between 3 an 5 assignments per day.The battery fits the camera without any issue and it hasn't even shown the half-used symbol after a week of shooting.

A really bad place to put the warning sign. It is sewed very well on there too, we were able to get it off thankfully. Also the music box feature with music and light and vibration is underneath the lace on the front.

If you don't read this you'll be missing out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cyd and company","review":"I loved this book. I loved the realistic twist and the funny humor. (This book has some great one-liners!) The characters are what really pulled me in. The are so funny, cool, and I just wanted to get to know them even more then the author, Rachel Cohn, would let me.Overall, this book is about a senior in high school, once again getting to know her boyfriend, Shrimp. Yes, she has a past with being pregnant with hottie Justin's baby. Cyd is just someone trying to find her way before she leaves high school, not to her dismay, and have a life with her boyfriend or maybe not. :) She learns what happens when she makes bad and good choices. Cyd is just a girl, like you and me, being in love and not really knowing how to deal with it.I give Rachel Cohn a big hug because this book rocked!! This was almost as good as the Gingerbread, Shrimp's sequel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shrimp","review":"Book was in excellent condition It was as if I bought it at a store brand new The only difference was the price Excellent service I will be shopping here again!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Way Over Priced! Decent Lighter.","review":"I've had many of these.. used to sell them at gunshows. A good lighter, but not the best. However, you can get these 2 for $14 if you look around. $24 each is a major rip-off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a butane lighter. Not sure what is windproof about it","review":"This is just a regular lighter. It takes lighter fluid. It was a waste of money. I bought it because I thought \\"windproof\\" meant a butane torch lighter. I was wrong. Save your money, get something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Right out of the box, the product does not work. I took a chance on this lighter and I am sorry I did. Its nice that sparks come out when I hit the ignition but no fire. It means either this product was shipped broken or came with no fuel to begin with. Either way, this is not how a lighter should be shipped to a customer. I did not bother to ship it back as my time is worth money and for me to pay for shipping for a $12 lighter is not worth it. Besides how it looks, this lighter does deliver what it promises. At least the lighter should come filled with fuel or not broken. Don't fall for the slick looks. I am bit suspicious that maybe all the past rave reviews are posted by the employees of the seller."},{"rating":"2","title":"great lighter","review":"holds fluid way longer than a zippo and lights really well. great price too!!!feels sturdy and the flint is easily replaceable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality","review":"I'm very pleased with this purchase. The lighter appears to be of a less heavy duty contruction than a Zippo, but tough enough. It has lit every time, and is more \\"windproof\\" than I would have expected. It's quite a looker, even a conversation starter. The removable tank is useful for lighting things like pipes. I would buy another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haters gonna hate!","review":"I don't know what there is to complain about. You can get an interesting and functional lighter for $11-$12. I know people who spend that amount on 2 cups of ____bucks coffee. Don't compare this to a zippo. I have a few zippos and love them for what they are, just like i love this IMCO lighter for what it is. Apples and oranges. If you are lighter enthusiast you probably know that IMCO is way old. The only lighter company that is older is Ronson. This lighter has a very interesting design, as did most Ronson and IMCO lighters. A guy at work saw my IMCO and ordered one for himself, He doesn't even smoke, he just thought the design was great.For the price it's easily a 5 star item.Oh, i've had the IMCO i purchased on Amazon for a few weeks now. So far it has lit on the first try every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"works well","review":"While convenient for many, and lucrative for the manufacturers (and shareholders,) the disposable lighter is an appalling waste of energy and materials. I bought one of these a few weeks ago after tiring of throwing out the disposables. Now the only consumables are the flints and the fluid.As for the design, it is almost perfect. I find it particularly neat that you can pull the reservoir out of the housing to use as a candle, and the striking mechanism is brilliant as well. One minor complaint is that the flimsy adjustable wind shield got loose and eventually fell off; it seems to be something of an afterthought. For such a low price, however, this is not a big deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool, not for everyone","review":"IMCO's lighter has 2 features not common among flint-started oil lighters.First, it ignites automatically when the lid is flipped open because the striker wheel is rotated by the lid.Second, the flame height is adjustable by sliding the outer sleeve up and down to reveal vents (opening the vents increases airflow).Now here's the warning...This lighter is assembled from a bunch of pieces of pressed sheets of metal, while people generally expect modern products to look as cohesive and solid as possible. I don't know the history of this brand, but it looks like a very clever design which made the most of very cheap manufacturing processes. I think this adds to the awesomeness, but it might not appeal to people who want everything to look like an ipod."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"I received the Imco triplex in a mini brown envelope encased by cardboard. I should have read the description of \\"not in original packing.\\" That's fine, but what I received was the lighter with 5 stars engraved on the flat spine side. This is not what I ordered. Do not want cheesy star engravings on my lighter. Price should also be cheaper without original packaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre at best","review":"This is simply not a very good lighter. Bought one for myself and my brother in law and we both have moved on to a zippo. For a couple dollars more just get a zippo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not do it","review":"I purchased this lighter because I believed it would light in the wind as advertised. IT DOES NOT! A light wind blows it out. So I would not buy this lighter again."},{"rating":"1","title":"all around not worth it","review":"first thing you notice is it smaller then it looked in picture. next wasnt that practical got very hot if lit for over 10 sec and moving peices got jammed easly. in my opinion just get a zippo, heck a disposable bic is better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"no flint","review":"So I knew this lighter wold have no fuel when I bought it, but it also did not come with a flint. Way overpriced for no fuel, no packaging/directions and no flint."},{"rating":"1","title":"MEH","review":"This is an inexpensive lighter, and cheaply made, I think I would have preferred a Zippo. IT works but, MEH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lighter without the fluid?","review":"It is an okay item but at the same time I had one big problem. I hear others saying something about fluid, and when I got mine I had constantly kept lighting it, all i did with the wick was just catch red, it never stayed as lit as near as close as the shown picture. It just came with the metal part, the flint, and the cotton thing to keep it lit. I didn't get any liquid in mine or fuel, I would at least have expected it to. And if it does it should at least say \\"Product does not come with fluid\\".I don't know where to get the cotton after taking it all out since the cotton it came with, after constantly trying to get it lit, had ran out. That is my current and possibly only reason for 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy elsewhere","review":"I purchased this lighter to replace the IMCO lighter that I lost. IMCO makes great lighters and I loved my old one, however, the one I received from this distributor was not acceptable.The lighter was shipped in a small brown envelope that was not even properly sealed. The package was labeled \\"Austrian Windproof Lighter New\\" which seemed sketchy to me. My suspicions were correct when I looked at the lighter and realized it is not the lighter advertised or the original IMCO Triplex. The lighter I was shipped has five raised stars down the side, not what I had ordered.I will be returning this item immediately and purchasing elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent - but....","review":"Decent lighter but I did see anything in the listing that it was not butane. It just says windproof so I Assumed it was butane. Good luch lighting it with even a slight breeze."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it at first, but then","review":"At first this was a great purchase: it is relatively cheap, reusable, windproof (or more windproof than most lighters at least), and it looks classy as hell.Unfortunately the first one I bought simply broke. I pushed down on the... trigger thing... one day and it got stuck halfway. Nothing I did could make it budge. I figured, well, maybe it was a bad apple. So I buy a new one. I guess this one hasn't broken yet, but it does have the quality that it loses its fuel rapidly when not in use.I gave up and went back to disposables."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible lighter - Very non practical","review":"This is a nice lighter if you are a collector.It is not a good lighter at all though, not good for camping, not good for taking out anywhere. Maybe good to show off originality for a one time use only.The fluid dries up in just a few hours of non use.When used, it heats up very fast making it unusable and dangerous actually..I was hoping to get a useful practical original lighter, got a useless lighter instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"lighter fluid dries up fast and by no means is it wind proof. With a 4 star rating i was expecting a lot more."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"I'm going to review this in comparison to Zippo.Pros: Compared to Zippo it is slimmer, has a pull out reservoir for lighting a pipe, fire or something else you would need that for.Cons: smaller amount of fuel than a zippo. Wick burns out faster, but is longer. Chews through flints faster. Obviously cheaper construction, thinner metal, sharp edges, rattles. My sparker has gotten really crappy after only 4 flint changes.Thoughts: Get a Zippo, they are better built lighters and have a lifetime warranty. If you need to light a pipe you're not going to be using a petrol fluid lighter, if you're lighting a fire, get some swedish fire steel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Supported by QuickBooks means it's NOT USABLE!!!!","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE!!!

I'm not about to reveal any details, but this series is a spin-off of the 2000 movieSaving Graceset in a small fishing village on the north shore of Cornwall, England. If you have not seen it, you should . The (different) Doc Martin is a secondary role there, perhaps more whacky and amiable.

Would have been much better with closed captions but still great TV. Martin Clunes is incredible and the show is visually stunning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last season of Doc?","review":"Having seen all of season 1 and 2 on PBS, I just had to see the rest. Doc Martin did not disappoint, but I wish his character had grown beyond being just a doctor. Maybe the new episodes filming in 2011 will allow him to grow, but then that might not make for the silliness we have become used to in British comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This edition is a rip-off","review":"While this book is very interesting, do not buy this version. It is a slap in the face. Considering it's published by a Christian publisher, it's a shocking display of parsimony. All they did was Xerox the original book into this new binding. They charge $49 and did not bother to reset it. I'm amazed. As a result, except for the front matter, the whole book looks like it was published in the '40s. Broken type, uneven lines, archaic typeface.Really really shoddy. Buy a used copy of the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great food!","review":"This version is ground. NOt my current cat's favorite version, but he really likes the taste. I do wish they'd make this one not ground but in the pieces variety too.

Why, I don't know but it seems to be a little richer than the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an actual Cisco part.","review":"I spoke to customer service about these.

I'm sure they probably work just fine and I will revise my review if they correct the description of this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Velvety Latin Sounds","review":"SHearing was a master at velvety latin music. These two albums represent only a portion of his vintage latin albums released in the late 50's & early 60's. Both of these albums work perfectly together on a single CD. Shearing uses a latin combo to produce lush textures that make you want to slip into a smoking jacket and pour a martini (or margarita). I highly recommend this CD. I'm only hoping that more of the Shearing's latin catalog gets released on CD soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool Cayenne still hot","review":"I don't understand; I tried the cool cayenne, and it was still hot hot hot in my stomach.Has anyone else experienced the same thing?I read somewhere that if your mouth experiences the hotness first, it somewhat prepares your stomach for the cayenne. I just swallowed the capsules because I didn't want the hot burning in my mouth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great food, but a little pricey","review":"This stuff is really nice to have around as a \\"special treat\\" for your cat, but I wouldn't introduce it as a regular daily diet or you may wind up in the poor house. It's pricey and the cans are very small, but if you want to spoil your cat for his birthday, holidays, etc., then they're great for that. My cat doesn't really care for most of them - he prefers the chicken hearts and livers the most, but could care less if he has it or not. I buy these occasionally, but it really isn't worth it too much for me to do so because he just doesn't care that much about the taste. It doesn't drive him to his dish and actually, he leaves a lot of it there and just wants his regular old Friskies. I have a Persian too, just like the commercial, but mine doesn't really like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and Fast Game","review":"This is a simple and quick game that is great for two people with a few minutes to spare.

It was written in a period when Industrialism was increasingly establishing itself over Craftsmanship. Gill starts by analyzing the clash between these two worlds, then goes on to situate typography in this melee. Most of the book concerns Gill's views on correct typography, some of which seem quirky. Gill is unique: his forward style and searing insight are inspiring and refreshing, even after six decades. The last section of the book is Gill's proposal to convert written English into phonetic writing, avoiding spelling/pronunciation inconsistencies and increasing efficiency. It makes great sense - typical Gill"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful little book","review":"As a type enthusiast, everything about this book made it enjoyable to read -- the form factor, Gill's distinctive typesetting, and wide-ranging subject matter. While there is still plenty of hard advice about how to properly use type, I found Gill's exploration of the man-versus-machine design conundrum far more engaging: it's a profound look at the role of the artisan in an increasingly automated world."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 7-year old daughter thinks it's the greatest!","review":"My daughter decided that her birthday party was going to have a Scooby-Doo theme....so, as the ideas got rolling and I was searching the internet for inspiration, I found out about the Scooby Doo CD.

You get all the Scooby Doo themes, plus tons of songs from the shows. There is even a Scooby Doo club mix! When I was little, I watched the show a lot, and this CD really brings back memories.

The CD is still okay; I even like the booklet with the full names and profiles of Scooby and \\"those meddling kids\\" we've come to know and love. I just misunderstood the product description; I'm such a big Scooby fan, when I see something Scooby, I just \\"click\\" to get it.

Neither Miami 05 or Without You Near came close to the excellent Coldharbour Sessions, but Ibiza 06 truly is a return to form and features the complete range of his signature sounds - deep, brooding, balearic, trancey, uplifting. Fans of Markus will love this - the mixing is typically excellent and the gradual build-up of both CDs constantly interests, entertains and invigorates. Highlights include 'Louder', 'The Shelter', 'Yearzero', 'First Time (Funabashi Rmx)' and the excellent 'Where It All Begun'. My one complaint? Roland Klinkenberg's 'Whats the Point' - it's boring, repetitive, monotonous and it simply doesn't belong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album, Just Missing a Little Something","review":"I have been enjoying this album a lot, especially the first disc.

If you already own the first book in the series, \\"Gone to Texas\\", go ahead and add this to your shopping cart right now. The first storyline is well worth the 11 bucks.Unfortunently, the second story arc found in this book, \\"Hunters\\", is unbelievably dull. Don't get me wrong, it's good, but hardly anything happens. A load of new characters are introduced, and it takes FOREVER to learn who these characters are and what motivates them. Even by the end of the book, you STILL don't really know what Herr Starr is all about, and thus you gotta buy the next book.This collection is great, and the first storyline is stupendous, but it just doesn't live up to the standard the original TPB laid out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit big","review":"I was looking for something smaller.

Sure, some of the details are outdated, but there isn't a travel guide out there where that isn't the case. What I like about the Bradt publication is that it rounds out the hiking experience, offering alternatives and interesting insights. I have found especially valuable the 1995 ed. section on Bolivian National Parks--the information provided a gateway to some amazing adventures I had in the Apolobamba (a must see) and Amboro National Park.

I did think the examples could have been bigger, but our site is so specialized the examples might not have been helpful anyway. I thought the writing was very clear and I was able to better understand Commerce Server concepts, which I have been struggling with.

This section would talk about the relative difficulties of large team development with C2K2.A second edition to this book would be a complete site using C2K2 with the type of extensions that most development teams will have to make.The next edition could be something like \\"C2K2 by Example\\" or \\"The C2K2 Cookbook\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best book, the only book","review":"I'm in the midst of an e-Commerce project using CS 2002.

Where's an example that isn't just \\"starting with a solution site\\"?The structure of the book is awkward, there is no introduction into the CS architecture with an explaination of the various objects. It is up to the reader to notice an object being used and to figure out it's interface from existing online documentation.This book is little more than a rehash of the existing online documentation, just a little easier to sift through.

It lacks the depth in real world examples and particularly in the sample code area. Many times it is mentioned that the solution sites provided by Microsoft are not good designs for production, highly scaleable stores, yet most of the actual code samples are stripped straight from the solution site code. It would have been nice to see the author(s) invest some effort in writing some code themselves and showing alternatives to the methods Microsoft has already shown us.

I have 5 PC's in the house and everyone loves being able to send a doc to the printer and have it done almost before they get to the printer. Printing Photos works very well - and the 'intelligent' FAX capability is nice, since my answering machine will grab a call after 4 rings, and if there is another FAX machine out there, this machine will step in and connect.

My main complaint is that the paper will not feed properly. I think it's problem may be in the inherent technological deficiency in \\"sniffer\\" paper feeders, which this one is. I have an old Epson Stylus which is a \\"feeder\\" type tray with the paper in the back rather than under the printer and it works like a charm. I have tried less paper, more paper in the tray. I have tried adjusting the guides and the paper in tiny steps a hundred different ways and the printer still will not feed the paper properly. I have to babysit every print job, feeding individual sheets into the printer. If it is allowed more than one page in the tray it will invariably pull in three sheets then give me a paper jam error message.

Printer prints quickly, scans beautifully, copies impeccably, and sends and receives faxes with a breeze. Am impressed with it. You can fax multiple pages at once, because after you press fax, it asks you to place document on scanner, it scans, it, and then it asks if you have another one. Was worried you can only fax only one page at a time, but that is not the case. Make sure you buy usb cable for it. It's not included inside. Telephone cord is included, and you can simply hook printer up to PC's extension port, if you have one, or simply to the wall jack.

A second rep told me the change was a cost savings initiative by Dewalt.I am very disappointed with the misrepresentation because some people like myself may have bought the saw at a good price and where waiting to buy the LED light when it was also cheap. I got lucky and found out early."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incompatible with LED","review":"I wish I had read the other reviews first as other people note the same problem. It would seem Dewalt updated the DW715 miter saw and failed to mention they removed hardware that made it compatible with their DW715 product line, but of course left the model intact and unscathed. This, if anything, is false advertising as you cannot couple this device with the handy dandy LED system which is specifically why I ordered this affordable saw.Infuriating to wait for the post-Christmas gift to myself and discover I have to package this heavy item up and ship it back. I'm returning the saw blades, LED system, and Dewalt miter saw all in one go. Why buy products that work together if the main piece of hardware is not going to cut it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"Mine is a couple years old now and has had no problems.Once you get the fence set to square with the blade, if stays there pretty well. The miter rotation is easy to move and is quite accurate for most all projects, including frames.The blade that comes with the saw isn't the greatest for fine woodworking, but is acceptable if you move the cut slowly. Certainly, a higher quality blade can be purchased if needed.I mostly use mine for rough crosscuts on longer boards and some small frames. Truthfully, I like using the table saw for very precise angle cuts, but that's my fault with not getting it set up to near perfection, not the machine's.One star off of perfect due to lack of quality dust collection. I don't know if anyone makes one that has good collection. Maybe the Kapex?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Everyday Chop Saw","review":"I'm happy with this chop saw. It's not Swiss watch precision, but it doesn't cost a fortune, either. As delivered, the saw was adjusted as accurately as possible. A tiny (few thousandths of an inch) depression in the center of the saw table intoduces an equally small error, but in actual use, it seems not to be an issue.The saw is well designed and very user-friendly. Adjustments are quick and easy and hold their position well. Accuracy is good, but not perfect; probably typical of saws in this class.The blade that comes with the saw is okay for rough carpentry, but not for fine woodworking. It leaves a slightly rough cut. I replaced it with a good blade, which cuts nice and smooth.Overall, I'm happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"DeWalt 12\\" Compound Miter saw","review":"I purchased a Reconditioned 12\\" Dewalt compound miter saw from CPO outlets in June not knowing what to expect. I opened the box and the saw looked brand new except for a couple of marks on the cutting table, there was also a new blade on it. The saw works as advertised and makes accurate cuts, for $209 delivered it is an awesome deal. If you can't find the reconditioned one I would just buy the new one, best saw for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"This totally sucks rotten eggs!!!","review":"This cd is one of the worst cd ever produced.

For me this is a huge deal breaker because I use them on my computer for voice communication in which there can be long periods without a person talking. I'm really starting to regret my purchase. Now, the overall quality of the sound and signal are fine. If you use them to listen to music or for watching TV or any other function where they are in constant use then you may not ever encounter this grating cacophony. I'd say other than this horrible \\"feature\\" they actually deserve about a three or four star rating but for what I use them for they are incredibly frustrating to deal with. I will not be making another Sennheiser purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound quality and a nice product overall.","review":"Got this for mother and she loves it. The first one broke after 2 years but that's about 4-6 hours of use everyday. This was a replacement and she is more than happy it not a overly complicated gizmo. Overall build quality is good. Excellent range (>150 Feet tested personally) if you are not sitting around WiFi and other interfearing devices. That's a personal opinion but where do you find a spot like that anymore. Right?!? I certainly would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't hearrrrrr you...... no more","review":"A wonderful product for me. Being hard of hearing (nearly totally deaf in one ear) I have tried several devices to enhance TV watching. These headphones are the perfect item for me. I can use them while my wife can use the speakers at a sound level she is comfortable with. The headphones are comfortable for long periods of time and I can still easily shut them off during commercials. I can tune them in with ease and the sound quality for me is great. I can actually hear in my \\"bad ear\\" with these. I don't have to have the volume up very loud to hear clearly and I can move to any location in my house and garage and still hear well. It's a relief for me as well as my wife to not have to keep asking \\"what did they say?\\" to keep track of the show I am watching. That's all I use them for and I love them. My lovely wife is happy to no longer having the TV blaring. I highly recommend them for the hard of hearing set for TV watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked the first so well, I bought a second for my wife.","review":"These earphones have brought a whole new dimension to our TV viewing.

Particularly helpful when accents are involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I had one set of these headphones with charging base and enjoyed them very much. I wear a hearing aid without feedback. I did go to a thrift store and bought a cheap set of headphones for the foam ear pads on them and put them on the Sennheiser which made them more comfortable and fit better and got better sound quality as a plus. I live in an elderly apartment complex with people who like to complain about noise so this has been an excellent purchase for me. So well that I bought and extra set of headphone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy for apartment dwellers, or older people who do not hear very well.","review":"Living in an apartment makes it tough to have good sound on the TV without making a lot of noise for the neighbors. These headsets give you great stereo sound. Also with separate volume controls, you never have to fight over the remote to get the volume right. Conversations in movies are always clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"The hissing will drive you mad!","review":"I bought these headphones, hoping that they will allow me the freedom to move around the house while still being able to hear the stereo. These headphones do have great range: I was 50 feet from the base, with two walls of separation, and could still hear the sound as clearly as when I was right in front of the base. Unfortunately, the clarity of the sound, even when you're right next to the base, is not very good. A high-pitched whistle pierces my ears, and I just had to return the headphones. I don't recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died...","review":"I had these headphones for about a year before they stopped working. I simply cant keep all boxes and so no longer have this one, after at least 6 months good useage I just cant justify the storage space. They worked fantastically, anywhere in the house, comfortable, great sound quality, I loved them. But for some reason, the transmitter light has stopped working (That is the one which comes on when you turn on the headphones I believe) and now all I get is static, I have tried all levels of tuning and taken advice from reviews on here but just cant get them back working. I have tried everything I can think of, but to no avail. Extremely disappointed about the staying power of what was otherwise a super product for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failure are 6 months","review":"The head phones stopped working after six months.

Now, I must replace the headphone, therefore I am out of $59.00. Wow, Amazon's 30 day policy is a joke!! It is a shame in today's economy customers are ripped off!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Decision","review":"I was expecting a much better sound quality based on the manufacturer's name, the signal is poor. I am using it at 10 feet distance from the transmitter and there is a hiss on the background. If you adjust the tuning knob you can reduce the hiss but also reduce the volume and viceversa.This product seem to use old analog transmission, look for digital (Bluetooth) technology which pairs transmiter to receptor.Also, the pads gets your ears hot when using it at movie average time (1.5 hours)No good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst wireless headphones I've ever owned.","review":"My MAJOR complaint is the sleep mode on these things. If it's been 5 minutes since you've listened to music you must wait for them to WAKE UP. This usually takes 5 to 15 seconds of sound before you can hear anything. If you listen to your audio at too low of an audio level, the headphones mistake this for silence and shut off, filling your ears with ear-piercing static. Would not recommend these or buy them ever again.Another problem is the constant drop in audio level that I experience with these headphones. It's as if they are attempting to compensate for some thing, and drop the entire song/audio file level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sennheiser Headphones","review":"Ordered and extra set of headphones to add to my existing set-up. Very pleased with their performance. Work great using two pairs simultaneously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very frustrating.","review":"- Sound quality is not that impressive.- Hissing is horrible, despite my best efforts at tuning.- If you are using with a computer, you probably occasionally have periods when the computer is silent.

It's a terrible, terrible design flaw.DO NOT BUY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"We were excited after reading the reviews and hoping this product would be what we were looking for. We were not dissapointed. The quality is very nice and the performance has been better than expected. We can now listen to TV without any noise while our 6 month old sleeps 1 room over. The product provides very submersive sound which helps us enjoy programs even more."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's great except for earphones comfort","review":"The sound is excellent. I find that I would much rather listen to my TV with the earphones than with the TV's installed speakers. Much better quality sound;much clearer. I can understand the speech much better, even with background noise and mumbling by the actors. The only problem is the discomfort of the earphones themselves. They squash your ears and get uncomfortable after a little time. But, I am getting used to them, or they are molding to my head better, so that I can stand them for longer periods of time without my ears feeling discomfort. As for recharging, I just use a recharger I already own and not the one that is incorporated in the transmitter. That makes the options of where I place the transmitter much more flexible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sokes Oriole Guide Review","review":"I enjoyed this book alot as you can see by me rating. It has alot of colorfull pictures, but could have more. It provides good information and it is to the point but they could have gone further to explain it better.

This book, however, is a rather dull account of the political intrigue and manouvering Leakey faced from 1989 to 1994 when he was involved with Kenya's various wildlife services. Those in the field may value his insights and perseverance, but the average reader may find his grandstanding and, at times, painstaking defensiveness a bit hard to stomach. I'd much rather read a book by those out in the field (such as rangers) who saw the elephants every day and who would have many a tale to tell about fighting off poachers and dealing with tourists and natives. Leave this book for the bureaucrats in world wildlife agencies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great General Read and for Teaching Conservation Politics","review":"Anything with the names Richard Leakey and Virginia Morell on the cover is guaranteed to be a worthwhile read. Like his equally brilliant and famous father Louis, Richard Leakey is not without controversial opinion.

To that end the book provides an excellent point of departure for classroom discussions on major conservation issues of the day such as community roles in conservation, the effectiveness of National Parks in protecting wildlife and biodiversity, and the interplay between international, national and local needs and strategies.

But if the volume is not up all the way from the input they don't turn on, and sometimes will just turn themselves off. Also, sometimes they don't turn on even though music is playing with volume up all the way, so then you have to turn them off and back on. And if watching youtube or something, you have to turn off and on again because it is somewhere around a 30 second delay to auto off.Second, I purchased these in August of 2011.

I'm not a sound engineer by any stretch, but I do test the speakers in different ways. Every way the sound is terrific. I pull in XM radio online most of the day and the sound is superior. I switch to my iTunes if there is something specific I feel like listening to, and its terrific as well. But where I get the most out of them is listening to TV/radio commercial mixes. I'm in the ad business and we're constantly working on audio for new spots. I can decipher all the different tracks our engineer puts down, from music, voice to sound effects, and I'm able to evaluate them right at my desk.

The problem is that when you try to adjust the volume you have to push against the knob to get enough grip to turn it, but the speaker isn't heavy enough so that you end up pushing the speaker back or holding it in place with your other hand. If you adjust the volume frequently, as I do, this becomes very annoying. It's a surprising engineering flaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have grown to hate these speakers","review":"Right out of the box they didn't really work - or they worked intermittently. Use case: I leave these speakers plugged in to my laptop when I am sitting at my desk. I use Pandora, Spotify, and Amazon MP3 to play music. Most of the time I get sound out of them for about 2 minutes and then mysteriously there will be no sound - the green \\"on\\" button will be lit but no music. After a period of no sound, green light on, the green light will go off and, sometimes, they will magically restart.The JBL website has some troubleshooting tips and that seems to make them work for a while, but then I'll be back to on for two minutes, then off completely.Although I bought these a couple of months ago, I will probably return them unless someone can point me in the direction of how to fix permanently.On the plus side, it's hard to believe that such great sound comes out of such a small package."},{"rating":"1","title":"not happy","review":"I do not like them, they buzz and the knob is very slippery making it very difficutlt to adjust the volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality and very short warranty.","review":"I bought two pairs of it. Both stopped working a little over a year. One pair lose one channel. The other pair became completely silent. This product seems have design flaws. And JBL only offer one year warranty, what a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Energy saving feature ruins the experience","review":"I like the sound from these speakers - but they keep turning off in the middle of some of my music that features quiet passages. It is very frustrating because the speakers will not stay on during some of the music I want to play for meditation. I would not buy these again, even though the sound is good and they fit great on my desk top, because speakers that won't stay on are a problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after being used twice","review":"It must be an unqualified manufactuer like other small electronics sold on Amazon. The first time works, and then didn't use it for a long time, four months or so. The second time we did use it again, the sound suddenly disapeared in the middle of the movie, I turned it off and on again, the sound resumed with no problem through the rest of the movie. The third and fourth time, this happened more and more frequently, now I'm sitting in front of my computer watching a movie, the sound can only last two or three minutes. And I cannot return it now. It's not a cheap item, so save yourself some time and money. Like many other examples, this is definitely something you buy in a store but not Amazon. There is a reason why it doesn't get five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"They worked great -- for one day","review":"The sound from these speakers is really good -- when there's sound. After one day, the speakers started going silent for no reason. The sound doesn't come back until I unplug the jack and try again.

However, they are really cheap feeling and sound horrible. Very tingy with no bass sound at all. I had them hooked up to my computer. I am returning them today."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're better off using your computer's internal speakers","review":"These speakers are disappointing on all counts. They are quiet--even at full volume they are only slightly louder than my computer's internal speakers. They sound terrible--with disproportionately round bass and tinny, metallic-sounding treble. They also regularly turn themselves off as part of a power-saving mode that is nowhere mentioned in the product description, the packaging, or the instructions.I bought these on sale as part of an Amazon lightning deal, and even at thirty dollars I felt these were not a good buy. But they did teach me to better appreciate the muddy sound of my iMac's tiny internal speakers--which, overall, I much prefer to what the JBL Duet produces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after 10 hours of use","review":"The sound was good, even decent bass which is unusual for small speakers. But the construction was poor. The wiring connections were weak, and the power supply died after just a couple days of use. We were in the mountains at the time and I just recycled them, not even worth returning for replacement as I wouldn't want another set of these. Bought them on the name. Looking for better."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST AMAZON PURCHASE","review":"I purchased these to use with my computer. As soon as they plug in to the computer they simply buzz and the sound increases as you turn the volume up. This is not a subtle buzz, it is very loud. It is impossible to use these speakers. Unfortunatley, I threw the box away as was unable to return them. I absolutely HATE these speaker and they are complete garbage. I just wanted something simple and inexpensive, but they do not function at all. DO NOT BUY THEM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound for an affordable price","review":"I have been very pleased with the overall quality of my JBL speakers. The deliver clean audio and surprising sound from such a small foot print. The only complaint I would have would be that they are so light in weight, that I have to hold the speaker with the volume control to keep it from moving when adjusting the volume control. Maybe adding a larger non-skid matting on the bottom of the speaker would help keep them in one place. Over all I give them a 4 out of 5. Good job JBL !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the speakers","review":"I love these little speakers, perfect for the office. They sound great and fit my budget, too. Christmas present to myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avg quality (below expectations) & buzzing sound","review":"See a lot of other reviews about buzzing sound - this is terrible. In addition, I'd like to mention that there's nothing fancy about sound quality - it's normal, which is below my expectation for the price (I'd expect quality to be noticeably above average). Buy $5-10 speakers on ebay and get similar result with no buzz.I'll try to check if manufacturer will accept a return."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound, But......","review":"I have been using these speakers now for about two months and the sound quality is GREAT!!! I had a pair of Infinity speakers before this and these blow those away, easily! I listen to all types of music and the sound quality is terriffic, regardless of the genre, the only problem I can think of has to do with the volume control. I read a lot of reviews before buying these and some people mentioned this, I thought it would not be that big of a deal, but it is a little annoying. Adjusting the volume is difficult because the volume control is pretty small and it is a little hard to adjust. This is the only complaint I have, they sound great, the setup was easy, but adjusting the sound is a little more difficult then I thought it would be. Otherwise, for the price I am very happy that I bought these and I would still recommend them to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good speakers for the price","review":"This is actually the second pair of Duet speakers I've purchased. I was so impressed with the sound quality for the price the first time around that I decided to invest in a pair for my office computer. Well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Looking, Good Sounding, Good Pricing","review":"I've had these speakers for a few weeks. They have a clean look. The white ones match my ipad keyboard dock really well. The bass is surprisingly good for a 2.0 speaker system. I have two complaints that would keep these from being perfect. The shiny, silver knobs are slippery for how hard they are to turn. Sometimes I have to hold the speaker down with one hand and turn the knob with the other. Also, I would like a notch or marking on the knob to let me know how far I have the speakers turned up. These complaints are VERY minor. I gave them a 4 star in 'Ease of use' because I am being picky. These speakers are worth the $50 that they sell for at other places."},{"rating":"2","title":"JBL quality","review":"I have 4 sets of small JBL speakers. I have tried and returned other brands.

Your search has ended.","review":"I wanted some simple, decent speaks for a laptop I set up in the family room for the kids to play games on, listen to itunes, watch dvd's etc as the built in speakers were pretty puny. I found these here, already highly reviewed and they are as advertised. I rarely give 5 stars but these speakers earned it. They are elegant to look at, not too big, a breeze to set up and the sound quality is startling. I expected ok but these speakers go way beyond that - I was really blown away. Well worth the money. I guess other speakers may look cooler with lights and such but these are truly the best quality in the price range."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mini Speakers with a boom.","review":"I Love these little guys. I have them on my desk to as a desktop sound system only. I don't use them as a main stereo source. I'm in a small office and each work station in the office has a pair of the Duets, and honestly for blasting your Itunes Music the sound is great, if the sound gets a lil tinny (like a tin can) or too bass heavy it's nothing a lil adjustment to the Itunes EQ can't fix. Their small with good sound clarity and pack a heavy bass sound when it counts. They can fill a 750sq ft studio office easily with it's sound. JBL has the best mini speakers out there in my opinion, I also have the JBL On Stage Speakers for iPod, AWESOME as well!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"JBL Speakers","review":"I was going to buy direct from Apple for $50 but just for the heck of it I checked Amazon and they were $39 with free shipping.

After years of abuse, the speakers finally gave out and needed to be replaced. I chose the aluminum ones to match my Macbook Pro.Note* the color is aluminum, the speakers are made of plastic.The problem with these speakers is that they put themselves to sleep after about a minute or two of no sound coming out. The quickest way to wake them up is to unplug the jack, tap it with my finger to wake the speakers up and then plug it back in. Otherwise, the song or video will have to play for about 10 to 15 seconds before the speakers will realize they are supposed to be doing something.This would be a much better feature if it took 10-15 minutes to go to sleep. As it is, I'm probably gonna throw these speakers out and buy a different set."},{"rating":"1","title":"They broke after a week","review":"These speakers had fine sound quality - almost as good as the internal speakers that came with my Mac desktop computer anyway. I bought them because I needed something louder than the internal speakers, and they were a little louder, but not much. Then, about a week after I bought them, they stopped working. There was a soft \\"pop\\" and then no more sound ever. The best thing I have to say was just the Amazon was great about refunding me my money and making it easy to ship them back."},{"rating":"1","title":"buzzing noise and broke after two weeks","review":"A faint buzzing noise was present which was especially noticible when speakers were ON while no audio signal from my computer was being sent to the speakers.After two weeks of minimal use, the speakers didn't even turn on.I think I must have gotten a bum pair, as the other reviews are good.The speakers are stylish, but I couldn't judge the sound quality because of the buzzing or vibration noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ralph Nader would labeled these \\"unsafe at any speed\\".","review":"Do not buy these speakers at any price. Don't even bother accepting them as a gift. You will be disappointed. OK they sound alright until you turn up the volume, then they feedback regardless of how they are positioned. It must be an internal design flaw because I have seen two sets of these now and they both do the same thing regardless of weather they are connected to a laptop or not. Also, the volume control is tapered and too smooth to get a hold of so you will be frustrated when you try to turn it just to find your fingers slipping around a stationary control knob. I almost threw them across the room. Other than that they are great."},{"rating":"1","title":"most frustrating product ever","review":"The SOUND of these speakers is very nice - really, they are terrific (especially for a desktop product) But they apparently have some strange \\"power-saving\\" feature whereby they turn themselves off (after what I can only determine as a random amount of time) or perhaps it's dependent on the strength of the sound signal going to them - I don't know, and who knows what it actually takes to turn them on!!? 8 to 10 seconds in to a song they MAY come on - they might wait longer. And if they song gets too quiet (think classical music) they will just turn off! Do they think the music is over? I really don't get it - and there didn't seem to be any way to override this setting.REALLY ANNOYING.

They have some cruddy technology that is supposed to put the speaker into \\"power saving\\" mode when your computer isn't outputting audio.

But it seems as though they are not properly shielded. They produce a constant soft 60 Hz buzz that is rather annoying in a quiet environment. When my new speakers arrived I thought they were defective and exchanged them for another pair. But alas, the defect seems to be in design rather than manufacture since the replacement pair buzzes as well. If I were in an environment with some ambient noise, like an office, I might not be bothered.

They were easy to setup - just plug in and they're ready to go. I wish they were black instead of aluminum, but I knew what color they were when I bought them so really can't complain about that. Overall I'm satisfied both with Amazon's shipping, speed, and the quality of the item."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Top Choice in its Class","review":"I've had this speaker pair for a little over a year now for my laptop. Although I was pretty neutral on the concept of a small pair of speakers when I got it, I've grown to love them. They offer great sound quality (for their size) throughout the range, if only a little bass-lacking, as can be expected in these types of units. Although not as sleek as some of the units you'll find in Apple Stores, they don't look bad at all on a desktop, and the materials quality is good.I can't pass any judgements on their longevity at this point, but based on what I've observed in my year+ of daily usage, I think they'll be with me for quite a while to come. I'd recommend this product to anyone in search of a good, compact, pair of computer speakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got progressively worse with time.","review":"I got these in 2008 and was pleased with the sound quality (with the exception of the slight buzz when the speakers are on but no audio is playing--as some reviewers have also mentioned). Then, gradually, something happened with the bass...instead of hearing the bass, you'd hear a grainy, booming buzz and not much else.

After reading all the reviews on these, I bought them. The first thing that kind of irritated me- not sure why- but did, was that the quiet turn on is annoyingly long. When I listen to voicemails at work on these, I have to start the messages, wait for the speakers to turn on 1/2 way through, then rewind and start over to hear it all. Maybe I just got a bad set. The left-main speaker has also pretty much died, and no I don't crank these too far.Again, maybe I just got a bad set, but my old set of Harmon Kardon's sounded better, were more reliable, and worked immediately. I'll be purchasing something else next time for sure.Seems like everyone else loves them though. So take my review however you want. I just expected more from JBL, even if they are a cheaper set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound for such small speakers","review":"We bought these speakers to use with our i-pod. The sound is great and we use it for our living room stereo system. I like the fact that they are white which matches the i-pod and our bookshelves.

This is not acceptable.Problem #2: I'm surprised at how many people say the speakers sound so great--very mediocre in my books. It sounds like a cheap ghetto blaster from the 80's. You definitely get what you pay for with these light, tiny speakers.Problem #3: I agree with others--the knob is not just slightly annoying becasue it's so slippery, you actually can't operate it unless you have both hands free so that you can brace the speaker with one hand (for leverage) and use the other hand to control the knob.My recommendation: I recommend trying different speakers. I'm not one to give many bad reviews, I usually have very good luck with most everything I buy, but I thought I'd put in my two cents here so that others can avoid this product, not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Right Speaker / Left Speaker Markers!","review":"The speakers are OK and sound fine, but, insanely, there is no marking to let you know which is the right-side speaker and which is the left."},{"rating":"1","title":"pops and crackles","review":"Despite all the wonderful reviews, my speakers keep having trouble with crackles and pops and dropped notes in songs.

Also, I would no longer have to burn CD's of her favorite music downloads. She also enjoys listening to Delilah from time to time, and since the Sansa has FM as well, my problem was solved.These little speakers have a clear, beautiful sound to them.I would recommend these speakers if you are looking for quality computer speakers, or powered speakers to play music from your Mp3 player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"Do not buy.

Plug them in and they play sound. Kind of hard to mess that up, right? My gripes are twofold, however:1) The volume knob is the ONLY thing on the speaker that you ever need to touch, and yet they've made it incredibly difficult to turn. It's tiny, slippery, and basically requires two hands to turn (one to hold the speaker and the other to grip the knob *really* hard and turn). Maybe I just got a bad pair, but you'd think they would make that ONE single thing easy to use.2) There's definitely a buzz coming from the speakers. I can hear it right now. It's not loud, but loud enough to hear in a quiet room. bzzzzzz....They seem minor, but I find both of those problems to be increasingly annoying. In fact, after a few months of using these speakers, I think I want to replace them.

Her mother is reduced to setting her up with men from the produce aisle in the supermarket, and Camille can't take it anymore. She answers an ad looking for a woman to decorate offices in a town of eighty bachelors. It's Camille's dream job in a dream town full of hunky blondes. Wade Harrison is the one who placed the ad. He's tired of seeing his town lose out to the big city year after year as the young people move away. Wade isn't worried about the national attention, but he is afraid of making a commitment to another woman after having been hurt. The road to true love is never smooth, and for city girl Camille and hometown Wade, there are some rough patches, but eventually Camille convinces Wade that she's in it for the long haul.

It's really nothing more than a picture book that spends as much time discussing the Corvette's competition in the IMSA series as it does the Corvette itself. I was expecting much deeper insight into the technical aspects of the car including design, development, construction, and lot more information about the engines. I also expected a lot more technical pictures of the car's construction and components. It's unfortunate the author only scratched the surface of such an interesting GTP car.

I vaguely remember reading this one when I was younger, but I couldn't even finish it this time. First of all, who WERE these characters? Secondly, Why was Karen's name changed to Kara ? (That annoyed me more than her complete turnaround regarding her characterisation - she turned into the people she seemed to loathe!). Seriously, the name change of the character bugged me so badly I had to put the book aside. It just made me nuts. Normally, I'm a huge Barbara Michaels fan, and I really really wanted to love this book too. Alas, not meant to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Premise, Unlikable Characters","review":"Was Barbara Michaels feeling ticked off while she churned out this one? I can't believe how nasty Kara (Karen from Shattered Silk) turned out. She's just plain rhymes-with-rich in this book; such behavior is NOT the same thing as being assertive, Ms. Michaels. The heroine (Rachel? Was that her name?) is a total nonentity, as others have mentioned....until the end, when suddenly she had all the answers. (Where'd she get them?) The hero (can't remember his name and don't care) was utterly unappealing. People seemed to do a lot of slapping and snapping at each other. I got fed up. But I did think it was a clever premise, so I flipped pages just to get the story and let the characters go on bickering without me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Suspense Book, but a little slow","review":"Overall I liked this book. It was a little slow, but on the whole the story was good. I did wish for a little more background on who the quilt was made for and why it was made. The book never really tells you, it just gives you the characters guesses. At time the book seemed to drag, but it was mainly because you didn't know what Rachel's motivation for doing things was. I had a hard time telling what was her and what was the quilt's influence. On the whole I liked this book and may read another by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Has to Be The Dumbest Book I Have Read Yet!","review":"I did not think that this book made any sense-and it was the first of Barbara Michaels I have read.What happened to the plot? She really dropped it, and the story just barely held my interest at all. It was one of those books that the synopsis made it sound more interesting than it actually was; in other words misleading to me.If you're looking for a book that is entertaining and interesting with a lot of character, don't go for this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"romantic suspense","review":"Barbara Michaels has churned out another page-turner in her genre of romantic suspense. As always, the heroine is young, plucky, a bit naive but willing to learn. The plot device here is a haunted quilt.Michaels is an accomplished writer whose characters are well-fleshed out, whose plots are timely, whose dialogue rings true. Some readers prefer her archaeology novels written under another name, but I like her Michaels novels better.\\"Stitches in Time\\" is a great rainy-day, read-on-the-couch book and if it's your introduction to the author, it will lure you into getting more of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"homeannex distributor","review":"This company is one of the worst I've dealt with online.

I was surprised at the very low cost--maybe it's been around too long. But it's a good CD. The music is guitar, much of it classically flavored and played very well. The fact it's a tribute to Robert DeNiro is puzzling to me--the liner notes don't explain that. But a number of the tunes are, like Cavatina, pretty. It's the type of music that you can put through your headphones while you're doing something else; I think my daughter would find it good for her job as a data entry clerk. It's a good few notches above elevator music, but not a top-of-the charts type of CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk.

Disorder is no problem for me - I have a high tolerance for ambiguity. So think about what kind of floss you're seeking - content brainteasers or process challenges(readability). This gives some of both. Content: Some articles are pretty ordinary - stuff most people know already - but other tidbits are in depth additions thst are new and fun for any trivia hound. As for readability: It takes a lot of concentration to find your way through each page-let alone the whole magazine. I will continue to subscribe, but I do wish they would string together just a few of those loose ends which serve not to 'floss'the brain but instead to burn out the reader's neurosynaptic connections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow Shallow Shallow","review":"Don't waste your money on this soundbite deception. The title does not live up to itself. There's nothing mental about it other then the word in the name of the magazine. This publication amounts to a whole lot of trivia and maybe one feature article in the middle of the magazine, no depth, just hype and snippets of esoterica. I felt so disappointed and deceived as the build up sounded quite promising. Invest in something else worthwhile like \\"Atlantic\\", \\"American Scholar\\", or \\"Commentary\\". This was a real waste of money; if you don't believe it go ahead and see for a fee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much less interesting than expected","review":"As other reviewers have pointed out this magazine does at times ask some interesting and unusual questions. However the answers leave you unquinched for the pondered idea.

Instead, Mental Floss is just a bunch of assorted trivia pieces. Worse yet, they use the same snarky, condescending tone that rags like Entertainment Weekly and Rolling Stone have been using. I have grown very tired of hearing the writers voice. Some of the articles have good bits of party knowledge sure, but you would just be better off hitting the random button on Wikipedia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing!","review":"I was very excited when I ordered this magazine. Now, a year later, I haven't even read the last issue. This magazine has very interesting information and it could easily be a great magazine. However, some of the writing is inane. I get the impression that the editors are so lacking in creativity (or is it just the writers?) that articles are poorly conceived and poorly written. By the painfully obvious attempts to stretch the articles to acceptable lengths, I am reminded of the words my College English teacher wrote on the essays of students who were desperately trying to reach her required 500 word minimum and were not being too successful: \\"Words full of sound and fury signifying nothing.\\" I know those are Shakespeare's words but they were apt for the writings of those students and also, sadly, fit the articles in this magazine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Train Wreck","review":"This is an absolute train wreck of a magazine. I ordered it because all the other customer reviews were so positive and because I like trivia like jeopardy, trivial pursuit, etc. I have no idea how any intelligent person could enjoy this magazine or gain any knowledge from it. For instance the first issue I received was about the 25 most influential movies of all time. I don't remember much from that article except that toy story made the cut. Toy story. I think the only other article in the magazine between the hundreds of ads was about how many time Abe Lincoln wanked off a day or something. Okay that's not exactly true but you get my drift. This is not a magazine for people with even a mild intellect. Its basically watered down maxim articles without the scantily clad ladies. Remind me again what the point of this magazine is? Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your Money","review":"I wonder who came up with \\"Mental Floss\\"? It's more like \\"Can you Think\\"?

Every piece written is easy to read and informational. It has very few ads and the layout is always different and fun.

Mental Floss is perfect for trivia enthusiasts and average people on the prowl for scintillating entertainment alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trivia heaven","review":"I've been a fan of Mental Floss for some time. I own several of their books and read the magazine as often as possible. It's history, science, food, literature, you name it, offered up in humorous and quirky ways. It takes items that you would never think twice about and turns them into fascinating subjects. Many of the bottoms of pages contain extra bits of trivia.This is a magazine that can easily appeal across many different genres. One doesn't have to be a trivia geek to appreciate the cheeky, irreverent humor with which this magazine presents its material. All you need is a bit of free time, a cool drink in hand, and someplace where you can laugh out loud without having people think you are nuts.I look forward to every new issue and wonder what I will learn within its pages. Be warned though, if you like to play trivia games with others, you may soon find yourself winning more games or being the person everyone else wants to team up with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"This is my second subscription to this magazine.

Thankfully, each issue of Mental Floss carries a handful of stories that are absolutely fascinating, touching on bits of history that you never knew existed. Will it make you smarter?

But will it entertain you with delightful wit? Absolutely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped","review":"After reading many reviews I opted to purchase a subscription. Needless to say I was disappointed with the content. This is more a magazine of daily trivia than any \\"mental floss\\".

In fact, this would be the second time that I have bought this particular collection of music. The first time was when the CD first came out, and you could only buy it on cassette tape! A decade later I have finally replaced it to CD and am delighted that I have. The whole CD is one that you can put in the player, curl up on your couch with some spiked eggnog and watch the fire burn down. It is an inspiring as it is relaxing, brings back memories of a quieter, and somehow nicer world than the one we all currently live in. It is not a piano pounding John Tesh, but the musical arrangements do have his mark on some of them. And this CD has my favorite rendition of Ava Maria. A mixture of classical, contemporary, choral and instrumental, I believe this is \\"THE\\" Christmas CD to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixed","review":"I have heard music from this cd on Pandora and I liked it.

It's very informative, and quite packed with some good tidbits for the earlier games in the Jaguar library. Why they didn't make another one taking into account the later games is beyond me (other than the fact that Atari went out of business).Unfortunately, if you're searching strictly for cheats, you're better off today checking around the Atari Jaguar sites on the Internet, as there are an unbelieveable amount of sites that carry cheat sheets and FAQs for these games.If, however, you're a beginning gamer with some of the earlier titles for the Jaguar system, and needs some visual walkthroughs, I'd suggest purchasing this book. If anything, it's a great addition to your Jaguar collection, and even contains some screens from other games that were upcoming in the library that you may want to check out as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"This video was very disappointing!

N T Wright is a leading scholar, appreciated by numbers of emerging church leaders, who is investigating the life of Jesus in the context of first-century Palestine. He invites us to see and experience Jesus afresh, not with our own imagined standard perceptions but drawing on insights into first-century culture, politics and faith in Christ. Looking at Jesus in his world is where his subversive agenda can be best understood.Originally reviewed in Darren Cronshaw \`The Emerging Church: Spirituality and Worship Reading Guide.'

Wright brings the mind of a scholar and the heart of a pastor to this work in which helps the reader sort through the pressing questions which underly the quest for the historical Jesus. The reader will find a healthy assessment of and response to postmodernism. Wright is a exceptionally gifted writer and apologist of the Christian faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ","review":"This book helps up understnad the historical context of Jesus.

I have not had a crash so luckily have not had to test that. But I am sure it will work well as a helmet.The issues I have with this helmet is that it fits the head really oddly, it makes your head look REALLY round. It looks like your wearing a goofy space helmet, not very attractive. The chin strap does not have a button to pin the slack strap to the helmet. Any slack strap just kinda hangs there in the way. Another problem I have with it, is that the visor does not fit well. You kinda have to manhandle it to get it on the snaps. It often unsnaps from the helmet and gets all crooked again. Really unless if you think this helmet looks amazing, go and find another you will probably like it more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice helmet","review":"This is a comfortable and sturdy helmet.

For the next addition, would like to see a quick reference guide on quick identification of different varieties of commonly encountered plastics.

McInerney clearly told that story in Bright Lights, and hasn't been able to change the formula significantly--alternating between \\"experimental\\" books (such as Ransom and Last of the Savages), and the same New-York-professional-whose-life-is-falling-to-sh*t fallback tale (Bright Lights, Story of My Life, Brightness Falls, and Model Behavior).He's a fantastic stylist, however, and the book is exceptionally well-written and entertaining, as long as you literally expect no new material beyond what you saw in Bright Lights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lazy, pathetic, annoying, and shallow","review":"This book was a great disappointment in every way.

I got the feeling that Jay was told to have a book done by a specific date by his publisher, and he put off writing it until the night before. There was no depth in either his characters or his story. I think Jay read too many of his New York reviews and forgot that the US is larger than just New York City. The worst part is the price. I would gladly have paid the extra amount for this book if it was half as good as \\"Bright Lights\\". But instead, this book is worth $9 less that its requested price. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unremarkable, re-tread blah from Easton Ellis-wannabe","review":"There's nothing wrong with writing fun, 90's-style fiction, but can't anyone do better than this? If this was some nobody's first novel, and not the oh-yeah-Bright-Lights guy, it would never have been published. It's nothing but an unamusing, amateurish rip-off of American Psycho minus the blood and guts. Even if youre tempted, starved for good current fiction, please, at least wait for the paperback -- to show up at a used book store. You'll thank me later. Oh, but you will get a variety of wildly implausible albeit unimaginative subplots that add nothing to the story other than momentarily distracting our shallow, bland protagonist. Quick, before any more aging one-hit wonders are encouraged by the smell of a fast buck, can't some clever, with-it young or old author write a fun, topical literary novel? I think we're clear on who can't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright lights Mk. 2 with a 90ies-touch","review":"Yes - it is something of a remake of his first model. Yes - it seems a bit boring for McInerney to write once again about NYC and its strange inhabitants while secretly enjoying exactly those people to the max. And yes - he can't help being not able to decide whether this should be a funny or dead-serious book. But who cares ? Although \\"The last of the Savages\\" and \\"Brightness Falls\\" were his best, it's a great read, not only for the die-hard-McInerney/Ellis fans.

The throw-backs to J.I's life in the 1980's when he was one of the literary world's \\"flavor of the month\\" were nauseating. His constant name-dropping was annoying. And the fact that he had the nerve to even mention his own name in a fictional book review just shows that J.I doesn't care about writing good fiction.

Back with the 1990's 'vibe' after his chronologically rootless journey in 'Last of the Savages', this is not one of McInerney's masterpieces ('Brightness Falls' being his best novel to date, in my opinion, and 'Ransom' being an overlooked classic - I had to obtain it on import in the UK), this is a welcome addition to his oeuvre.

This latest project \\"Angels\\" seem to take itself so seriously in all the strangest ways, it is almost a bit insulting to be honest. I have heard all of these melodies before, but now I am supposed to take them more seriously because M. Gira has decided to sing over them. If you like \\"Angels\\" it just seems like there are other bands/people doing this whole mood/sound better and with more honesty.

Anastasia is going to work as a companion to elderly rich ladies; Mrs. Bellingham is her old wealthy lady. \\"This is going to be great!\\" she said. The first day she had to be a maid for an emergency. She polished silver, cleaned carpets, and set tables. Day after day of work, she was a maid even if there was no emergency. One day they had another party, but this time it was for her granddaughter's, Daphne's, birthday. Daphne and she became wonderful friends, and Daphne was going into 7th grade as Anastasia was. Daphne and Anastasia were so mad at Mrs. Bellingham they designed a prank. Will they do it? Read Anastasia at Your Service to find out! I recommend this book to all readers, because it is interesting and funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute book","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite Anastasia books.

It does make the viewer wonder about modern medicine and how it can possibly affect those who take it on a regular basis. On the other hand, the film lacks true suspense. I was hoping for an explosive opening scene when the baby is first born and instead was offered a yawn. The baby itself is about as scary as fozzy bear and while there is some blood flow it is kept to a minimum. The pacing is too slow at times and it just doesn't stand up that well today. The actors who took part in this didn't go anywhere say for the father who went on to appear in the sequel. Why there was a sequel is beyond me. I recall how frightening the commercial was for this film when it first came out but I was only five at the time. At the most this is a rent not a buy. I guess good for it's time but perhaps a re-make would pump some needed life into the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"on life support -- is more like it","review":"this thing just dragged on and on.i have never been so happy to see the end credits in a movie for a while.but it isn't just the boredom of the movie that bothered me.the characters also behaved in ways that were not realistic or logical,even when carrying out mundane routines.add to that the fact that the movie was about as scary as the energizer bunny,and you got one big misfire.however,having seen a few thousand movies in my time,i can honestly say this is nowhere near the worst movie i have had the misfortune of sitting through.it just isn't very good.it's followed by two sequels,which(after sitting through this movie)i can say with 100% certainty i definitely won't be watching,so something good came out of it.for me,It's Alive is a 2/5"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a bore!!!!!!!!!!!

I don't think this storyline works very well and as a result I think the movie is largely ineffective as a horror movie.

It's funny to watch the mother just casually say \\"it's time\\" when she goes into labor. I have been around women when it starts and there is some screaming and stress involved.

It's not scary enough to be a legitimate horror movie or funny enough to be a comedy. Instead, it's like a bad high school film project.

Poor Altman and Landon were just doing their jobs. The blame goes to the scriptwriter and producer of this wasted effort. IMPORTANT NOTE: The DVD does NOT use the original \\"Bonanza\\" title theme, which was probably too expensive for them to procure, but substitutes a nice little alternative country-music ditty.

Factually, there are very powerful cases of non-human animal bonding that exceeds even so-called normal human bonding. Secondly, the author neglects to take seriously the 'argument from marginal cases'. So, for example, autistic children, senile and retarded adult humans and the like, are simply incapable of even the minimal bonding that the author believes inhabits 'normal' humans. The result, on parity of reasoning, is that these marginal humans deserve lesser moral treatment. This seems at odds with our considered moral beliefs; indeed, many of us would think that these humans deserve extra care and consideration. The book is rather philosophically naive and leaves obvious objections unaddressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo for Coming of Age","review":"Dacing in the Wings stole my heart!

She is the tallest one in her dance class, and gets made fun of quite often.When all the dancers compete for a chance to perform in Washington, D.C, Sassy(the main charcter) gets chosen.

For the seasoned Christian, these notes help deepen our never ending, insatiable quest for better and more comprehensive understanding of the Word.It is obvious to me that the review of August 23rd was one based on hearsay and not based on familiarization from study of the Word and Kenneth Copelands notes.

The purpose of this edition is to set out topical subjects with scripture references. Kenneth states clearly that this reference edition is not meant to take the place of your own prayer and study time.. the outlines are to help by giving a starting point for your study and meditation.

The content is boring, so the writing style used to try to pep it up makes the book even more annoying. I couldn't read any more than the first several pages. Read a couple sample pages before buying this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure why this book gets so many stars","review":"I read an article reviewing this book and was so excited to check it out. When I looked through the book I was dissapointed at how \\"light\\" it was in content. Deciding to give it a try I read the first 20 pages at least and found the book extremely boring - so boring in fact that I've given up. The \\"personal ads\\" are not very funny or entertaining, just basic and dry. I honestly don't even want to give it to someone else and will probably end up throwing it away. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Road Trip Book!","review":"I took this book on a road trip with 2 friends. It was hilarious! We had so much good conversation come from it. And we learned a lot about ourselves, each other, and our dating styles. It's very interesting to see how personal ads have developed and how the media has evolved. It's also fun to see how what people are looking for has changed terminology, but shares a basic underlying idea - everyone is looking for ultimate happiness with \\"the One.\\" Very enjoyable book. Great for a coffee table book, gift, road trip, and interesting conversations!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best and Worst","review":"I loved this book! It might be better titled \\"The Best and Worst OF Personal Ads of All Time,\\" as it aptly demonstrates the best and worst OF people, well, through time. People represent themselves and their desires in a particular way in personal ads. They always reflect something true, whether it be the truth of what they are looking for, the norms of the time, or what they think their potential mates want to see. This collection captures that, and what's more- its funny! Some things about us change, and others stay the same through the years. Check out my favorite, \\"The Result of a 'Personal'.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool title but lame book.","review":"Title is cool but all the adds I read before I died of boredom were more than 100 years old.

The Om Mani Padme Hum is too sinister sounding to my ear. In fact the first time I played this cd to class I wasn't expecting this song, and when it came on with it's long low OM and this tapping or loud clicking sound that is interjected into the chant,I just about popped out of my pose. I turned the music down, apologized and continued teaching without music. Don't get me wrong I love 'yoga music', and I love the om mani padme hum chants. I own many yoga cds and make my own mixes for teaching classes but this cd sits in the back of the collection. It serves as a reminder that I should listen to the whole cd before deciding to play it in class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Izzue grey shirt","review":"the photo makes it appear solid. it actually has a pattern which everyone in my family of 7 finds hideous.

There *are* good songs on this album. Most notably the ever-popular goth club hit Nightmare (Sinister Strings Mix), by Brain Bug. Most of the stuff will bring back memories of going clubbing in the very late 80s, early 90s when this type of music was just emerging, but other than a few other tracks, these really take the bad remix cheese award.

There is only one worthwhile track, Armand Van Helden's 'Funk Phenomena'. Ninety percent of the rest of the cuts sound like old 70's disco divas wailing over slightly updated rhythm tracks. There are NO instrumentals except the dull-as-dirt 'Sinister Strings'. The CD doesn't even have a coherent sound, mixing together tracks like 'Mueve La Cadera' with 'Lovefool' by the Cardigans.

It timed out and worked fine, but when it had to be reset, no way!They want $40 to \\"fix\\" it. Its $25 for \\"diagnosis and handling\\" and $15 for \\"handling\\" just to get the RMA!

I didn't drop it or anything it just died. Probably the risk of buying an oled display."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am happy with it--a good deal","review":"This player is very versatile--besides music and pictures (and short videos), the best thing is that it can download your Outlook calendar.

I initially had some trouble downloading music from my CDs through the laptop, though it worked fine on the PC, and I eventually did work out the problem. Otherwise, great.

Less than two weeks after purchase, unit wouldn't turn on/off, and kept freezing. I returned it to Circuit City, and obtained a replacement.In the six months she's had it, there were intermittent problems with freezing and not being able to turn off the unit. About two weeks ago, the on/off switch fell off, followed by the toggle button in the middle of the unit, falling off into the unit itself.Emailed customer support at Creative and was told that I was still under warranty for parts, but not labor. They want me to pay $25.00 to fix this piece of junk. Not going to happen.Maybe I just got a lemon, but beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"arrgghh...RESET nightmare","review":"Eight months of constantly finding a pin to poke into the tiny reset hole, feeling like I'm doing progressivley major damage to delicate innards. Takes more, longer, deeper poking each time. Something's changing in there and that's not good! And every time it freezes up, which is all the time, you poke & poke, wait & wait for it to reboot, then you must re-navigate thru lots of tiny, unreadable, moving banners just to get back to your place. If you can't find your glasses, you're not quick enough to read the banners and then it shuts off. Plus, I got it for listening to audiobooks, and the tech reviews suggested this model cuz of its available bookmarking, but the bookmarks are mostly worthless because they're so awkward to use, both setting and accessing. And the radio, which I wanted so I could listen to a favorite program, is useless. Hardly any channels, nothing but static. I wish I had spent a little more and gotten a real mp3 player. This one's just junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this!","review":"I bought one of these players in April. I had to repeatedly reset and then reformat the player.

There is a warning that states that the cables included with the device (like the earphones and USB cable that would be frequently handled) contain lead, which is a carcinogen. By contrast, the iPod does not have this warning, because they provide high quality and non-toxic cables and other materials.

I wasn't happy about the number of new software programs put on my computer and I didn't know what they were until it was finished.However, I had it less than 24 hours when the joystick broke. Honestly, it seems almost too light and flimsy to last very long. My camera has a joystick about the same size that is much more robust and has worked for almost 2 years.

Then it crashed & even windows wouldn't recognize it. After scouring the internet for a solution I learned this is a common feature of the Zen V Plus. I wish I had know before I gave it to my son as a gift. Even the support team at creative agreed it was time for a new zen... I'm thinking ipod instead. Maybe in the near future Creative Labs will work out the glitches, but I won't be purchasing another of their products soon. It really is too bad because it could be a really cool toy, it's relatively reasonably priced & the software was very easy to work with.

It appears that the screen is very fragile, and if I had read the reviews from others I would have laid out the extra cash and bought a ZUNE earlier, 20x the product for only 2x the price. Also tried to get the warranty activated from Creative, however they say that a dead screen is not covered by the warranty, only the hard drive. In fact they wanted proof that anything wrong with the device was not caused by me, not sure how to do that, and also was told by the customer sevice rep, \\"Why are you wasting my time, they're only $100, buy another.\\" DON'T WASTE YOU TIME OR YOUR MONEY BUY AN IPOD OR A ZUNE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have only had my Zen for about 5 months and it's already freezing up.

My only complaint would be that the earphones are really uncomfortable. Unless you have monster-huge ears, you will probably need something else. I like the Zen software and it is easy to download updates and firmware (just check out the Creative website for info). It did freeze up on my once, but that was before I installed the firmware which seemed to help. I checked a lot of websites before I bought and Amazon had the best price!

She had it for a little more than 90 days when the power switch broke. The unit would no longer turn on. So, I contacted Creative to see if we could get a replacement. They said that since it was beyond the 90 day warranty period that we'd have to pay $25 JUST TO HAVE A SERVICE TECH LOOK AT IT. Then, there would be charges for the repair on top of that. What? The tech was extremely rude via email, accusing me of abusing the product even before giving me the opportunity to explain that my wife was very careful with it, always using a special carry case which I purchased in addition.Bottom line, buy an iPod or something else and save yourself the grief. Creative obviously does not feel confident enough about this product to back it with anything more than a 90 day warranty.

The first time it died, I was ready to return it under warranty, but after a couple days it \\"woke up\\" (on its own) and worked fine. It just quit working again, a few days ago, and won't come out of its coma this time. I was going to return it, but found out my labor warranty expired (after 90 days) and I have to pay $25, in addition to shipping the damned thing back and insuring it.

It is a little slow to start up.Go ahead and buy the (expensive) charger from the manufacturer.I have found nothing else that works.The screen it VERY bright in the dark, but still hard to see in sunlight.Most files will have to be converted.

However, to watch videos on it, you must uncompress them using the included software to very large sizes, otherwise, the player's weak processor would not be able to play it.

I have my RMA # from Creative lab, and I'll see how it goes when I return the unit. I hoping they're not going to ask for more money for a $109 unit. More than $50.00, I don't feel it's practical.It is a disappointment, since the unit was used lightly and already needs repair after less than 4 months of ownership.

Instead, simply plug it in to a USB, and it gets treated like a drive - I like that very much, as it keeps down the amount of software I need.*It is small (though not as small as the Nano, which is good.

Updating the firmware and a little patience seemed to do the trick however. Now it works great, and I love the bookmark feature. I listen to the NYT during the morning commute and various books on the evening commute. The bookmarks let me keep my place on multiple books simultaneously, so I can choose what I want to listen to based on my mood, etc. I only gave it 4 of 5 stars because of the initial problems I had, plus the owner's manual is pretty weak. I had to get some clarification from Creative's tech support, but they responded within a day or so. If you like listening to audiobooks, this MP3 player is a must have.

I continue to get error messages when I try to install it. Unfortunately, I bought the player from Amazon so Creative cannot give me a refund and Amazon requires it to be returned in its original packaging (of course the original packaging is a sealed plastic container that you have to open with a knife or scissors).

We've sent it back once to be replaced (and of course, that took 8 a solid weeks). Since we got it back, it has frozen three more times. Twice we were able to let the battery run down and it would turn on again after charging, but once we had to reset the whole player and reload all the music onto the player again.Overall, the product is a waste of money and time.

When I called the Creative Zen because I was still in my 90 day warranty they told me that it would take up to 5 weeks to take the whole thing apart and erase all of the subscription music that I would have to pay for again to get back on there see if it was my fault or a faulty part. I didn't even mess with it.

Then the MP3 player started locking/freezing up. I would have to press reboot key (which requires a very small paper clip)to get it to unfreeze. The occurences of freezing got more frequent and even the reboot did not help. I tried emailing Creative Labs, but the customer service email was not working. Also, called their customer service line twice and was left on hold forever (this is NOT a toll free call by the way). I finally was too fed up and returned it. The joystick is a little tricky too. I am a little hesitant to buy another Creative Labs product because I could not get through to the company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kenny's first Christmas album","review":"Kenny has recorded five Christmas albums - four solo and one with Dolly - but this was the first one he did. It includes an excellent mix of the familiar and the unfamiliar.The most familiar songs here are White Christmas (the Bing Crosby classic), When a child is born (the song that gave Johnny Mathis his only UK number one hit), O holy night (one of the most popular carols) and My favorite things (originally sung by Julie Andrews in the Sound of Music).Before you get to them, there are some great songs, of which Carol of the bells is a cover but the others might all be originals. Kenny must like Sweet little Jesus boy a lot - he re-recorded it for the Gift, one of his other Christmas albums, but I particularly like Kentucky homemade Christmas (about a poor family determined to have as good a time as they can) and Kids (about the people who enjoy Christmas most).This was a great start to Kenny's career as a singer of Christmas music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Greene crime novel captivates","review":"The assassination of an influential public figure leads to a complicated web of betrayal and murder. As the double-crossed assassin hunts down his former employers, a policeman and his fiancee find themselves on opposite sides of the fray. Graham Greene's writing style is very cinematic here; many passages played out effortlessly in my mind's eye like scenes from a vintage film noir. It almost makes me think that it may have easy for Carol Reed to direct the classic \\"The Third Man\\" (also based on a Greene story). Greene is not satisfied with simply providing an involving plot; he gives his characters depth and dimension and interesting dialogue as well. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I'd Hoped For","review":"Given the world-class reputation of the author, I assumed I was in for a treat -- or at least a solidly diverting yarn. Unfortunately I found myself aching to put this book down and pick up something else. The story is about an assassin working for munitions suppliers who kills an influential British anti-war figure in the days leading up to WWII. He is betrayed and races to confront his betrayers before the police catch up with him. Sounds like good stuff, but for some reason it isn't. Part of the problem is that Greene gets sidetracked into painting little portraits of every peripheral character encountered. While well-fleshed out characters are required ingredients for any good story, Greene goes overboard and the story drags and suffers as a result. Next time I'll try one of his more famous books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pyramex Zone II Safety Eyewear","review":"These Pyramex Zone II safety glasses are really decent for the price. I ordered a couple of pairs of these in \\"Matte Black\\" from Amazon by mistake thinking they were the SAS Stingers that I usually wear, but I do actually like them and have been wearing them both on the job and around the house when working outside. They do a good job of reducing glare and are comfortable enough to wear all day with no digging into the bridge of my nose or pinching behind the ears. Overall, I think they are very good safety glasses for everyday use and have no problem recommending them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cycling glasses","review":"I bought these because I don't like spending $75 or more for designer sunglasses for running and cycling, since I'm liable to lose/break them within a few months anyhow. $15 or less is more my price range. Plus, I get the added benefit of actual eye protection, in case a rock flies up and hits me in the face (it's actually happened--I was very glad that I was wearing safety glasses for that ride! It wasn't this specific pair, but it was another pair by Pyramex. I heard a clicking/cracking noise and felt an impact, but when I stopped to see if there was damage, there was a tiny, barely perceptible scratch. Didn't affect use of the glasses at all). This pair is also nice because the lenses aren't quite as huge as in some safety glasses, so you don't end up looking like a space alien. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll Need a Magnifying Glass to See the Stones","review":"The Peridots in this necklace are so small and so pale, and so dominated by the comparatively bulky settings, that they can't be seen at all from more than 6\\" away. From any normal distance, such as standing next to someone, this simply looks like a nondescript silver chain with no stones at all, and is not especially flattering. In intense light, such as a spotlight or direct sun, it can look glittery, but one still can't see the stones, and there is no discernible color from more than a few inches away. What a disappointment: I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing!","review":"This necklace was pretty enough when I took it out of the box, but it doesn't sit right on your neck.

During the course of the month the LCD decided to stop working and then it wouldn't read disks at all. The only thing that worked were the headphones. Seeing as how I bought the player out of state at a store that doesn't have a local location I decided to call the company to get a refund or figure out if I could fix it myself or send it in. I was never able to get through to Customer Service to figure any of this information out. In the end it ended up making the perfect, most expensive paper weight I've yet to own next to my cat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Display Malfunctions","review":"I was very excited to have this player, and loved the look, design, remote, magnets, hand strap and the functions. However, I brought it home, used it twice, and the display on the unit started flashing uncontrollably, then the remote quit working completely. I returned it for a new one, thinking it was just a faulty piece of equipment, and it happened again! I've only had it two weeks, and the display is completely blank. At least on this one the remote still works, but I can't see what the thing is doing when I select the mode and the skip protection buttons. I called the 1-800 # and they were no help and told me to return it and keep trying. As there's another reviewer that had the same problem, and two of them have done this to me, this is a consistent problem, and the equipment is not worth the time or the money. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"this product is not a \\"sports\\" cd player","review":"I needed a new sports cd player to use while running, so I bought this Philips cd/mp3 player. While I enjoyed the fact that it played mp3s and was relatively inexpensive, I was very disappointed with the product as a whole.The magnetic parts that attach to your shirt to keep the headphone cord out of the way are very annoying and heavy. When running with this cd player, I felt like I was weighed down. I would rather have the headphone cord flapping around than have heavy magnets hitting against me.Furthermore, the remote on the headphone cord is completely useless. The cd player comes with a sporty case to make the cd player easy to hold while exercising, but this means that your hand is not free to use the remote - so the remote just bangs against you and weighs you down as you run.And finally, this cd player ate through batteries and was both heavier and larger than most other cd players on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Item","review":"I was quite dissapointed in this item after opening up the box. The design is great and I was SO excited to have purchased this after hearing so much buzz and seeing the product displyed. But, when I turned it on, the LCD display did not work at all. The CD played fine (both audio CD's and CD's containing MP3 files). But, you had no idea what you were doing when you were pressing buttons. Also, it looks like the magnets had a tendency to cause the CD to jump to different tracks when it got too close to the unit.I tried calling the Philips help line to see what the problem could be, but I couldn't even get through on the 1-800 number included in the packaging. So, I'm returning it today and asking for a refund.Maybe I'll look into the iPod instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT MP3/CD PLAYER BY NIKE-PHILIPS!!","review":"I purchased this MP3/CD Player today (after trying out many others) and was really impressed with the style, sound, and the features offered by NIKE-PHILIPS.

It also comes with a remote, handstrap, and ac adapter. The sound is terrific. It uses an equalizer button that can vary your taste in bass and treble. The bass has 2 levels and the treble one level. Put them together and you have excellent sound quality. It plays all MP3 files, CD-R, CD-RW, etc. Nicely made with LCD readout on both the remote and MP3 player. Has all the controls of a regular player. Is orange and tan in color with a rounded shape and comes with 2 AA batteries.

Following their legitimate hit of 'It's a Long Way There' and facing the disco onslaught, LRB molded their songs into generally forgettable middle of road odes to love and even bordered on being termed a disco band.

I'd have to say go buy Shania's other cd's!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as Rex Stout","review":"Enjoyed this just as much as Rex Stout's original stories. The characters are true to form and their parlance is what we've come to expect. There are even the traditional vocabulary builders scattered here and there. It took a short while to become used to Archie preparing documents on a PC instead of a typewriter, but I guess that's the price we pay for progress. The plot of this story includes a nice twist with the deceased as an author who writes sequels to a popular series of detective stores after the original author has died.I thought that Robert Goldsborough did an excellent job of occasionally giving us a round up of who may have done what where and to whom, without making it too contrived."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobody's Darling","review":"5 stars isn't enough. Ms. Medeiros is always fantastic, but she really outdid herself with this one. This is one of the few books I can honestly say made me laugh and cry all at the same time. The plot, the romance between the main and secondary characters, the setting...all were perfect. After reading this one, I bought everything I could find that Ms. Medeiros had ever written and I wasn't disappointed. This is a MUST READ!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly enertaining!","review":"I loved this book. The reviews were so good that I had to check it out. I was not disappointed at all. To think I almost put it back(I buy most of my books at the local thrift shop). When you spend $8. for a new book and get disappointed, it makes you angry that you wasted good money. I won't mind buying some of her other books now that I remember that she's a great author. This book has everything you expect and all you don't expect. Books like this make you remember why you read historical romances in the first place. I read some of her books years ago and whe was one of my favorites and now I'm reunited with an old friend.

Later English teachers foisted huge tomes upon me, all purporting to teach me how to write correctly and well. But none of those books taught me as much as this gem. Besides fixing many important grammar bugaboos, it teaches you to listen to the way your writing really sounds, and to develop your own sense of style. I still reread it, still follow its advice, and still enthusiastically recommend it to my students."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 45K a year book","review":"This is a great book for anyone who wants to write better, stronger, and with more conviction. Someone told me a few years ago that reading this book would improve my writing at work. Four promotions, 8 years, and a dream job later, I went from less to 15K to 60K. Some of that was hard work, but much of that was practicing the advice in this \\"little book.\\" It is funny, straightforward, and I have given away so many I can't keep count.

For someone so bright his writing skills have much to be desired, no doubt in part due to extensive use of text messaging amongst teens (and some adults) these days.

I gave 2 CDs as presents to people who'd never heard of him. They became instant fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Good","review":"A very promising debut album with some excellent burnished tenor sound. To the reviewer who went on and on about Mr. Villazon only being in his 20's -- I hate to burst your bubble, but he was born in 1972, which makes him 33! And, by the way, the age of the singer is not a \\"huge\\" advantage; let us remember that some of our greatest singers didn't come into their element until their 40's (e.g., Flagstad, Milanov...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than Bocelli, yes, but...?","review":"Oh come now! Villazon is a perfectly okay, acceptable lyric tenor no better or worse than many another lyric tenor. He is NOT in any way, shape or form a \\"young Domingo\\" or \\"the fourth tenor\\" and to suggest so -- while it may thrill his record company -- is ludicrous. As for his alleged \\"whopping high c's\\" all I can say is that I didn't hear them. If you want to hear what a \\"whopping high c\\" really sounds like, listen to Mario del Monaco or Carlo Bergonzi singing \\"Che gelida manina\\" from \\"La boheme\\" and you'll instantly hear the difference. Villazon's high c is a bit strained and totally unimpressive to any discerning ear. Is it the voice all these people are crazy about, or the music. I believe Villazon's obsessive fans, like Bocelli's, tend to be newcomers to opera whose limited knowledge gives them little to compare him with. Sure, he's a better opera singer than Andrea Bocelli -- but \\"a young Domingo.\\" Surely these people jest!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this cd, you'll be disappointed.","review":"Considereing myself I fan of both punk rock and hair rock, I must warn you, this album is neither of the above. I'll give the artists credit for putting very unique spins on the songs, however, I really don't want to hear lounge and swing version covers of these rocking songs, from some of the better punk bands around.If you want a good punk cover cd check out Punk Goes Metal (which is unbelievable) or Before You Were Punk 1 or 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please turn it off!!!!!!","review":"This CD is PAINFUL.

Metal Rules isn't just a bunch of no-name bands covering your favorite Head Bangin' hits. There is a new spin put on all these songs. From the Swing version of Poison's Unskinny Bop to the Loungy interpretation of Def Leppard's Pour Some Sugar on Me, which is to die for, I am sure any one who survived this past era of guys with long hair and make-up will get a kick out the new take on these past hits."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real dog","review":"I just couldn't make it through this one.

But I have to say, after several weeks of protracted effort, I just can't bring myself to finish it. The combination of pretentious language and obscure metaphors was insulting... and I found the overall shock-value course of events to be unlikely. I have nothing against being intellectually or emotionally challenged when I read a novel, especially by a new author, but this book is just unpleasant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustratingly Overwraught","review":"I was curious about this book given the extremes of the reviews, but having struggled through its pretensions I must add my vote to the \\"too self conscious\\" and \\"trying too hard\\" set. If you want well written gritty and convincing stories, read William Vollman or Irvine Welsh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain awful","review":"This is just the worst book I have read in a long time. The cover made it seem so intriguing and dark but it turned out to be incredibly boring and full of itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky, Poetic, Lyrical, Haunting, Raunchy and Sad","review":"Ms. Gussoff is an original. Her gift for language, her off-beat world, her main character's courage and grief and youth are all gripping. A short but power-full book, \\"Homecoming\\" can be read in a day or a night, leaving you outside your own life and inside the world of a sister's death, a lover's loss, through the consciousness of a young woman's quirky, poetic, haunting and raunchy-sad, but strong life. Highly recommended. A great talent is beginning to bloom here. I look forward to her next works."},{"rating":"2","title":"whoa, the varying opinions...and here is mine","review":"I was intrigued, I must say. This book seems to find its readers on either side of the loved it/hated it line. I hope Ms. Gussoff sees this, and realizes what an accomplishment this is, in and of itself!So, curious, I ordered this book, and I really, well, liked it. \\"Liked\\" seems not quite accurate...it well, changed me somehow. I'd dare not say it was a perfect novel. Far from it, but I have never read a style quite like this author's, and the sadness was what got me. The loss was itself a character, a character with no lines or description, but one always there, a bare-naked and razor sharp presence. I will agree at times the prose was clumsy, and I think she may have traded clarity for style, but I read an interview with the author, and she is surprisingly young. I think her works will grow into something quite impressive, if Homecoming is any indicator. I think this slim volume is worth the struggle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful photography","review":"I've been hunting for a book about common backyard birds which had big, clear pictures, to make it easier for my young kids (5, 3 and 1.5 years) to see the distinguishing characteristics of each bird. The photographs in this book are beautiful! The colors are crisp, details are vivid. Many of the scenes are breathtaking -- birds in flight, feeding their young. The pictures are also large, each occupies an entire page.Of course, Harrison includes information on the birds -- descriptions, what they eat, their habitats, how to attract them, etc. The info is at par with the other bird books. The photos make the difference. I highly recommend this for both beginner bird watchers (like my family), and for bird lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not worth the money.","review":"Lucy Lawless barely is even shown in these short films.

Although short, every second is made to maintain the standard running throughout.A Bitter Song (Lucy Lawless' first film role) is intoxicating.

In fact, all the cuts on this EP are beautiful (as is normal for Enya), though not obviously \\"Christmasy\\" to my non-Gaelic ears.By the way, I see many of the reviewers here were put off by the price of the CD, and as I see that the list price is over $20 for 5 songs, I find that understandable. I bought my copy quite a while ago and I don't remember what I paid for it, but I really don't think I paid $20. Shop around."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"Aside from Enya's other lesser known EPs ('6 Track' and '3 Track'), this one stands alone because of the inclusion of an exclusive Gaelic track (S' fagaim mo bhaile) which could well be one of Enya's best kept secrets (it featured on few collections and is regarded a 'rarity'). It also features 'Ebudae' which we all know from the 'Shepherd Moons' CD.This EP is short, yes, but it makes up in quality what it lacks in length. Enya's lovely voice is worth any price, made more evident when you hear her lovely Gaelic rendition of 'Silent Night'. I consider this the best rendition of the classic holiday song ever, in any language or format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all Enya predictably high quality/value","review":"My personal opinion of the Christmas Ep was not entirely negative.

Also, I placed the order in November of 2008, so either this is a very sought after book, it's made of the Shroud of Turin, or somebody needs a map to distinguish their derriere from their elbow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barrington Levy...is for reggae connoisseurs.","review":"Barrington Levy is at his pinnacle on these two albums reissued by Greensleeves and backed by the premier reggae session band Roots Radics. If you dig crucial reggae this is the cd for you. \\"Look Girl\\" & \\"Rock & Come In\\" are solid reggae songs that will satisfy your soul!

From jet rides, to federal agent training, galapagos islands, volcanic eruptions, to the hubbell telescope and sports cars. I would not call this information secret. I was looking for something more technical i.e. about how the internet works and electronic information. The previous review gives the video a 5 and mentions electronics. I expected something more \\"secret\\" and electronic. It is about adventure sites on the internet. Originally, this video was broadcast as a series with lots of commercials. The mention of \\"this week, next week,\\" are left in the video. I wanted to inform high school students. I doubt that I will show it and would love to get my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"it could have been more geared towards creating web pages","review":"I am an avid video buff and have viewed a wide variety of videos.

It was exactly the same as Volume 1, just in a different order. It doesn't say Volume 2 on the disc case and isn't the same picture as shown in Amazon. Maybe Volume 2 really is what I wanted. But what I received was definitely disappointing. I went to order it again, thinking I just ordered the wrong DVD, but it said I already purchased Volume 2. Maybe Best Buy has the whole set."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD from a Great Voice","review":"Definately a great new voice for Opera/Crossover. Sings with depth and passion and clarity. Wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of His Best","review":"I just recently started listening to Alessandro Safina and I have become a fan of his music. This album in particular has become one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kelis' Roots","review":"A debut with extremely great lyrics and beats, can't really get no better than this. If you haven't heard \\"Caught Out There\\", you must have been living in a cave or something. Anyway, if you love Neptunes beats, this is your cd. If want to here Kelis at her peak, this is the cd. Love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw Neptunes","review":"I really do feel like I slept on this cd since I just purchased it recently. My only problem with the cd is that the Neptunes aren't the best songwriters lyric wise, and they wrote all of the songs on the cd, with Kelis contributing to maybe three songs. I feel like there weren't any songs that showcased her voice, and you can tell that the Neptunes were pretty new and raw as far as production goes. Still definitely a great cd though....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Feelin It","review":"I would've given it 2 and a half stars if possible, but since it's not, I think Kaleidoscope is closer to 2 than three. She uses some novel themes (i.e. Mafia) but not all that well. She also has a decent singing voice, but I don't think the Neptunes production works for a full length R&B joint. My two favorite songs are \\"Game Show\\" and \\"Ghetto Children\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Its all about the baseline.....","review":"This album is just simply fantastic. The melody are hypnotic and the basslines simply slamming! Kelis' style is hard to define as it is unique. My personal fave track isGet Along with you, a sad lost love song with a moving melody. Get the album and find yours.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I heard \\"Caught out there\\" and wanted to hear more from Kelis. After reading the great reviews from amazon.com - I gave it a shot. What a great disappointment. Of the 14 tracks listed only four make any musical sense. She has a great voice but the songs that she sings are bland and \\"way way out there.\\" \\"Game Show\\",\\"Mars\\", \\"Mafia\\" and \\"Roller Rink\\" are the worst songs I've ever heard. Don't waste your money. Buy the singles until she gets some decent material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ditch the Album for the single","review":"Ok, so the Kelis single \\"Caught Out There\\" is outrageously good. The beat is amazing and the lyrics, well let's say real. Once you get the Cd though, it is terrible. The only other good cut is \\"Good Stuff\\", so basically once you pass the intro and the two good songs, you're in for a mighty boring ride the rest of the way.The only remotely bright spot after the first three tracks is \\"Mars\\". The originality that was so overpowering on \\"Caught Out There\\" is gone once you pass it. Kelis has such a good voice and it's a shame that it gets wasted on so many songs. If anyone thinks that this CD is good all the way through...stop smoking the crack and listen again. Buy the single....save your extra $10."},{"rating":"1","title":"the voice has moments but overall the material is lacking","review":"caught out there shows something, but her voice overall is being played to the same old current beat.the material is what is hurting her here.i like her edge but the concept overall is being done to death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Debut","review":"She serves as a wonderful collaborator/muse for producer team The Neptunes. A great album - tracks are hauntingly beautiful, socially concious, and/or booty-shaking good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good CD","review":"Kelis Cd is very good for the people who likes rap and hiphop and a good refrain. This Cd contents fourteen songs. Its nice to listen to this when you are in a soft mood and also when you feel like party! Iam glad I bought this Cd even but im not listening to this kind of music, because it is a good example of hiphop rap rnb! The Cd features Terrar in Good stuff, Markita in Mafia, Marc Dorcey and N.E.R.D. in Ghetto Children and it feats Justin Vince in a slow ballad called Wouldnt you agree. The negative thing about this Cd, it isnt any! Because if you like Kelis famous music than you love this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent listening","review":"So far I've been disappointed with the poduction of R&B albums, and the content is so predictable. This CD is way different from anything out there. The songs are real, the lyrics are interesting, and best of all, the music is outstanding. The way she phrases her lyrics stopped me in my tracks the first time I heard 'get along with you' (#4). The album gets better too. Not the best CD I ever bought, but it gets a lot of time in my CD player, which is why I give it 4 stars. Very enjoyable CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"YO, COP DIS' DISK!","review":"KELIS IS THE BOMB,NO DOUBT!

She has a voice that has never been heard in music.. Production is sparse but keep things moving in a quick pace.. there are a few misses hereMafia, Suspended, Mars are completely mediocare tracks ..Among the stronger cutsCaught out there , Game Show, Ghetto Children, Roller Rink, Wouldnt you Agree .. these cuts show a lot of promise from one of the brightest and intriguing new acts.. future is bright enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"In Love with Kaleidoscope","review":"I had this album for a while..but until recently I fuond it and its been stuck in my CD player...Her sound is very different from the cookie cutter standards of Hip-Hop and RnB.I feel the standout tracks are Caught Out There,In The Morning,Suspended(the best!)and Get Along with you.If you want a break from the mass produced crap on the radio...this is it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Debut!","review":"This album was a very unique sound that made everyone listen and respect Kelis as an artist......But one song just truly annoys me...Game Show....Overall, the album is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the typical \\"pop\\" ular music fans.","review":"This album is a classic. It is not for those who are in love with \\"pop\\"ular music. It is not a staus quo type of album. Hell, Kelis is not a standard pop artist. This album is witty, different, yet still has great beats that you can dance to. But also, has some interesting word play and choices that rival the somestimes standard trival lyrics of R&B; and Pop.*****************************Great choice if you want to step outside the box from traditional R&B; and Pop. Yet, you still want to dance and have fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the story of my life!","review":"I was crazy. Please disregard the review(i submitted one for the edited version by accident)I gave prior to this. After listening to this CD thoroughly, I just fell in love with it. This CD has made my top list of all-time favorites. I just can't get enough. I feel her pain and everything else she sings about, I definitely can relate. I really love this CD and recommend anyone who wants a break from the 'over-commercialized music world' to take a listen to a very talented artist. I would definitely want to see her perform live. You don't know what you're missing. Her music and clever lyrics are....different. I just can't describe right now! Also, this ain't the ol' tradiional r&b either, not that there's anything wrong with that. But I really dig her style!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wow amazing","review":"When I listed to this album, I felt very chocky inside. The looves are amazing, and expecially the bruns are terrific.

But the rest of the album didn't quite do it. The songs are boring and the beats sometimes start to sound the same. I REALLY wanted to love this album. Tried to -- 'cause I'm always down to support sisters who don't fit anyone's standards. Nonetheless, this CD is going back to the store. I'll wait for the CD single, watch her interesting vids and check for the next CD if there will be one. My advice: listen closely and repeatedly to all the songs before you plunk down your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great all around lens","review":"I got this lens a while back at B&H before I realized that amazon sold almost everything I could find there for at least a slightly lower price and with free shipping. This lens gives me clear shots up and down it's focal length, vignetting and warping issues I've seen on other wider angle lenses seem to be nil on this one.

Remember such great hits as\\"A little more Love\\",Deeper Than the night\\" and \\"Toatlly Hot\\"? All eventually became unforgettable hits.This album shows a more daring,a more raunchy side to the\\"cute\\"Olivia Newton-John but she sure proves with Totally Hot that she is as capable with Pop as with Country and love ballads.The album also includes a few songs that Olivia wrote herself,she proves to be quite talented at writing too:))"},{"rating":"2","title":"A totally hot album","review":"Contained on this album is one of my all time favorite Olivia songs \\"Boats Against The Current\\". It's a beautiful song about a couple who know that their relationship is over but rather than put an end to it and save themselves a lot of heartbreak they stay together and both remain unhappy. \\"Dancin Round And Round\\" is a more upbeat track with Olivia promising herself that she is going to go out, have a great time and forget about the man whom she has just broken up with.This album is woth buying just for the track \\"Boats Against The Current\\". A must for any Olivia fan"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great singer,great album","review":"I've been an Olivia fan for years, and this is one of her best! It's filled with great songs top to bottom, from the hits like \\"A Little More Love\\" and \\"Deeper Than the Night\\" to lesser known gems like \\"Borrowed Time\\" (my personal favorite!) and \\"Boats Against the Current\\". I've been waiting for a LONG time for this to be re-released on CD and I'm glad it's finally here... my cassette is played out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Olivia is TOTALLY HOT","review":"Totally hot is Olivia's firs attempt into the world of pop music.It didn't take long to see that people apreciated her change of style when A little more love reached number #3 in the charts while her latest country single Sam had only reached number #20.Another single release of the song deeper than the night led to another hitsingle.But the best song on the album and probably one of Olivia's best songs ever is the wonderfull\\"we boats against the current\\",as you see Olivia is the best,when it comes to country or to Pop music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimately Unfulfilling","review":"In my opinion, John Leguizamo is both funny and talented, but this book exploits neither of these qualities. It's an extremely quick read (about 60-90 minutes), and while there are 1-2 chuckles here and there, it's much too compressed to be an effective autobiography, and not enough humor to be a decent \\"gag\\" book.

This is one of his earliest CDs of a project done in collaboration with Brazilian artists. Sadly, it is a CD quickly going out of print. Bill always swings great, he is inventive, harmonically subtle, always balances his CDs with a thoughtful variety of styles, and always thoroughly understands the style and its proponents. All of his projects are innovative and no two exactly the same. I have all his CDs including the newest Latin Band which is now, I understand, number two on jazz radio in the nation. The only reason I give this CD four stars is because some of his newer work is even more impressive. Check him out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read.

I have to say that this book is as good if not slightly better than Pratchetts first book. It's clever and witty, the part where we learn Voltemeters true desire for his future is great writing, Brutal repressive taxation with the yearning to lord over people, great. If you really like Terry Pratchetts fantasy writing you have to give this book a try. It is like reading Terry Pratchet when he first started out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delightful Light Fantasy for all ages","review":"This delightful light fantasy pleases on a couple of levels.Of course, it is a spoof of the coventions of the fantasy genre, almost a novelization of Peter Anspach's \\"Evil Overlord list\\". However, it also works as a light-hearted story of adventure that Joseph Campbell might recognize, for the flawed hero overcomes his shortcomings with a handy how-to book that is more effective than any magic ring.This is a quick read; if you enjoy Terry Pratchett or Piers Anthony's lighter works, you will probably enjoy this.

Too bad it got stuck on this DVD, but I strongly reccomend watching it.A smart mix of seriousness and humor, it shows the first serious signs of Aoshi having feelings for Misao, yet hilarity ensues when a group of characters go out for the day."},{"rating":"1","title":"This just keeps getting worse.","review":"The episodes on this DVD are not really worth the purchase. These episodes have no real importance to the story and are just filler episodes. The only interesting ep. after the main arc (Shishio fight) is the last ep. but to bad it was never released.

It was also cracked and the disks although playable were scratched. The season 7 DVD box was a joke. Thin as a single disk box all four disks piled on top of each other. Also making me think was a fake copy. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the disks although scratched were playable and the show is great. As far as shipping I am very disapointed.

As an aspiring fictionist myself, I drank up his comments and advice in this book. Gardner was a strange bird, who didn't walk the walk - he rails often in his writings against some of the very types of writing he committed. But he remains one of America's original voices, and this brief book should be read by anyone who wants to write fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great insights and counsel to writers","review":"Gardner comes across as a realist and an inspiration to writers. This is not a step-by-step book about how to write a novel. It is more of a big picture approach to developing the mindset, skills and discipline to become a novelist.Gardner illustrates the ingredients to writing novels and to being a novelist. His examples of his own writing experiences are the crux of this book. He has been through the angst and exhiliration of writing and shares his insights in this book.He clearly conveys that writing takes discipline, skill, perseverance and teachability. He elaborates on these areas in the book.Overall, the book is inspiring and educational. It is not drawn out or wordy. He gets to the point and keeps it short, so it is very helpful throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"A much better mousetrap!!!","review":"I have managed warehouses and distribution centers for over 20 years.

I prefer to ship in boxes rather than padded envelopes and hate wasting time fighting with tape and scissors. I thought this would be handy but it did not meet my needs. The gun when loaded with tape it very heavy (and huge!) and if you try to use it on a standard, small, or non corrugated cardboard box you will just completely smash the box. This is great if you are moving or frequently packaging stuff in large, sturdy, corrugated, heavy boxes that can stand several pounds of pressure. But since I use smaller light weight boxes, I found myself still using scissors and this was reduced to a very expensive tape dispenser. I'm back to square one!

Through his years of research and numerous studies, this great scientist has revealed more about the nature of conscious awareness than cognitive philosophers could ever dream. How he does this is simply by repeatedly observing and verifying the temporal factor in consciousness, and leaving the reader with only one wonderful, inspiring conclusion: That we are, without a doubt, dictated by our subconscious awareness, and that there certainly is a fine line between what I think, and what I unknowingly have already thought of, called the threshold of conscious awareness."},{"rating":"1","title":"No picures in kindle version, very disappointed","review":"Everywhere it should have a picture in this book on the kindle version it has a note: \\"To view this image, refer to the print version of this title\\".

The only other issue I have is the little wire rack that you use to lift the filters out is pretty flimsy, and it has no side support for the filter pods, so if you lift it up too high out of the canister, the pods tip over. Not a deal breaker for sure, and it looks great next to the My Invento Coffee Maker that uses these pods.

I snipped two of the prongs at the bottom and now he loves it.However, now that he is a pro at two prongs--I want the prongs back! =)With prongs, you can't really freeze or put gunk in it (cause good luck trying to clean it!) but without prongs it is basically just a kong.Downside: it is too hard to chew, especially for puppies.

The medium size Squirrel Dude holds a 1/4 cup kibble, and I set these down on the floor and the pups go at 'em. It'll keep them busy for about 90 minutes, sometimes longer.I prefer this toy to the Kong because the Squirrel Dude has prongs to make it harder to get the kibble/treats out. I'm happy, and it's been 3 months with these squirrel dudes holding up to sheltie teeth just fine. If there are any longevity issues, I will update this review.I don't remember a rubber or plastic smell to these toys when I got them, but if there was it didn't bother the shelties and the toys don't smell anymore... well, the toys smell like kibble and dog slobber, but they don't smell like rubber or plastic. =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for my agressive chewer","review":"This is one of the only chew toys that my english bulldog has not destroyed within a few days of getting it.

She is an incredible shredding machine who has destroyed many so-called indestructible toys, but Squirrel Dude has held up just fine. She carries it around and tosses and bounces it to get small kibble or cereal pieces out. We did not modify the tabs so it takes some effort to get the food out and there's a random quality about when something comes out so she stays interested. She is quickly bored with her Kong; a cookie is too hard to get out, and she can clear out peanut butter in under 2 minutes.

I first purchased it back in the late 1990's as a college student and had trouble finding it again. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon. It smells amazing. It is a very unique coconut blend.

Lover's Moon is my favorite so far. A light cool floral with staying power. As with all perfume oils, a little goes a long way. This is a great perfume for a great price. I hope they keep making them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not your mama's patchouli!","review":"This is not the same patchouli as was commonly available in the US during the late 60's and early 70's.

Very disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"P.U.-trid!!!! - awful - migrane invoking","review":"I've never been nearly knocked out by a fragrance until smelling this one. It is SO strong, I couldn't even get it out of my olfactory sense after one small dab and then taking a shower to scrub it off. Patchoulli has always been one of my favorite scents, but this, well this is just overwhelmingly awful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not for me :S","review":"After reading the intriguing reviews for this product, I was expecting a wonderful new scent to try...sadly, I am VERY disappointed.I could barely detect any fragrance at all after I first rolled it on. I waited for a while, and then I applied more; however, there was no noticeable increase in the scent (actually all the second application did was give me a headache, which has gone away since I scrubbed the oil off.)

Too gross to even use as a room deodorizer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lavender Dream - Auric Blends Scented/Perfume Oil - Nice!","review":"I wasn't quite sure what to expect. Reviews were good, and so was the price. I have to be very careful with fragrances because I get migraines and so if the scent is very intense at all, it will give me a migraine. This is very subtle and quite nice! I am happy with it. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"On sexy scent! If you're a 5th grade teacher...","review":"Think of the smell your Teachers had.

I put it on and immediately wished I hadn't. It stayed on for 3 good days, and I showered each day. I have tried to give it away, but nobody wants it. Next week it will be making it's way to the great-grandmother, maybe she will like it. To sum it up very quickly: Do not buy this scent if you are under the age of 75; it smells like old lady, exactly. Pretty much the same reason I cannot give it away.I would give 1 star, but I don't want to trash the entire Auric Blends line. Their Patchouli blend is awesome and I love that. Not sure what happened with the Egyptian Goddess, but pee-yew! I'd like to try their other scents, but now I am not sure I should stray from the patchouli."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad smell!!","review":"the reviews made me try this perfume....yeah rright, do'nt get fool with these reviews!!! stinky smell and wont even last for a sec!!! but the shipment so fast!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting!!","review":"The first time I used this fragrance it made me nauseous.

Never again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have listened!!!","review":"I read the other reviews stating that this perfume was too faint, and that you couldn't smell the fragrance. I should have paid attention to it. But, having said that, I am also one who likes a strong fragrance. This one is extremely mild but pleasant. It's a pleasant fragrance, I just should have saved my money. I just assumed maybe it was just the difference in chemistry and maybe it would work for me....it didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honeysuckle? I don't think so.","review":"This has absolutely no honeysuckle scent to it at all. So if you are looking for that clean sweet smell, don't bother with this stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fancy baby powder?","review":"I recently ordered a small sampling of Auric Blends fragrances, and this one was a disappointment. It started out nice and smelled nice in the roller, a fresh rosy-jasmine smell. However, it quickly changed to an unpleasant nursing home smell, finally drying down to a baby powder smell. The smell is giving me a slight headache, lasting forever and I will never, ever wear this again. It might work on somebody else's chemistry, but I can't imagine many people wanting to smell like either an old lady or a baby's bottom. I love other scents by this brand (Love, Sweet Rain), but this was a miss for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtle and Exotic","review":"I wanted to comment on the reviewers who state this product has no scent- Right from the bottle, the oil is odorless, and at first I was a little dissapointed when it came in the mail. I rolled it on anyway, and let it soak in because its quite viscous, and slowly the scent started to release from my skin. The scent is subtle, if your used to spraying on a department store perfume and becoming lost in the fumes, then this is a nice surprise. Its very exotic and slightly sweet, nothing like I have smelled. Patchouli? Sandalwood? Jasmine maybe? What a treat to wear at such a great price. I can feel the African sand as I bathe beneath the Giza acropolis..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"My wife smelled this on someone else, and was happy to own for herself.

We returned it, and Amazon was AMAZING about giving us our money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like it","review":"This Egyption Musk oil smells ok, I wore just a dab to work and it made me and others around me sneeze alot.

I am amazed at how much this DOES NOT SMELL LIKE VANILLA. How hard can it be?No one, after smelling this, would even say, \\"It kind of reminds me of a cheap vanilla candle.\\" That's how far off it is. For this to smell like a $1 candle would be a huge improvement. It smells like clouds of baby powder and artificial sweetener.The \\"Vanilla\\" sent is putridly sweet and powdery dry. There is no note of the warm milkiness that you expect from even a poor quality vanilla scent. It doesn't smell yummy and edible. It smells nasty and chemical immediately upon application. I wanted to wash it off immediately but I gave it a chance. Upon drydown the powder smell becomes totally overpowering. After a few hours the whole effect faded significantly but not enough for me to avoid washing my wrists to escape it.I gave it one star because zero stars was not an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chemical smell!","review":"Very synthetic! It's very hard to nail a true jasmine scent, and Auric Blends fails to measure up. Since ordering this roll-on, I have discovered a jasmine scent named \\"Zen\\" by Indikah. Now that is fantastic jasmine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gack!","review":"I cannot STAND the smell of this. I love the smell of coconut....but this is not it. Overpowering and just flat rank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Auric Blends Egyptian Goddess Roll-On","review":"I didn't use this product.

Amazon did refund promptly which I appreciated but I hate to have to return things."},{"rating":"2","title":"yummy","review":"This scent is absolutely delicious! Auric Blends is my new favorite brand, all of their perfume oils are amazing and they mix beautifully to make your own signature scent, but they also work wonders all on their own. This one is a white amber musk combination, its fresh, and has soft floral notes of Egyptian Goddess (my #1 fave) and also slightly spicy but sweet base notes of sandalwood. It's worn well in the summer because your body heat changes it quite a bit to make a lusciously sweet and sexy, truly unique fragrance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smells Beautiful","review":"I love perfume oils because they stay with you longer than the spray. This oil is very floral when you first put it on and then becomes softer smelling when it melds into your skin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't smell it on me or in the bottle","review":"I seriously couldn't smell a thing. Had my teenage daughter smell it too and she couldn't smell it either. However, my teenage son yelled that the smell was horrible--to not pack his lunch or touch anything of his while wearing it. Came out in a weird greasy way from roller. Threw it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"So glad I found this here","review":"I bought a bottle of this years ago and just started using it again and fell in love with it all over again. I didn't remember wear I got it, nor did I know if they still made it. I found it here by accident and bought more. YAY! The great thing about this oil is that a little goes a long way and it smells delicious. Expensive perfumes just don't have this staying power. How can this be so good but so inexpensive? This has a casual, flirty scent that I love for every day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't really smell like lavender","review":"I was hoping that becuase this was an oil I would get something that smelled like true lavender. Well, I was sadly disappointed when I received the item. It has hardly any notes of lavender in it and smells more like old French-milled soap. The smell isn't horrible & it lasts but it was what I had expected. I had used the vanilla and coconut oils before and they were true to their scents so I was hoping for the same on this Lavender oil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little scent","review":"Great shipping, the product arrived days before the estimated date. However, I was very disappointed with the oil. I wonder if they sent me an old bottle. The roller ball to apply it was stuck, and once I was able to get the oil out, I could hardly smell anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Help, I smell like a Macaroon cookie!","review":"...either that or marzapan! Don't get me wrong I love, love both types of sweets but I don't want to smell like either one. The first time I wore Black Coconut someone walked into our office and said, 'you ladies are always baking something'. Unfortunatley, we did not have any baked goods in the office that day. I bought this scent because someone here said it smelled like the beach or suntan oil/lotion and thought that is what I am looking for in a summer scent (and I live on the beach, so again I thought, perfect). This left me smelling like a bakery. I was not going for smelling like food items, the pantry or my local bakery/cafe. These are also thick oils and thick scents which I don't mind but others may."},{"rating":"1","title":"Golden honeysuckle - smells like shampoo - do not buy","review":"i was trying to experiment with different brands and love honeysuckle. but when i got this product , it smells like shampoo or soap. i was very disappointed. i asked a few other people and they said the same thing. nothing flowery about this scent at all. do not waste your money"},{"rating":"2","title":"smells great!!!","review":"I've been searching for this scent for almost 3 years now.

Well, the search continues...."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're looking for old-school Patchouli, keep looking","review":"Darn! I'm so disappointed because I really had hopes this would smell like the Patchouli of days gone by. Unfortunately, it doesn't. The oil is thick and goes on smoothly with the roller ball but I detect no Patchouli fragrance. I even tested it with my husband who absolutely adores Patchouli: I did not tell him I bought this and when it came in I applied it in several strategic locations. He did not detect the slightest hint of Patchouli! In my opinion, the bottle I received may be old because it actually has the fragrance of cardboard. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too man-like for me","review":"I thought I'd try this based on some lovely reviews, but sadly this wasn't for me. Gave me a man kinda smell. Not what I was going for. Had to toss. A little strong and headache-inducing as well.

It's a constant, great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little \\"old lady\\" by itself - try layering","review":"As others have said, this scent goes on very light. The first time I applied, it was very faint and lasted a few minutes. I reapplied a few times before I got a good concentration of fragrance. It smells a little spicy, musky, a little powdery, a little floral, a bit medicinal. I think of older women when I smell this by itself.I did try layering with my everyday perfume, and it added more musk and spiciness, which I thought was lacking. I like the scent but I'm still on the fence and will need to get a second opinion later. I don't think I'll be buying this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!","review":"Majik is a wonderful scent! It's earthy and sweet, but not too sweet and sort of smells a little spicy, too. It's hard to describe. When I put this on, I can smell it all day, unlike other oils or perfumes I've had that I forget I'm wearing after 20 minutes. Not only does the scent last when you're wearing it, but the shelf-life of this stuff is phenomenal, too... I bought a bottle like 15 years ago and then forgot I had it. I recently found it again and the scent hasn't diminished at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Egyptian Goddess","review":"This is the most enchanting scent I've ever smelled. It's been my favorite for a few years, now.I don't know how to describe it... it's slightly musky, but has a very beautiful nostalgic aroma to it, like something you'd find in an antique store.I also recommend pouring some of the perfume into an oil burner; it really warms up the room with its beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"All time favorite!","review":"This will be my 3rd bottle of this perfume.

I didn't like the smell from the bottle and neither from the back of my hand where I placed a small amount. It smells like a funeral pallor or something funky,there is a dominant scent perhaps Lilly, sorry, not for me. To be fair I will try on pulse point to see if there is an improvement, which I doubt.

Its almost sickeningly sweet, and I really don't sense that much coconut. It almost smells syrupy. I put it on though because oils can smell different on the body then it does in the jar. 4 hours later and its still pretty sweet...not as bad as it was when I first put it on , but definitely smelling even less like coconut. I thought I would be getting a true tropical warm scent from the description... (pure coconut with a bit of spice) but, alas, I go right back to the bubble_gum scents of junior high when I smell this. Does anyone have any recommendations for a TRUE coconut scent? (Nutty,creamy, musky, and warm smelling) I'm willing to try anything!

I was pleasantly surprised to see that the quantity of this was much larger than I had expected. It smells great and applies easily due to the roll-on top. It is a very delicate, subtle scent, which I was looking for, but it seems to fade right away unless covered by some clothing. I dab this on my wrists every morning and usually by lunch time the scent is undetectable unless I bring my wrist right up to my nose.

It just so happened to also smell like patchouli which I can't stand!!I will no longer order from this site for that I KNOW what it should smell like and I don't know if it's old or what but that is not the Egyptian goddess I have been getting I will spend the extra few dollars and go to the real site!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Strong when you first put it on but then it is very mild.

It has a slightly sweet, flowery scent that most definitely captures the exotic, tropical island aroma. If you want to entice a certain special someone \\"even more so on a hot summers night\\" this is a sure win. Usually arrives within seven days and Auric blends has great packaging as well.

I opened it and without smelling it first just rolled a little bit on my arm, I smelled like an old lady all day (no offense intended). Right after I put it on this really sexy guy I work with walks in and says it smells weird in here what is that!? I showed him the scent and the disgust on his face said it all lol. Then of course I figured it'll fade soon enough but no I could smell it for hours so I said screw this I need to wash my wrists. Even then I could kind of smell it and I don't have smelling like a dog it was just that bad. When I got home that night I had my grandma and mom see of they liked it and the look on their face was priceless haha, I need to send this crap back.

I got it only two days after ordering, even before the items that I ordered the same day with prime 2-day shipping.Comes in a super convenient small bottle with rolling applicator, perfect for bringing with you and freshening up on the go. The jasmine scent isn't that strong but still smells good, with a hint of vanilla actually. Very summery. Worth buying but if you really want a strong jasmine scent I would recommend looking for a more pure jasmine essential oil. Sun's Eye Herbal Essentials offers a fantastic jasmine rose option at an extremely reasonable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little scent straight from the bottle","review":"Take the cap off and sniff, and you'll get a light whiff of this perfume. Not bad, really. But, roll it on and the scent disappears. I've used it several times and the result is the same...nothing. I can only think that it is just too weak to have a scent when spread thinly on the skin. I am aware that an individual's personal chemistry can affect perfumes, but I expect some scent, even if different once applied. Disappointing, to say the least, and I am afraid I cannot recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mari","review":"i got this item after reading all the reviews.

So I set out to buy it as a perfume. This particular roll-on is very very strong, which is good, as it'll last a long time in view of the fact that you don't need to put much on. Be careful, though. You have been warned. It can be quite overpowering. Which it why I merely dab a bit between my ladies, and that's that. Bob's your uncle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"I bought this thinking it would be as fragrant as other oils that I have used. Not so. I put a small amount of this on right after I got it, which was fast, and you could smell it for a few minutes. Then nothing. I thought maybe I didn't put enough on, so I reapplied. Same thing happened, even though I used more the second time. I emailed the company to see if it was possible to get an out dated or bad batch. They wrote back and told me that their oils aren't like other ones and you need to apply it 4-5 times to get the fragrance to last. Does anyone else see something wrong with that?! Seems ridiculous to me. Anyway, I'm not going to send it back so I guess I'll just use it when I want to smell it for a few minutes. Wish I would have known because I wouldn't have gotten it or done business with this company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Scent","review":"Love this oil.

I have read many books about the legend of Merlin and King Arthur, but this book by far was the most fictional. It allowed me to see another side of the story.

I did get confused by Merlin and how T H White tried to explain his aging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Upside down fairy tale","review":"Wonderful, stunning, funny. This write up of the King Arthur saga was, for me, an introduction to the middle ages which made me realize where we come from. The book is about a change agent pur sang, learning, growing, developing AND implementing his vision of how to live together in one of the most difficult of times.The best thing about fantastic books is when they make your own fantasy take you on a trip to a place where time runs backward, Kings are chasing beasts, magicians fall in love and knights save the life of virgins.Already looking forward to the time when I will be able to read this book to my children...If you don't like British humor, do not read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I ever read","review":"I have read many books, inlcuding several that portray stories from midevil times, this one was the worst.

I felt that i read it because i was compelled to. Honestly this was too long of a book for the amount of information given. i fell white couldve of shortened it a little. In reference to people's mad review about the humor, i disagree. The OAFK has the most dull and senseless humor i have ever heard before in my life. So in conclusion i must rate this the lowest of all books and to those who want to read it watch the movie or better yet the cartoon on channel 13"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The Once and Future King is about King Arthur and all his adventures he has. That sounds interesting to me, but not when u start to read it. T. H. White makes an interesting story very boring. Even the actions scenes are boring, like when there is the war against King Arthur by the rebels and King Lot I found my self wondering, 'wait, what is happening? Whos winning?'Also you can tell the book is really old by the style of writing. There are many misspelled words too, but I don't know if that is on purpuse because the person saying the word is pernouncing it wrong or not.Overall I think it is a terrible book, and that is saying something cause normally I like all fantasy books and espically books that take place in Medeivel Times, cause they are normally INTERESTING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the few books I ever truely hated.","review":"This is one of the most horrible books I have ever read. It is long and drawn out. Sacrificing trees for this mindless drivel should be a crime. The only slightly interesting part was the first book, The Sword and the Stone, when seeing Arthur's early years in more depth then a Disney movie would allow made me optimistic about the rest of the book. After that, absolutely nothing of importance happens. Throughout this book, I was rooting for Lancelot and Guinever to die, so maybe we could focus on Arthur, the only interesting character. The others are all shallow and uninteresting. I felt no emotional connection to any of the characters that were being focused on."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING! DO NOT READ THIS BOOK UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE BORED!","review":"When I read this book I found it to be the most boring book in the world. I could not understand what I was reading because my mind would just trail off into outerspace from sheer boredom. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE BORED! IT DESERVES LESS THAN A ONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Arthur Book Ever!","review":"This is, without a doubt, the worst King Arthur book I have ever read (and I have read plenty)! The characters are silly and boring. The first section tells the tale of Arthur as a child. This is probably the best part of the book, and it's not very good. The remainder of the story is pretty much Lancelot and Guinevere whining about how guilty they feel cheating Arthur, and then refusing to stop what they're doing.This might be an okay book for children -although the Lancelot/Guinevere portion is probably not suitable- but I can't imagine any adult taking pleasure in this atrocious book.For some good Arthurian literature try Marion Zimmer Bradley, Jack Whyte, Mary Stewart, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"painful and slow","review":"I tried, I really tried to read this book but could only manage about 160 pages of this 600 page monster. He alludes to so much Latin, French and yer ye Olde English, it was virtually impossible for me to follow along. Many of the words he uses are not in modern dictionaries, so if you don't have a good command of English or have good reference material, TH White can leave you guessing alot of the time. Usually I can guess meanings through context clues but in this book it was much harder than usual.Of what I read, none of it flowed smoothly from chapter to chapter, it just jumped all over the place. By the time Wart was a bird for the second time, I was screaming, get on with the story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dont try to read it in one night.","review":"I was supposed to read this book for summer reading. I put it off, which I shouldnt have until the ngiht before. I kind of like the story...or at least what I read....but it is SO freakin hard to understand. I just didnt get it. I wish they couldve been a tidge clearer with the whole story and it would have been great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good if you like the genre...","review":"When we read this book in tenth grade English our class was sharply divided. Those that liked medieval fantasy enjoyed the book, while those of us whose tastes lay elsewhere were mostly unimpressed. As one that belonged to the latter group, I found much of this book tedious, but I liked some of the politics and genuinely enjoyed the love affair between Sir Lancelot and Guenever. I'd add the antics of the irrational Red Queen, but I guess that was in Through the Looking Glass. Overall, I gave the book a four-star rating because it does have some appealing parts, and fans of medieval fantasy usually like the book very much. But if your tastes lie elsewhere you are advised to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beginning and end of Arthurian genre.","review":"I'll confess that this was the first literary piece of Arthurian Legend that I read. I was a young adult at the time. After reading this I have gone on to read a number of other versions of Arthur's world. I've taken them all at their own worth and they have contributed to my Arthurian \\"knowledge\\". However I will say that I've used T.H. White's version as the benchmark for all others. This is an incredibly well written and presented story of Arthur. And as the title of this review says. It is the beginning point of all modern Arthurian Legend coverage for me and all others are measured by it. Read The Once and Future King/Book of Merlin, learn all the names and places, timelines and events. This will give you the basis for going on to explore any/all other Arthurian works.Following this I'd recommend Mary Stewart's trilogy. But only after you read Once and Future King/Book of Merlin first."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most wonderful story of all time!","review":"The Once and Future King is the most wonderful book I have ever read! I was forced to read it because of an assignment in school, however, I was pleasently surprised! I finished it with in a matter of days of starting it! I really got into the story and felt as though I was watching something happen right in front of me! I enjoyed the romance between Guinevere and Lancelot, the balence between gentle love, war, and justice that Arthur possessed, and the mystical adventures that Merlin took Arthur on! This was the best book that I have ever read! Next up, The book of Merlin!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How I wish I was thirteen again ...","review":"... And able to read T. H. White's admirable rendition of the Legend of Arthur for the first time.Alas, I am only able to experience this vicariously, having given the book to my nephew some time ago. Also, alas, I fear too late, as he has wanted to follow the modern path of fast things with wheels.(But he may yet learn of the magic of Merlyn, and the mystery of the sword, Excalibur).Mr. White's rendition is at once easy to read, and deeply insightful, sometimes darkly so, taking us from Arthur as a young lad, to Arthur ruling uneasily in Camelot.Highly recommended to anyone who is young, or young at heart. Read it to your children or grandchildren, if you must."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"I read this when I was in high school, then again in college, and now again I find the story appealing and timeless.

I usually only read the speach bubbles on the comic strip \\"Garfield\\" but for some reason, when I read this book, I had trouble stopping. The author has a unique style of writing that is both captivating and intertaining. This book is classified as Fantasy, but really it could be a number of genres: action, adventure, romance, and humor. If you like any of those, I highly recommend you read this book. The book is quite legnthy, but then again I considered that an asset rather than a drawback. Overall, I would give this book 4 1/2 stars, but since that wasn't available, i had to give it 5, because it sure wasn't a 4.

It is riveting, humorous, and contains scores of jokes best suited to those with a classical education and Catholic leanings."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"I missed out on this book when I was younger and have only recently read it for the first time. As a child, I can see how some might deem this book a little slow, especially with the war-heavy second half of Sword in the Stone, but as an adult, this book is an excellent venture. It reads more like a historical fantasy rather than an epic one, due to the attention to dates and historic detail of Arthurian Albion, but all the general legendry is there. The language is ornate and exquisite and the story ranges from whimsical to tragic without flaws. There are some mistakes in the editing, but that's just Harper being careless. I recommend this book to any adult fantasy lover. A new favourite for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're looking for the Camelot you're used to - DON'T read this!","review":"I'm half way through this book - it's taken me a month to get this far. I keep putting it down and reading an ENTIRE other book before picking it up again.The 1940's \\"pop culture\\" references in what should be a historical work are VERY out of place, and jar you out of the story when you least suspect it. The work does not flow in any way, shape or form. His way of writing makes many of the charachters sound incrdibly ignorant and simple. Also, I find the historcal timeline to contradict itself severely.I would not even consider this a good book for children, as it does not grab the attention enough, or flow well enough in my opinion. Also much of the vocabulary would be well beyond the education level of kids.For someone like me who can normally pick up the worst written books and get some pleasure out of it, I don't even know what to say about this one. Go get The Mysts of Avalon - it's a much better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The print is verrrry small","review":"Warning! This paperback edition has very small print.

That went out the window rather quickly. I might have liked this book, had I been born in England 60 years ago and had an intricate knowledge of obscure old English references concerning their medieval period and items contained within. However, I have to say that I read through a few chapters of White's novel where I was left with no sense of what had just happened.He goes into intricate explanations of scenery, events, and items that last for pages. This in itself is not bad, however, White seems to have been going through the Old English Book of archaic terms while he was doing this. Not a fun read, you might as well break out your dictionary and thesaurus because that's the only way you're going to understand what White is describing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Longest Book Ever Written (Almost)","review":"The First Chapter went pretty quickly; however, the second was the longest and most boring chapter in the entire book- it took me at least a month to finish the first few pages of it. It becomes very complicated and confusing and I had to read it over and over again to actually understand what was going on. Of course, my opinion is biased because I am forced to read it for school for the summer. But anyway, it seems like a fairly good book. I gave it two stars because Chapter 2 was awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very slow moving book","review":"The book is kind of good, but it moves very very slowly ... there are periods when you feel like its not getting anywhere .. the literature is of course very good, but a ver slow book"},{"rating":"1","title":"i didnt enjoy it at all","review":"i, along with a bunch of people in my district had to read this book for summer reading. i found it dull. i could barely work throught it, and i love to read. normally i ready very quickly but this was just to awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Library Binding is Inferior","review":"The library binding edition is inferior.

Not inviting for a young reader--or anyone for that matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Arthurian Tale Done Right!","review":"This book is almost too good for words! I read \\"The Once and Future King\\" as a school project when I was a teenager. Never did I enjoy homework so much! T.H. White had me hanging on every word of this wonderfully done version of the story of King Arthur. Of particular interest was the attention paid to Lancelot. White brought this character alive and made him a living, breathing being. After reading this book as a young man I was dazzled with thoughts of chivalry and virtuous conduct. It really enriched my life. \\"The Once and Future King\\" is truly great literature!

This book is not just a amazing work of art, but it is a guide onto life. The mesmerizing imagery and the sneaky satires drew me in to the story faster than you can say wow! It allowed me to see things that I've never seen before. It also confermed some of my doubts towards life. This book is better than a classroom. White's way of communication reaches pass your defences and leave you senseless. He takes on the role of Merlyn and makes you his student. I love this book, especialy the lessons and the symbolisms. White satirizes the major world powers without directly putting down his own thoughts. This book is for all ages. As long as you have an obsession towards learning and strive to better yourself. I mean, who could be a better teacher than Merlyn-\\"Education is experience, and the essence of experience is self-reliance.\\" This is a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"rather enthralling and purely wonderful","review":"I had to read this book over the summer for my senior thesis class.

I FINALLY finished it today. The book is one of the worst I've ever read. It's depth is so far over my head that i'm not sure i understand it enough to answer my review questions for school. Sadly, the only part of the book that kept my attention was the Lancelot and Gwen affair. That is the only reason i give it 2 stars. I wouldn't recommend this book for anyone under 20, unless you are patient and have a bunch of time on your hands. It's just way too confusing and boring!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased with purchase","review":"The book I received from Amazon was in great condition and arrived in a very timely fashion. The only negative about the purchase was that I couldn't locate before buying, what edition this particular book was. I was purchasing this for a college course and knowing the exact edition would have been very helpful. But other than that, I was very satisfied with Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read with caution","review":"White's novel is testimony to his exceptional writing skills, but White fictionalizes history in ways that can be misleading. The great irony of this book is that, in spite of White's diatribes against the Celts, Arthur himself was of Celtic origin. To learn the real story behind the Arthur legend, I recommend Ashe's book The Discovery of King Arthur. If Arthur really was Riothamus, this defeats the political agenda of White's novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"bogus basis","review":"I picked this book up expecting a unique twist on the King Arthur legend. What I got was a pothetic explanation for how Merlin got his magical powers -that he had access to modern technology. So instead of the mighty wizard mumbling a spell to cure an illness, he wips out his penacillin syringe. I'm sorry if you loved this rendition, but King Arthur has to be mideival. No excuse is good enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring and dull","review":"i am a huge fan of fantasy and medieval legends, but i HATED this book. i found the descriptions to be dull, and thought the entirety of the novel to be boring. i may be in the minority, but i'll take disney's adaptation of this (The Sword in the Stone) any day! give me Lord of the Rings or The Chronicles of Narnia; but as far as this book, run away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wondrous and essentially Arthurian!","review":"I've been in love with the Arthur legend ever since I first heard it, so naturally I was interested in this book. After I read it, it became the ultimate authority for me; I judge all other versions (including Malory's) in light of this perfect version. It brings out the characters of Guenever, Lancelot, Arthur, Mordred, and the Orkney brothers like no other version ever has. Everything makes sense and hangs together.

He wasn't really a king when he was seven through sixteen. It was just him playing around with his friends like normal people, they did not get into trouble a lot but there were being pretty good kids. The book has a lot of details about medieval life. More details than I care to know.The real story starts out with the sword in the stone. No one could pull it out but Arthur. Then he met the Queen of Air and darkness also known as Morgan le Fay. Arthur goes through a lot like the Ill made Knight and The Candle in The Wind. I think it got a bit more interesting by then, but I really didn't care about the characters. I really do not like the book because I am not that interested in medieval things. I think the author needs to rephrase most of the book. This book wasn't to my tastes at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"From silly to sad","review":"This is one of the most read fantasy takes on the Arthur legends. Very good book but odd because the first third of the book is an almost silly funny story seemingly aimed at children but quickly turns into a sad, dark tale primarily focusing on the Arthur, Lancelot, Guenevere love triangle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Read Too Much in One Night!","review":"I had to read \\"Sword in the Stone\\" and \\"Queen of Air and Darkness\\" from this book for school, but didn't have the fortune to read it over the summer. I thought that the book was okay, but my teacher gave us way too much to read each night. We had to read about 4-6 chapters a night. That's a little too much for me to digest in such a short time period. At least if I had been assigned this book over the summer, I could have read this book in a more leisurely pace. I rented \\"Camelot\\" before the test over the book, but it turned out to be based on the 3rd or 4th book. It did help somewhat about the lessons that Arthur learned as different animals. Now I will have at least some background information when we come back to the 2nd half of the book. This isn't a bad book, it's just that I was forced to read too much in too little a time period."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down even if I wanted to","review":"This story is I think one of the best reads I have ever read. It was definetly not the kind of book you could put down or read half way through and stop. It's the kind of book that urges you to read more and you do. Once and Future King was full of everything from action to adventure to even comedy and drama I found so many different genre in this one book. I liked this book because it took a boring subject like the life of King Arthur and made it come to life with jousts, magic, quests, and a love triangle that will make your head spin. Though i will admit it does get slow at some parts but once your past those your ok. This book is a must read and should be on everyones shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting book, worth taking a look at","review":"I found this book a very interesting read, although it did take me quite a while to get through it, my attention remained. I found that I enjoyed the first part of the book the best, the story of Arthur's childhood told in a rather playful fashion. The rest of the book was someone politically, chivalry-oriented. I found interesting the way that the author inserted passages dealing with magic, and odd or interesting things simply as if they were everyday occurences. I found especially amusing the antics of some of the knights, even if they were not meant to be amusing. I was a bit dissapointed in the whole story of the Holy Grail, it was confusing, and difficult to keep track of each knight separately. The characters were quite interesting, but I found that Arthur lagged a bit after the first book. It was certainly not the best book I've read, but I would reccomend it if you're browsing through or have heard of it before."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the book with something for everyone!","review":"It has romance, action, adventure, fantasy, historical fiction! Every insationable thirst for a good book will be quenched thoroughly! I've never enjoyed a \\"required reading\\" book for class so much! I highly recommend this book to anyone fascinated with the classic tale of King Arthur, or anyone looking for a good read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most beautiful book ever written","review":"I first read this book in 10th grade as an assignment, and quickly fell in love with it. The characters are so real and human, so worthy of love and hate, you don't want the book to end. You want it to be real and live in it and know and love and hate Arthuer, Guinevere, Lancelot, Merlin, Morgan Le Fay, and all the other beautifully scripted characters. Truly, this is the book of sighs......"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic in every sense of the word","review":"For those who struggle with the length and detail of Le Morte d'Arthur or Lord Tennison's poetic version of same, a work showing the beauty, honor, ethics and chivalry of Arthurian legends is not lacking. The Once and Future King is an extremely well crafted interpretation, showcasing the moral and ethical dillemas faced by all those with power over their environment or others. Some may call the book preachy, but I find much worth emulating in this tale of gentle sadness."},{"rating":"2","title":"An epic delight","review":"Four books comprise this epic of the life of King Arthur, from his childhood, when Merlyn was teaching him to gain other perspectives by transforming him into animals (Disney had a field day with that one) to his future as king dealing with dark witches and double-crossing relatives and betrayal by Lancelot and Guinevere.White has a dry sense of humor and many wonderful insights into human nature, as well as a deep understanding of the theory of swordsmanship and chivalry to imbue the adventures with a sense of historical accuracy. I love this kind of stuff, and The Once and Future King is a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"all things...","review":"On the back of the paperback edition of The Once and Future King there is a description that says, \\"It is the book of all things lost and wonderful and sad,\\" what a beautiful, perfect way to describe the book. Although I am a neophyte at fantasy and Arthurian literature, this was one of the finest pieces of writing I have ever come across. It is similar, especially in the first book, The Sword and the Stone, to the Orwell Animal Farm in that it is simple, if you choose to look at it that way, but can be enjoyed on several levels. The best thing about White's writing is that nothing is simple and everything is simple. Read it and see"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall Good","review":"Although the book is long and some parts are slow or confusing it mostly a very good book. The last chapter is phenomenal! The chapter and a few other parts in the book are very thought provoking. It probably is the greatest King Arthur story ever written although it would be more enjoyable if the author did not consistently relate back to Malory. Many of the characters are very well-made and it is definately understandable why T.H. White's book was a great literary achievement and has become the classic it is today."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic with plenty of themes to ponder","review":"I found this to be a terribly slow book to read. The frequent narrative asides (many extremely anachronistic) were a major distraction and prevented me from settling into a rhythm as I read. As a result, I found myself easily distracted while trying to read this book.However, it was worth the effort. T.H. White is exploring a number of significant issues here. It seems to me, looking at the period in which he was writing, that he was trying to use the Arthur legends as a vehicle to search for some meaning or understanding of the great events of his lifetime (i.e., World Wars I and II). Is war inevitable? Can it ever be justified? What alternatives might be found to avoid it? These are some of the questions that White confronts in his telling of story of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round table. In the end, it doesn't seem that White finds any definitive answers. But he certainly provides plenty of food for thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"A work of Art!","review":"A wonderful book that tells of a great tale of epic fantasy and chivalry. When I read it for the first time as a 6th grader I became very bored witht the book, but now that I have matured and have to read it for an AP Lit. class I am really enjoying this book. It is divided up into 4 sections, the first being the Sword in the Stone, which is what the Disney movie was based on, the second being the Queen of Air and Darkness, which tells of Queen Morlan, the Orkneys, and the invention of the Round Table and Arthur's early thoughts on Chivalry, the third section is The Ill Made Night, which is about Lancelot and how he falls in love with Guenivere and Their \\"love triangle\\" or should I say \\"Love Quadrangle\\"...The last section is called the Candle in the Wind.It is an overall awesome book which is a must read classic for anyone who loves a tale of fantasy and chivalry."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books written!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I thought that this book was one of the best books ever written. We had to read the Sword In the Stone Part of the book and reading the rest was optional. Of course, me, Being a huge fan of books like this read it. The retelling of king Arthur by T.H> White was one of the best that i have read.It starts out with the tell of Warts(Arthur) \\"eddication\\" by Merlyn the wizard, with a number of adventures in which The Wart is turned into several different animals. and learns the secrets of all the animals.WHen you get into the second, third and fourth book is takes you through arthurs Reign as King. We see him Marry Gewn, be betryed by Lancelot, and the quest for the Holy Grail. It ends with the knighting of Arthurs page when the Round Table is in Disaray, and with Arthur reminiscing aobut his childhood, and he remembers all his teachins from Merlyn.All in all, I give this book 5 stars. I couldnt put this down and i would recomend it to anyone who likes to read. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 Stars, actually","review":"Really, really good!!! It's about three kids: Harper, Sophie, and Y.L. They are all starting school on the same day as new students (that isn't really very realistic, but oh well.) There is a very snobby group of girls who pretend to want to invite Sophie into their group, but really they just want to tease her. Y.L. has to take ballet class because his dad (who works at a radio station) thinks it would be good preparation for football. And Harper doesn't know anything about her family history, and is determined to find out. When Harper finds her birth certificate (without the name \\"Harper\\" on it!) everything changes. To find out what happens- read the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for your little soccer star","review":"My daughter is just learning to play soccer (age 2) and this is a good intro.

The ball is just the right size."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 3 year old loves it!","review":"Overall this is a great soccer set - not too young for my 3 year old and perfectly sized for his needs right now. The only problem is that like other reviews mentioned a needle was not included for the pump/ball so we had to go out and get one. I guess Little Tikes needs to quality check their products a little better before shipping. Beyond that, this is a great toy and we are very satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I thought that this product was flimsy and not quite as advertised.

They must be the same people who made this or they didn't actually watch it. This was one of the most boring 90 minutes i've ever spent. The video is cheap and is always so dark that you can't even see what kind of cars are racing. Not that it matters since they are all so .... Then for 20 mintues we get to watch a cars race around a track on Japan. Wow! When the guys filming it finally find something interesting (an accident) you can't even get a good look at it because the camera is so jerky. The mostentertaining part of the DVD is the bonus footage. Which is most just girl's shaking their T&A. Avoid this DVD and buy Miscief 3000, real street racing with REAL cars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Worthless DVD","review":"This is the most worthless DVD I have ever seen. From the description you think you will see some quality street racing and all you get is lousy video shots, horrible sound and an hour of your life you wont get back again.

Dont waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor filming and editing","review":"I was very disapointed with this DVD.The filming was poor, and the film editing was even worse!The only good footage was of the JGTC race, but it was ruined with useless visual effects and really made it annoying to watch.There was a lot of potential, but it was lost in the editing.If you don't believe me, buy it and find out for yourself!

The quality of the shots are lousy, the racing is so lame its not even funny. There are about 15 minutes of actual racing and they shot it horribly.

I wouldnt even give it 1 star but its as low as you can go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it sounds.","review":"... Imagine a Skateboarding video with cars and that's what you get for the better part of this DVD. Most of the Races are pretty boring,go with the crowd any Sat night and you'll see the same sort of things on an empty road.

No subwoofers, no cop chases no anything a couple 25 ft long drag races that my mom probably could have one. This is the worst video ever. Anyone that gives it more than the worst rating possible only did it because they were either in the movie or because get some of the profit if it sells. I cant believe I spent any money on this piece of junk. DO NOT BUY IT, SPEND A COUPLE MORE BUCKS AND GET THE MOVIE MISCHIEF 3000.

The songs are rendered with sincerity and thoughtfulness, reflecting the variation of emotions which occur within each human life--some powerful and electric, others pensive and achingly beautiful.On the cover, David Frain, with his exquisite artwork, has depicted the essence of the music--the journey of a soul, clad in mortal DNA, from its origins to the ultimate reaching--and joining with-- the light of the Divine. At least, that is my interpretation of this mysterious and beautiful work.Thanks to all these artists for this very special gift. Their talents and the love of their craft are obvious throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"$3.99 better spent on a drink at Starbucks","review":"If you have seen the preview, you have seen the whole movie.
