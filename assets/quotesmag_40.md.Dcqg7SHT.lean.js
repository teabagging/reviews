I agree that you are putting 21st century values on a 19th century character. I guess I read these novels for a light easy escape and that is just what Christina Dodd gives me.

And then I realized there are too many books out there that I will enjoy so I stopped about one third of the way through. I just could not take any more. The characters are so contrived, they do things that no normal human being in any time period would do. How is it possible that this woman was so straight-laced she was known for being stiff and she loses her mind for one good looking barbarian? Please! Why? He's rude, he's a chauvinist. The only possible reason would be his title, his money and possibly his children. This was absolutely a dreadful read and Christina Dodd has done so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite...","review":"I thought that Hannah should have punched Dougald in the gut and promptly left him...on her way out, she should have punched the butler for good measure!I got so frustrated with the way Dougald was behaving that I couldn't finish the book.

I have read every single one and enjoyed them immensely!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Complicated and hot","review":"I have not read any of the other books in this series. However, I have suffered through several inferior books in recent weeks.

The book didn't culminate in one big love scene. I intend to read more of Dodd's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why would anyone fall for Dougald?","review":"I do not understand why ANY woman would want to be with a man like Dougald. I like books where the characters evolve, but I didn't get the sense that Dougald evolved at all.He was so unbearably cruel and mean to Hannah in this book. He even talks to himself about how \\"easy\\" it would be to kill her! And he's the \\"hero\\"? Not in my world. He never acknowledges his part in his failed marriage and is so pathetic that he's planned revenge on the innocent young woman who ran from him nine years ago. Get a life, Dougald!He's mean to Hannah, and takes pleasure in her pain. That isn't love.I kept hoping for some glimpse into Dougald that would salvage this tortured and torturing character but I found none. I would have run away from this ogre too.Please, writers, get back to ROMANCE.Readers, save your money and read all of Julia Quinn's books or Suzanne Enoch's. THOSE are heroes to remember.....Kat"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot and steamy!!!","review":"This was my first book by Christina Dodd and I have to say that it was not my last. Okay this story first opens up with our heroine waiting all alone in the dark for a carriage to take her to her new employer's house. Good so far and it does get better. That first scene with our herione and hero is very hot, and while our hero did seem to be a little mean at times well all I can say is made for some very hot conflicts! The mystery was pretty good too oh and I hated our hero's faithful butler or whatever the heck he was he was really nasty and he actually caused alot of hardship for our herione in the past. Very good gothic romance I know it is in the Regency times and everything but it had a very gothic tone to it to me and I LOVE gothic romances!! 5 stars for steaminess and good story line and of course a very sexy hero who tries so hard to deny his feelings for our heroine but deep down has loved her all along, and really that is what makes a truly terrific story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Title, Not Much Else","review":"Eat This Bug was a huge disappointment. It's main fault is that it contains very little detailed information. There are some nice pictures in this book, a list of insects that are suitable for feeding reptiles and amphibians and not much else. There is no discussion of reptile and amphibian nutrition, little information on how to care for your insects once you get them home, little or no information on culturing your own insects, and no information about the suitability of different insects as food for different reptiles and amphibians. The book is so simplistic, it seems to be written for children. It was a big waste of my time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eat this Bug: A Guide to Invertebrate Live Foods","review":"At $9.95 I thought this book was way overpriced.

He LOVED the game! He's a game whiz but it surprised me that he had beaten it after about a total of 10 hours of play (not all at once). He wished it was a two player game so he could play with his friend, but thats the only complaint he had. If i get the free time i might try to play it, it looks intersting enough. As an adult i like more challanging games but if its a gift for a teen i think it's a good bet, especially if you want to get your kid interested in history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been a lot better...","review":"The game play was not very good compared to Medal of Honor series or Call of Duty series.

So far, and I admit I haven't played through all of the battles, it seems like a poorly-done, overly-simplified, super-easy, first-person-shooter with an extremely rigid linear play-through capacity.It says that you command full complements of troops of varying types across the battlefields. Um...where is that exactly? From the description I was expecting an advanced version of Star Wars Battlefront series. You know, a campaign game from each side, then an opportunity to fight whichever battles you wanted from different perspectives. I guess that would have taken more than the 37 minutes that they spent programming this though...On the plus side, for what it is (not much), it does provide some small amount of amusement."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is a game to rent NOT to buy","review":"i am really in to the civil war. When i bought this game i thought it would be fun. i was mistaken, the game only has 12 missions none of which are easy, its like pulling teeth.

Another thing is you only get to play one side of the battle. this is a game to rent NOT to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good game","review":"The game Civil war nation divided is very good, when i play it makes me feel like I am reliving the battle.

I like action games. I don't like action games made with a bare bones programming. The game is not entertaining. You spend the majority of the game shooting than hiding. After each shot, you get a smoke cloud that blocks your view and most of the enemies take a couple of shots to kill. Yet, your enemy, even on easy, have amazing accuracy with thier shooting. The civil war guns are known for being highly inaccurate. Overall, if you got to try it, just rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"History channel should be ashamed.","review":"Like many others I couldn't wait to play this game. After playing it I was kind of dissapointed. For one the types of weapons used in the game were not that common during the war its self. Secondly the solo man on a simple mission, give me a break. Thirdly the battleground should have had alot more bodies laying around. And last but not least only being able to play six missions as a confederate, and the other six as a YANKEE. To me playing as a yankee is like playing as a NAZI in a ww2 game. Where was the line battles, Where was the Cavalry Charges? First person shooter is great for ww2 and other modern warfare games, but not for the war between the states."},{"rating":"1","title":"The description of the game is false advertisement","review":"Do not believe the description Amazon gives of this game. It's a blatant lie.\\"Control full compliments of troops and move them across the battlefield - cavalry, musketeers, riflemen and moreCommand cannons and mortars, build and take forts and experience 3D combat\\"1. You don't control any compliment of troops other than the one soldier you play as.2. You don't dig a trench, let alone build a fort.3. The \\"3D combat\\" might as well be 2D sidescrolling combat, because the game limits your movement so severely that you might as well be on rails.In addition, this game is grossly historically inaccurate. Other reviewers have already covered how, so I'll leave it at that. This game is atrocious."},{"rating":"2","title":"History as a first person shooter","review":"Excellent game overall.

Like the underground prison into which he is thrown for years, Kaspar is a black hole into which his story is sucked. This film is really about two connected themes, both reflecting German anxieties about its past. Hauser's treatment and fate exposes the Enlightenment society that destroys him, just as his seemingly primitive characteristics (grunting etc.) undermine its insistence on artificiality, manners and wit.Secondly, a film set in Nuremberg, with a hero twice wrenched from his home and incarcerated, and who has his diary burnt, is clearly 'explaining' a more recent notorious past, that of the Nazis, showing how Germany would rather couch uncomfortable history in vague mythology. A comparison between this tricksy, paranoid, exhausting film, and Herzog's restrained, enigmatic version of the same story would be instructive. The latter is a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"cypress edge","review":"I have this movie on dvd and it is a good film rod steiger has a limited role but if your a real fan of mr steiger you will enjoy this movie. good acting by mr steiger and a good story line...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely good for both native and non-native speakers","review":"What a fantastically enlightening and helpful book!

It comes in a large bottle, bigger than I thought when buying it. I might get a small spray bottle to fill for taking around with me.

After reading the reviews on this one, I thought I had struck gold. The product just came today and, in my opinion, doesn't really smell like much of anything, other than alcohol. There is a faint, somewhat honeysuckle-ish fragrance under the alcohol odor. I have a honeysuckle vine in my yard & I love the smell of it when it is blooming and that's the fragrance I was expecting. This just misses the mark. Maybe the fragrance is just too faint to overpower the smell of alcohol (the first ingredient of this product). The fragrance also doesn't last very long at all. A couple of hours and it's gone. I'd send it back but between the postage both ways & the restocking fee it's just not worth it. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this unit!","review":"I have always paid to have my chains sharpened. The last two years have required more cutting and more sharpening.

This book allows me to share that interest with my third-grade daughter. It is entertaining and well written. It celebrates the diversity of our presidents and lets children know that anyone can grow up to be president. There is not one set of characteristics that describes our presidents. The book has charming illustrations, and is written in easy language. The book celebrates presidential achievements, and it does not gloss over the shortcomings of the presidents whose reputations were tarnished by impeachment. My daughter is most pleased that there is a bowling alley and a movie theater in the White House.

It's a picture of him naked being lowered by a crane into a bath as he stuffs his face. Okay so during his presidency he weighed 300lbs.

St. George states that no one of color has ever been President. While when she wrote this book that may have been true, it is now embarrassingly inaccurate.

Children hear much about the president, whom ever he or she might be, and they deserve to know meaningful information about the office and the difficult demands of being the president of the United States.Trivial information does not humanize the president it makes the president appear silly and unimportant. While the children will laugh at what they read, the only thing that can be considered important about the book is that the children practice breaking the code to read the sentences. If that is all you want a child to gain from reading the book, this book will serve the purpose as will any book. If, however, you want to help a child understand the government, the need for qualified candidates, and the demands of public life, this book defeats your purposes entirely."},{"rating":"1","title":"The pot calling the kettle black...","review":"I find it to be an irony that the author high handedly cautions children not to lie like former President Bill Clinton did then goes on to lie to them that he was impeached. President Clinton was NOT impeached. To try and manipulate young minds based on her own political leanings no matter what they are is unconscionable and pathetic. She should teach history but leave the parents to do the rest as she is obviously very unqualified. I can only hope that the author doesn't have offspring of her own. I am personally making sure this offensive book is brought to the attention of every teacher at my child's school and my local public library to request that it by removed from the shelves.

After those sections, the chapters are broken down by activity which wasn't as helpful. Also, I was shocked that they put exercises to do with your baby; as in holding your baby and rolling him up and down like a barbell! How dangerous is that, at least a first-time parent like me would think so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant! The music touches you and takes you on a transformative ride!","review":"The musicianship and the depth of this cd is very evident as you listen and are taken on a journey through the melodies and the poignant, subtle and flowing lyrics. The music enters your ears, penetrates your soul and opens you up to a world of infinite possibilities, perspectives and adventures. My experience with Citadel's, and more specifically Rejyna's, musical gifts is that once the songs start, you become transfixed and have a strong desire to see where it takes you next...to places in your mind and heart where magic, healing, peace and understanding abound. I would recommend this cd to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"To be blunt: HORRIBLE","review":"Oh my God! I can't believe this piece of **** is even listed here.

These guys outdid Spinal Tap and the sad thing is that they were actually SERIOUS.This group were capable musicians, but this album sounded like a 12 year-old's concept of what progressive rock is supposed to be. This album is loaded with HORRIBLE fantasy lyrics and unbelievably cliche' musical passages.Hopefully this is long out of print and impossible to find these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like Claim Jumper","review":"Claim Jumper restaurants use Helen Grace's Fudge Topping on their Mud Pie dessert. I had this dessert recently and liked the fudge accent so well I decided to buy some. Unfortunately, my experience at home was that the Fudge Topping out of the jar tastes different from the topping at the restaurant, it's far sweeter out of the jar. It also seemed to be of a different consistency. The Fudge Topping out of the jar, even though it started out warm and smooth, froze instantly into unappetizing globs on top of the ice cream. I'm not sure what the explanation is for these differences, although I suspect Claim Jumper somehow tweaks the topping before serving it. At Claim Jumper on top of their Mud Pie, it's fabulous, but at home, out of the jar, this topping was a disappointment. Helen Grace does offer refunds though and their customer service is excellent, and that's why I gave them two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you","review":"I was so mad when my Claim Jumper Mud Pie came with a different hot fudge sauce. This was my favorite thing about it! I remember they used the Helen Grace sauce, so I ordered a small jar to see if this was the same thing.

I will definitely be ordering this in a bigger jar for my family to enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

When the anniversary of the first time you read it comes around, you'll find yourself going to the bookcase, digging it out, and reading it again.

As for my daughter and I we bought a 1958 metal cast model of a 1958 Edsel convertible. Everytime we see it sitting on the shelf that joyful sad feeling sweeps through our hearts again.

I wasn't very interested since I don't like science-fiction. However I read it on a trans-atlantic flight and I was surprised that it made the flight go by in half the time. The reason I liked it was because it wasn't science-fiction at all, rather it gave me an eerie feeling of what can very easily take place in our life time with all the wrong which is going on in the world. I felt the author has a very strong message he is relaying to us about the future of mankind and he does this by weaving a story full of greed, love, wisdom and courage. I could personally relate to most of the characters in the book because they were so real to me. I swear, it seems I kenw several of them personally.

This fellow was a syrupy singer specializing in classic Latin American boleros... Carlos Augusto eschewed the hometown rhythm of the samba in favor of the lush romanticism of the ballroom sound. These Portuguese-language dance tunes seem to have been written mainly by Brazilians, although the style is definitely an import from el mundo espanol. Still, his vocals aren't overly corny, and the early '60s arrangements are also rather tasteful.

It\`s supposed to be a ghost story, eerie, chilling and spine-tingling according to the jacket. I found it to be none of those. It has very little to do with ghosts and more to do with a rather boring love triangle and a man who is learning to deal with the death of his wife. The musical score is pleasant at first, but then becomes monotonous. The photograhy is too dark and what is shown of Ireland doesn\`t really come across. The dark photography and music create a somber mood that is more conducive to going to sleep rather than being eerie. It\`s an Irish film that may have won some awards there, but it didn\`t appeal to this American."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really, really, really, really awful.","review":"This was not a ghost, or a horror story.

That any of these mysteries are part of illusionary compensation for losing someone is beyond belief.

The film (optics) is very dark, using too much contrast for a high quality motion picture. The story is okay, but only has a few places where you might feel some chills from a few ghosts. With all the money that these films make, you would think that we would have hundreds of motion pictures coming out at the Theaters every week, but instead, we have only a few, which means that we don't see a great film too often. In this regard, THE ECLIPSE movie is slow, acting is good, but the story-line is dreary and depressing, the ending is a dud.

I suppose that's the beauty of not knowing what you're getting into. Thankfully, shocking the audience is not what this film is about.The Eclipse is for adults in the sense that adults tend to be more interested in character development and relationship dynamics, both of which are here beautifully realized by committed performances.

So much has been written on the subject of Germany, before, during, and after World War II... I felt relieved but also invited by the apparent simplicity of the text. It betrays the underlying emotions and discoveries, which are poignant and real, and brings the experiences of a different time closer. I was reminded of the temporal, fragile nature of every human constellation, be it family or friends, so it makes sense that I found the book in my stair well... Finally, it was very refreshing to read a nonpolitical, nonmoralizing book on the experiences of a young gay man, focusing on the human traits of emotions, a sense of belonging, and friendship. Especially the description of the fascination with health and the body as a machine at that time should be pertinent for our culture at present."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"Despite the \\"hot\\" cover and interesting historical period involved, this book is actually quite dull and poorly written.

I would like have burned \\"Another Time, Another Place\\" from the King Buscuit cd except Kihn has this long dialogue after the song introducing the next song written by Bruce Springsteen in the same space.

I've been working with Arco and Kaplan's books, which both feature sample tests and some exercises. However, they're inadequate in preparing you for the nature of the real test questions. \\"10 More...Preptests,\\" being actual LSATs, actually do give you a feel for the test's real questions.The only complaint I have is that there is no explanation key but it's a minor complaint, since I have had to look over my answers and figure out for myself why my answers were wrong. Of course, this helps, as it forces you to examine the questions more thoroughly than you normally would.My recommendation is to use this book in conjunction with a study guide (Kaplan has a good one). Study the test-taking techniques and do the exercises in the study guide, THEN test your skills with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great study aid!","review":"Great practice set for a more comprehensive study of the LSAT.

Good exercises.","review":"I've seen worse. And I'm actually reading it instead of simply tossing it in the trash. But that's the best I can say. The book is rife with typos, never a good sign in a computer book. There are factual mistakes as well, though usually these are obvious. It's actually two separate books by two different authors: one on Java and the other on the Visual J++ environment. The latter, irritatingly, is really about VJ++ 1.0, not the environment specified in the book's title. I found the exercises useful in learning Java. Answers are provided--just not always to the exercises as stated! In particular, I spent a lot of time trying to get a wait()/notify() exercise to work, only to find that the author apparently couldn't either. In that same exercise, the author candidly admits that he \\"dunno\\" why one part of his code is necessary. Bottom line: Don't buy this book. There must be better ones out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent performances","review":"Robert Merrill has for too long been written off as a bad actor with a good voice. What he really was was a bad actor with an EXCEPTIONALLY good voice, and these arias and songs prove it. And not only do these selections show off his wonderful, rich baritone, they also include some great songs and arias which aren't usually recorded. In particular, the \\"Invictus\\" of Bruno Huhn, the Toreador Song from Carmen, and the three spirituals are all either unknown or under-recorded, and all receive their due on this album. And, of course, Merrill's signature aria, \\"Largo al factotum,\\" is wonderful. The only problem I have is with the sound quality of the album, but even that isn't as bad as it could be, and becomes less noticeable after listening to a couple tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining read","review":"This was an anthology which I found quite entertaining. It centers around the theme of alien companions. I found the vast majority of the stories to focus around the theme of \\"Lonely Earth child finds strange animal, bonds with him like regular children never did, leaves him with him as a better person. While this may sound like a repettitive formula, the creative subject matter manages to keep it entertaining. While it's not up to the par of other anthologies (Gallery of Horror, Mammoth book of Fantasy) it's still an enjoyable time killer."},{"rating":"2","title":"ENJOYABLE ROMP THROUGH SPACE","review":"Lots of good stories, many with a twist.

With each song radiating into the next. Personal favorites are 'Another Devil Dies' 'Four Leaf Clover' and 'Summertime in Wintertime'. Although not as spontaneous or sporatic as his earlier works, it pays off with a more disciplined and stronger structured songs. His melodies and riffs are beautiful and soothing. The lyrics are moving and conveigh the emotion of friendship, loyalty, and the interworkings of humans beings with one another.

I discovered him, probably like many, through the film 'About a Boy',and was drawn in by his simple and yet effective melodies. I have been yearning for some mellow, guitar, songwriter kind of music recently, and this is far beyond that!This album is wonderful. He has an amazing ability to write beautiful and melodic songs, many with just a string section, some great chords and a guitar. And yet there are also some epic songs on here, as mentioned before, 'Holy Grail' has a childrens choir and the song somehow works really well with all the funky experimental stuff going on.This album is perfect for sitting and chilling to. I like to study to it alot! It has catchy upbeat tunes to keep you motivated, and yet it isn't at all distracting.At least take a listen to 'One Plus One Is One' , 'This is That New Song' and 'Year of The Rat' to give you a feel for this album, and enjoy!5 out of 5 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One plus one doesn't equal one","review":"Very disappointed in this release after Mr. Gough's other work.

I'll be listening to the tracks on his next album before I buy it... A couple of tracks on this album are decent, but certainly not the quality of his other work.

I love to imagine that folk-music in Europe several hundred years ago sounded somewhat like her. I highly recommend all her music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying add-on, cannot load onto ipod","review":"Okay, this is not a review of the music, since there are plenty of those here already. What I have a problem with is in the manufacturing process. Like another reviewer noted, this CD does not play well on my pc. Odd, for a digital format...Secondly, when I do open it on my pc I get an annoying macromedia flash window of self promotion.Thirdly, and my biggest complaint, is that I cannot load this onto my ipod. I'm sure there is a workaround, but I'm not proficient enough on a computer to know what it is.I understand that artists need to protect their works against piracy and illegal filesharing, but if I spend my money on a product with an already inflated price I should be able to listen to it the way I want. It is no wonder then that consumers get frustrated with the recording industry and their zillions in profits and turn to other means for getting their music.Just my two cents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Beautiful","review":"While I'll always have a special place in my heart for \\"The Visit\\", I've never considered myself to be a huge Loreena McKennitt fan.

Definitely worth the price -- especially since the money you pay will be going to charity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"This CD is truly amazing!

Many of the songs sound different onstage, as McKennitt is removed from all the electronica and remixing that helps make her music so good, and some of them are worse for the removal--\\"All Soul's Night,\\" for example.But the whole of the CD is excellent, and some of the songs are even better in this live recording than on the original CDs! Of particular quality is \\"Santiago,\\" which has an energy, spontinaety, and pace the original recording pales in comparrison to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing and beautiful!","review":"Once again McKennitt has done it!

Having a male protagonist is not that only deviation from tradition Levine makes in this little book. The \\"bad\\" characters are dim and ignorant more than they are evil and malicious. The \\"good\\" characters, for the most part, demonstrate some of the more elevated human traits (patience, intelligence, wit, and optimism.) Moreover, Levine neatly dodges becoming distractingly \\"polically correct.\\" The writing is excellent - simple yet descriptive. Levine uses humor to temper the \\"moral of the story\\" and creates a well-rounded tale while leaving enough room for the imagination to take over. If you want, for yourself or for your children, the magic of fairy tales without the out-of-date stereotypes, Levine's Princess Tales series is an excellent place to start. I also HIGHLY recommend anything by Robin McKinley."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Fantasy","review":"Cinderellis and the Glass Hill by Gail Carson Levine is a great book to read. This book is about a guy named Ellis who sleeps in a shed, and one night he captured three horses, and uses them in a contest. The contest took place in an enchanted field. He had to climb a glass hill on his horse, and the first one to make it up there, gets to marry the princess. The author, Gail Carson Levine, has many styles. She writes long and short sentences, and touches you imagination. I think everyone should read this book. I gave this book five stars because it is a great book that touches your imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite of Four!","review":"This fourth book of the princess tales is one of Gail Carson Levine's best!

The plot and characters are dumb, and yes, even stupid at times, and altogether, extremely dull. As I look back now, it's a wonder I decided to finish the book. The characters are more or less believable, most of the time, anyway. The parts about the potions are so impossibly impossible, I can barely describe it. I have read others in this series, and they, too, have been very disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The first honest review","review":"Well,there is humor in it,overall. Gail Carson Levine does put wit into her stories, but something fell apart in this book. Chapter eight is a perfect example of where an entertaining story went bad. At first, we look through Marigold's point of view, then we look through Cinderellis's. After that, the chapter is just confusing. It goes back and forth between both of their minds that I don't know whose I am in. I think Miss Levine could have done a better job in writing this story.

Of these, my favorite has always been \\"Summer Story\\". The plot is not particularly complex. In it, two little mice (Dusty Dogwood and Poppy Eyebright) have become engaged and they prepare for their summer wedding. Similar in many ways to Beatrix Potter's books, the Brambly Hedge series is published small, for small readers. Kids will enjoy the pleasant story while taking particular interest in some of Barklem's more impressive drawings. Her elaborate Rube Goldbergesque illustrations of the Dairy Stump and Mill are delightful. There is an attention to detail in these books that does not go unnoticed. For those kids who are, as of yet, too young to enjoy Brian Jacques \\"Redwall\\" books, the Brambly Hedge series may be right up their alley."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is not what I thought I was ordering","review":"Pay attention to the white print on the bottom right of the label \\"Performed by the Musical Stage Company\\".I thought I was getting a soundtrack from an actual performance, this is a poor re-creation of a wonderful show.

Although the plot is exciting and gripping on its own, we also find ourselves reading the story for the wonderful characters and the funny, insightful things they say and do. Jake and Ellie's friendship seems very real, and the characters in Eastport, Maine, are all people you want to know. Even when she's writing about creepy characters, she gives them depth. (I wouldn't be surprised if Graves does for Eastport what the TV show \\"Northern Exposure\\" did for Alaska.)

To merely state that \\"An eternal, uncreated designer does not have a beginning or a creator\\" does not provide resolution but at best merely conjectures the existence of at least one eternal, uncreated designer.

Don't go by the horrible and inaccurate color samples that are supposed to represent the shades. The Plum Wicked is a wonderful blackberry shade that can be worn light, for a soft plum rose shade, or applied more heavily for a romantic, goth look. Blood Orange is pure MAGIC ... warm sweet coral if you use just a bit, or apply two or three coats for a deeper, more dramatic persimmon shade that's gorgeous and wild. And I've never ever rolled it right onto my lips -- I use a lip brush to pick up the color from the rollerball and apply it for an even coat. Use it over a wee bit of buttery lip balm (not over a waxy one!). It takes instants to dry, so you can apply another coat or more within a minute or so. These lip stains last very nicely indeed.

Because the rollerball is so large, it is very difficult to get a precise application of color. Also, once you start applying it, the liquid remains wet (not moist, but really WET) for about 10 seconds and if you go over the wet spots, the rollerball just wants to slide over them. What I ended up doing was applying big stripes of color and then using my finger to smooth the wet color into the corners of my mouth and the peaks of my upper lip. Then I pressed my lips together to make sure there were no \\"blotches.\\" This is too labor-intensive for me so I won't be buying it again.The Plum Wicked color is very nice, more of a berry shade than a true plum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"Maybe because I am olive coloring that this did not work for me.

If you're looking for Hollywood production values, look elsewhere cuz' this flick ain't for you. If you have an open mind, you may find a lot to admire about this flick.

A student of Auer at the same time as Heifetz, Spiedel failed to reach similar heights, partly due to a cranky personality and lack of discipline, though probably not lack of commensurate talent. He wound up in Hollywood. You will have heard him without knowing it in lush solos from movies of the Golden Age as principal violin at MGM. He also was a respected teacher in the LA scene (among his students being Michael Steinhart of Guarnieri Quartet fame). This disc is a pleasant one. The Brahms sonatas are well-done. The playing is somewhat old fashioned...more slides than we are used to today, and not as edited. But the golden tone is very much present. The sound quality is surprisingly good for 78 transfers.

And the End of Time(Pt 1 and 2)... with the return of the Master, the Doctor must choose. In perfect symmetry of the 10th Doctor's character, he must give up everything for the sake of goodness. Good God Doctor, my heart bleeds for you! A bit of a tearjerker, this finale will leave Doctor Who fans breathless and stricken."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the new Dr. Who","review":"The David Tennant Specials are the greatest episodes of the new Dr. Who. Each one of them is a great story in itself. But the Waters of Mars and then the End of Time brings the David Tennant story lines to a stunning conclusion. The End of Time resolves the clash between the Doctor and the Master from Series Three and really is the climax of David's work with this show. Even if you didn't follow the previous seasons this collection is a good start to dive into Dr. Who.

I don't know if it's a problem where these won't play on just Samsung players, or if this is widespread, but I really wanted these to work. Instead I've had to send back the Blu Ray set and I guess I'll have to settle for DVDs of the Specials instead.

My least favorite was \\"Planet Of The Dead\\". I just couldn't warm to Lady Christina as a companion nor as a character... a smarmy smart@rse I can do without, much the same as Catherine Tate who totally ruined series 4 with her obnoxious Donna Noble character. Tate appears in the final 2-parter here and, although I was put off by her and her annoying grandfather, the delicious eccentricity of John Simm as The Master, the menace of Timothy Dalton as #1 Time Lord and the wonderful David Tennant as The Doctor more than made up for the belligerent squawking of Donna Noble. \\"Waters Of Mars\\" by far the superior story here... but all episodes have their points of interest and there is seldom a dull moment.Lots of extras and commentaries... plus it all looks super on Blu-Ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Few More with David Tennant","review":"If you want to see a little more of the David Tennant Doctor after watching the last of the (new) series four and before passing to the new doctor, these specials are for you.In the Next Doctor, does the Daivd Tennant Doctor get to meet his successor Doctor?

What a relief!Anyway, I have found that the batteries actually last for quite a while., much longer than I had expected based on past reviews that I had read of what to expect. Recently I did buy the $10 plug in accessory so that when we are home the kids can play it without using batteries. So, while I highly recommend the LMAX, I strongly caution anybody who is thinking about buying the recharging system based on my personal experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depends","review":"ONLY by if you know how to play music and are REALLY good at it!!

As soon as I got it, it became my daily wear watch. It's simple enough to be a little casual but the brushed look of the metal also makes it classy enough to wear with a shirt and tie. Very versitile. Haven't had any issues with scratching or anything and I'll forget sometimes and wear this into the gym. I love it, I would buy it again no question."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"My girlfriend bought me this watch for my birthday and it's really quite nice.

I would definitely recommend this watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hubby wears it all the time","review":"It's comfortable and fairly easy to adjust the band..

Then, 20 years ago, I thought I should have a digital watch. Not soon after, I returned to analog but it has taken until now for me to find this Citizen. It is simple, yet handsome. It is basic with just a touch of elegance. I don't think you can find better at any price. It's great to be home.This is an amendment to my former review added 5/7/2012:-------------- I began to have trouble with the stem getting caught on clothing and shutting down the watch. When discovered, I would push in the pin and it would restart after resetting. Then the pin caught and broke off. I had to replace the watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Watch For The Price.","review":"First - their were only 2 small things that keep this from being a 5 star watch. 1, the band occasionally but painfully pulls hair, and 2, the band clasp says made in China. That said, I wanted an understated watch that wasn't flashy but would feel like quality on my wrist and this delivers. I've had it just over 3 weeks and it gained 5 seconds. You can pause the second hand for 5 seconds once a month if you need to be perfect. The watch was lighter than I expected - but for me that was a good thing - the watch case itself is thinner than I expected so if you like a thicker watch, read the measurements carefully - I had to remove 3 links to get a fit on my 7.5 inch wrist. I suspect if you have a large wrist in comparison to mine, this watch will look smallish, even feminine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Watch","review":"I thought that this watch looked good through the pictures, but I am more than happy to see that it looks even better up close. It keeps time very well and the first time charging isn't much of a hassle. It appears that you can charge it with indirect sunlight rather than direct sunlight. That's what I did and, I believe, citizen recommends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eco Drive is NOT a hoax","review":"Unless something has changed over the past thirteen years, which is how long I have had my Citizen, the Eco-Drive is not a hoax. In fact, this has been the most accurate and reliable watch I've ever owned. The only thing that I have had to do over that time is to replace the pins in the titanium band. The gold on the band and face of the watch has even remained, which is no small accomplishment because I almost never take it off.To clarify, I don't have this specific model. I don't remember the name of my model but it has a rotating dial with various cities around the world plus the ability to select those cities in the small digital display. I would absolutely buy my watch again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratches","review":"Watch looks great until you wear it a few days and start to notice the scratches on the band. I work in an office setting and cannot figure out why the band has so many scratches.They are tiny scratches that when all combined makes the watch band look very dull. Gets worse daily. I have only had this watch for a month and wish I had one with a leather band. I do not recommend this watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"good gift","review":"I bought this as an anniversary gift for my husband, it came quickly, in a very nice box, was easy to adjust to his wrist size and seems to keep good time.

Either the plastic material is cheaper than the factory unit and flexes out when the center of the unit becomes tight, or it is molded with a little warp in it. Called the factory to discuss with them the problem and they tried to make me believe it was my doing that caused the unit not to flush up to the tailgate. I gave them an opportunity to replace it but to no avail. They suggested I return it to Amazon for a replacement. Obviously, this would cost me more in postage that the unit is worth. I am determined to put some kind of seal around the unit to make it water tight, but for all those that are considering the purchase, beware that the unit may NOT flush up properly, and if you have a problem of any kind the factory may not stand behind the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"The Bully LH-007 Integrated O.E.

The most cringing moments are when the group deliberately try to provoke an European cafe owner to throw them out. These guys destroy china, cafe furniture, everything and now and then they stare at the camera and say: \\"I can't believe they haven't thrown us out yet!\\" I nearly sank through the floor with that one.

It's amazing how adults, including the guys in this DVD, can still be stuck in a pre-adolescent mind frame. Jackass and other skater/prank-stuntmen and shows all seem to have appeal in the lowest level of entertainment. Acting like an absolute moron for cheap thrills and attention is funny when you're a kid or early teenager but it can't be right for twenty or thirty something to make a career out of it. It is especially wrong when it threatens your life, health and dignity for money.This show influences kids much more to do stupid harmful things then what parents thought heavy metal or rap music used to do.These guys also give a bad name for skateboarding, as if it hasn't been affected enough by hip hop influence and brand clothing styles.The shows might have been slightly amusing when they first came because of the shock and awe but it's gets old fast.It's good that these shows are fading and aren't as popular as they were some years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I ordered","review":"I ordered a RCBS Trim Pro Manual Case Trimmer with a picture and a description of the item.

Although I am crate-training her, I wanted her to have a little more room sometimes when I bring her in from outside but still be able to keep an eye on her. Our house is very open in its layout, so baby gates in the kitchen were impossible. I set the pet pen up in the kitchen using 6 of the 8 panels. The puppy has toys and an extra bed in it. She plays and watches me as I prepare meals, and I know she is safe. I've had no problem with her trying to climb up the sides. I agree that it would be nice to have a floor and/or a top to the pen as optional add-ons. I don't need either, but I think options like that would make this an even better item.

I got it, assembled it and had it all ready for my new pup. Within 30 minutes he was able to get out although I did not see how. Over the course of 2 days he got out many times. The walls have verticle and horozontal bars, not rounded but flat. The horizontal bars that are FLAT act like ladder steps and what my little guy did was to use his back paws and climb. He got to the top and pushed himself over landing on his head. Luckily, I have carpet. The design is terrible and I doubt it was tested with pups. Perhaps if the bars were rounded??? or if the walls were a solid design with holes in them like metal beams but what they designed does not work.Mine is goin gabck tomorrow...."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect enclosure!","review":"Love this for my little yorkie, didn't want to crate her and this makes the perfect little home for her.

The stakes that are supposed to be able to go into the ground are too short! They don't even reach the floor! There is no way to cover the top thus it is easy for a puppy to jump out or climb out! In addition, when using indoors the pen can slide around on carpet. I ended up purchasing a different kennel, pen. I would not recommend this to anyone who has a puppy or dog that is at all active. The idea is a good one however they need to go back to the drawing board and make it possible to have a cover for the top and stakes that do the job they say they will do.

Now she had her own little room which she loves!It is hard to lean over the top to reach in so I open one of the panels to step inside if I need to. I don't want to injure my back!

I kept her in it during the day until she was 9 months old (about 45lbs) and she wasn't able to get out.

So it's not perfect - but it's good.The little door works for our Pug puppy and she seems to like it, however the door latch lock screws have to be done just so as they are short and will fall out if you twist them too much - there's a learning curve for us humans.the whole thing can easily be shifted or configured to fit a given space.

It appears like its his room and will pee/pooped only outside the pen on the wee-wee pads.My new pom pup loves it. So far he doesn't attempt to climb out, and it fits his bed, water, toys and he still has room to lay on the tile floors when it gets too hot. It's easy to put together and best of all it's portable. Only thing I wish it was just 4\\" higher so I know he'd have a harder time to climb out even as he got bigger.

He gets into the corner and climbs right out. It was really easy to set up though and really easy to put away and stores nicely. It stays on the floor and doesn't scoot around when my puppy jumps against the sides.

Though it is not a big area, there is enough room for your dog to play a little, eat and sleep. The pen is easy to assemble and disassemble for storage. It allows you to keep your dog in an area where you can keep an eye on them, even when you are doing chores. It is light and portable and I have found that it doubles as a gate to close off an area of the house you do not want your dog to go into. Finally, you can increase the pen area by buying extra panels as required. Great product for short/term penning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everybody","review":"We purchased the smaller, 4-panel version. This pen is easy to set up, can be expanded, looks attractive and offers more room than the typical crate. The problem is that many dogs can easily escape. Our 12-week old, 5 pound puppy escaped the second night he was placed in the pen by launching himself up using the horizontal supports. It is totally useless to us now. Perhaps if you place a much younger puppy in the crate and he gets used to it before he can climb, this pen could work, but must puppies aren't available for adoption that early. It may also work for older dogs who are content staying where you put them. Since Amazon combines the reviews for the smaller pen and the larger version, many of the positive reviews may be for the larger version, which is about a foot higher and harder to climb out of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Check your parts","review":"Very nice playpen for my two bouncy 6-lb. miniature pinschers. I'm confident they won't be about to jump out of this. It seems pretty sturdy and was easy to assemble.Two reasons I didn't give it 5 stars: (1) The panels are awkwardly tall, making it impossible to step over if I need to go inside the pen to clean. Instead, I have to remove a connecting pin to to separate the panels so I can go in. Not that big a deal, but it's just an extra hassle for those days when I'm in a hurry. And (2) A latch piece for the gate was missing. I'm hoping the manufacturer will make good after I give them a call.Tip for floor protection: I'm using a rubber treadmill mat under it to protect from soils and scratches. The fit is just right for the 8 panel pen."},{"rating":"2","title":"not good for climbers","review":"This is a great little dog play pen.

I love the fact that I can easily take a few of the panels with me for a weekend or day trip and let her have a scaled down version of her area on the go.

I intended to use the pen as an enclosure when I am not home so he would have more room than in a crate but that is not possible.

So, they each have their own means of escaping, and I've had to resort back to a traditional metal kennel, though I really enjoyed using this enclosure as their \\"bedroom\\" for the 4 or 5 months before they figured out the system. I would recommend it to people with smaller dogs who are not jumpers, climbers, or nudgers, as that's how I think he gets the latches open - by ramming his head into the gate until he lifts them out of place with sheer force."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Versatile","review":"I bought this product for our new puppy to have its own area to play safely.

I put him in the pen instead of his crate when I need to do things around the house without him underfoot and he loves it! I also leave the door open during the day and he goes in there by himself for naps. I have recommeded this pen to 2 of my friends with new dogs and they love it as well!

If you have a small dog this would be an excellent product to get.I rated this 4-stars because I just purchased this on Tuesday and today (02 OCT 09) the price went down $10.

And it's extremely portable. My dogs love it so much that when we are home with them we leave the door on it open. They go in and out freely and put themselves to bed by themselves.

We have tried to cover it with different objects and the little bugger is still able to maneuver her way up and out of this particular pen.

I have kept my childrens old plastic playpen, but when we set it up, our little bunny just squeezed through where the panels met. Needless to say, it didn't work. This one is AWESOME b/c we put it on a vinyl mat (that I also purchased when my kids were babies to play on) and I leave the door open, pushing the gate against the bunny barn and leave that door open also. It allows so much room for a little bunny. In the warmer weather, she can stay outside in the pen while my kids swim in the pool or chase each other around. We can also attach it to the Rabbit Run.

While his arrangements are a bit reserved in comparison to most of the normally-boisterous old-school samba, the songs still chug along with plenty of catchy pep, and Silva has a really pleasant voice.

There were some interesting clips, but overall it is terrible. The quality of the tape was awful, the sound was extremely poor, barely audible at times. Much of the video is blurred, and a good part of it is just still pictures, many not even in focus. You do not even have the pleasure of listening to her music in the background, assumedly because it is unauthorized. Selena was a great entertainer and an even better person.

He didn't explain her life very well- there was more to it than just singing. Also, you don't get to hear her sing at all. Just blurry clips. And they spent more time on the messages the fans wrote after her tragic death than anything. The second part just explains about other singers, not Selena. This was very poor and I think they could have done a better job. The movie with Jennifer Lopez explains it all much better.

I could see that on the internet for free! They only good thing (aside from Selena) is that it shows a lot of her house after her death. Otherwise, this video could have been much much better.

While perhaps this might suit beginners or children, I believe too much is left out to be helpful to the serious artist. For example there is almost nothing on musculature. The drawings are quite crude. The author claims that he makes the body mechanics \\"simple and sensible\\". It would be nice if body mechanics were that simple, but unfortunately they are not. In my opinion there are many very good books written for artists on this subject. This doesn't happen to be one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"+ 70 years ago","review":"The book provides insight into a period of regional American history as experienced by the author and his family.

The hopelessness of the people crowded in the cities with nowhere to turn. This book opens a window not thought of by many people who did not live through those desperate years. It is a story of a man, a woman and a child who traveled the back roads of our Nation in search of a way to make ends meet. It is well worth your time to take a look through this window to see their daily struggle and strife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Disposal Cleaner You'll Find","review":"I used to be able to buy these blue Disposal Care packets locally but my grocer stopped carrying them.

First, there are too many mistakes (yes there is a website that corrects some of them, but not even half of the mistakes). Second, after taking the first test from Transcender, I ran into at least five questions who's subjects were not even mentioned in the book, meaning I failed the test just on those points. While I wouldn't expect the book to go into detail on everything, I would expect that all relavent subjects be introduced. Since reading this book, I have noticed that the book on this subject written by \\"Amit Kalani\\" has gotten good reader marks.Good points: I liked the \\"game\\" test at the end. I also liked the labs. And to be fair, nothing in that this book covered was a waste. It just doesn't present everything necessary to prepare for the test which is what I would expect this book to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad study prep","review":"The demo for vs.net was very useful.

(and I did learn the content of the book very well). Next, none of the questions in the book were anything like what the questions were like on the test.

Jeff repeats the following code so many times that it becomes annoying:Visual Basic.NETImports System...Visual C#using System...* Jeff repeats the same code even when it is identical in VB.NET and C#. Excellent way to have many pages - who cares whats in.* Jeff lacks rigour in every respect.

When I bought this DVD, I was excited to see them Live since I never seen them live. I was rather disappointed with the really awful sound quality and the front man vocal sounded like he needed to loosen up his vocal cords, but after a while, the sound got just a tad better but still, not fun to listen to at all. It was a boring concert with not many camera angles. There was many songs that I love that wasn't performed, but they did several songs I love, and others, I don't even know why they bother with some songs that isn't so great. I watched this DVD the first half of it and then later, watched the second half and that was it. I was finish with it. Being one of my favorite band, I was disappointed with this DVD.

Rest in peace, Peter.This DVD is good for an avid fan, but I must warn you that it is not just a straight-up live concert. Unfortunately, (for me anyway) it is laden with a bunch of goof-offery that is often crude and mostly stupid. I don't feel it really adds anything and was several lengthy scenes of useless content and wasted space.Now it's not ALL \\"negative\\"... the live performances are quite good and reflective of times I've seen them live in the past.

As the boy learned, if you are gentle and kind to cats, you will be rewarded with the affection of very loving creatures. My cat is just like that. Mark Graham's beautiful paintings illustrate the wonderful qualities of cats: they are mysterious, beautiful, serene, cozy, and very affectionate.

We get the statement that \\"The Buckleys are an upstanding, upper-middle-class family. The idea that anyone who knows them would rape a woman in a coma is ludicrous.\\" The nice boyfriend couldn't possibly be suspect because \\"Todd was one of the two or three top students in the class. He was bright. He was eager to learn. And he was a gentleman.\\" Furthermore, \\"the young man was a third-year law student at the University of Chicago, and he was from a good family\\" so he obviously couldn't be a rapist. Sure enough, the rapist ends up being the only person of color in the book (Cuban). The only reason I read this book to the end was because I'm compulsive that way and have to finish a book once I've started it! But I'm so glad I only borrowed a copy from someone else, and didn't actually pay for this appalling book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"I purchased this book as a high school independant reading project.

Very stylish, and just enough weight to pack a perfect brew...so much better than the cheap plastic one that came with my espresso machine.

Now as an adult, I was very nostalgically excited to see this film come about. But 10 minutes into the film I was ready to turn it off, only continued watching because of my youthful obsession. Boring and boorish. Steward Copeland doesn't come across well, his narration making me wince on multiple occasions. I'd skip this one, even if you are a die-hard fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging storytelling, priceless archive footage","review":"If you ever heard Stewart Copeland speaking in public (take podcast of 2004 O'Reily Conference for example) you already know that listening to the man is quite entertainig experience. Mr. Copeland is great storyteller with a sense of humour and it shows in the film. One other thing is that this movie is not your ordinary \\"Behind the Music\\" documentatry, but real-deal archive footage, straight from the center of events. C'mon, where else does a music fan get this kind of stuff? And lastly, Stewart's production chops are good - great editing, directing and scoring, all done by the man himself.

Mildly interesting clips on the personnality of the three usual suspects, hints at the process that had them drifting apart, but never a thorough insight or commentary. The Police has been dead for 20 years, their latest tour is a sad testimony to it, and this DVD does not add much to the storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"The life of the Police on the road through the eyes of the Drummer.

No content, save for Stuart Copeland's boorish, un-funny commentary.

It started with the want to succeed, the fear of someone discovering his lies, the denial of doing something wrong and then the embarrassment when everyone knows what he did. I for one respect him as a person even though I don't agree with his actions from the past. All he wanted to do was succeed, wasn't it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lies and more Lies?","review":"How can you beleive anything he says!! Dont waste your time on this book. Its .............ahhh it dosent matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't know what I was buying or I would have put it back!","review":"I admit I didn't know a lot about Stephen Glass before this terrible book , so I bought it quickly without reading the back. If I'd know what kind of person this was I would not have even looked at it. Also, even if this were a work of total fiction, I still would not have liked it, I would hate the main character and not care what happened to him. Even as a story it sucked. After reading the first half, I returned it and I have never returned a book in my life. Sorry, Mr. Glass, you're not making a dime off of me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has anyone noticed?","review":"Does anyone else have a sneaking suspicion that all of the 5-star reviews for this book were penned by Mr. Glass himself? It's interesting to note that in almost all cases, this book recieved either 1-star or 5-stars (with the vast majority being 1-star reviews). If you dig into the reviewers who gave it 5-stars, 9 times out of 10 this is the only book they have ever reviewed. It's also curious that the first four reviews were all written on the same day -- May 12, 2003 -- and all gave the book 5-stars.It seems that Mr. Glass still hasn't kicked that nasty habit of fabricating stories, or in this case, reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible First Novel","review":"Set aside for a moment who Steve Glass is and consider the book solely as a novel - not as an act of contrition. What do you have? A poorly plotted and poorly written novel that has one real character - \\"Glass\\" - and dozens of poorly characterized other people who pass through the book in order to serve some purpose in relation to \\"Glass.\\" So we have the suffocating parents who are supposed to show that Glass still can be loved. The ex-gf, who is supposed to show disloyalty. Cliff the reporter, who is supposed to demonstrate the vicious side of reporters. And assorted minor characters who are supposed to demonstrate the \\"Glass,\\" despite his wrongs, is still superior to everyone else.Glass can carry on an interesting story for 15 pages in Harper's, but he's unable to do it for more than 50, let alone the 350 that make up this disappointing first book. Let's hope there's not another.This book is a waste of [money]. Do not buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even Renting It Is a Waste of Time; DO NOT BUY","review":"Kudos to the reviewer below me: it seems that these five-star reviews match the writing style of the author himself, right down to the typos and misspellings. Anyway: \\"The Fabulist\\" is predictable, cliched, and worse yet, boring. The (fictional) story of Glass' autobiography reads hollow and fake (pun intended). Seriously, you're better off watching the \\"Shattered Glass\\" movie to really know the life of a fabulist. Now THAT film did a better job at portraying Glass' actions than Glass himself could in his debut book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it a ZERO if i could","review":"how shameful to buy a book from a lying jerk...when will the world quit rewarding people who do not deserve the financial returns?!do not buy this book, see the movie, or support jerks like this in any way"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Class Glass","review":"As far as I'm concerned, Stephen Glass should never be given one ounce of praise or accomodation for spinning his tales and lies, all that were published to the public record.He is no journalist, let alone a writer or a human being."},{"rating":"2","title":"TRUTHFULLY...a good book.","review":"Yes, Stephen Glass did some shameful things. That, however, does not change the fact that his writing style is very good. The book was certainly interesting; a good look into the mind of someone who seriously had a problem with lying. Everyone does it...this guy just got caught; but at least he's not condoning what he did. Many people write stories based on their lives and don't get blasted for doing so; why should Glass be any different? This book should be taken for what it is...a decent story written by someone who knows how to write."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just say no.","review":"Your integrity is at stake. There's no story here unless you like reading the life and times of a pathetic impotent man that let his affliction beat the system. And then he wants you, the reader, to understand 'his side'. No brainier - just say no."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain dreadful","review":"The main character, who cunningly has the same name as the author, never really develops as a character. There are no changes or lessons learned. All of the characters are largely cardboard and unsympathetic. If you really have a burning desire to read it, try the library.If you want to read Mr. Glass's better fiction, just pick up his articles from New Republic. They are much more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scam","review":"What? This is a novel a publisher bought and paid for and distributed and is a novel some people have taken seriously? Get out of town. The narrator is a sniviling weasel who is misjudged and whose feelings are hurt by girls as a boy. He is self-absorbed and, to all appearances ( like Jake's comment about Robert in The Sun Also Rises )a case of continuing adolescence. At least Robert could box. This guy Stephen Glass ought to be barred from publishing for ten years as are Wall Street felons. This novel is just another scam and its publishers ought to be ashamed of themselves. Don't read this book, you'll only get depressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hallucination of Evil","review":"There is only one way this badly concocted, nauseous vat of ego-expanding psychotic blather got a rating above zero on any book review site. The author and/or his friends and family are doing all of the voting. You have a choice when considering whether to buy, borrow, or accidentally read this book. Should you spend a few hours getting yourself convinced that Stephen Glass is a dangerous psychotic serial liar, void of both talent and remorse, or should you go to the dentist and get a voluntary root canal? Option two is less painful than the first choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie, the book & reality","review":"I recently watched the movie Shattered Glass so I picked up the book to read. I tried to get through it but what prevented me from finishing were my thoughts about the people who he worked with during those years. I thought about how they must have felt when it was disclosed the articles were lies. I wondered how the hard working people at the magazine felt after they had to deal with the aftermath. A better book would have been to write it from their point of view and I think the author perhaps would understand the true damage of his actions.In the end, the only victims are those co-workers and the reputation of the magazine. I hope all who were there have been able to move forward and continue to have wonderful careers.I'm glad I caught the movie. I just couldn't get through this without questioning my own motives in even reading such a book after realizing how many good people got roped in this sad affair."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book belongs in the recycling bin","review":"This book is trash - pure and simple. On top of being a liar and a fraud, the author is also a bad storyteller. Furthermore, it bothers me that the author would try to profit off of his monumental lapse in judgment and integrity. My advice - do not waste your money on this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Courage and Shame","review":"Glass is most courageous in not committing suicide. In this world doing so is selfish and only hurts others. In another world it is the only honorable thing to do. He is to be commended for facing the world in spite of his ignominy.But the real shame is that Simon and Schuster would shatter its credibility by publishing such trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fabulist","review":"Is it too late to get a refund? Saw the movie so thought the book would be interesting. What a mistake! I'm an avid reader but half way through I wanted to throw the book away it was that bad! Too much self pity; every chapter more of the same. I lumbered through to the end wishing I had never wasted my time. It is now in the Goodwill bag. Probably should put a warning on this one: Buyer beware!! Don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"shattered expectations","review":"I had high hopes for this novel, assuming that this true life fabulist would really be able to spin a good yarn. Unfortunately, the novel spins out of control and ends up being a series of vignettes, strung together by a loose structure. I must admit, there were anecdotes that made me laugh out loud (the airplane scene), but ultimately I did not care about this character's journey or relationships or future. Perhaps when this author has a little more life experience I will give him another try, but The Fabulist is ultimately a narcissistic apology for a journalism no-no."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steal this book. Then burn it.","review":"I borrowed this book from my local library because I wanted to read it before I saw the film Shattered Glass. I couldn't help but notice this irony: Glass is much better at presenting fiction as the truth than the truth as fiction. What can you say about someone who wrote such compelling articles for The New Republic, which were totally fabricated, and then writes this incredibly boring so called \\"novel\\". Don't refuse to buy this book for all the overwhelming moral reasons. Refuse to buy it beacause it is a poorly written piece of junk. Take the money that you save and go see Shattered Glass. It's the best movie about journalism since All the President's Men. Anyone who gives this claptrap a positive review is related to the author. It could even be Glass himself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time but watch the DVD","review":"Don't waste your time with this trash but watch the \\"Shattered Glass\\" DVD if you're interested in this story. \\"Shattered Glass\\" did an excellent job of telling the Stephen Glass story. You will not feel the least bit sorry for Stephen, a pathological liar and master manipulator who couldn't seem to care less about the lives he effected. Let's not reward Stephen's lack of a conscience by buying this dribble. Besides, he had written enough fiction before his first novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eeew.","review":"Nobody's said anything yet about the repulsively twee, incomparably false sex-and-romance scenes, which are surely among the worst ever to be set into type. I surmise that Glass thinks he's showing his hot-blooded hetero side, but the lovey-dovey bits could have been written by a virgin girl of 14 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 stars?","review":"Having read this book and observed Amazon custiomers' 5-star reviews one must wonder if Stephen Glass has visited this website."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this tripe","review":"...Trite characterizations, weak plotline, and lackluster writing make for a very, very poor read. If this editorial conman were a talented writer I'd give him a break but I finished this piece of [work] wondering why in God's name a reputable publisher would issue something as weakly written and conceived as this.It might have made a decent magazine article but then one is reminded that no reputable magazine would ever buy anything from this disgraced ex-journalist. Thinking of buying this book? Take a tip from those magazine editors---Just say NO."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fabul-OUS read","review":"If you liked the movie Shattered Glass, you will love this book. It gives the other side to the moive, which made the editor the more sympathetic character. While this book does not make Glass the sympathetic character, it gives him more depth. The book gives the reader some insight into his world. For instance, in the first chapter of the book, Glass describes how he dumps his girlfriend's cosmetic bag to find blush and lipstick, which he applies to his face to get into character as he types his fictionalized interview into \\"notes.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"shameful sequel","review":"This is by far THE worst movie of the 1990's, if not ever. Also known as BOOGEYMAN 3, it's literally 1 hour of recycled footage from the original BOOGEYMAN (minus the actors dialogue - which instead has new actors speaking over the scene and describing what's happening) and has only 17 minutes (! ) of new footage. In those few scenes, some bimbo is with her psychiatrist in a trance claiming to be psychically linking with Lacey from the original at the SAME TIME Part one is taking place (odd, then, the obvious new footage is taking place in the early 1990's, while the same time events are clearly early 1980's). Bland, stupid and even more insulting than the similar BOOGEYMAN 2, which at least had 30 minutes of new footage, this is one of the biggest ripoffs and has continued to destroy what could've been a very lucrative and inventive franchise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humor with a Point","review":"This is a wonderful collection of short essays, each filled with laugh-out-loud moments and points of reflection. It's great for reading in short bursts (train, bedtime, etc.) and for discussion groups. The author's engaging style draws you in. You sense her dread at returning to confession after a long absence, and chuckle at her Lenten fasting strategies. There are humorous and thought-provoking insights for all - young and old. Non-Catholics will find insights to an ordinary Catholic's views on confession, suffering, stewardship and priesthood. It's a thoroughly enjoyable book for all audiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"more of the same","review":"I like these stories, but really, they are mostly thin variations on the same theme so far. family from \\"our\\" timeline, or close enough, visits low-tech timeline, gets in trouble, silly love story on the side, LOTS of repetition. So much repetition it feels like something from an oral tradition, or written for people with memory loss. Way too little exploration of the new alternate worlds. It's a short story padded to novel length, really. I buy these when I'm looking for a book, it's late, and the Kindle one-click is right there ... it's a guilty pleasure like a giant bag of potato chips. If you still want to buy this book, welcome to the club.

If you are a fan of stargete just like I am, you don't need to think it twice about take it into your collection.The only reason that I didn't give it a 5 star ratting is that the manu of the first season dvds was poorly designed and difficult to use on my dvd player.

Here the soldiers and men of the Shutz Staffel are allowed to speak for themselves, for the first time, through their photographs. The ferocity of combat, the ecstasy of victory, the exhaustion of defeat and the strain of life on the Eastern Front where the SS was outnumbered by Soviet soldiers 6 to 1, are all captured here in candid, gritty, emotional photographs taken from veterans personal collections.This book has been criticized for its supposed \\"self-congratulatory\\" introductory text by former SS leader Paul Hausser. However, I didn't find \\"When All Our Brothers Are Silent\\" any more self-serving or defiant than the Allied perspectives of the war that I've read.\\"When All Our Brothers Are Silent\\" is highly recommended, especially considering that the text does not engage in the generalized bias and character assassination so often associated with works on the SS.-Bryn"},{"rating":"2","title":"Side Pouch","review":"Ok!

Like the others before me said, a lot of self-congratulations by the author on what a wonderful human being he is and how he just can't relate any more to the rest of us non-backpacking travelers. I love how he talks about how poor the rest of the world is, yet his brother and he haggle over every service. Don't waste your time reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"down-to-earth, warm, inspiring","review":"I was shopping around for something to read on the plane for a business trip I was taking and have already decided on one particular book when this one caught my eye.

Its true that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts, because 'Honeymoon with my Brother' combines travel advice, romance, drama, familial relationships, cultural observations, and a great sense of humor to end up with a superb read unlike many other multi-genre attempts. As an international gypsy throughout my childhood, Wisner's astute commentaries on various cultural characteristics in each country had me laughing out loud, nodding my head in agreement and feeling homesick... Trust me, reading this book will make you want to take a trip, immediately, and you'll never trust a standard guide book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The more I read, the more I liked Annie.","review":"If you like books written by self-absorbed whiners, then this is the book for you. I had heard an interview with the author on a local radio show and thought it might be an interesting book. He certainly has the gift of gab, but is definitely not a writer. After the first few chapters, I realized that the book was more about the author, his \\"career\\", and his distorted views of love and friendship than an interesting yarn about his travels. It's a shame that he would resort to writing an entire book to dump on someone who obviously made the right choice in not marrying him, and cash in on it as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needed an editor","review":"While well intentioned, the writer really needed a good editor: the prose should have been pared down and spiffed up, the repetition should have been eliminated, and the book's front section could have been cut WAY back. The travel part doesn't start until one-third of the way through the book, and by then I was ready to toss the book against the wall. Much less about the writer, his brother, and their not-so-compelling personal problems and more about the people, culture, and sites of the place he visited would have made this a much better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad writing, shame.","review":"I was really excited about this book Right up my alley.

This was not one of them. The title \\"Honeymoon with My Brother\\" is absolutely fabulous, but it only goes downhill once you actually open the cover. The author has a clear sense of entitlement and absolutely gleams with his own self-importance. This is not an adventure. This is a poorly cobbled recount of the author's accomplishments under the guise of modesty. He claims to be throwing away a corporate lifestyle, yet it's clear he never, not even once, actually escapes from the shadow of his \\"former\\" corporate life. The present (i.e., the travels in the book) is continually overshadowed by his previous achievements in the workplace."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT one of 30 Books Everyone Should Read Before They're Thirty","review":"A list of \\"30 Books Everyone Should Read Before They're Thirty\\" has been going around with this book added to the end as a \\"Bonus\\".Don't fall for it--it's a very clever marketing device.

Bad move ! It took half the book for the author to quit whining about Annie and get on the road. Then all he seemed interested in was women and sex. The destinations were not brought to life. If he had spent half the time describing places that he put into describing women, it could have been a decent book. I never expected, from the concept of this book, that he would be such an incessant whiner about Annie, Annie, Annie. In my opinion, Annie made a very intelligent choice when she decided not to go through with the wedding. Don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Title: Bad Book","review":"Not witty enough to be funny. Not deep enough to be heartfelt. Not written well enough to have been published. I got a great idea why his fiance dumped him and why his boss demoted him, but I have no idea why any editor gave the 'thumbs up' to this mess.

When a one-nighter turns into a four-dayer in eastern Europe, he literally runs away to avoid teaching his desperate lover her 21st word of English -- goodbye. When he finally encounters his ex again by chance in California, he makes a point of hugging her tightly just so he can assure us that she has had a boob job. What won't Franz do for a sellable story?

Franz draws the line at sex with a prostitute.

So did the summary of the book. The book, however, was a disappointment. The author and his brother sounded like they had quite an adventure traveling the world, but was unable to capture it in the book. The book was emotionless and lacked any interesting details about the travels. In the beginning, the author had a chance to make the reader sympathetic about his woes with his fiancee dumping him at the last minute and his demotion from his well-paid job. Yet, I couldn't be convinced of this as it was written almost like an article - the details were there, but with no emotions attached to it. Furthermore, his adventures were written haphazardly, almost as if he was too lazy to read through his notes (if he took any) on his travels and was just writing by memory. I couldn't picture any of the places he traveled to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honeymoon With My Brother","review":"Shallow. Simple. No nuggets of wisdom here. No insight into the places or the people he meets. I kept hoping he could evolve from his young Republican sell-out, Christian want-to-be mentality. I gave up at 2/3 into the book. This would have made a better blog for his family and friends. Bill Bryson, this guy is NOT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Trip","review":"This book caught my eye in the bookstore with the big armchairs, which was lucky because I couldn't put it down. I had to buy it to find out what happened to this guy who was left at the altar. I was intrigued by the demise of his seemingly perfect relationship and by the way that cataclysmic event brought on both a literal journey of self-discovery and a renewal of a withered sibling relationship. The brothers' unusual ports of call in Eastern Europe were a refreshing change from the typical travel diary. I was impressed by the author's willingness to take his life (and his brother) in a completely different direction and accept whatever came of it. It is good to see that people can reinvent themselves at any time of life, no matter how many of the trappings of career and relationship thet seem to have taken on. Well done Franz. Where to next?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed review for mixed up story","review":"In my opinion, the interesting parts of this story were the travels themselves and the relationship between the brothers. The dull parts were when Franz would indulge himself, his escapades and \\"his\\" Annie. Hopefully, the story worked as therapy for him as much as he feels the travel did. I am guessing that a story written from Kurt's perspective would be more exciting. I did finish the book, though felt it dragged on, and have to admit I'd see the movie...for more insight on Kurt."},{"rating":"2","title":"quick and simple","review":"I found the item that I needed and the ordering was quick and simple.

I originally picked up this book as a birthday gift for her. It was sitting on my table unwrapped on a weekend that I had planned to lay low. I walked by it a few times and then, picked it up and began reading it. Having recently been dumped myself, I immediately got drawn into the story...at first it was because it's written in an unmistakably male voice and I felt kind of curious. So I guess it wasn't just the intrique of travel that held my attention and made me thoroughly LOVE this book, but it's well rounded, full life perspective. Franz's healing process, relationships, both old and new, are as much a part of the journey, as the travel itself. This memoir is sad, hilarious,intelligent,sexy,and definitely a great read. Franz's background in politics added an additional point of interest. Hey Amazon, this is not a \\"childs review\\" check your problem.

I can't wait to hike up to Machu Picchu and roam the ruins at Ankor Wat.

Wisner brings the world to us through the people they meet and it will leave you feeling the people of the world are much more similar than different and that we in the US are very blessed indeed.

The story potential is fantastic, but the writing just wasn't enough to hold my interest. The whole thing struck me as really superficial. It's more a recitation of this happened and then this happened and we did this and we did that. If he'd had a real writer write the book with him it could have been great.

I'm glad I only borrowed it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"I was misled by the book jacket into believing this was a funny story about a couple of home boys who go off around the world together to forget their woman troubles. Which, quite frankly, could have been a fantastically entertaining book.Instead, this was a lugubrious portrait of an unapologetic political lobbyist and his sad breakup with Annie. The whole idea of feeling sorry for a political lobbyist, in this decade of dashed dreams and political malfeasance, is hard to swallow. How much do we really want to read about his $500 dinners with state legislators to win business for his employer?In William Least Heat-Moon's beautiful book \\"Blue Highways,\\" it takes him about two perfectly-honed paragraphs to explain how his marriage and career had come to an end, and why his reaction was, in essence, to flee.

On the other hand, the author writes with the moral depth and talent of a smartish highschooler, not like an educated or particularly creative or imaginative grown-up.

Interesting for most of it a few slow spots but overall exciting, from the hairraising horseride to the world's worst cab driver.I'm doing a similar thing myself, traveling around the US I quit my job last june and I'm still on the road, so I identified a lot with his story though his travels were mostly international.At first he comes off as a little snobby especially in the section about hanging out with the backpackers in the islands, but I think he grows throught the time the story covers and in the end he seems very open minded and willing to stay the night anywhere just for the experience. I would have liked more detail about how he shopped his stories and got a publisher for his book etc., hopefully he'll talk about that in the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing at best","review":"This book has shown me that I have commitment issues.

I am familiar with a variety of brands of wasabi peanuts and like all of them--except this one. And now I'm stuck with 9 pounds of bitter-tasting nuts. What a mistake.I have liked all the Diamond nut products I have tried in the past and am very surprised to find that this one must have been taste-tested by people with taste buds very different from my own. Even my husband--who is wonderfully easy to please--doesn't like these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely terrible","review":"I love good wasabi peanuts. This ain't them.The biggest problem with Emerald's take is that the medium used for the wasabi coverage is soy sauce and not a very decent one. The overall flavor is extremely unpleasant: sour, bitter - but NOT the wasabi flavor they SHOULD have. The nuts don't have much characteristic wasabi 'tang' to them - they're very pallid in that regard. But far more important: that bitter soy sauce flavor overrides everything; instead of the purity of peanut and wasabi, there's a muddled yet very unpleasant tang of flavors which do not mesh well at all. Do yourself a favor and pass on Emerald. I wish I had...the (remaining) unopened bags sit in their shipping box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need a little hotter wasabi.","review":"I love wasabi dried peas. Unfortunately, my last experience with them led to a fractured molar and a root canal because they are so hard. I thought these might be the perfect exchange.

If you are expecting that eye-watering wasabi experience don't buy them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but hard to find in the stores...","review":"I used to buy these at Safeway but they stopped carrying the Wasabi flavor. They still have the barbecue flavor, which is awesome. The problem is that peanuts are just so fattening that I can't keep them around the house.The Wasabi flavor is good, it's just not as good as the barbecue or chipotle flavor. But in my case, that's good because I don't eat them as fast. I can make a bag of these last a week, whereas I'll scarf down a whole bag of the barbecue flavored peanuts in one day, and blow my diet.I think the heat level is enough, but then I'm not into spicy foods too much. I suppose if you like the wasabi peas they sell at the Asian markets, then this product wouldn't be hot enough for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"yucky bitter peanuts","review":"I bought some wasabi peanuts last summer at an arts festival.

Lynn Harris, Eric Jerome Dickey etc.) no one is putting out literature. When I speak of literature, I am referring to a work of art, where the story, the language, punctuation and even typesetting blend together to entrance the reader.Don't get it twisted, Jenoyne Adams' story IS COMPLETELY JUICY, however she is an amazing writer who invites you into the heart of all of her characters. If you like the soap operatic story lines of the authors listed above, you will not be disappointed. However, if you truly appreciate the beauty of the writing of Toni Morrison, Tina McElroy Ansa or the emotional simplicity of a Sonia Sanchez haiku......this book is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic First Book","review":"Resurrecting Mingus is the best novel I've read in quite some time.

Since this is a first I can't wait until her next.I agree with someone had written earlier, this book had me emotionally engaged with all parties from feeling the pains of divorce, sibling rivalry, the doubt of that rebound love to the frustrations of being in a interracial family. I reccomend this highly to anyone who enjoys good books that don't neccesarily end up tidy to placate the general \\"reading-happily-ever-after\\" public.Brava' Ms. Adams... and I am looking forward to your next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a story that isn't like all the others","review":"This was my first book written by Ms. Adams, and I have to say that I like her writing style. The book caught my eye from the first page up until the last. When Mingus cried, I wanted to cry.The whole situation with her mother trapping her father into marrying her was messed up. The situation where she had a little sister because her father cheated was even more messed up. Her relationship with her sister also was a problem, but the situation that takes the cake is when her sister and her boyfriend have an affair. I know they didn't have sex, but still. He cheated, even thought not intentionally, and her sister, her flesh and blood, did that to hurt her.I felt Mingus was really strong in the end. It seems that she finally had her head on right and was going to start looking after herself. And that's always good to read about. All in all, the book was an excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lifetime Movie-Of-The-Week Quality","review":"Mingus's parents are getting a divorce, and because they had a biracial marriage, Mingus decides to avoid complications and only date black men. Of course, a minute later she meets a nice white cop who pursues her, and she gets involved with him - only to later meet a nicer black guy. Who will she pick? Well, if you can't tell by page ten, there's something wrong with you, because this novel is as predictable as it is lame. Adams tries to tackle the big issues of race, family and infidelity, but she has about as much success as a Movie-of-the-Week trying to win an Emmy. Jenoyne Adams should stick to dancing. Maybe she can move, but she obviously can't write."},{"rating":"2","title":"Resurrect your mind and read this book","review":"When I first started the book, it took me some time to get into it. The writing style is different, but once I got into the character Mingus, it was hard to put down the book. The story is about Mingus. She has a great career, but her personal life is not all that good. Her relationships never seem to last, she does not get along with her sister, and she is grappling with changes in her family. She is bi-racial, but always identified herself as black. When she gets involved with a white man she has to question if she is doing the right thing, then she meets Eric who is a black man and that complicates things even further. When she thinks she has finally found the love of her life, a bombshell is dropped that rocks her to the core. When she cries, you will want to cry. You want her to find that happiness that we often times think is elusive. I'm looking forward to reading Jenoyne's next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"My first time reading this author","review":"I read it but like Sela Bed didn't really remember the story, just thought it was kind of interesting but not not a memorable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Without a doubt ....

Otherwise I wouldn't have made it past the 10mn mark. The story was beyond absurd. The heal of the film is a minor league MMA fighter(like 3-0 I think).Sso desperate over losing a karate point sparring match as a teenager, kidnaps the hero's kid to force him to fight him in the cage to avenge this soul crushing loss. A 10 year old kid could have come up with a more realistic reason than this. So the hero travels to Brazil to learn Gracie Jiu-Jistu from Renzo Gracie(who plays himself). This is the best 10mns of the movie. Renzo is by far the best actor in the movie and he's never acted in his whole life. Just a clumsy film with weak dialogue, story & poor film quality. If you're a Renzo fan than it's cool to check out. Otherwise avoid this like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star above terrible but missing something added","review":"Movie had professor Renzo Gracie which makes it worth the watch. The plot is a beyond belief I need a movie that is at least believeable. The chief actor Jason Field needs more acting lessons. Maybe he has improved since this movie but in this one he was still an amateur? Anyway there were a few good parts in it but overall I wasn't impressed. It had the expected plot and ending and little believeable about it. I enjoyed seeing Renzo Gracie in it and the girl did a good job acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I didn't buy this book","review":"This book didn't cover many rapid reading topics, as a previous reviewer noted it was more about comprehension.

No smashing or tearing & the guide works wonders to keep your slices even.Since I can slice now I have been baking like crazy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"Next to my Showtime Rotisserie and NuWave Oven, this is one of the best As Seen on TV purchases that I have made. It is sharp and the guide adjusts from 1/4\\" to 1\\" thickness. I used it to slice through a loaf of turkey ham that I had been avoiding because I didn't feel like butchering it with a knife or pulling out my food processor to slice. I sliced the whole loaf into 1/4\\" slices in less than 5 minutes. The knife also does a great job cutting even bread slices, and it works like a charm when slicing tomatoes. This is a really good kitchen tool to have. Well worth the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool","review":"This knife was easy to use. it works great on hams and good with bread.

I had heard nothing but excellent comments about Gainsbourg's genius. What genius? This stuff has nothing I'm interested in and I regret the few bucks I spent buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Brazilian pop vocals","review":"One of the best-beloved and vocally powerful Brazilian singers of the 1950s, Angela Maria was a pop vocalist with a not-quite-brassy heft to her voice that might remind modern listeners of Maria Bethania - Tropicalia stars such as Caetano Veloso frequently acknowledge their admiration her work. This 2-CD set leans heavily on her later recordings, with a handful of tracks from the early '50s, but the bulk coming from the '60s and '70s. Most of it's pretty nice - a cool look at one of Brazil's now-neglected legends."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant compilation that could set the mood....","review":"I do agree with the editorial review that most of the individual pieces do not have anything to do with sex, per se, but I am not sure that is the point. Most of the music here (along with its sequel CD) is in my (subjective) opinion, quite romantic -- soft and melodic. I am not sure what classical pieces an album like this should include if sex were the real point -- popular music gets there a lot more directly. There certainly is nothing to offend here, and perhaps something to inspire. Think of this as the album you put on while in front of the fireplace with a bottle of wine when you are with the person you love. It should set the mood for some good conversation and whatever follows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been a lot better","review":"While I like all the pieces on this CD, many of them are incomplete (i.e., they fade out before the finish) and most of the performances are not very inspiring. It's disappointing when you know they could have done a better job by leaving off a couple of tracks so everything would fit in the original length. And the cover photo is a bit much... but you can re-fold the liner so people in the office don't get the wrong idea about your taste in CD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! With One Reservation","review":"Most of the music on this CD was great listening for me but one of the four CD's was too hard rock for me. I had to give that one to my 20ish daughter. I was quite happy that each of the CD's featured certain styles of music so that I could easily gift away the one I didn't like. If all those tunes were mixed amongst the 4 CD's I wouldn't have been able to give it away to someone who appreciated it more than I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Boy!","review":"This is one bad flick. You can tell Dennis Hooper was unconfortable making it. The hero, who was a brainless brawny jerk who had no common sense, only made things worse. Come on, the earth is going to be distroyed, the hero needed to get his act together. It started out OK, but it quickly got bad. There were some good looking babes in it though and the special effects wern't too bad for a low buck flick.

From what I read and saw , I expected to see tidal waves, tornadoes, etc... instead, none of that was in the movie.....Now, the FUNNIEST part about this movie was that they have used footage from movies like \\"Asteroid\\", \\"Dante's Peak\\", and \\"Armageddon\\". The most I recognized were the collapse of the bridge while the volcano was erupting (Dante's Peak)..and the nightscene where an asteroid hit Dallas from the movie \\"Asteroid\\". And all of a sudden, the movie ended...WOW. I just could not believe and did not expect this movie to use footage from other movies than creating the whole thing on their own.It was disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother!","review":"Not only did the effects and acting in this movie bite, but the story was terrible.A scientist discovers that a comet fragment will hit the moon ... world leaders ignore him ... he builds a shelter ... then, everyone is upset that he is \\"playing God\\".How lame!

Anyone interested in the history of Stalinist Russia should at least glance through this book. Trotsky offers not only a detailed analysis of the Soviet Union under Stalin, but an interesting critique as well. Finally, perhaps the most interesting factor in Trotsky's book is how he almost seems to forecast the end of the USSR...nearly 50 years in advance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dollhouse pieces","review":"These were about dollhouse sized. Not what I expected, but okay.I had a little trouble getting shipping information, but everything arrived in good order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story","review":"In a way it's hard to believe this short story is what inspired the iconic movie. Especially, since Tiffany's plays even a smaller part here than the movie. It was hard to get Audrey Hepburn out of mind while reading this, because this book takes place twenty years earlier-during the WWII. All material written in that time was always so serious (The greatest generation-they say.) that it was hard to picture such a flighty and worldly personalty for that time. Though I have no doubt that it must be true. It just takes an adjustment. Overall, it's a good story. I wish I could say the same for the three additional stories in this book. To me those, House of Flowers, Diamond Guitar and a Christmas Memory were a waste of time and a disappointment. But this book is still worth the purchase price for Breakfast at Tiffany's alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful","review":"Truman Capote is the master of both description and character development. Holly Golightly comes alive in dialogue. This is a breezy read, in the best possible sense of the term. It never bores and brims with poetic description, rich in detail, but never dense or plodding. The three short stories are similar in skill and beauty, but entirely different in tone, location, and plot. I almost cried at the end of A Christmas Memory. The Diamond Guitar reminded me of The Shawshank Redemption in atmosphere, but with an entirely different story."},{"rating":"2","title":"What beautiful prose . . .","review":"I had only read Truman Capote's In Cold Blood and not any of his earlier work. His writing is truly beautiful, every word is a delight . . .now I understand his popularity and fame."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"The first story \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" is wonderful and worth the entire book! I dont need to go further, read the book- and you will know why Holly GoLightly is well known!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Did you know...","review":"Seeing so many comments here about the character of Holly Golightly, I wonder how many people realize that she was written to represent Capote's friend, Marilyn Monroe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked...","review":"I bought the book yesterday morning, not knowing much about it; I haven't even had the chance to see the film yet! Anyway, I finished it last night. It is the most hooked I have ever been on a book. If you, like me, are a keen reader of JD Salinger, then this is a good read. I have't read the other stories as of yet but intend to later today."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book has more character depth than the well-known movie","review":"The movie is iconic, but the book is the source. Truman Capote wrote such great characters. Light-hearted banter does not necessarily mean superficial feelings. Read this novella for yourself. You will be surprised at the details and depth not revealed in the movie. Additionally, I purchased the Kindle version which came with more Capote short stories after the novella. Wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick Read","review":"I watched the movie Capote and was interested in reading all his books. Breakfast at Tiffany's was a good, but almost too quick read. It came with some other short stories that were enjoyable. Just left me wanting more because they are very well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truman's Talents","review":"I can't believe I waited so long to read this brilliantly written tale! Truman Capote paints a picture with his stories using every colour, shape, texture and tone imaginable! Loved this story, and although I thought the movie was good, it doesn't come close to the book itself. What a great gift we have been given....as no movie can ever compare to the mind's eye! We watch Holly Golightly as she comes to life before our very eyes. Incidentally, she is quite different and far more multidimentional than in the movie! A well-told tale.Highly Recommended!! A great summer read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast pace!","review":"This book was entertaining and fast moving but didn't make sense at times. A good book for anyone that likes a quick read. there is a lot of underlying messages that need a closer look after reading it once. Reading it over again helps you pick up on little things you didn't get before."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"I got this book because I love the movie, and now I can say I greatly appreciate the book also. It is always nice when a movie follows a book well and not make their own story and just use the title. But this is definitely a book i read again and again. The other stories in the collection were good also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick Heartfelt Fun","review":"The short novel, Breakfast at Tiffany's is wonderful. You could not ask for a more interesting character than Holly Golightly. She is a complete child has little regard for anyone but herself, and runs around New York like some play girl. You instantly fall in love with the mysteriousness that surrounds her life and the crazy events that pile on top of each other. From the way she finds cloths in her disheveled apartment to the nameless tabby cat that prowls during her eclectic get-together. The slow piecing together of Holly to the climatic ending is truly a ride.The three short stores that are included in this version where surprisingly good. They made me think of Raymond Carver and Richard Yeats. I think Capote was before both of them so he could very well have been an influence. A Christmas Memory was one of the best short stories that I have ever read.I have In Cold Blood now on order and am looking forward to reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I enjoyed the movie Breakfast at Tiffany's but the book deeply impressed me. The book tells the story of a woman who is trying to find her place in this world and in the society. It's a book about human nature that made me smile and got me sad in the same time. An excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless Pleasure","review":"An enjoyable and quick read. Capote delivers a dramatic and comedic storyline that offers a glimpse into the life of the characters. I thoroughly enoyed this read. The short stories at the end are a delightful bonus. Each is unique and exquisitely descriptive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Opened my eyes to a whole new world","review":"I didn't know it was possible to love reading until I found this book my senior year of high school. My assignment was to do a research paper on one American author, and I chose Capote knowing very little about him. Over the semester, I learned a lot about Capote, but it would be Breakfast at Tiffany's that kept me coming back for more. I chose to focus on this novella and his short stories as well as his personal life for my paper. The book supposedly based off his relationship with a certain Hollywood starlet reminds you that sometimes none of us know where our home is, and we are able to seek solace in the fact that Holly makes it seem not so bad sometimes. Yet, we know that she is a very lonely woman. Breakfast at Tiffany's opened my eyes to a whole new world, and I couldn't ask for anything more from any form of writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsensical","review":"I read the reviews on this story, the 5 stars and the 1 one, but I thought I would give it a try. Wish I hadn't.What does nonsensical mean? \\"Having no meaning or direction or purpose.\\" Exactly what this story represents. There is no depth to Holly Golightly's character. She talks in trivial roundabouts, is selfish and did nothing but try my patience. The narrator is flat, a wimp, and has no backbone. The story consists of mostly dialog, giving the reader no sense of being there. When I read it, I was thinking \\"blah, blah, blah\\" the whole time.As a librarian, I really do give every book I read a try, but I felt this story was nothing but complete DRIVEL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get how it can be given a 5","review":"Ok, so I know I'm probably alone on this one, but it's one of the few books I have read that I would not recommend. I have never seen the movie, so maybe I missed some link. I found it was lacking any form of structure and I think some of the language was dated (of course seeing when it was writen) and maybe some \\"American\\" terms that because I am not familar with I missed the point. However, I did get two quotes out of it and it was a short read so not a huge time investment to loose."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book stinks!!!","review":"I didn't care for it at all. I had to read it for high school and I couldn't even begin telling someone what it was about.

I liked Gina but her constant \\"there is a silver lining\\" attitude became tiresome for me. When I think of a good romance I think of books by Judith McNaught, Madeline Hunter, and Stephanie Laurens (although she can be repetitive). The characters in those books develop relationships that are truly founded on for better or worse. In order for the reader to feel the connection between the hero and the heroine it needs to be experienced with them and not told in pages upon pages of internal reflections. Dialog is very important in developing the characters, it provides interaction and sets a tone for the book. There was not a lot of dialog in this book. A few lines here and there but a good portion of the book was internal thoughts."},{"rating":"2","title":"my children and now my grandchild love this book","review":"I used this book for devotions for my two children when they were growing up (they are now 29 and 26). I kept it, because I loved it so much and so did they. I now use it with my 4 year old grandson who lives with me. He sits still and enjoys as we read the stories, and he loves the pictures, which are well done. I am so glad to have found a duplicate copy, to give to my adult son so he can read it to my 3 granddaughters. The stories are each one page long, which is perfect for a child 3 to 5 or even older.

There is a stainless steel wire shelf provided so I installed it and put the food on the shelf.Sometimes I noticed the food like a potato would be burned where it touched the wire. Once a hotdog arced through a paper plate and burned a hole in the paper plate. Once something arced through a paper towel and it actually had a burning ember glowing in the paper when I took it out.I think the shelf must overload the system and it has caused the demise of the oven.

I'm 14 years old and I have to admit, this set is totally cool. The Dragon it comes with is past poseable. The Catuplat was a little confusing to build at first, but the second time around it was easy. The Dragon is also easy.

His younger brother, Secondo (Stanley Tucci), will compromise, bend, wheel and deal; he is a desperate businessman who cares about food, but is realistic. Unfortunately, their little restaurant is way, way ahead of its time. When their 1950s customers go out for Italian food, they want red-checked tablecloths and lotsa spaghetti and meatballs, not risotto and delicate wine. How can their restaurant stay in business? It can't, but they try to save it with an all-out feast for a famous Italian jazzman. If you're the least bit hungry when you watch this film, you've got trouble, because food has never looked this good.

My test of a great movie is while I'm watching it I think of people I know who I'd like to see it with and then I try to make it happen (\\"C'mon over, I've seen a movie I want you to see with me!).

About two-thirds of the through the novel, though, it feels like Russell just gave up on revealing what's going on through the events, and characters start vomiting out long explanations of the plot in prose that sounds like they're quoting from a newspaper article (or in the more painful cases, from self-help books). Which doesn't matter, because you'll have figured out most of it long before the revelations). Once the plot grinds interminably to its resolution, there are a couple of less-obvious big reveals - but at that point, the characters have become so uninteresting and unlikeable that it's hard to care.

Maybe that's because I liked Mr. Russell's premise so much, I was disappointed to see how it actually played out in the story and plot.One disappointment, for example, was in the backstory relationships between the main characters. These were reveled with craftsmanlike skill, but oddly, rather than adding color or suspense or tension to the story, they seemed to add a distracting dissonance.As I read the book, I guess I just thought there was a better story there than the one that was told.

The plot is actually really scary, but instead of getting a chilling and action-packed story, we get a boring runaround with way too much drama, not enough suspense, and too many things that just don't add up.

If only the writers were more interested in creating suspense rather than drama.Not recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Waters of Mars","review":"This is one of the best stories in the second Doctor Who series.

The daughters of Mr. RODGERS: LINDA and MARY talked about their father's complex personnality and say along the way that the music was more emotional than the man. The portrait of LORENZ HART is also interesting; Mr. RODGERS's patience with LORENZ shows the compassion of a man who knew the value of a partnership. Personnaly, because I am a huge RODGERS and HART fan, I really liked this segment a lot. Those were the days of the AMERICA we like best, between the two world wars. So many of AMERICA's greatest achievement in music happened during those years. 90 minutes of RICHARD RODGERS who was the greatest composer of his time is certainly worthy of your time.

I will tell you this right now: you most likely won't understand until near the end. That's when all of the pieces will fit together. This book deserves more than 5 stars. The reason why I gave it only 4 stars is because of the dialogue... which confused the hell out of me! The characters are Scottish, so it took me a couple minutes for each page.

Anyone over 30 will say it is a controversial cult novel. Any one from Gen X will tell you it is a guide to well-being. Wheither you find it down right smut or holier than thou, godly material, you'll always find it interesting. The motion picture screen doesTrainspotting little justice because the contents that make this the \\"feel nothing\\" book of the era, also ban the true feel of the novel from any screen. And that my friends is a shame, because so few bask in the glory of literature anymore.

For example, Diane has no condoms, and Renton is raped while he's passed out by a dirty, neurotic man. Its scope is much larger than the film's, encompassing perhaps three times the number of significant characters, and weaving their stories together in a way that keeps the reader feeling as confused as nauseous. I liked it on the whole, but too much of it felt disjointed and irrelevant for me to really enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"a humorless novel about a group of Scottish drug addicts","review":"The hype this novel recieved was way overblown. I can imagine teenagers getting all pysched up about this, but if anyone has ever read James Kelman, Willam S. Burroughs and Samuel Beckett, then you may have some understanding as to what I mean. Basically, this book is a complete rip off of the three writers whom I referred to. Besides this fact, it is also humorless. But this is not say that Mr. Welsh isn't a good writer, because he is. It's just that he doesn't shine in this book. Try The Acid House."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strangely Fascinated...","review":"I finished Trainspotting five minutes ago and it was a heartache to close the book after having absorbed so many emotions from it. I searched for it because I had heard only a little about it with the exception of a few famous people reading it. Due to my vanity, I had to read it. A friend bought it for me and as soon as I started, I was blown away by the dialect and slang used. Once I got over the initial intimidation, I dove headfirst into an incredible book. Although this isn't my usual read, (I'm a huge W. Gibson fan), I found myself absolutely captivated by Welsh's characters. I think of him as a fabulous storyteller who captured the epitome of the tragedy of being young. I applaud him for showing that we do indeed have remorse for what we do. But we also have a love/hate relationship for this world. Read Trainspotting. It was indescribably beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"the embodiment of culture... or is it culture embodimented?","review":"Trainspotting is an alarming dialogue on youth, drugs, escapism, and the lowliness of dislocation of not just Scottish youth, but all youth. We can relate to the characters because they live in a game of chess, where they just feel like laying down their king to go f*#k off somewhere. It is about real people who choose not to make choices, what's the point? Inevitably we all are born, and we all die, so where is the necessity to conform?

While the film follows the life of the main character Mark Renton, the book gives a brilliant insight into what the friends really feel about each other and can provide a lot of humour in the writing. Another the thing the book has over the film is the overwhelming feel of scotishness which at time's in the film, fails to come across through the lack of decent a Scottish lead actor.If you can manage to get through the first couple of page's, where you will for sure find out how scotish this book is, then you will find Trainspotting a brilliant read. if you dont agree with what i said e-mail me and tell me how yoou feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"I don't think anyone could truly explain how amazing this book is.

Trainspotting is a hilarious, violent, and even sickening book that takes us into and below the lives of a group of junkies in Edinburgh, Scotland. It takes us into the minds and emotions of several characters, all who at one point in time act as narrator.

The game engine does not work at all. I wish I had read reviews on the car sim boards before wasting 10 bucks on this piece of trash. Even before you can start a race you will get a penalty for not being in the correct starting position even though you are right in the right place and then you will be disqualified before you can get to the pits to serve your penalty. Same thing every track every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Piece of Work","review":"EA Sports did a good job putting this thing together!

I would highly recommend this game to any nascar fan.Ryan"},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll be sorry","review":"Uninstalled this peice of garbage today. This game definately does not live up to the hype. Is it better than Thunder 04? maybe. Is it a realistic Nascar sim? NO. If your looking for a Sim Nascar Game buy anything made by Papyrus Racing Games. From Nascar 4 to Nascar 2003. They are not perfect but they are way closer than this. I really had my hopes up that EA would get it right this time but once again they fell way short. EA has exclusive rights to Nascar Sims now and since there is no competition they don't have to worry about making anything better. I've been racing online for 4 years and playing racing games for several years before that. If your looking for a new racing game even if it's not a Nascar game for the PC look elsewhere GTR and R Factor come to mind as games that show way more promise than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joke of a game","review":"This is an absolute joke of a game. If a car spins and you pass them to proceed to the yellow, you are disqualified for passing a car after the yellow comes out. If you stop behind the car that spun, you are disqualified for going too slow under caution. In other words, if any car spins in front of you, you are disqualified. This is true even with the 1.0.2.5 patch. This game is proof that EA cares about nothing but the bottom line. It is not playable."},{"rating":"1","title":"We need Papyrus Back - EA Missed the Boat","review":"Ridiculously buggy even after the patch. If there is a yellow flag, chances are you will be blackflagged and taken out of the race. Trying to bring in the elements of sponsorship and working your way through the different divisions was a great concept, too bad what should be the easiest part to program (the NASCAR rules themselves) turn this game into an unplayable mess.I guess we're left with an aging Papyrus Nascar Racing 2003 as the only decent NASCAR sim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unplayable","review":"Yes, the graphics aredisappointing, and the game physics lags well behind Papyrus's NASCAR Racing 2003. But what really takes the cake with this game is the bugginess, especially with yellow and black flag rules. Under a yellow flag, you follow the on-screen and spotter directions, and you will likely get black-flagged for passing someone you weren't supposed to. if you slow down to get in the right spot, you will be black flagged. If there is a wreck in front of you and you pass a wrecked car after the caution - black flag! I tried about 30 times and not ONCE did I finish a race without getting black flagged for some absurd reason. Papyrus figured out how to fix these problems years ago, but the EA monopoly doesn't have to, apparently. NASCAR SimRacing is an absolutely unplayable game and I have sent it back for a refund. Don't waste your time and money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAP","review":"I bought this game a year ago, and still haven't got it to work! EA has stopped supporting this game long ago. This game is total crap anyway. The ONLY real NASCAR Sim is NASCAR Racing 2003 Season by Papyrus. That game is continuously updated and supported by the largest single game following that I have ever seen. There are addons available for free through third party websites including Grand National, Craftsman Truck, ARCA Re/Max, and IROC. Those websites also keep all the paint schemes current, and are easily found through a Google or Yahoo search. Use what the real NASCAR drivers race online with, there are tons of open leagues available.

It just feels more authentic. Graphics are fine on NSR. The tracks are beautiful, but the cars look pretty chunky. Physics-wise the cars handle well but it is really hard to get any of the cars loose. I didn't try any of the online racing. I personally do not like EA. They come off as arrogant. They buy all of the rights for Nasacar and put out a mediocre product. Sure, each year there are improvements, but even five years from now I can't see them coming close to the quality of the original Paprus product.

Their exclusive licensing has done nothing but harm gaming for all gamers. This product is a prime example, its outrageously poor.The graphics look like something from 10 years ago. How can you release a game with graphics that look like a 2 year old drew them?

I got everything I expected- a superb simulation. This is a simulation of the real thing. If you are thinking that the guys at EA are dum, than you're saying Ryan Newman is also dum. Ryan Newman contributed precious information to the designers that makes this a great game.How can you be disqualified when the yellow comes out? The only way to be disqualified is to not obey a black flag, or make a complete stop.If you think this is not a simulation, think again. If you think you will finish in the top 5 in every race, you are wrong. Many people don't think the game is fun because of the difficulty. Those same people just don't understand the rules in the real sport. This game is a simulation of the sport, and that's what a true simulation is. If you decided to not buy this, think again.

I like to race the longer races at the shorter track,but i'm never am able to finish because i will be black flagged under caution or something on those lines. You dont even have to do anything wrong and you'll be black flagged and disqualified. It reminds me of a playstation/xbox game to much. the reason i get the computer racing games is because their always more realistic with chassis setips and driving style. I wish Serria or Papyrus could get the rights back because thats when the games was good. I will not buy anymore racing games for my PC if they are made by EA sports. EA sports games are great for playstaion but not PC. So if your looking for the latest Nascar racing game thats good. Then buy Nascar Racing 2002 or 2003.

However, this adapter made for horrible sound quality (e.g. garbled sound) and its cheap construction is evident just by looking at it. It's not even worth the $2 (pluse S&H) that I paid for it. At least it proved the theory. It's in my garbage can and I'm now ordering an adapter from a better brand of electronics.

The 21 articles each examine a discrepancy in a free market situation and develop theories for explaining the discrepancy drawing upon the behavioral finance field. I have an MBA and have been an investor for more than 20 years. There are too many statistics and academic language to be an efficient book for me. I quickly switched to finding each of the 21 questions, then skipping to the summary to find the behavioral finance theory for the discrepancy. I did enjoy the credit card high interest rate explanation and consider this explanation alone worth the price of the book.

I felt compelled to read it through in two nights, and then spent a number of days digesting the disturbing information it contained. The manner in which Jeff entwined four very diverse subjects (investment broking, the sale of body parts, China/U.S. relations, and a love story) was skillfully done without losing integrity in any area. Even though the subject matter is frightening, I felt an underlying strand of hope in the character of Stuart Dealier.

There are references throughout the book to other sections that in some cases do not even exist. Overall the book is a general overview of Exchange Server and Exchange/Outlook clients. I used the book as a background to the Microsoft course work and did find it to supplement the material somewhat. One notable well-written section is on designing and installing an Exchange system.

I now look at food in a whole new light and feel better than I have in years. My only criticism would be that she continually refers you to other chapters, which made sense within the context of whatever subject she was on, but you had to keep going to the table of contents. It would have been helpful to have the chapter number included on the top of the right hand page so you could leaf through to the referred chapter quickly, but all in all a small inconvenience in an otherwise great experience.

Well-designed plot, the revelations are deserved and rewarding. Has a strong heroine and a strong female villain.

Crews put a lot of work into these essays, which are clever, intelligent, and extremely funny. He isn't nearly so vicious in his satire as many of his speakers (and their real-life counterparts) are in their literary-political maneuvering, but he exposes the void at the heart of much modern literary criticism where the work itself used to live.

The box itself as well as the sleeves in which the CDs are placed are made of good-quality hard cardboard with a glossy finish. Much more compact and easier to handle and store than the larger plastic CD covers. The sound is quite good and pleasant to listen to. The selection is vast and has quite a bit of vocals with the beautiful voices of Ray Eberle and Marion Hutton. 10 CDs is a lot of music and the best part is the price. You can't get a better deal than this box set. I am absolutley satisfied with my purchase and look forward to many hours of beautiful music from the good old days. I certainly recommend this box set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swing with Miller","review":"For lovers of 40's big band jazz, this is terrific value for money.

It is everything the other reviewers said it was -- it has a great selection of Glenn's most popular and some of his more obscure works and the sound quality is outstanding. My only complaint, and this is why I'm rating this only item 4 stars instead of 5, is the packaging. Each CD comes in its own sleeve and it is pushed in there so hard it is nearly impossible to get out. I had to actually partially rip one of the sleeves to get the CD out. Also, grasping the CD with flannel and pulling it out so as not to leave fingerprints isn't nearly as easy as it sounds.So, I guess this rating is 5 stars for the music and only 1 for the packaging. Otherwise a great set of CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glenn Miller Civilian Orchestra","review":"Well, we've all heard most of them before but still.

So in order to use the hole saw, I had to either find a mandrel or buy this kit. The Bosch hole saw requires a 16mm mandrel which I could not find anywhere, so I ordered this adapter. It fit OK but has some slop in it, so of course you don't get a good hole. I would have bought a Big Hawg except they don't make a 2 3/4\\" hole saw. Bosch makes a good hole saw, but if you can't use it, why waste the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea but needs to be more durable","review":"I have gone through 2 of these in about a years time. I like the fact that the bits are so easy to change, which is what attracted em to them in the first place. After 6 months or so the ball retainer for the pilot fell out or was broken, which meant that you had to start the hole and then take the pilot out or it would fall out on it's own. The second one was destroyed when I was drilling with the 3 inch hole saw that came with the set that I purchased, and the bit actually bound in the hole and the stub that is put into the drill chuck actually bent. I am a professional remodeler and do use my tools, but I never abuse them. I can't afford to keep replacing broken tools. If you are doing light duty or small diameter holes then this is the system to get, but don't expect the mandrel to last through much in the way of heavy use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"We go through a 5-pound jar of this every month, and have used several different brands.

Myself, I tracked down the book mostly to see the chapters on gymnastics, but did enjoy reading the entire book.Be forewarned, though, that the book definitely does have the air of propaganda about it. It was written by an American author after her interviews there, and published by an American company, but some of what is presented still seems like too much whitewashed sunshine to be taken at face value. I almost had the impression reading it that the Soviets had very carefully censored what she saw and who she talked to, and that she had been gullibly taken in.Despite that, there were some lovely tidbits - for example, a story about how overweight girls weren't turned away from rhythmic gymnastics, but instead segregated into their own classes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of Motown's finest","review":"I'm a big Motown fan, and I figured it was time to add some Martha Reeves to my collection. I heard her through an old 'Best of Motown' CD that I bought years ago, and I loved them. So, I felt it was only necessary to add them to my collection.This one, 1999's '20th Century Masters' is the way to go if your new to this wonderful trio. 'Dancing In The Street,' of course, is their biggest hit. That was actually the song on my old Motown CD, but I liked it a lot. Other highlights for me are 'Jimmy Mack,' 'Heat Wave,' and 'Quicksand.'So, if you want some more great Motown to add to your collection, don't pass The Vandellas by. They are simply too good to ignore. Highly, highly recommend. Plus, as always, the sound quality is excellent.Enjoy this one!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad copy","review":"Great introduction to Martha Reeves and the Vandellas. But QUICKSAND has some audio problems...I returned the original copy I purchased ...exhanging if for another. The problem still exists....kind of hard to describe but during one part of the song the speakers in my car sound like they are going to pop. It's not as noticeable when played on my home stereo but it's still there. Also the version found here is not mixed properly.Although HEATWAVE is played over and over again on the radio and included in so many compilation discs...the version found on this disc includes one with a longer instrumental break during the middle of the song. I've only heard this on the radio ...I assume it was a \\"radio cut\\" sent to DJ's. However, by adding the longer instrumental break the producer of this disc sacrifices the classic ending to the song. Bummer.

I found it a fascinating read that made a lot of their songs take on a whole new meaning for me.

BUY THE BOOK !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Wheel's on Fire","review":"This is an amazing book.I could smell the earth, trees, etc. in Levon's boyhood home.

I didn't want to put it down. Wish Levon, Rick and Richard were still here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great musician, sad and bitter person","review":"This book is full of interesting anecdotes but it is spoilt by Helm's bitterness towards Robertson. Instead of blaming Robertson for his problems perhaps he should have reflected a little on the destructive consequences of his own heroin addiction. I don't understand why people accept Helm's spiteful comments about Robertson so uncritically. His attitude towards women is also fairly disgusting. It would have been better if Helm had not published this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Story of The Band","review":"Well, Well, Well, what can I say, the true story of one of the greatest bands of all time, The Band. This is an account of the history of The Band told from the point of view of it's oldest member, Lavon(Levon) Helm. Helm tells the story of his childhood growing up in Arkansas and learning to play the guitar first and then the drums. This tells how the group came together under the direction of one Ronnie Hawkens, and eventually under the great Bob Dylan, and eventually their solo careers and ultimately their breakup with the \\"Last Waltz\\" as Robertson liked to call it. This is full of little known facts and is a must have for any true Band fan, and yes, it does tell what was really in Neil Young's nose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Proud and Talented: Levon pulls you behind the scenes","review":"It could be said that Levon's writing style gets a tad hokey and that the chip on his shoulder could hardly get any bigger but the story of the songs and the formation of the Band make it worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Memoirs from a Fascinating Man and a Great Drummer","review":"This Wheel's on Fire is a great memoirs and a must read for any rock and roll fans. Levon Helm's voice shines throughout its pages. You really feel like you get to know him and other members of the Band, as well as their famous friends. While Robbie Robertson doesn't fare so well, Levon made sure to give credit where credit is due. Some of the stories, especially Rick Danko's impromptu return to his pre-rock and roll job, made me laugh out loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for anyone who wants to read about a real band.","review":"This book tells a story of a band. Not of all the lager than life exploits of a rock'n'roll freakshow, but a band. Levon mentions some adventures here and there, but the story revolves around the creation, life, demise, and rebirth of probably the greatest band in rock history. Some unfortunate istances took place amongst band members, and they caused some bitter dissention, however, the book is honest and interesting. The best musical book I have ever read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great acting and deep emotions make this a must see!","review":"This film is very moving.

Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Touching","review":"I watched this movie simply because I love Claire Danes, and was rather suprised by how moved I was by this movie. Claire Danes is WONDERFUL, and the story is very moving and believable. I've seen this movie 3 times and I recommend it to anyone who's looking for a sad, moving family drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"First of all, for the caliber of actors in this movie, they deserved a better script. Michelle Pfeifer and Peter Gallagher are class acts, but really this movie just did not dig deep enough. I have read all the rave reviews of Claire Danes, as I have read all the raves in the past and I am beside myself. I mean she has mastered the part of the proverbial angst-ridden pouting teenager to a tee. If this is her niche, so be it. The premise of the story is pretty decent -- a man loses his wife in a tragic freak accident and has a hard time moving on. Completely understandable. Then his annoying sister in law and her equally annoying husband arrive and proceed to berate the poor guy for mooning over a wife that is dead. Oh my god, stop the presses. These people had the sensitivity of androids. It would have been nice to see him kick these people out of the house, but then the film would'nt drone on and on, This is a good film for a rainy day. But I expected more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full Frame - Boooooooo!!!!!","review":"Even though this film was originally released in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio and the DVD format traditionally preserves a film's original artistry and scope, Columbia-Tristar decided to modify this film for your television set. By doing this, Columbia-Tristar make clear that they have no respect for this film and think that it's a terrible film undeserving of your money. Don't waste your money on this cheep DVD vandalization of this film. Wait until they give it a proper widescreen release."},{"rating":"1","title":"widescreen please!","review":"I think it's ridiculous that this movie is available only in 1.33:1 aspect ratio! Now, with the advent of digital broadcasting and HDTV, nearly everyone has widescreen TV. I would buy this movie if it was available in it's proper widescreen version but as long as it is only available in 1.33:1 I will not be purchasing it. I give the movie itself three stars but because of the unavailability of widescreen I would give it zero stars if this review format would allow that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling human drama","review":"\\"To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday\\" is a compelling human drama that is a masterful potpourri of characters drawn together for different reasons to commemorate a tragic anniversary. The script is superb, well written and echoes other masterpieces like \\"The Man With No Face\\" and \\"On Golden Pond.\\" The film is masterfully complemented by James Horner's soaring movie soundtrack score. Those who don't like this film were probably thinking that they were going to see a reunion film starring Bob Denver and Alan Hale titled \\"To Gilligan on His 57th Birthday.\\" And, true, they would likely have been more comfortable with a film where the professor and Mary Ann send out invitations to a surprise party written on dried fig leaves. Or they were perhaps afraid to approach 40 or to dare to remember the ghosts of their lives so passionately and so vividly. Don't mistake Gillian for Gilligan, accept the invitation to take a long look inside and enjoy this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great to build, lousy to play with","review":"My son and I had a great time building this beautiful ship, but shame on Lego for not putting a dislaimer on the box, \\"Not for Play, Only for Show!\\" You can't breath on this thing without the hull falling apart. You expect small pieces to fall off, but the backbone structure?. I will start tomorrow on some modifications (glue anyone) to make this thing an actual toy for a 7 year old with a great imagination. By the way, whatever happened to making your own designs with generic bricks?"},{"rating":"1","title":"High on Cute, Low on Durability","review":"First, I confess: I'm an adult and I love playing with Legos. Thus this ship was something of a disappointment. As other reviewers noted, it's very unstable; the hull wants to keep collapsing as you build on it. The dragon figurehead will fall off if you breathe on it. Since the set SEEMS to be designed to be played with -- i.e., fire the catapult, move the sea serpent, etc. -- I would think a child would be very disappointed in this as a toy. You can't play with it or even touch it. So it's reasonably fun to build but that's it -- it's definitely under par given Lego's usual attention to such details."},{"rating":"1","title":"STRANGE","review":"I read this not knowing anything about it except the synopsis. On the surface it was good - a story of a light that gives divine grace to certain towns-people, and confusion to a killer. It was an interesting mystery, but the writer seemed lost at points, and gave the killer too much psychobabble conversation - which proved too much for the story. I read it through to the end - but found the end lacking. It is an \\"okay\\" read - but too \\"intelligent\\" to be interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I had moderate hopes for this book after reading the good reviews here, but I have to say I was very disappointed. It started out pretty good, but rapidly went downhill. The dialogue seemed very artificial, and the whole plot involving the Light was confusing and strange. At times, it seemed touching, but mostly just strange. There are also odd sexual details that seem unnecessary to the story. I can't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"no decoda required","review":"This was one of the most trite books i have read in a long while. And Tuscany??

He writes in a clear and comprehensible fashion. This particular book is a great resource for those who want to scratch beneath the surface of some of the most significant events from the New Testament - events commemorated each year by the Catholic Church.

I tried using their software, and it worked when I changed the root of the target CD, including the folder name.

Any 6 year old kid in Palestine knows how to speak the language, but I'll bet he wouldn't have clue as to what diptotes are and I doubt he has memorized the 10 derived verb forms or the innumerable patterns for broken plurals.

I had to by a second transformer to use back home, since we have here 220V.Another thing, I have a 4GB Ipod NANO first gen, and the remote doesn\`t work(Has never worked for me). Went to the MAC store here, and the guy told me the batteries could be failing (remote ones). Strange for a new product.Summary: The sound is the only plus, the rest is awfull"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Atrocious sound.

At first they were great, but within a year, just beyond the warrantee period BTW, all four had gotten their volume stuck in either the minimum or maximum positions. The JBL web site doesn't even list the speakers by name, you have to look it up by model number (TEAK-48-180080000/U/M/V/VB1/A/J/K for those of you who are curious), and if you don't enter it just right, then it sends you to 404 world.

I don't see how resetting my iPod would help with the volume problem because it happens when I have my computer connected via a speaker cable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will Not Charge 4th Gen.

It also shows the contrast of a person raised during China's total embrace of communism and how he copes both morally and emotionally with Chinese communism's embrace of the free market. It is a story of love and hope. An umemployed factory worker and a blind 18 year old are the heroes of this movie. Simply, it is a lovely film and viewing it you will feel better about people. Watch out Hollywood, Chinese cinema is no longer just Kung Fu movies. Director Zhang Yimou knows how to tell a story, without off color language or gratuitous sex scenes. Only goes to show you a good script transcends all language barriers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kaplan LSAT Study Book","review":"The Kaplan LSAT study guide is comprehensive. It is a great tool from the start of your LSAT journey even up to giving tips about how to apply to law school afterwards. I would recommend using it in addition to the Logic Games Bible, which breaks down the process, but the Kaplan book is a good investment. There are plenty of practice problems in the Kplan and explainations which is key."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Prep Tool","review":"I love this prep book. It gives great strategy tips and has great practice tests. I'm taking the LSAT in June so I won't know how well this has prepped me until July but I think it is worth the buy. the CD is great and you have access to online content only from Kaplan. they even have a free practice test that you sign up for online where you go to their local kaplan center and sit for a practice exam that is scored. That is awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Want to get noticed just from your scent?","review":"I received this parfum as a gift last year. When I first smelled it, it was flowery and nice, not too sweet, but nothing real special. I normally wear Tatiana but, for a change I used it one warm evening and once I put it on, I noticed it changed and smelled really beautiful! I recieved complements from several strangers, both men and woman that evening! The scent lasted too. I'm not a huge fan of Joan Rivers, I find her funny and entertaining but this parfum is really wonderful. When I ran out I wasn't sure I could buy more because I don't watch QVC or any of the shopping channels. But I did a quick search and found it on Amazon and I'm very pleased. If you tend to wear light, sweet scents, try this, it's quite nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy Duty Commercial Grade","review":"This juicer is what I use in my restaurant. It is high powered and very easy to use. Cleaning and maintaining the machine are very easy.

Besides that, it is a quality juicer that is perfect for a commercial evironment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story I can relate to","review":"From the very first page of this book I was enticed to read on. I felt a connection to the characters and it was as though it was my life on these pages. This story also inspired me that no matter what happens to you in life and no matter what the odds are stacked against you, if you want it bad enough it can be yours.

Don't get me wrong I have watched plenty of foreign movies especially some of the Korean ones like Old Boy and the two others in that series as well as a lot of Japanese horror.This movie did not frighten me in the least. It was so painfully obvious in the first story what the dumplings are that it kind of ruins the entire thing. The second one has many social connotations I am sure but that really isnt my thing.I found the third story to be creepy in some parts but at the end I guess I just didnt understand what had happened. I dont consider myself to some movie genius like many of the reviewers here but I usually am able to understand...this just kind of jumped to what they thought might be a creepy ending but made very little sense.I say save your money, and if you want to watch a movie where people eat weird things buy Ravenous instead with Guy Pearce."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars for \\"3 Extremes\\"","review":"I was looking forward to seeing this film due to the good reviews I'd heard and the sterling reputations of Takashi Miike and Park Chan-Wook (I'd never heard of Fruit Chan before), but I was very disappointed. Miike's \\"Box\\" is the best of the bunch, a surreal psychological portrait of guilt with a startling image at the end. Chan's \\"Dumplings\\" is an obvious, simplistic morality play with an ending I could see from a mile away. (I wonder if it plays better for Chinese speakers. It occured to me that this segment could function as a commentary on China's \\"one child\\" policy, but this is not evident from the subtitles.) Park's \\"Cut\\" is a bizarre set piece that provoked much discussion among the people I saw it with about exactly what happened and what it meant; the only thing we could all agree on was that this contrived mess wasn't worth the energy of the debate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Other then 'Dumplings' it was a let down for me","review":"This is basicly 3 short films and the best being Dumplings. A woman runs a 'clinic' out of her flat (apartment, whatever you call them over there) and she also makes a fountain of youth, as it were, using the leftovers from her other job as the ingredients. I have a problem with that concept but other then that the movie didn't do much for me and the other 2 (Cut and Box) were forgettable. I'm not sure about the other 2 guys, but I expect more out of Miike (Box)."},{"rating":"1","title":"superficial","review":"I had high hopes for this book in view of the rich experiences of Nicholas Gage and his two fine books so worthy of that experience. Sadly, this book struck me as superficial and, as often happens these days in writers who drawing on personal experience, narcissistic. I gave the book a chance, but really had to stop before I was half finished.It's not enough to be a good writer; you need to have a mature sensibility and not leave the impression that you've spent too much of your life shopping. Disclosure: I am of Greek descent and we need more worthy attention to be paid to Greece in the modern era, books like those by Miller and Patrick Leigh Fermor are an antidote to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Awful","review":"With so many struggling to get their work published, it really makes you wonder how word vomit like this was ever printed. The illustrations are absolutely beautiful and immediately attracted me to the book. Without time to read through it, I bought it for my daughter's Christmas present. Looking forward to reading such a beautiful book, we sat down to read it, and I was astonished at how poorly written it is. The reader has no context for half of what goes on in the story, word choices are dreadful and the book is missing a really good editing process. Overly worded and reads with no rhythm whatsoever. My daughter, who loves stories and has no shortage of attention span, couldn't make it through this awful reading despite how great the pictures were. What a letdown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very handy.","review":"Very nice indoor clothes dryer, and made in U.S.A as I recall.

Rational readers will ask, every page, \\"Well, then, why didn't you just walk away?\\" As she goes into detail after detail about the incorrect teachings of the organziation, a reader will repond, \\"Yes, that's why the rest of us don't join up!\\" I was hoping for insights into the workings of a cult, but instead received insights into the workings of a very weak individual. Perhaps the two are one in the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Common slander/libel again Jehovah's Witnesses","review":"This is the kind of common slander/libel that is used against Jehovah Witnesses repeatedly time and again.

When I first started reading this book I thought OMG someone has gotten into my head and written my story. Of course this could be any of a million or so exJW's story with a few variations. We all started off the same (except those unfortunate enough to be \\"raised in the truth\\") and then our story takes its own turn. I was held in bondage for 30 years in this frightening organization and I am so glad to be set free. As I kept reading this book I would think, this is the big thing that is going to get her out and I'll be darned if she didn't need more convincing. It was almost frustrating that she would not just throw in the towel and quit long before she did. Excellent book tho. Every exJW should read it. Too bad that the active JW is not allowed the freedom to choose their own reading materials. It would also do them well to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fully-Awakened Soul","review":"I have not only had the opportunity to read Diane's well-written and \\"healing\\" book, but was blessed to meet her face to face, producing a four part series on our weekly public access cable television show entitled \\"Cult-Awareness.\\" That series was based on Diane's book. Since that interview series hundreds of people throughout the country have had the opportunity to view it and be educated, strengthened in thier beliefs, and made aware of the \\"heavenly deception\\" of the Jehovah's Witnesses....I highly recommend to anyone and everyone Diane'sreal-life-escape recorded in her engaging book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read","review":"Diane Wilson gives an excellent idea of life behind the Watchtower walls. She correctly describes the stifling spiritual wasteland in this religious publishing company. There is some excellent information in the book which is well documented.Active Jehovah's Witnesses may find the book critical of their organization but they are trained to ignore what those who have left have to say. Those who are studying with the Witnesses or have family members who are involved will gain a rare glimpse into the mindset of Witnesses. In fact most active JWs will not even read the book but will claim (as they are taught to do) that it is full of lies designed specifically to make them look bad. Sadly this actually reinforces the points that the author makes about the control the Watchtower Organization has over its members.While the story is from a woman's perspective men will probably enjoy the clear, factual and unemotional perspective the author uses to present her story.Lee"},{"rating":"2","title":"it rang true with me!","review":"Very interesting read of an ex-Witness. Written very much from a female perspective, Ms Wilson talks about such issues as depression, coping with teenagers who leave the religion, blood transfusions, the society's equating of rape with fornication (if the victim doesn't scream) and the lack of love in the congreagation. She goes into detail about the society's zigzagging doctrinal changes and tells how she finally got out from them"},{"rating":"2","title":"You Want Insight On A JW?

After doing much research and reading on the subject, to read this personal account of a long time JW did the trick! I have no doubt that most JW's are good hearted people and to be so sucked in, manipulated and guilted into serving God is ashame - what power (and $$$) the Watchtower Society has over these people.

Kellerman's characters are more substantial than those of many other mystery writers, and I enjoy watching them and their relationships grow over the series.I strongly disagree with the earlier reviewer who felt that the author was unfair to religious Christians. Only one character in the book fit this description, and by and large she was a sympathetic character - a good nurse, mentor and daughter.I particularly liked the interwoven relationships of the various characters, and I have to admit that the mystery itself kept me guessing to the end.I'm looking forward to reading more of Kellerman's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grievous Sin deserves better reviews","review":"I thought this was a pretty good novel, despite all who protest that Grievous Sin was too slow and talky. I was interested in following the mystery of the enigmatic nurse, the missing baby, and the unidentified victim of a grisly murder. There were a few problems: I did not find the nursery nurses' behaviour believable--they were too negligent to be for real, one hopes--and Decker seemed to operate on zero sleep, which continues throughout the series to amaze me. I also didn't care for Cindy's character. As in Stalker, she just annoys me with her self destructive nosiness. But despite it all, I couldn't put Grievous Sin down, much like Decker never seems to be able to go to sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decker pursues kidnapper","review":"Peter and Rina Decker are thrilled at the birth of their daughter, despite the fact that Rina suffers complications and goes through a dangerous period after the birth. Their joy turns to concern when a little baby who is born at the same time, disappears from the nursery. Peter takes this case personally because he knows that it could have been his little daughter Hannah who was kidnapped. One of the nurses is a chief suspect and when a dead body is discovered in a burned car, police feel that it might be the nurse. Homey, domestic scenes of the Deckers and their new baby are interspersed with the cold reality of Peter's pursuit of a kidnapper and murderer.

I recently tried to get a refund, but have heard nothing back."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious and frustrating","review":"I found this book to be very disappointing.Too much dialogue and emotion...in the hospital waiting room especially. I can't believe the number of hours Cindy and Peter spent at the hospital. Also, the under-staffed nursery...(one of four nurseries) was too unrealistic to believe. The nurseries should have been consolidated...to match the number of nurses available.Unrealistic characters...especially Tandy. The word 'caring' is used to describe the motivation of nurses in excess. Makes you really wonder about the nursing profession...and their sanity.The baby's parents were stereotyped latino teenagers.I was frustrated starting at page one....all the way until the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"Faye Kellerman has certainly written some good books and I am a fan of hers. I read Justice first and still think that one is my favorites. I found this book to be a real disappointment. I found Cindy irritating, Rina morbidly self-consumed and the plot ridiculous. Peter, who was not interviewing some of the suspects, seemed to know things that he had no way of knowing before Marge, who was interviewing the suspects, told him. When the ring was found in the car, he asked Cindy all about it but neglected to ask her what color the stone was? The first half of the story never got out of the nursery where the baby was taken and nothing was going on but a lot of talking there. When I finished the book I was left with a feeling of why did I even bother to read the book. It was a struggle from beginning to end to get through it with no satifaction at any of the stages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reading this was a grievous sin","review":"This book was a 390 page let down. Kellerman has a way to drag out a plot of nothing. I continued to read this book hoping to find something exciting in it only to get to the end and read a rather \\"blah\\" ending. The old mother-daughter, 1/2 sister plot. Listen to the other reviewers and read something with a little more pizazz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Humorless, with dull plot and talk talk talk","review":"What gets this woman on the bestseller list? I thought this was very talky, with Decker & his partner often making wildly irrational leaps of logic. One early chapter seemed to be nothing but a back-and-forth between Decker & his daughter regarding a nurse and a nurse's station. Witless, too - and I mean, yes, not a modicum of WIT in this book. Very humorless. The plot is ridiculous - it really did read as if she were making it up as she went along. Not much detecting seemed to go on, either, just talk, talk, talk. Find something better to read (or listen to)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ok","review":"Was expecting more in the book. It's just ok. Bought it for my 6 yr old, but she doesn't get the riddles unless I explain them and some are far fetched, even for an adult. I wouldn't recommend it for a 6 yr old."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must in any Statistician's personal library","review":"This book was providencial during my Master in Statistics research. It is THE reference when it comes to discrete distributions, a topic in Stats which has bloomed in the last two decades. This new edition covers some state-of-the-art topics in the field, such as mixture distributions and new families of discrete random variables. It is well written, but never verbose: it cuts to the chase and will be of great help to a practitioner in dire need of an arcane test. And finally, believe it or not, discrete random variables are FUN. The more you know about them, the more you perceive they can be applied in almost any practical situation. And you don't need much more than the contents of this book to be an expert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ark Angels","review":"I HATED this manga. It was Horrible(to me) but i am almost 18 and this was geared to younger children and that might be why.Three girls come from another dimension and are collecting all the endangered animals and putting them on an ark because we don't respect the animals...You get to see the animals souls and how the animals live...But they always have to go on a mission because the give the animals one last request, like saving thier mom, or helping them find a true love...It's cute and educational...It reminds me alot of sailor moon and card captors....If you like cute innocent storylines then this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice music!","review":"I bought this cd a couple years ago off a discount rack, and rarely have I ever felt that I got more than my money's worth. This is a great collection of a capella Celtic songs that send you to another world while you listen. The artists are fantastic, very talented, and I love to sing along with the songs. I let my brother borrow it for one day, and he was instantly jealous, wanting his own copy. My favorites are Carrigdoun and the Lakes of Pontchartrain for stunning vocals. For sing-along, I love The Galway Rover and the last track (the title escapes me--but I know the lyrics). Get this cd--you won't be disappointed. It's money well-spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous!!","review":"These earrings, while small (1.5\\"), are absolutely beautiful! I had my doubts based on the inexpensive price, but I am more than pleased! The amethysts are beautiful (true to the color in the picture), and the earrings overall are well made and look much more expensive than they really are. Only one small problem, one of the earrings is slightly defective, but I called Eve's Addiction (toll free to CT) and they are shipping a pair out tomorrow free of charge, along with a pre-paid return label. The company couldn't have been easier to deal with; it took me about 30 seconds to arrange getting a new pair shipped. I am seriously considering buying these same earrings in different colors; that's how much I like them! Great to wear to weddings this summer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Connecting the Disconnected","review":"I was going to give this novel four stars but, after reading the bad reviews and feeling how badly they've missed what makes this a great Theroux novel, I'm going to go ahead and give it five stars.(My memories of other Theroux works is my sole motivation for taking a star off anyway).Yes, there isn't a clearly-defined plot in HOTEL HONOLULU but the transient lives and lifestyles of the people who end up on that \\"rock in the middle of water\\" form a story that feels like a single entity. The characters are bold and vivid. Nothing whitewashed here: old white men rant about the Hawaiians and Asian women and vice versa.Another wonderful quality about Theroux's writing is that he goes to remote and exotic locations and brings back a reality we've never seen, whether it's the South Sea islands or the dirt roads of Mongolia or the frozen train stations of Siberia...or America's paradise, Hawaii.Bravo, Paul!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No preconceived notions...","review":"I was familiar with the author, Paul Theroux but had not any feelings about the book. In brief, I was able to enjoy the book cover to cover and at times I read the various conversation out loud--just maybe an Audible presentation/edition will be enjoyable, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Hawaii...therefore I appreciated this book","review":"There are few places in the world as magical as Hawaii, and though I'm no expert in Hawaiian culture, there was something incredibly authentic about the reading experience. As usual, Theroux does a masterful job of creating complex, likeable characters who experience pain in unique ways. Hotel Honolulu successfully juggles the lives of many as they interconnect and weave over the course of many years. I won't say that this book is a page turner, in fact, it probably took me 3 weeks to read, but it is memorable and has stayed with me more than most books do.And it makes me want to visit Hawaii again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dull","review":"i did not care for this book. i did not learn anything about hawai. the charecters were not very nice eithir.it just seemed kind of dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I've read Theroux (Mosquito Coast and My Secret History were superior), (Chicago Loop was not very good at all) and I thought this was a very enjoyable read. Theroux is a standout writer and his observations about the hotel, its guests and human nature in general were insightful as well as hilarious. My only problem (if any) is that the book read like a bunch of short stories rather than a novel, but overall high marks. I rarely give 5 stars but this one deserves it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your dime","review":"What a disapointment. Honolulu/Waikiki is my favorite place on this planet, bar none. The diverse culture and variety of character types presents a marvelous opportunity to create a story of gripping proportions, interweaving people and places laden with intrigue and interest. However, Mr. Threoux blew it! The characters, including the unnamed narrator, are flat and boring. There's simple no one here to care about, for better or worse. The cast rarely cross one another's paths, and in far too many instances, the exotic locale is irrelevent. If you do decide to throw good money away on this book it wont take you long to figure out that Mr. Theroux has nothing to say here. And if he wasn't a writer with a name, I doubt this book would have seen the literary light of day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hotel Honolulu","review":"This was a selection from a member of my book club. I thought the book was smut. The author seemed obsessed with oral sex.

This is a story about how destructive passion can be when focused in the wrong place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!!","review":"This movie is fabulous, with utterly brilliant performances. It is in limited release, but don't miss it if it is playing in your area. It is a real tearjerker. If you are unable to see it in theatres, pick it up when it is released on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Heaven's Sake","review":"All this drama and hype for a bunch of dysfuntional people who could be happy if only they'd make the right decisions.There was absolutely no justification for Rickie to jump into bed with his wife's sister, or his wife's sister to cast off all familial fidelity for a fling for her sister's hubby. Didn't they know this would lead them into trouble?I guess we're supposed to feel sorry for Rickie who basically is at the whim of his adolescent hormones, but to finally leave his mistress and then rape his wife (!) as though she's the cause of the whole thing? What an ape.2 stars for good London sets."},{"rating":"2","title":"about the movie the heart of me.......","review":"The storoy is basically about one of the actress Dinah whom got pregnant after sex with the actress's husband(Maldeleine) whom later try to tie down Maldeleine's husband by messing with their marriage. I am notgoing to say anything more to the story to make the movie boring to watch. There are two sex scenes inside and also for those whom are interested to watch this genre of movie. I watch this at Singapore theatre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blew Me Away","review":"I have been in the music industry for a very long time, and I haven't been this excited about a band in the last decade.

I ended up buying a hair dryer there with a smaller narrow oval shaped rubber plug which worked just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a 5 star book.","review":"I can't see why other rated this book 5 stars. Maybe they just looked at the pictures because it does have nice pictures of various old sheds.The book contains instructions to build one shed. They are very detailed. Too bad they are hard to follow and in some cases just plain wrong. For instance, on page 77, step 68, the author says to set your circular saw to a 45 degree angle and cut a 12' 2X4 into 6 pieces 3' long. This will result in bevel cuts, not the desired angle cuts. The instructions are written in such a way that you expected to follow them blindly without deviation. Also it is difficult to match up the relavant photos with the instructions.My bigest gripe is the drawings in the appendix. They used brown lines on tan paper with brown stipple. This makes them so hard to read they are almost useless. The full uselessness is rendered by the appendex drawings being incomplete and poorly ordered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Young Flav is the Bomb Representing the Westside","review":"If you are a fan of Westside rap you must have this CD. All the songs on this album are great but my favorites are I Dream, Catch Me if You Can, Murder Mob, I Keeps it Comin, Rules of the Game and Money 2 B Made. So if you don't have this CD I suggest you go and cop it, you don't know what your missing. This CD is old but it is tight with some tight beats and believe me you will be bumpin this CD all the time because I know I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings the Civil War Home","review":"Wow! Another book that tells of the dread and horrors that the Civil War brought to the civilians, and it is done as perfectly as one could ever hope. It is written in a lively manner and was very hard to put down. Based totally on facts, using diary and journal accounts, the writer brings the reader right in to the middle of the Maryland conflict, from the trepidation the citizens felt weeks before the battle at Sharpsburg/Antietam as the Rebs entered their border state, through the battle itself, and finally how they dealt with the after affects of the worst one day battle ever fought on American soil.We here in the 21st century cannot fathom what our ancestors went through - what they felt...the aptly titled \\"Too Afraid to Cry\\" will give the reader at least a tiny idea of what life was like for the folks living in Maryland in the early Fall of 1862.Wow is right!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun movie for the entire family!","review":"I was skeptical about watching Adam Carolla as the leading man but this was a great movie. It was not only a good date movie but probably fun for viewers of any age. Disregard the \\"R\\" rating because there's nothing about it that really deserves this. The movie has plenty of humor mixed with romance and a story that is very real and something you can relate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid little movie","review":"I'm an Adam Carolla fan, so I bought this movie and his book as my way of paying him back for all of the free entertainment his podcast provides me. The movie is solid and is actually decent for watching with your lady. There's enough guy stuff and romance stuff to keep you both interested. I still think it's funny how Adam just employs his friends to be in all of his stuff, considering none of them are actors or comedians.The movie is semi-autobiographical in a way, since Adam's character is a construction worker and boxing instructor while living in the San Fernando Valley, much like Adam's life was as a young adult.Anyway, I recommend this movie to anyone that's a fan of Adam or any guy just looking for a fun flick to watch at home with the wife or girlfriend."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprisingly sweet and expectedly funny!","review":"Adam Carolla isn't for everyone, but I am a big fan of his podcast. I would NEVER have expected him to see him as the romantic lead in a very heartwarming (and very funny) movie. I know he wrote it and it's based loosely on his life, but what I was very pleasantly surprised by was his acting. He has a very casual charm, but his acerbic wit that I have come to love is very present. This movie isn't breaking any new ground, but it's a very well done underdog story with rom-com elements. I really recommend it, especially to people who already admire Adam's humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutly Brilliant","review":"Adam Carolla is hilarious. I saw this in theaters, and then five more time the first week it arrived. I show it to everyone I know. Simply put this movie is amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not What You Expect","review":"The Hammer is a fun comedic love story. It has what you expect from Carolla - a quick wit with smart, slightly chauvinistic humor. But it also has what you don't expect from him - a heartwarming story of love and loss and love again. It's a great date movie with something for everyone! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"rating":"2","title":"not a manshow fan","review":"I watched about as much manshow as did sopranos; less than 10 min of all seasons combined. I liked dr drew on sextalk more than the other guy. I saw about 10 minutes of this movie on a movie channel and I had to buy it. I'm sure glad I did. This was funny! I don't profess to know about comic-bookey or lighting or any of the other ploys reviewers like to use to describe movies. I had no preconceived notions about adam carolla prior to this viewing, he did not let me down. I'm the kind of person who can watch the same movie 3 days in a week. Like wedding daze or count of monte cristo. So this movie was spot on for me. One of my favorite scenes was them driving back in the van and getting pulled over. The humor was sharp and witty, just the way I like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The postive results are legit this is a good movie","review":"I listen to Carolla on the radio every day and every guest compliments Adam on the Hammer. My first thought was they were a bunch of kiss ups and there was no way this unknown movie could be any good. Well my curiosity got the best of me and I bought the movie.First the movie is low budget, but comes across as well produced independent. The movie appears to be shot on location at several areas and was well done. The acting was somewhat cheesey but Carolla is not a movie star and held his own.The plot has been mentioned in every review and nothing to add. The movie is about a down and out carpenter who gets a chance to realize his dreams and change his life around. It is a feel good movie and worth your time and money. The guests were telling the truth the Hammer is a good movie, lets hope Mr. Carolla has an opportunity to do another movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I hoped","review":"I'm a HUGE fan of Adam Carolla.There are some laughs but I found myself rolling my eyes at a few parts.The whole fight scene with the old boss towards the end- so cheesy!Or the date montage(s) with the new love interest...ugh, extra cheesy!The movie isn't awful. It's a great story about someone taking a risk and going after what they want.It just has some cheesy roll your eyes moments.I thought the ending was cute but I wouldn't recommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Disappointing.","review":"I love Adam Carolla and listen to his podcast daily. So I don't feel bad about buying this and putting it in the Adam Carolla fund. But I did not like this movie at all. Besides Jane Lynch. She's hilarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reg","review":"I loved this movie! Great humor, great story, & should not be rated R. If you watch this movie you will like it! There is humor for men and women. A love story and boxing! What else do you need!

Everything in this movie feels \\"true\\". The love story develops in a very realistic manner, and so does the Boxing plotline.PLEASE NOTE: there is absolutely NO reason for it to be slapped with an \\"R\\" rating. The F-word is said 2 or 3 times but, other than that... it's a wholesome film. There's no blood... no sex... no drugs.Bravo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film","review":"Great movie all around! whether you're on a date or just sitting wanting to watch something funny, you will be impressed with this movie. worth owning for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Adam Carolla","review":"I thought it was one of the best movies i have seen. Adam Carolla is great actor as well a great comedian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie for couples","review":"So here comes a little movie from the guy who used to host \\"The Man Show,\\" and is now one of the hottest morning show personalities on the west coast. This movie was much better than I had expected, and I'm a self described fan of Adam Carolla's work. This is a movie that is filled with heart and comedy. A surprisingly engaging romance along with some laugh out loud moments make this one movie that will leave you smiling from start to finish. I recommend it, if even for the fact of rewarding Carolla for taking a risk and creating something that can be genuinely enjoyable for guys and girls alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Adam, doubted the movie... then I loved it when I watched it","review":"Adam Carolla is my favorite radio personality. If you don't get his show on the radio in your home town, then go find a webcast or podcast of it. Its well worth checking out.This movie had me laughing all the way through. His attitude and comedic style rang right through his character just like it does on his show every morning. Thanks, Adam, for keeping it real.I'm ordering my own copy right now. I hope you finally made some money off of this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good movie.","review":"I thought the movie was good.

On a scale of 1-10, a solid 6."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Flick","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect despite hearing everyone on his radio show rave about the movie. But I think Adam is funny, so I gave it a try. Turns out I was not disappointed.His rants were enjoyable, the concepts for some of the jokes were really unique and some of the scenes were laugh-out-loud funny. Also, the boxing scenes were top notch. What really made the movie work was Adam's relationship with Ozzie. One can tell they are friends off-screen just by the way they interacted throughout the film.I want to give it five stars, but it's just not on par with movies like Usual Suspects, Godfather or Dark Knight."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hammer Is Great","review":"I'm a big Adam Carolla fan but I don't think that is at all a prerequisite to enjoy this movie. Everyone will love Ozzie, Carolla's real life construction worker buddy. The Hammer is an incredible feat considering this is Carolla's first foray into full on movie creation. A+ Ace Man!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hammer, drives it home.","review":"This movie The Hammer was hilarious! It was well made and the story was great.

Thanks Adam!"},{"rating":"2","title":"always a great movie","review":"This movie delivers laughs and a complete story in a neat little package. I couldn't find anything to complain about if I tried and it's refreshing to see a movie that is truly appropriate for the whole family (despite the unfounded R rating)."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprisingly funny","review":"and this was made by adam carolla? it is beyond belief that adam carolla was somehow involved with this project but actually co-wrote and starred as the main character in this movie. it's probably all lies to make him more appealing to the feminists but this is acually sweet and charming. so how is it that adam carolla is involved. i have a hard time believing it. the movies too good. too funny and too charming to be a carolla vehicle--they should have given this to rob schneider."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good story and snappy patter.","review":"One of the first lessons of writing is \\"Write what you know\\". Carolla does exactly that writing about a down on his luck carpenter and evening fitness boxing instructor who comes into his own later in life. Lack of self esteem seems to have kept him check till spotted by a local trainer noticing his \\"heavy left\\"...the hammer. Out of work and a girl friend he finds renewed inspiration in a student and a hope at making the Olympic team. Its not high art but the story is sweet and pacing is kept up with Carolla's jokes and lively patter. He is accompanied by a proud Nicaraguan named Ozzie...who, is mostly indecipherable throughout the film but steals scenes left and right. Its a sharp contrast that works Carolla's wit. It becomes a tad predictable in the end but it was well rounded and enjoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good \\"Date Night\\" movie","review":"\\"The Hammer\\" is a funny movie that only gets better as it goes along. This is a great \\"Date Night\\" dvd. It has strong comedy chops while carrying a humble love story plot line. Warm, funny and fuzzy. A good time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Few Laughs","review":"You like this guy or you don't. Few viewers will feel neutral.

Great movie by the way, Adam."},{"rating":"2","title":"A KNOCK OUT BOTH IN AND OUT OF THE RING!","review":"With a nice combination of sports and romance, 'The Hammer' is a film sure to please both men and women. Adam Corolla plays a 40 year old carpenter who could have been a contender. The story is simple Carolla plays a regular guy who doesn't apply himself and hasn't had much success financially or emotionally. He gets a second chance after his girlfriend leaves him and a boxing manager sees something in him.The film works because Carolla eases up on his usual attics and plays a very likable guy and the relationship between him and Juergensen is realistic. The film is way better than it should be and gets a boost from Carolla and the surrounding players in this inspirational and cute romance film. Hey Guys, the next time it's your turn to pick the movie surprise your sweetheart with this one! She'll like it as much as you will!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a fan of Adam, BUT","review":"I didn't think this movie was funny. I'm a daily Carolla podcast listener and am accustomed to his uncensored brand of humor. This movie seemed like a family movie and was way too safe and way too clean for my tastes. I have no idea why it's rated R. I got about 3/4 of the way through it before falling asleep, and then I threw it away. Sorry, Adam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as advertised","review":"Adam Corolla really hyped this movie during his appearance on the Bill Simmons podcast on ESPN.com. I also see that many reviewers seem to have loved this movie. But I don't really get it. I'm a big Corolla fan and some of his subtle/dry humour is hilarous during this movie, but overall this is a below-average (and unoriginal) Hollywood filem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype!","review":"I must admit, I fell for the hype. I liked Adam on Loveline and The Man Show, but his morning radio show is pretty lame, unless you like meandering drivel. I only listen during Mark and Brian commercials(and if Kevin and Bean also are at commercial). I decided to give the movie a try after repeatedly hearing him pat himself on the back about how good it was and how it didn't get any bad reviews. Well, I was highly disappointed to say the least. If you like predictable movies and bad acting, you'll love this movie! The only redeeming quality(and thus a second star for my review) is the leading lady, played by Heather Juergensen. She is very charming, but unfortunately, couldn't save the movie on her own. Please don't waste your time/money on this film, if only to dissuade Adam from acting in the future! He was on Tim Conway Jr's radio show again last night, and said all of the reviews on Amazon were glowing- he must not have checked recently!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PR Work at its finest","review":"There's a reason this movie bombed; it's just not that funny. Carolla is always good for a few chuckles but this movie is slow, poorly edited, and cliched as they come.I rented it based off The Sports Guy's podcast recommendation and it's one of the few times I've thought he plugged a sub-par item.It's certainly not the worst movie I've seen, the actors themselves do a pretty good job, but there is just too much for them to overcome to make this into even an average film."},{"rating":"1","title":"R U Kidding?","review":"Sorry, just not worth buying or renting. Wait for it on TV as there are so much more movies out there that is better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as I'd hoped it would be!","review":"In spite of its \\"sleeper\\" status, I had very high expectations for this film--having recently become a huge fan of Adam Carolla's radio show (podcast).

That's saying a lot, since most of our toy motos have broken handlebars the first week, and various other missing or broken parts soon after. The stand for reving worked, but was relegated to the back of the closet, so I can't say how durable that part is. The ramp was used all over the house by motos, monster trucks, and balls. I'll be buying another this year, this time for my 3 year old son."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good, doesn't go very well","review":"The bike makes it about a foot across the floor before falling over.

In what I take to be an effort to make Shakespeare accessible to audiences raised on Bruce Willis and Matt Damon, director Oliver Parker delivers something emotionally incoherent, clumsy, shallow, and crass. Branagh, Fishburne, and Jocob seem to inhabit different dramatic universes. I was unable to believe that their characters had any real connection with one another. This was particularly--and painfully--true of the scene in which Fishburne's Othello deflowers Jocob's Desdemona. Exciting bedroom games for some, I suppose, but for me it was Shakespeare made vapid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Utterly flawless - and completely unsettling.","review":"I just viewed Branaghs \\"Othello\\" and can offer no further discussion. I am rendered speechless."},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie gave a modernization to the original play.","review":"The movie gave me a better perception of the play Othello because it is visual. with books you have to imagine and figure out really what the person is thinking. In the movie the peoples expressions explain it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dont remember","review":"i watched this movie in my English class because we have finished reading the book. i dont remember the movie because i was half asleep while watching it. now we have to write a film review and i have no idea what to write! i hate reading Shakespeare because i have no idea what they're talking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly excellent","review":"For anyone with even the slightest appreciation of Shakespeare this movie is one to watch. The performances are strong without being overbearing. The emphasis always seems right and the flow is almost perfect. Fishburne surprised me as the Moor, his presence and sensitivity were just right. I had previously not given him credit for this much depth as an actor, but his interpretation is excellent. Branagh's tone is light and scheming and in essence the perfect Iago. Jacob's Desdemona was presented with such clarity that one might almost forget they were listening to old English. I had not expected a lot from this movie and came out feeling it to be the among the best screen adaptations of Shakespeare to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Branaugh's Othello Rocks","review":"Without losing the Elizabethean venacular, this version of Othello rocks. The actors have the Shakespearean language roll off their tongues as smoothly as if they were reciting \\"Old KIng Cole.\\" Perfect for a high school classroom if you can get away with the R-rated fantasy scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Othello","review":"Well created version of Shakespeare's work. Many scenes envoked much detestation for the villain whose treacherous plot to hurt others out of jealously and spitefullness...what a tragedy! All in all I enjoyed the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a black Moor...Mr. William would have been pleased","review":"For his directorial debut Oliver Parker has chosen a great cast: the always incredible Laurence Fishburn as Othello, and the famous Shakespearean \\"maniac\\" Kenneth Branagh as Iago. Like Laurence Olivier, Branagh is another talanted actor, whose name is forever linked to the name of William Shakespeare in the movie industry. However, it's Fishburn who truly carries the film on his shoulders. His portrayal of Othello, with all that mixture of love and hate, devotion and betrayal, passion and intense jealousy, growing slowly into paranoia, makes a deep impression and a strong understanding of who Othello truly was. A very good interpretation of the Shakespearean classic standing in a row with Olivier's, Welles' and Bondarchuk's Othellos with one very major plus - finally a black Othello..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go with another version","review":"This is one of the worst adaptations of Shakespeare yet done for the big screen. The script is completely butchered and the direction is more reminiscent of an MTV video than of Shakespeare. Irene Jacob can't really speak english all that well, so the performance is completely lost, and Brannagh gets just a little too full of himslef. Try another version. Please. The Bard was never meant to look this bad. Especially not for one of his greatest works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Required","review":"This was suggested to me for my English class to help me with my writing piece but I didn't like this story anymore then I enjoyed the play.

When I tried to play it, my player said it wasn't the right region. I cannot even return it because the slip the buyer usually includes explaining how to go about returning an item was missing. I'm sorry to have to write this because I've bought many items through Amazon and had always been satisfied till now. Still, if this can help any other buyer from going through an experience such as mine, I feel it would be remissness on my part not to do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Version...","review":"I have seen three other Othello movies and this is my personal favorite. From the way he looks and speaks one would not think Iago is the villain in the story. Laurence Fishburne did a good job portraying Othello and will leave one feeling almost sympathetic to his demise. Overall, it was a good movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great adaptation","review":"Great plot, language, and acting. I had not expected to be drawn into a story that was written nearly 400 years ago, a language that sounds foreign to our ears today, and an ending I knew. The acting was superb, and it's a good introduction to Shakespeare's tragedies - no substitute for reading it yourself though. Had a few technical issues with the quality of the instant streaming, but Amazon took care of that. Another movie I have watched since was fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Signature Branagh","review":"The film should have been renamed \\"Iago\\" instead of Othello, because it's yet another ego-vehicle for Kenneth Branagh. He overshadows the main character, played by Laurence Fishburne. The film itself is gorgeously shot and very sexual, but it definitely has a modern feel to it. The cover makes it look like interracial softcore porn. It was probably intended to be a serious movie, but certain costume inaccuracies are just too obvious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not play = one star for seller - but 4star movie, if you can view it!","review":"DVD would not play at all, but since I opened the package to find this out I can't get a refund. So don't buy from this seller!The movie itself, however, is fabulous! Kenneth Branaugh is a believably evil Iago. And Lawrence Fishburn shines as a strong Othello wracked by jealousy for his beloved Desdemona.UPDATE:Since purchasing, the seller has updated with region playing information with specific mention that it doesn't play in the US. Hopefully no one else makes my mistake and wastes their money. Teachers don't make enough as it is and to waste by \\"trickery\\" is inexcusable.

It was a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty, well researched, with a sparkling main protagonist.","review":"\\"Virgin Territory\\" succeeds on several levels - the heroine Claudia (first met in \\"I, Claudia\\") is a realistic, feisty and nicely rounded (in more ways than one!) character with the foibles and attitudes typical of her time. Marilyn Todd manages to make her other characters stand out as individuals also, even the walk-on parts. The murder mystery is both intrigueing but not too obscure (something which always irritates me). The research into the period is obviously intense but used to create atmosphere and a solid backdrop, and isn't allowed to overwhelm the story. A welcome addition to Lindsey Davis and Janet Evanovich for amusing, clever crime fiction on my bookcase."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment.","review":"This book teaches almost nothing about sound processing. The writing style is bad, actually this is a monolog of a DSP expert showing off what he knows. There's no one subject that he explains well. He assumes that the reader has technical knowledge in many subjects that are outside the scope of the book. for example, in one section were he describes quadrature sampling, he just throws that it's better then using wavelets. Wavelets are not explain anywhere in the book though... The book is filled with senteces like the above. Even worse, most of the time the autor talks about programming for windows, MFC, code optimizations and GUI - Subjects not very related to Audio DSP. The author seems to be a very talented guy, but he doesn't know how to write books. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"amateur book writing skills and bad programming skills","review":"Well I was expecting something a little more professional. His knowledge of the DSP world is not in debate, but his communication skills defintely are. This is not really a techincal manual, this is an 'author-having-a-converstation-about-dsp' type book. He just talks about DSP in his own words and throws out over-generalized, under-explained concepts of DSP with slight regard to audio processing, with very few real models or examples.And for you programmers like myself, his code is almost UNREADABLE! His tab formatting is worthy of a true amateur hack. Don't expect to be able to use his code intelligently without a lot of reorganizing.The book does have some redeaming qualities. Some of his explanations do manage to intrigue and delight you. However, overall I'm dissapointed, as this book was marketed more as a Programmer's bible to dsp, but there is nearly no programming examples or ideas even in the book. Just talk..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much content","review":"By reading the books description, it seemed to be exactly what I needed. However, it fails to deliver much of what was expected. The author provides very little explanation into any theory and says \\"just try out the software and see for yourself.\\" The author says himself many times, \\"the source code it way clearer than anything I can explain.\\" There is practically no source code in the book itself, just on the CD. And the author does not explain any of it. Overall, I was very unsatisfied with the book. After reading it I felt I had no better understanding of the subject than before I bought the book. The author relies on his example program in the CD for you to figure out everything. If I wanted to do that, I'd download an example program from the internet with source code."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Hype","review":"I do not believe that this is a very good book for programmers who are wishing to learn DSP. I'm sure this book is of value to a particular audience. Unfortunately, I'm not in that group. Here's my advice: if you want an explanation of how and why different audio effects function the way they do, if you want a general understanding to different DSP principles, or/and if you plan on writing your own code and need some type of direction, like a few brief examples (well-commented & an explanation of the source code), then DON'T BY THIS BOOK! As I began to look elsewhere to find the information I was looking for, I realized that this author failed to explain the topics. The source code was not even useful because there was not much of an explanation behind the work. Too much hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast Buck","review":"I was very excited about this book until I read it. It presses all the right buttons up front, but the actual content doesn't deliver. He claims to explain DSP concepts in understandable English, but every explanation is less than one page and laced with jargon like 'passband'. Even worse, he explained the one concept I was familiar with and got it WRONG! (Nyquist's limit is optimistic, but he thinks it's the highest sampling rate you'd need for a given frequency.)There were more typos and awkward sentences than usual, the guy never shuts up about how old-school and experienced he is, he uses 'affect' when he probably means 'effect', and he pads out the book with Windows programming tips and an introduction to efficient PC code.Overall, it seems like an experienced consultant with very high self-esteem trying to make a few extra bucks on the side. Please make a quality product next time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Could be just what you're looking for","review":"If you have a good basic understanding of sound and C++ programming, and a desire to put the two together, you may have experienced some difficulty in finding material to help you do it. If you know what I'm talking about, then this book may be exactly what you're looking for. Not only do you get good \\"plain English\\" introductions to advanced DSP subjects, but for the fidgety programmer who can't be happy just reading about it, a CD full of ready-to-run code awaits your experimentation. Not just buggy examples either, but a full-blown app written in Visual C++ 6.0 that you can examine, modify, and use as a platform to get your own ideas up and running quickly. As if that weren't enough, the author includes his own thoughts on how and where to learn more, including excellent recommendations for further reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"Many have already said it well - this book is a waste. Like many others I was hopeful that there would be something of value so I spent the money and what I received is an exercise in ego from someone who offers little of substance. The code is horrible. There aren't many books in this area unfortunately but unless you have money to burn it's better spent elsewhere. Nothing to see here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes, bugs galore, no math","review":"Sorry,I really wanted to like this book, since I've had a horrible experience writing code to handle audio on a PC (.wav files, audio sampling are much messier and less intuitive than need be). I AM an expert at DSP, having done it for over 25 years, with many hardware/firmware designs under my belt. I would not have slammed this book for one simple reason. The code examples are buggy and crash. Yikes, the fellow rails on Microsoft and the low quality of their compilers. His code does not work.Sorry, I tried, I really did, but this book mostly text describing C++ classes which are on the CD. Unless you have a lot of time on your hands - just get a decent DSP book (Antoniou, oppenheim). Try Embree or Rorabaugh if you want books with DSP code in them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look Before Leaping","review":"I was enticed by the title and bought the book without first looking at it--a fifty-five dollar mistake! Doug Coulter probably knows digital audio processing. If you already know the subject, you probably won't want the book. If you're trying to learn the subject, you probably won't learn much of it here. Doug writes in the rambling chatty style of an old hand, but with many non-instructive, \\"It turns out that . . .\\" statements. If you are interested learning programming for audio processing in C++ for Windows, you may find the example code in the accompanying CD useful. The entire Help file of WavEd sums up the quality of the CD offerings: \\"This app written by kids.

After I read the reviews, I decided to use the two sided tape on the wings. The wings didn't fall off. Nevertheless, the plane flew very short and dived every time for no reason. The remote control is defective because when I went to use full throttle, the engines cut off. I'm glad I tested this before first flight. The first crash damaged the front of the plane.

Lois' mouth moves to Clark Kent's voice in many scenes. There is no excuse for such sloppiness. Everyone involved with this should be ashamed of themselves. They have completely disrespected these cartoons. How could they release this with such obvious flaws? It's just ignorant. Do not buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid the Blu-Ray!","review":"This release looks like it should be a 2-4 dollar DVD sold at a pharmacy or supermarket, not a 29 dollar blu-ray release. I've paid more for this than I have for some Criterion releases, and while I appreciate the booklet it comes with, the discs themselves look so bad I almost returned it. This is clearly an upscale from a dollar store DVD. Not to mention each short has a logo for some company at the bottom.

This is one of the worst looking Blu-rays yet released, jagged lines and all. BEyond description. The distributor used to call itself GoodTimes and under that moniker would on occasion put out something watchable. This isn't one of them.

I remember seeing some of these on television at that time, but really didn't remember the individual shows. A few years ago I purchased a set of these, and until I saw this set listed I didn't know there were seven more episodes I didn't have. I bought this set and it's great! All seventeen episodes of the very first film version of Superman, finely restored and looking and sounding as good as I could ask for!If you're a Superman fan this is the set to get!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Animation Is Awesome","review":"Seeing that these cartoons were done over 60 yrs. ago, the animation is superb!! I was floored by the richness of color and the fluidity of the movement of the characters. Just mesmerizing! Not to mention, the actual plots of the episodes were great! I suspect that the animators for Batman The Animated Series (BTAS) probably studied these classic Superman clips quite a bit before doing any sketches for BTAS.This is a must-own for any serious Superman fans and for action adventure cartoon collectors! I highly recommend it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Blu-Ray is AWFUL!!!","review":"UGH! AWFUL! JUST PLAIN AWFUL! Company's logo never leaves the lower right hand corner (obnoxious). Terrible transfer (unless you like your blu-rays full of scan lines). And THE AUDIO IS OUT OF SYNC! By, like, several seconds! At times, Clark was talking but Lois' voice was heard. Hey, not too creepy....Which is all too bad, because the booklet that comes with it is pretty nifty. But that's the only nice thing I can say. I mean, even the cover looks like a bad Photoshop scan.Too bad this is the only blu-ray edition on the market. Hopefully, another company will do it right for blu-ray"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not from Warner Bros.!","review":"CAREFUL BUYING THIS...IT'S NOT FROM WARNER BROS.!Years ago a company named Winstar released digitally restored (their words) these cartoons. They were public domain cartoons and they did the best they could with what they had...garbage in, garbage outThen Bosco put out these cartoons thru Image (Diamond Anniversary)and they were the best prints up to that date. When the standard definition Superman Motion Picture Anthology came out, WB included these cartoons, taken from their original vault prints and they looked fabulous, the Diamond Anniversary couldn't even compare!When the blu-ray of the Superman Motion Picture Collection came out, these cartoons were included, but only in standard definition. Everyone was hoping for HD, but upscaled to 1080i, they still look great.So, now this company has taken the exact same dvd from Winstar and are trying to say they are now in BD. For all we know, they're probably upscaled to 1080i! Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible blu-ray!!","review":"I purchased this item, couldnt wait to watch it, and then, here! Everything is upscaled, which didnt make me happy at all! Then, I watched it later on, and some episodes have the mouths moving after they say a line! That really p**sed me off! The worst thing is that the only thing in HD is the menu, and the Warning! The Gaiam ads are upscaled too! And when you watch the Superman blu-ray, there is a Gaiam logo on the bottom!! I thought those people who reviewed were crazy, but unfortunately, I was wrong! Avoid this blu-ray if you know whats good for ya!! When you read the side, it actually says \\"2-disc DVD set\\". I repeat \\"DVD\\"!***UPDATE***This set was so horrible, I gave this set to a video store that takes used home videos. Maybe YOU should do that to your set, or just throw it away!

The attention and understanding to detail, shadowing, color, and story are truly amazing. I won't get into details about specific episodes, as others have already done so, but I am glad that I bought this DVD, as it was worth every penny. To call these 'cartoons' seems to trivialize how good these shorts really are.

But there's been no other better collection of these toon's to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible item. Buyer beware!","review":"I wish I had read other reviews before I jumped to buy this. I think many of the positive ones are for the shorts themselves or other previous editions of this item.I was very much looking forward to this, having had the original cartoons on VHS and DVD for many years. Since these shorts are public domain, anyone can release them and this new Blu-Ray edition proofs just that. First of all, each frame has a logo imbedded on the corner which is unacceptable. Second, this is not Blu-Ray quality image! It is full of artifacts and pixelized. It is just a blown up version of a smaller digitized edition of these cartoons. They clearly did not work directly from the original sources. And thirdly the sound is out of sinc. In other words, a worthless item. I returned it and I hope that someone will eventually make a decent version of these classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not acceptable!","review":"This will be to the point:Sound is out of sync.Company logo is distracting.Dust and imperfections are still present, so the presentation is not pristine, as described.I recommend the same 17 episodes found on the Warner Brothers DVD set for better quality and price."},{"rating":"1","title":"This release is KRYPTONITE!","review":"If you're a purist of the Superman lore, then avoid this \\"Blu Ray\\" release at all costs. I put Blu Ray in quotes, because it didn't seem like a Blu Ray at all. The quality is horrible. There is t a ton of pixillation and artifacts in the print. The lines are all jagged and it's compressed looking. What a waste of good money! And the greatest insult of all, the ever-present and ridiculous Gaiam watermark in the lower right hand corner. I watched one episode and threw this in the garbage. Avoid it, avoid it, avoid it. If you want, watch the prints on the WB released Superman Blu Ray set. They're not digitally remastered (they still have a lot of film artifacts in the prints) but at least they're crisp and are devoid of the stupid Gaiam watermark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh, what?","review":"Too much drama for me. I figured a Jamie Foxx movie is always an entertainig one, but this time...I did not think so. Bacame too boring fast for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story; could use some better writing and directing","review":"This was a pretty good true story of a journalist who befriends a mentally ill but musically brilliant homeless man in the streets of Los Angeles. The scenes of the homeless community are truly harrowing. Also, Downey and Foxx give excellent performances.I have not read the book so I am not going to attempt a comparison.I did find the writing and direction to be lacking in some ways. The flashbacks are abrupt and jarring; the viewer has to do a lot of filling in the blanks; the scenes showing Nathaniel's episodes of auditory hallucinations are somewhat overdone. We don't even find out until the ending credits that he can play a lot more than one or two instruments.That said, this is an interesting look at a complex man and a powerful and unlikely friendship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Movie, If you can watch it...","review":"I did enjoy this movie. The reason that I give it 2 stars is because of the generally retarded decision of Universal Studios/Dreamworks to copy-protect the DVD. The result of the copy protection is that the movie doesn't play on Macintosh computers. It plays fine on my Vista PC (though I now wonder if it has a Sony-style rootkit on it), but my three macs with DVD drives spit it out after trying to read the disc for a few minutes. It's difficult to say what content-protection scheme is used on the DVD -- it may just be a 'taking the DVD format to the limits' style protection, or it could be a rootkit-just-got-installed-on-my-PC protection mechanism.Remember Universal/Dreamworks, when you implement content protection on your movies, you don't hurt pirates. They're going to find a way to steal your work no matter what. The only people that you hurt are your paying customers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soloist","review":"This is a great movie and I loved it. I would recommend this to anyone who has seen a struggle with mental problems and it sure gives an overview of the homeless situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"Not as good as I had expected being that both Robert Downey Jr and Jamie Foxx were the primary actors in this movie. Jamie Foxx wasn't very believable in his role. Robert Downey Jr. did a fine job in his role but the movie just wasn't all that great in my opinion. This is the type of movie you would only watch once and not want to see again. Once is enough for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Soloist","review":"The DVD wouldn't play at all?

Jamie Foxx is not a good actor. Jamie Foxx can do a Ray Charles impersonation. We have seen this storyline over and over and over. I had heard that this movie was really good and that the acting was very good. I have to say that watching it was like watching paint dry. They could have cut off 30 minutes and it would have made it better but it still would have been boring and it still would have sucked. Downey who is usually solid was boring. Katherine Keener had little to do that meant anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"with message","review":"Film with some kind of message interests me a lot. The soloist is that kind of film with friendship and tenderness of a newspaper writer that never could imagine how much involved he will be with the excellent violinist thatmake on him like a God.The scenes from Los Angeles homeless are very real and very sad. Never could imagine that L.A. was the most homeless city in USA. What a pity and what could be do for them..............."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Soloist","review":"The film is a satisfying adult drama that doesn't lose it's direction. It doesn't pander to it's audience. There is no random violence, no guns, but indeed simply good story telling with great characterizations. It's a decent film that deserves better treatment in the press. It has a noble heart that succeeds in telling a great human story.It resonates and strikes a chord.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JQIRTO/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring, but long","review":"I love the message of this movie, where a journalist from the LA Times runs into a Julliard washout with mental problems but is still a brilliant musician. The movie isn't so much about the music, but the friendship between the journalist (played by Robert Downey, Jr) and the musician (played by Jamie Foxx). Both of these men put on AMAZING performances. But the movie itself seemed to drag on and on (and on and on) at times and I really felt as though the movie could have been abridged to increase the pacing."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting study of an unlikely friendship","review":"A deep-set drama that deals with homelessness, poverty, mental illness, but manages to be hopeful about friendship and the power of music to transform our lives. This film doesn't have a happy Hollywood ending but, perhaps, it also doesn't have an entirely depressing ending either. Robert Downey Jr. is his usual blend of fantastic - comedic and tragic simultaneously, whereas Jaime Foxx is entirely convincing as a schizophrenic musician playing Beethoven on the streets of Los Angeles."},{"rating":"2","title":"fine performances and very realistic","review":"Having watched someone go through a similar process as Nathaniel Ayers, I found this movie both realistic and moving. The performances by both Foxx and Downey are mature and engaging, and the vision of L.A.'s homeless is eye-opening.

One would think a rebuilder would install quality bearings in a unit with known problems and not the cheapest bearings available. I could replace this under warrenty but would just get another piece of junk in return. Most alternators use the same size 6303 front bearing,only the quality varies.Rebuilds have been well known for poor quality for decades. I should have known better.

Now this is Bob Wills/swing at it's best! Everybody on this album sings their butt off and of course the Wheel's band is just the best around, bar none. I've seen them many times and Jason Roberts, who also plays fiddle/mandolin with the Wheel just nails it on The End of the Line. Ray Benson has the very best musicians in the country in his band, and young Roberts is THE most talented young man to come along in many moons. I highly recommend this new CD to anybody who loves great music, and it is better than any 5 stars that I've ever heard! Keep bringin'it to us....Ray Benson and Asleep at the Wheel.

True that the album is \\"Texas swing,\\" but it is a lot closer to country music than what is pouring out of Nashville these days. While I am not a prude, it is nice to listen to music that does not pound away at sexual and alcohol themes. \\"Faded Love\\" with Shawn Colvin and Lyle Lovett is my special favorite--Colvin's voice is as good as it gets.

He learns how he can live without even basic necessities (giving up books is harder than giving up food) so that his torturers cannot use these privileges against him. Samson shows us when he \\"fails\\" himself and when he triumphs.To think that a citizen of a Western country can be abandoned by his country in order to keep good relations is an outrage that needs to be corrected.

Tunes I liked best were the inventive \\"Oedipus Tyrannus Overdrive\\", \\"Edinburgh Castle\\", the ten-minute \\"Cool Breeze Of Brighton\\" and their version of \\"House Of The Rising Sun\\" (I've heard other bands play this gem better) but Tangerine Dream did a decent job.

Great look into some of the thoughts of a German sharpshooter. Still a little confused as to the authenticity of this book; yes it states that the story was taken from Allerberger's wartime scribblings but sometimes things seem first-person and other times not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to put down","review":"I didn't get much done once I started reading this book. I highly recommend it. In response to the people picking it apart, read the prologue. The author specifically says he had to fill in a lot of the gaps as memories degrade over time. I'm sure the interviews were very specific as to the horrible things witnessed during the war but vague as to where units went at which time.One thing is for sure....sniping hasn't changed a lot, except the distances have grown as the equipment has risen to the task. There are many lessons in here for the modern military sniper. I'm sure Herr Allerberger and Carlos Hathcock could have swapped many war stories.Fantastic read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"This book is about the life of Sepp Allerberger, a highly decorated German sniper, as he fights the Russians on the Eastern Front. He gives a first hand account of the brutal fighting, as well as some of the atrocities committed by the Russians. The book also puts his story in a historical perspective, often telling the big picture that surrounded Sepp and his unit. This was written for the average reader, but some of the graphic accounts of torture may be a little to much for some. All in all, it was a good book and must read for anyone interested in sniper warfare."},{"rating":"2","title":"The road less traveled","review":"Seeing from the German point of view is not popular since it was not the winning side. Still this book covers the progress of learning the fieldcraft that is a sniper's stock and trade. This man learned the hard way what is now commonly taught at sniper courses. I thought it humorous that he finally was sent to sniper school after he had spent some time as a sniper. The explosive rounds issued to the Russian snipers was new info for me. This book is the translated version, apparently different from the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sniper on the Eastern Front","review":"Very good book, I highly recommend for military buffs.

The story is good (although other reviewers question its originality) but the way it is written is overblown and sloppy.I have finished this book. This is a confection, a lie. It does seems to be a collection of horror stories from the Eastern Front. Wish I could de-rate this book further. Do not waste you money on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique viewpoint.","review":"This a viewpoint on WW2 that is fascinating because we have heard so little of it. He brings up points and issues that western citizens are generally uninformed about."},{"rating":"1","title":"I read it and threw it in the trash!","review":"I am very well read on the Eastern Front and found this book to be horrible. I would like to save you the time and your money and steer you clear of this awful book. The plot line was plodding and repetitive (e.g. retreats and encirclements, again and again) and the weak details in the art and practice of sniper warfare relegates it to a mediocre military story at best. Most distressing, there are numerous gratuitous descriptions of the torture of soldiers and civilians that does not add to the story. In fact, I believe that I recognize several of them to be recycled from other sources. Also, these examples appear lop-sided and seemingly provided to excuse German actions in this theater in which both sides created and endured barbaric conditions."},{"rating":"1","title":"is this for real?","review":"Very disapointed with this book - I thought it would be a decent autobiography of a man who had spent time as a sniper on the Eastern Front. Instead it's a sloppy narrative with little detail and a lot of pointless natter. If the author was on the Eastern Front (and I have my doubts that he actually was) then he should have written this 40 years ago when it was still fresh in his mind. There are much better books on this subject out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissapointment","review":"This book was a bit of a dissapointment really. I love to read first-hand accounts of people who lived throught WWII, but this book is not first-hand, but second hand. So somebody else tells the story of Sepp Allerberger, and I think the writer fails in really catching your interest. I must admit that after 80 pages I've had enough and I stopped reading. Would Sepp A. have written this book himself, I think I would have finished it. Now it fails to capture my imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"none of the better WW2 memoirs","review":"I have read some memoirs of the 2nd WW from a German standpoint and this was not one of the better. Although very fascinating at times it was also oddly detached and some of the stories about his sniping seemed \\"made up\\". It sometimes read as a fiction novel where he was alittle too much superman to be belivable.I also found it very strange that he very seldomly refered to other members in the squad, i do recognise that sniping surely is lonesome work but still, it was like nobody left an impression or if he held back with intent.Another thing that is getting tiresome is that is always the russians that are the bad guys doing grizzly things, but he didnt stand for a minute to think what his own country had got himself involved in.Still a good read but these factors didnt allowed me to be gripped by the story as other memoirs have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very graphic and the true horror of war","review":"A great book that any WWII reader will enjoy. Just when I think I know almost all that happened a book like this comes along. You will not regret buying it. A little like THE FORGOTTEN SOLDIER.Rob"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sniper on the Eastern Front: The Memoirs of Sepp Allerberger, Knight's Cross","review":"Rubbish. This account supposedly true is \\"war porn\\" at it's worst. Gratuitous in it's descriptions of the death and depravity of the fighting on the Eastern Front and in the style of 10cent Western. One had to wonder if this story is actually true. A description of the sniper shooting Russian T34 tanks through the \\"petrol\\" tanks and causing an explosion capable of disabling the tank is hard to swallow considering T34 tanks run on diesel, which is notoriously hard to ignite. I'm a fan of good war history, but this one is not good and of dubious history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"I almost didn't buy this book because of the price. However, after reading it I think it was well worth the money. Being a memoir, the book presents Allerberger's development as a sniper and his service with the German army until the collapse of the Wermacht entirely from the first person viewpoint. For the most part, the author tells his story in a plain, factual manner, skipping any moralization or justification of the politics involved. The facts of Allerberger's service record need no embellishment, and the book doesn't try to glamorize the role of the sniper, or provide any drama - the story doesn't need it. It is a gritty, no-holds-barred depiction of his daily life and the various situations where his skills were employed on the Eastern Front. If the history of the sniper's craft, or WWII interests you, I would recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read for WWII","review":"This book shows how brutal the Eastern front really was. This book at times is very gruesome but very necessary to show how this war was fought and how brutal war can be. Definitely worth while to pick up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Advertised; Biography or Novel not Memoir","review":"The copy I received does not have Geoffrey Brooks' name anywhere about it, though I would guess he is the translator. The author is given as Albrech Wacker. In the prologue, the author says \\"After the passage of so many years it is inevitable that many of his memories had become blurred and that only his most traumatic experiences had remained crystal clear in his mind, and the biographer was left to join up these pieces of information and to sort them into a coherent and readable narrative.\\" In other words, the author does not even claim factual accuracy. He further indicates that 'Sepp Allerberger' is a pseudonym. This is silly, because as a winner of the Knight's Cross, the protagonist should be fairly easily identifiable to any enthusiast willing to do the shovel work, assuming 'Allerberger' was one actual person. Knowing what I do now, I would not have purchased this book, which I can only classify as a fairly good war novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best CD of Celtic Women Out There","review":"I own a few cds of Celtic music, and this is by far the best--it is not 'easy listening' like other, more instrumental stuff. Each song says something (even if it's in a language you do not actually speak) and you have to Listen, not put in for background music. It is not 'fusion' celtic-techno even if it is not exactly folklore. Each song carries with it a certain authenticity that is nonetheless tempered by the present... you gotta have it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Romeo is Bleeding","review":"Simply a great film, about cops and the underworld and love and loss very dark and quite on point. Too bad the dvd version omitted a few scenes from the screen version, but still well worth a watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"The film sort of bleed to death!","review":"I'm not sure what movie many of the others who reviewed this film saw. It's super violent and Lena Olin gives such a (sometimes laughable) \\"over-the-top\\" performance. It definitiely does not have the wit of say The Last Seduction. It's more like Fatal Attraction meets The Terminator (with heels, course)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pulp Movie in '90s","review":"Nice castings and great Girls that makes you snobically hard-boiled; which means the most dangerous villains vividly living in a just real town. Those screenplay by Hilary Henkin invites you into a day-dreams of the world of ordinary lives of ours. It doesn't seem like movies; just like a life of your own. How fine Lina Olin and Gery Oldman are performed their parts. I like this kind of unordinary usuality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Olin & Oldman Chemistry to Die For","review":"Ah what a guilty pleasure this film is. The pseudo crime-noir story Romeo is Bleeding is an excellent character study and a chance for multiple actors to chew scenery and develop some great chemistry. Gary Oldman once again plays a seedy, disheveled and dangerous cop [not quite as nasty as the Professional though, heh] turning in bad guys in protective custody to the tune of $65K a dime. A serial womanizer, with Juliette Lewis in tow playing out his fantasies, his world starts to unravel when he is tapped to narc on Russian hit-woman Lena Olin. Olin oozes as much venomous danger as sex appeal as she plays Oldman like a fiddle. Never knowing if her affections are true, or if he's going to get shot in the back of the head, Oldman stumbles around blindly as forces greater than he can imagine conspire against him. Violent but with a blistering black humour, this is a great, underrated film. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifting and Inspiring!","review":"Prior to reading this book, I knew little of Buddhism.

Roco ultimitely became my hero. But not only does Roco provide humor that children can enjoy, it also has many jokes that slip past kids and make the parents laugh to. Roco is a show that after a hard day you can sit down and watch and just relate to how his days go. And the troubles he has then you think that you aren't so bad off anyway.

He is marked for death; a target of one his arrogant and dimented compadre who immediately recognizes that Horatio's wit and intelligence can and will defeat him. We see how Horatio earns the respect of his peers and becomes their leader, takes calcualted risks, outsmarts his opponents and serves by duty and honor. This is the man every woman wants for a husband, son, or son-in-law. This is the man every man wants to be. While the story takes place a few hundred years ago, the emotions translate easily to modern times. It's an amazing treasure for all ages and genders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horblower & C.S Forrester the author of the script-wonderful","review":"This is a wonderful series. I bought the first boxed set as I know of the fellow from readng about him in all ten of CS Forresters books about him when I was in my teens. They capture it all so well on screen. It is a very true account of what life in the British Navy really was like then. Sheer excitement in this series so I give it five stars HOWEVER -Last week I ordered a further boxed set and two other DVDs (same series) and paid to Amazon the extra fee for \\"Rapid Shipment\\" only to be told that one lot will not arrive for seven weeks !!!!!! This is not good. I have written but received no reply. I live in Paris - France and ususally only wait a couple of days for small parcels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good feel for the books","review":"The Hornblower TV shows give a good feel for the atmosphere of the books and inspired me to go back and read one or two of them again. I particularly like the development of Sir Edward Pellew's patronage over young Hornblower.Although not present until the second set of movies (Mutiny & Retribution), the portayal of William Bush gave the character a substance that I could never entirely get from the books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hornblower, The Adventure Continues correction","review":"Greetings Hornblower fans, I inadverntently made an error on the televised times of the two newest episodes. The correct times (confirmed on A&E's web page) are as follows:Sunday, April 8th @ 7 p.m. central time the episode entitled Mutiny will air.The following Sunday, April 15th @ 7 p.m. central time, the episode titled Retribution will air.I apologize for the oversight."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Movies Were Great on TV","review":"I rabidly watched these four movies on TV, and though they sometimes lag, as with the episode shot entirely on land, they are a terrific rendidion of Forester's stories, with magnificent displays of sailing and of naval tactics. I recommend them heartily to anyone who loves sailing or stories from the days of the old British Navy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb period drama, great plots, sets and location shooting","review":"I first saw the Hornblower film on a flight back from Seattle without the sound and even then it was good! After having watched all 4 of these TV movies from these DVDs I'm of the opinion that this is the finest sea-based drama!There are 4 stories, and they're all enjoyable, there isn't a dud. We see Hornblower rise through the ranks and gain respect above and below deck. The best scene of the whole series has to be when they capture a French ship and sail it through a Spanish fleet in the fog.The quality of the DVD is top notch. Picture quality and sound are up to the standards you'd expect for a 1998 TV program costing 10M. The extras are brilliant: a making of documentary (there's a book too also available on amazon.com) and a whole special on English ships from that period. Worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great adaptation, if somewhat sanitized","review":"I heartily recommend this series to anyone who finds the period even slightly interesting. The acting and production values are absolutely top-notch. However, as watching this series made me read the books (it was that good!), I have to warn some lovers of the novels that a lot has been changed. But that said, I still feel that the series is true to the spirit of the books, and many of the changes have been made by combining several occurences in the book into larger, more significant events in the video. I think that the medium of TV demands this for dramatic and time-saving purposes, and like I said, it is mostly true in spirit to the books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite simply, television at its very best.","review":"The stories, the cast (especially Ioan Gruffudd and Robert Lindsay), the ships, the cinematography, the music, and everything else about this series is absolutely top-notch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks the punch and excitement of the Hornblower series.","review":"As a long-time Hornblower fan, I was very excited at the prospect of the A&E Hornblower series (especially after the exceptional A&E Pride and Prejudice), but I was very disappointed by this series.If you have read any of the Hornblower novels, you know they are fast paced and wonderfully exciting tales of war at sea. These films were anything but- what is a 20 page story in the book is drawn out to a boring 2 hours. They lack the excitement and action which makes the Hornblower series great.

I was afraid that the only Hornblower ever to be done was Gregory Peck's Captain Horatio Hornblower. If you think the videos are good, you should read the books.

Having seen the first tape , i was thankful that we had purchased the set because it is something you cannot get enough of . I only wish there were more .It shows clearly the times and the lives on board ships in those naval battles of long ago , they were real poeple with troubles of their own not just participants in old wars . Each actor in this series held up their part and character portrayals were excellent ,especially by Ioan Gruffudd as Hornblower , and Robert Lindsay as Captain Pellew .They brought out the essence of each character in all the subtleties of tone and varied expressions ,always leaving one feeling that there was much more below the surface .The scenes were also well put together ,with good juxtaposition in parts ,altogether i believe it to be well directed and executed ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done, I loved it.","review":"I think reviews are most effective if you compare the book or movie in question to others that most of us have read, so prospective readers have something to measure it against. Horatio Hornblower could be best described as a film of miltary action, suspense, and intrigue--with a theme of honor and courage winning the day, as in best-sellers like The Triumph and the Glory, Blue at the Mizzen, and Sharpe's Rifles. Historically accurate, Horatio Hornblower is a worthy film version of the great Forester novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD","review":"This is my frist Puffy CD and i like it alot. the songs are all catchy. my personal favorites are the Boogie Woogie Number 5, Violet, and Wild Girls on Circut. the songs are varied from upbeat to relaxed. an excllent J-Pop CD. i gotta get the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I really would love to see more artists and bands from other countires making a splash in the USA.

Satanic Abuse is a great subject for people like him because they can always say \\"Well there's never been any proof but only because of the HUGE cover-up\\" and this book is really just a fictional account of that. It plays on all the outlandish fears of Christians (and non Christians) and, in the end, we all learn a valuable lesson and should be so frightened that we don't think twice about trotting off and donating money to Larson's Ministry.

For example, the protagonist had things go to smoothly for him overall. (He kidnaps a woman from a hospital and no one stops him; he holds hostages at a radio station and no one arrests him.)

This novel (ghost written by one of his staff) takes satanic rutial abuse very seriously. The book is a quick read and kept my interest but the whole story felt very silly and impossible to take seriously. The heroes often behaved very irrationally, which is always annoying.

Did not enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"I have read other books about globalization, politics and philosophy but I have never enjoyed it as much as with this one. It's a wonderful love story that goes down like a good glass of wine and I actually picked up some useful information and great ideas on the way - DNA as the collective unconscious -what a great thought. The book really provides some optimism and faith, despite all the problems it deals with. I guess the message is this: it's all part of the process and we'll get there one way or another."},{"rating":"2","title":"The tipping point of society","review":"By superimposing the tipping point onto ways in which we consume, behave and indeed perceive reality, Reissmann takes Gladwell's mainly marketing-oriented notions to a whole new level and provides a platform for changing the way we work as a society and individuals. I don't know how realistic any of this is and he does not provide a great deal of actual evidence in the same way Gladwell does, but it is a creative way of viewing today's mass-media culture, which is somewhat reminiscent of Marshall McLuhan.Finally his thoughts on Lamarck and intelligent design could inject a much needed new perspective into an increasingly polarized debate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not great as a remix album, but super selection anyway","review":"What can you say about a compilation that includes streaks from a cross section of bands as psychedelic as Baaba Maal, Black Uhuru, Avatars of Dub and Gus Gus? That it's ambitious.The music here is neat, as almost anything from Thievery usually is, just that the title seems to promise some sort of remixing (\\"Reconstruction\\"?). In that sense the album fails miserably, I'd still pick K&D; anyday for spiffy remixes of tracks of all genres.Having said that though, this straightforward album gets my top marks for a decent selection of trip-hop grooves.

If anyone tries to tell you different, they're lying. A great compilation of Thievery remixes of other people, and is often the only way to find most of their earlier remixes these days (as many of the original singles are long out-of-print; the Gus Gus single being a great example). The reason these remixes are so great is that they don't try and turn the song into Thievery songs with guest vocals. They turn them into completely new songs that just sound great (perhaps like many other artists, they make remixes out of songs they have that just don't fit onto albums). I would also like to state that I think they should do another album of their remixes. Many of the ones that don't appear here are great (especially the ones of Luscious Jackson's \\"Nervous Breakthrough\\" and The Januaries' \\"The Girl's Insane\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good thievery mix - must have for any downtempo fan!!","review":"Thievery corp. has really made a name for themselves with their lines of cd's that are truly a wonderful journey in downtempo grooves everytime one sits down to listen to them.

The teacher is a Suisse lady and a gem, but the book is wholly inadequate even as a superficial introduction. The book proves that language is NEITHER fast nor fun. Only the present tense is introduced. The sunbjunctive and some idiomatic expressions are dropped into the text and then left unexplained. Worse yet, the vocabulary is designed for serious [i.e., fabulously rich] shoppers. You will learn such expressions in Frech as \\"a ring without a setting\\" and \\"pendent earrings\\" and how to get your watch fixed, but you will never carry on a simple conversation with a French speaking person.

The tapes are not always correlated with the text (not updated with the book's revision). The pitiful dictionary omits basic words but includes arcane menu items. The tapes' speakers garble the phrases and do not include enough short phrases reachable by positioning the tape. The illustrations (undecipherable cartoons) don't adequately identify the word.

His writing style is \\"reader friendly\\". I think the area where he particularly deserves compliments is the time he's taken to locate and personally interview the men still living or those family members of the now-deceased. For me, the conveyance of the first-hand experiences and recollections makes Kershaw's books more personal, aand I appreciate that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Story","review":"I couldn't stop reading this book. Alex Kershaw is an outstanding writer, and \\"The Longest Winter\\" is my favorite book written by him. This is a book that I've added to my collection of books on the Battle of the Bulge and would highly recommend it to others. I felt like I got to know the soldiers in the platoon and was there with them that December morning in 1944. Their sacrifice allowed the U.S. Army time to respond to the threat from the Germans' advance and now this book brings their story to a greater audience, allowing us to read about a platoon of heroes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Generation shines once again!","review":"As an avid reader of WWII history books this is one of the most engaging and interesting books I've ever read about the Battle of the Bulge. While the focus is on this group of men from a cross section of America and how they stalled a portion of the initial Nazi \\"Bulge\\" offensive the book also jumps to other areas of the Bulge front for important updates on the battle's progress and how it affects this group of men in various Stalag POW Camps close to their deaths. This book ranks as one of my favorites about WWII along with Flags of our Fathers by James Bradley, Stalingrad by Antony Beever and Band of Brothers by Stephen Ambrose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing............","review":"The Longest Winter maybe a worthwhile book in that it tells the story of some brave men that served their country honourably. The reality of the book is that this small units brief 24 hours of combat forces the author to focus mainly on their training and subsequent post-combat POW experience. The interspersed and unrelated episodes from Hitler's bunker, Malmedy, Skorzeny, and Kampfgruppe Peiper all seem like filler to pad out a book in desperate need of content. Really does the recounting of Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun's last hours have any bearing on this platoon's story?"},{"rating":"1","title":"unreadable, disjointed, terrible","review":"While backstory is interesting this book takes it to such extremes as to make the book unreadable. The tanks were coming which reminded Private Smith about a movie he saw in his home town in Ohio, where his friend Bill lived, and Bill once had a cat that got stuck in a tree, an elm tree..... Please, what about the tank battle?I'm a huge fan of WWII books but this one is awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, paper-thin story","review":"I'm afraid one must have the courage to set aside the praise of many reviewers for this book solely for patriotic reasons. While the accomplishments of this platoon may indeed be remarkable, this book isn't.Firstly, there are quite a few errors in the book, but these have been discovered by other readers as well, no need for repetition.I was also puzzled with the way the author presents the storyline. Narrative at one point, switching to thoughts on another and jumping to fabricated conversations/quotes account for an awkwardly confusing reading experience.on the content : Omitting the character descriptions only leaves a couple of pages describing the heroic acts of this platoon - a bit thin if you ask me. It's no match for Ambroses' book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an \\"action\\" book about WW2","review":"I just read halfway into this book (page 153) and realized that the rest of it is about life in prison camps in WW2. Prior to that, it is very interesting reading about the training, coming together, going to Europe and then the one day of actual combat. It was a very important day but only one day.

Little did I know that this would become one of my favorite bands ever!! Over the years I bought it again on cassette, LP and twice onCD when the remastered version came out. Those who like this CD will also love Masque which is as good if not better and also their debut CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great Kansas album","review":"Carry On is definately the song that will get most people to buy this album.But there are several other songs that are amazing as well. To me, Miracles Out of Nowhere is right up there with Carry On for their best track on this album. It's complex, yet has just the right amount of straighforward rock to pull it all together. The rest of the songs are alright, but nothing special.So go buy it if you really want to, or just get \\"Device, Voice, Drum.\\" A greatest hits live album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carry on my wayward Band","review":"Wow, Kansas, what a great band. I first heard the song, \\"Carry on my wayward son\\" in my car late at night driving my somewhat intoxicated friend home. I thought that I remembered it from somewhere else but im not sure. Kansas is great. So not too long after hearing the song, I went out and bought the album. I began to listen and it got better and better every time. Kansas combines the rock and roll sounds of the late 70's and early 80's along with an entirely different synthetic sound to produce incredible works of music. It's great. Unfortunately, while working on my stereo at boarding school, the cd was sitting on my dresser, and a flashlight dropped from my hands and cracked the cd. That is why I am here tonight writing this and buying the cd again. Yeah Kansas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Leftoverture\\" is an underrated rock classic.","review":"Kansas has never been given their due by the rock and roll establishment. This is one of the best rock albumns from the 70's. Listening to these recordings makes me realize how far rock has fallen. The musicians of the 90's have such little talent compared to the band members of Kansas. The lyrics and melodies are unlike anything you will find today. This recording is a must buy for anyone compiling a collection of great rock and roll recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"1976 Saw The Best Kansas Album Up To That Date !","review":"Kansas don't appear to be very know in the UK, well rock fans over here should start by buying Leftoverture.There's strong vocals, guitars, violin, sythesizers and some of the more thoughtful and spiritual lyrics to be found in this genre.Kerry Livgren writes 8 songs and co writes the other 3, the result is a release which brings rewards the more times it's played.Outstanding songs, the powerful Carry On Wayward Son, Miracles Out Of Nowhere and the moving Cheyenne Anthem.There are 2 excellent live songs, Carry On ... and Cheyenne ....It all comes remastered, I recommend it unreserveably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave It Be","review":"Kansas specializes in bland pop hard rock of the arena variety.

They are probably the only truly progressive rock band in American history, and a damn good one. They can stand with any of the great British progressive bands (and I love progressive rock). This album is definitely the one I dig the most. While Song for America and Point of No Return are excellent too, this one is the most consistent with not one bad track in the whole album. My 2 favorite songs are Miracles Out of Nowhere and Magnum Opus. I love the intricacy of both of them, especially the latter. From their debut through Monolith, they were putting out great album after great album. Their arrangements and songwriting was some of the best American rock ever produced. It's a shame that they splintered in the 1980's, and ended up in so many different incarnations. But we still have their 70's output to hold onto..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prog Metal","review":"This is one of the best prog metal albums of the 70's.

Being a golf book junkie, I feel like I am qualified to put in my two cents. For what it may be worth, this book, in my opinion, is the absolute best book that has ever been written in regard to helping golfers achieve success. Yes, there are other books that can technically explain various positions, etc, but this book by Dante gives you practical and easily understood instructions on improving/understanding the golf swing. Simply put, this book is the ONLY book I could unequivocally give a 5-star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally in the position to go after it","review":"I bought Dante's book after connecting in spirit with the other customers here who bought it, found it worked, and shared their views. I'd watch the pros on TV and was always intrigued by that great position at the top with the flat wrist and the first move down. Getting the whole thing from the dead start to the top is a process that has never been adequately conveyed to me and absorbed by me...until I read this book. The meticulous treatment of the first move with the early wrist break to the top is a masterpiece of instruction for the lost soul. Don't rush your time spent reading and practicing Move Uno. Once you feel that sensation of owning your grip on the club with the hands set solid and perfectly at the top of your coil, you're about ready to trust Dante with your firstborn.

Mr. Dante explains in concise detail why traditional golf instruction/tips are faulty in that they rely on a fundamentally incorrect perception of what is going on in the swing. He further lays out the correct way of swinging a golf club that is shockingly clear, with appropriate and easy check points. Proof is in the pudding, after years of just flailing around with little or no improvement, (and hundreds of dollars spent for \\"golf\\" lessons.)

The picture quality and sound are poorer than what you'd expect from VHS, let alone DVD. The music seemed irrelevant.But all this I could easily forgive if it told the story well.

After the can was punctured the valve would not allow refrigerant to flow. I could fool with it and SOMETIMES get it to flow but for the most part it would not. Thanks to this POS I have wasted two cans of refrigerant and this stuff isn't cheap anymore. Should have bought a Mastercool instead. After replacing the o-rings, orifice valve and vacuuming the system, the whole effort was a waste due to this faulty valve. Now I have to go to the autoparts store tomorrow and replace this junk.

I used it all day yesterday with no problems. I have yet to compare it to a known good wrench, or run a calibration test on it, but from past experience I can tell that it's not far off, if at all. The dial markings are indeed a little small, but it's a small wrench. In good light, they are easy enough to see. As some other reviewers have mentioned, the gearing in the head could be a little tighter, but it was certainly tight enough to suit me.

I've read a couple of books by this author and found some of the early ones quite entertaining. Things have gone downhill. Each successive book is a flawed clone of its predecessor, and this one reached new lows in character development and plot. I got half way through the book and found I didn't like a single character in it and didn't care about the outcome. This is the first book that I have not wanted to read to completion in about 5 years"},{"rating":"1","title":"Battle Born","review":"Really lame and not worth the price!!! Exciting beginning with in depth detail of combat flying. The moment it leaves that and goes to geopolitical and military, the realism leaves completely. The basis for the story sounded intriging, but was not addressed in such a manner as to make it even remotely believable. It is a shame. It started so well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battle Bored","review":"The key aspect to a good techno-thriller is keeping the story a half step out of pace with reality but not so far out to keep the reader from believeing it could happen. Battle Born was so far out that I might as well have been reading a Star Trek novel. Others authors in this genre such as Tom Clancy and Patrick Robinson can at least come up with plausible senarios for thier characters to engage in and so could Dale Brown if you read some of his older works, but not in this book. In addition the first three hundred pages are more or less lead in material before the real action starts. If you want to read a good techno-thriller read Tom Clancy's The Cardinal of the Kremlin, if you want to waste your time read Battle Born."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I read the same book as everyone else?","review":"I hate to say it, but I found this book painfully SLOW. Yes, the plot moved along smartly, but not in a way that I cared about. The primary conflict doesn't arise until quite late in the book and our \\"heros\\", and I use the term loosley because I care not a whit about the charaters Mr. Brown created, see no real action until VERY late in the book. For my taste, he spent FAR too much time setting up the scenario and not enough time making me care about the characters. Tin Man, while admittedly hokey, at least saw the main character actively involved in fighting the bad guys from an early chapter. I struggled to finish Battle Born."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best ones Dale Brown Wrote","review":"This is a definate page turner. I like how it shows the plots with different countries' leaders point of view. Not a lot of flying like the previous books though. Still, as usual, Brown keeps a lot of Technical stuff in which might make it hard for new readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"a battle to read","review":"I have read all of Dale Brown's books. I could not finish Battle Born. I was bored and found myself skipping paragraphs and indeed pages to the point where I quit. I was very disappointed in this book and will hesitate to buy another by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"wal-mart special","review":"this book is typical of the soft covers wal-mart sells and my wife brings home. this time i was with her and it still didn't help. there was a lot of factual? material and much speculation, seeing that i have newer been invited to groom lake. it is just not well done, i tended to skip some of the junk but i read the whole dreary book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battle Born","review":"Dale Browns first book was Flight of the Old Dog. This book is an old dog. There are numerous dead spots in this. Mr. Brown really needs to find himself a new editor. The pacing is terrible. The conversations go on forever and the action is too drawn out. The concept of a multirole fighter bomber is very unique and interesting. The problem is the characters that fly this plane are very troubled people. You almost hope they get shot down by the North Koreans. Reading this book is alot worse than watching an episode of Jag. There are plenty of better military type books available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - Dale needs a rest.","review":"Despite perfect print and excellent cover of a european paperback edition the contents of Dale's latest are dissappointing.Battle Born lacks typical Dale's dramaturgy and is a pure techno-gizmo that is absolutely boring nor entertaining. It looks like Dale was bound to produce something by a certain date (by a contract, for example) and that was what he did.Wasted money and time."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Battle Born\\" - Flight of the NEW Dog!","review":"Unlike some, I wasn't too disappointed with Dale Brown's last book, \\"The Tin Man\\", I kind of enjoyed it in a Robocop kind of way. Besides, Dale showed guts in trying something different.But now \\"Battle Born\\". This is what I've been waiting for. Fast paced, fast flying, missiles firing action of the sort that Brown does best. While I'm not going to say if this is his best book yet (I'll have to re-read the previous 11 books and decide), it will grip you, haul you in and refuse to let you put it down until you finish the last page. The politics are not too far-fetched, the technology may well exist already and his characterisations are as good as ever. This book could be seen as a true sequel to Flight of The Old Dog, finally retiring the EB-52 with the introduction of the... nah, you'll have to read it to find out. When's the next one coming out? If it's better than \\"Battle Born\\", Amazon better change its top rating to TEN stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Armegeddon as Soap Opera","review":"If you prefer your tales of blood and slaughter served up with plenty of jaw-jutting angst, this book is for you. Dale Brown is to be saluted for getting this into print. I wouldn't publish it. The heros are monodimensionally combative with everyone, even each other. There's plenty of bombastic machismo dialogue. Still, the audio version is great for washing dishes. You can miss whole chapters while vacuuming and still follow the plot. And we get to focus on radio-transimitting microchips while thousands fry as the tactical nuclear weapons fly. Doesn't get any better than this for dissassociated mayhem. But hey, I listened to all of it, didn't I?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fizzle","review":"I've loved Dale Brown's previous books, mainly because of the incredible detail he puts into the flying parts - it almost feels like I'm in the cockpit. But this one spent so much time setting up the political situation, that when it come to the flying scenes, it's all done in about 10 pages at the end.On its own, it is fairly decent. But as part of the Patrick McLanahan saga, this one bombs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battle Bored","review":"If you like your Political Correctness hot and heavy,you'll love Battle Born. Have a blast counting the modern archtypyes so comman in todays Hollywood Films.Lieutentant Colonel Rebecca Furness;who out flies and out swears her PC squad. See Rebecca and Rinc (aka deadmeat) in the most stilted forced relationship on paper.You'll love Vice President Ellen and her tough as nails Secert Service Agent Corrie Law. If you can get by the characters,the plot has promise.However like Rinc flying skill ,it just doesn't deliver the goods on target. The climax is well... misplaced,it seems like it would belong in the middle of the book,a minor battle. It only the Koreans that made it remotely interesting,thus the two stars. This book reads as if Dale Brown is looking for a postion in the Clinton White House. I'll be dropping my copy off to local book drive,so beware out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battle Born","review":"What a piece of trash - ridiculous plot, comic-book characters and excessive reliance on techno-speak and flying 'action' that were incredibly unrealistic.

He overwhelms the reader with nonsense technology, impossible flying and unbelieveable characters. The book has no real plot just a lot of incidents that, in some cases combine and in most don't. Things just don't happen this way in real life. I have read every one of Dale Brown's books, The Flight of the Old Dog, got me. This is my last. It's too bad he has never lived up to that start . You just keep waiting for this book to make sense and it does not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just plain beautiful addition to the living room","review":"I loved my first lamp I got from the Amazon.com site but love this one even more.

This one was a little slow at the beginning but after about 20% could not put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recommended","review":"this book is written by someone who could not wait to write a review today. The plot is foreshadowing with a thud. One is never surprised at what happens next except one knows that nothing will go really wrong for these characters as they are made of cotton candy. think of it....run away from home with your family to a muli-million dollar beach house with a 'hunk' who delivers anything you want or need. OYE! such wish fulfillment, so predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical","review":"I couldn't finish this book because it's too predicatble and fluffy for me.I appreciate the info on the turtles but the story itself has been done billion of times...A wealthy, beautiful (but doesn't realize how beautiful she is) strong minded woman leaves home, returns and finds love. End of story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fabulous Summer Read","review":"After reading another book by the same title and loving it (The Beach House), I was eager for more of the same and was excited to come across this book. Wow, what a great story. I loved the location and the characters as well as the story itself. The author manages to transport you right onto the sand and make you feel like you are right there. I couldn't put it down.A great story to lose yourself in when you've got the winter blues!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Depressing","review":"I'm not sure why writers constantly include someone dying of cancer in their novels. Why would ANYONE want to read about that? Please tell me. Well, this book tops them all as the main character \\"Lovie\\" is dying from cancer from the first few pages of the book until the inevitable sad ending. Of course, we learn to really like her character, which I did, just to make sure you are really, really sad when the ending comes and to make sure you are completely depressed throughout the rest of the book. The novel also includes the pre-requisite philandering husband, abusive boyfriend, and lonely hunk who finally finds love. No surprises here at all. The information about the turtles was very interesting but sad as well as we learn with all the effort the \\"Turtle Ladies\\" give to saving the turtle eggs, most of them die anyway. Depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"mary alice monroe is a great and inspiring writer","review":"loved beach house, could not put it down, i live in the north and take my vacations in this part of the south, fell in love with all the characters , beach house made me homesick for the beach, reading beach house made me feel like i was there i would recommend this book for anyone that loves the ocean and the beach and all it's wonder"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Summer Read","review":"The Beach House was a great summer read.

I liked this story and it makes you want to keep all the communication channels open with your loved ones, family and friends. A reminder not to lose touvh no matter how busy we get.

You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, timeless story","review":"I read The Beach House years ago, and left my paperback copy at my parent's place.

But, I did not know there would be soooo much about loggerhead turtles- which I have absolutely no interest in.

Rather surprised since I enjoyed the movie so much. However, definitely one to enjoy repeatedly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jerry Goldsmith in awesome adventure mode","review":"This is Jerry Goldsmith's triumphant return to adventure films. Unlike \\"The Mummy\\" and \\"The Haunting,\\" which are by-the-numbers scores, Goldsmith clearly invested a lot of thought and emotion into this rousing score. If you're like me, you won't get past the first track until you've listened to it 4 or 5 times...it kicks! I love how the orchestra (a BIG one) blends with electronic elements, exotic percussion, and wonderful use of a male chorus. Some of the action cues are a bit overdone, but why quibble when there's nearly an hour of music to savor. It's all seamlessly done. Author Michael Crichton writes a nice tribute to Jerry inside the CD liner. Along with \\"The Phantom Menace,\\" this is clearly one of the best movie scores of the year...and certainly one of Goldsmith's best scores of the decade. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Predator like","review":"This new effort of Jerry Goldsmith perfectly captures the mood of those old days. His battle music reminds me of Silvestri's music for Predator. When Arnold prepares himself to battle (the scenes that he makes a bow and stuff). Clearly the influence of John Mc Tiernan I think. A very good effort, but not very original writing of this music makes this in my opinion a 4 star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST DON'T GET IT FROM IMPORTCDS","review":"This is a great soundtrack to a very good movie; just be careful who you buy it from. I ordered 1 copy from a seller called IMPORTCDS. They billed me for & shipped 3 copies.

Over 2 weeks later, I actually got a refund for 1 copy; I've still paid for the 2nd as well as their shipping charge to send me the 2 copies I never wanted in the 1st place.

Unlike many of the Japanese books on the subject that have been translated to english, Cohen's book provides a comprehensive look at the subject of QFD, from the history of QFD through the final chapters that guide one through the mechanics of conducting a QFD study. I particularly like the no-nonsense writing style and the step-by-step approach taken to explain the method without going into tediously technical details about all the potential mathematics involved. This is the first book that I have found on the subject of QFD that I could actually USE to complete a QFD study. I also found that the method described is not dependent on any specific QFD software, but works with any of the 3 QFD software packages that I use. If you have to have just one reference for Quality Function Deployment, this is the book I would choose."},{"rating":"1","title":"More examples please","review":"I, an engineer turned marketer, love to learn by example. Stop telling me about how it works...show me.THE COMPLETE LACK OF SAMPLES was very disappointing. I feel my understanding would have been much deeper if the author had walked through hypothetical/real examples.The book does a reasonably good job describing the various steps of performing the QFD process. Samples would have made it much richer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A surprisingly good collection","review":"Despite a misleading definition of haiku on the back of this book (continued in the introduction), and despite the tendency of Dover Thrift Editions to use the worst possible translations for other books they have published, this is an authoritative and valuable collection which offers translations of quite a few works otherwise difficult to find. One of the most valuable elements of the book is its printing of multiple translations of one poem -- while some of the translations (particularly from the early part of the 20th century) are execrable, it is fascinating and instructive to see how various poems have been approached.This book is a great addition to any library, but don't let it be your only haiku book -- be sure to read William Higginson's \\"Haiku Handbook\\" as well as \\"The Essential Haiku\\" edited by Robert Hass and \\"The Haiku Anthology\\" edited by Cor van den Heuvel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant remake","review":"Kaufman's _Invasion of the Body Snatchers_ is a rarity: a re-make that's as good or better than the original. The film features terrific special effects, intelligent writing, and memorable characters. The cinematography is gorgeous, with the Kaufman touch--carefully-placed details that invite the eye to roam around the screen in every scene.Jeff Goldblum is especially good, and he gets the movie's best line. See if you can identify it. There's also a great cameo appearance by Kevin McCarthy, who starred in the 1956 original version.The film is based on the story by the amazing Jack Finney, who also wrote the best time travel novel of all time, _Time and Again_.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff!!","review":"Man, this is a classic! Well worth the money, although the extras aren't that great. Still worth it, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, Terrible DVD","review":"This is one of the great remakes -- a remake that actually doesn't just rehash the original. It takes the same premise in a different direction. And it has a 70s apocalyptic character -- edgy and just a little depressing. The original and this remake really reflect their times.So the movie is fantastic. This DVD is one of the worst I've seen (I have a few hundred DVDs). The compression is terrible -- tons of artifacts indicating severe over-compression badly done. The \\"letterbox\\" version is not true letterboxing and is also hideously bad.So it's six of one, half a dozen of the other. If the price is low enough, probably worth having because the film is so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"best version of this one blu ray","review":"THis blu ray comes with a clean print and no dirt or lines on it. unlike other blu raleases of older movies on some titles, the colors look pretty good and the natural film grain is there. THis has not this good since it was released at the theaters. Thankfully this one didn't need restoring too much so that's a plus , this classic sci fi movie is at it's best here , I only wish that they'd put out the first 'bbody snatchers movie as a bonus movie on this blu ray. Thisstill remains the best version of the story though, it's paranoia is perfected and the acting is just great This blu ray will not have the look of a modern flick of course so don't expect it , however like I said it has a dirt and line free print and tha's awesome, just look at the shoddy blu rays out there with unrepaired defects and you will be happy this isn't one of them. the extras are the same from the dvd set so that's a plus too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"The plot was weak, the acting was so so even with Leonard Nimoy.

The Directors shows off behind the camera with obtrusive camera angles, and the ending is an insult. The acting is excellent, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is How a Great Remake is Made","review":"In the original INVASION (1956), the alien pods descend on a small California town and overtake it. Everyone knows everyone. The slightest change in anyone's personality is noticable so the humans are tipped off a little early.In the remake (1978), the setting is moved to San Francisco. Where no one knows anyone, the aliens have nearly completely overtaken the city before anyone notices the invasion has begun, amping up the paranoia and danger.Great cast, atmospheric photography, and chilling soundtrack. This is how a great remake is made: take the original concept and move it forward. (The only other great remake I can think of also starred Jeff Goldblum: 1986's THE FLY).A bit of trivia: I met Kevin McCarthy, the star of the original, this summer and asked him about the remake.\\"They didn't pay me a dime for that,\\" he told me. \\"They couldn't even come up with a hundred and fifty dollars to pay me for that cameo.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent viewing experience even today!","review":"SPOILERS BLEOWA classic in every sense of the world. Acting is superb, direction also, all that accomplished with a modest budget and without mind-blogging visual effects.The enphais is in the characters.

It is comparable to and in some cases far exceeds the originalInvasion of the Body Snatchersfilm. The cast all give great performances led by Donald Sutherland and Jeff Goldblum.

The first one I thought to have been pretty slow in some parts with the characters doing the same old annoying cliche crap that you'd expect from a black and white movie, while The Invasion had some good parts with some okay parts, but this one I found to have had the most thoroughly entertaining story and pace, with great special effects and creepy moments. I never get scared or creeped out during movies because I am very open-minded and have seen quite a few movies, but this one is one of the few movies where the ending really put a shiver down my spine. When the credits started to roll, I just knew I had to buy this movie. That is a sign that you just saw something that you would want to put into your movie collection - which I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase","review":"I got this because I was looking for an ab workout that I can use as a supplement to my regular workouts. I was VERY suprised by the amount of options the DVD offers including the 3 short ab work outs and one option to combine the 3 for a longer one (almost 30 minutes). I have not had a chance to actually do the longer aerobic options but I watched them and it's impressive. I have done the strictly ab options on their own and as a group and they offer a great workout and are very easy to follow. If you're looking for an ab routine to supplement your current regime or a DVD that gives you cardio options as well as shorter options this is it. HIGHLY RECOMMEND."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT TEA","review":"this tea is really good - taste is gentle minty (seems like i taste several different mints going on in there).

I know Eternabond talks about using a steel roller but this applies a tremenous amount of pressure where needed and may be useful for other projects as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marshalltown 2\\" Flat Roller","review":"I purchased this roller because it had good reviews and is made in the USA. I use it when I re-wrap drum sets (e.g. musical instrument drums) to help complete the bond between the wood shell and the laminate.

Don't miss the nice moments watching this movie with your family members!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST TO WATCH WITH DAUGHTERS!!!","review":"My little girl and I watch this movie regularly, we just love it and it makes us think of all we to be grateful for. It's something you can treasure with your own daughter time and time again. I strongly suggest you watch this with your daughter and hold her close as you do :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"Since \\"The Secret Garden\\" was done rather well (some changes) I expected that this film would mostly follow the book. If the author is good why make huge changes? Wow, what a miss this film is! In the book Sarah Crewe was a princess because of her strength of character. In the movie she was a princess in the Disneyish way of being a female of a certain age.Besides that the worst change was removing the scene at the bakery in which Sarah gave away most of the buns she had purchased to a girl who was hungrier than she was. Very important in the book, left out of the movie!I have 5 children (all grown now) but because of this I read a lot of children's book and saw a lot of children's movies. The book is very strong, required reading. The movie is not worth a view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely different from the book","review":"This film is lovely to look at and well acted, but the script has little in common with Frances Hodgson Burnett's story. The location has been moved from London to New York, the characters are poorly developed--if developed at all, and there are many, many departures from the original book. Being a huge fan of the book, which is my all-time favorite children's book, I was extremely disappointed with this film. If you haven't read the book, you will probably enjoy this rendition very much, but if you love the story, you will feel ripped off. It is a terrific story that does not need the massive amount of tweaking that it endured in this film. In fact, the original tale is all but unrecognizable here. What a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"little princess movie","review":"This is one of the sweetest movies I have ever watched! My girls love it! We have it on dvr and wanted it on DVD.

There were a few scratches, but I popped it into the DVD player anyway. The quality was very poor. Black dots and lines throughout the movie. I will be returning this."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the point","review":"Why bother making a film of a Little Princess without actually reading it. The book was set in the 19th century and the father never came back, he was dead. Also why the move to America?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistitled, but a good movie","review":"This movie added a world war, changed the continent the story took place on, and then brought the dead back to life. To me, once the essential elements of the author's story are that fundamentally altered, it's not fair to use the title anymore. I realize a number of the changes are a 'tribute' to the Shirley Temple version, but I'd hoped that since the new version wasn't a star vehicle they might have returned to more of the original storyline, but no. At least the first movie was on the correct continent! I like the movie, believe it or not, but it's not the story I read until the first book fell apart, and the changes to the story I listed weren't necessary, and it may have been nice to see that things can work out even when a parent stays dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO MELODRAMATIC","review":"Horrible movie,felt like kicking the VCR .Should be awarded the worst movie of the decade award."},{"rating":"1","title":"What on earth??","review":"What a horrible movie. It should have had a different title and not pretended to be based on a book, or at least have had a lead character that wasn't pretentious, spoiled and bratty.There was some serious overacting, and Sara just didn't look right for the part. I guess the people who made the movie didn't read the book.And there is one scene towards the end, where Sara is in her room and the girls play with the neighbour monkey- if you look at the locket as they hand it back to her, and then when Miss Minchin takes it, the photos are reversed. I guess the director thought we wouldn't notice but I was so bored by the movie I happened to see it.One of the worst movies I have ever seen, even for a children's one..."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT FOR THE OLD AND THE YOUNG","review":"This was a great movie to watch with my little sister. It was the type of fairytale story we could both enjoy. Liesel Matthews is such a talented actress. She was perfect in this role. I think every child, and every adult can relate to something in this movie. Whether it be the fact that a war has forced a man to leave his child at a boarding school, or a young girl having to adjust to new friends,a bully, and a mean-spirited head-mistress of the school. Through all this young girl endures, she keeps a positive attitude and survives. Very uplifting for the young."},{"rating":"2","title":"heartwarming and captivating","review":"I think that \\"A Little Princess\\" is one of the best childrens movie that i've ever seen. the cinematography has a fairy tale aura about it, the story is beautiful and heartwarming and the acting, specially Liesel Mathews as Sara and Eleonor Bron as the head mistress is captivating. I recomend this movie to anyone who whants to remember the innocence of childhood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely wonderful","review":"I am a 23 year old male and I love this film to death. I realize that it can be frustrating to find that a movie diverges from the book it is based on, but it should really be judged on its own merits. \\"A Little Princess\\" is shear magic - it is inspiring and truly moving. I don't think I have ever seen a fantasy film that surpasses this masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must see for both adults and kids!","review":"I cried in the movie theatre when I first saw the movie, after the part when Sara is told she has lose her father. I thought it would follow the book, so the loss for me was a real one. Sara and her father were real people to me and really cared for each other. It was absolutely convincing. This has to be one of the best children's movies ever made. The only real downside was with some of the acting, but since they're kids, I don't think it's a big deal. The beautiful scenery and the clever imagery make this a must see for both children and adults!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you loved the book, this is *NOT* the movie for you!","review":"I was very excited when I heard they were doing another remake of \\"A Little Princess\\" as it was a favorite book of mine. But why, oh why? must Hollywood think that they can improve on a classic by drastically changing the plot? Ugh. If you loved the book, look for the 1990 version instead starring Nigel Havers and Amelia Shankley. You'll be *much* happier with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this movie! It's for all ages!","review":"Beautifully shot, well acted, kept the attention of a 34 year old and 6 year old. Have seen it at least 20 times. Need I say more?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing the Charm and Literary Quality of the Book","review":"This movie was a big disappointment--it comes across flat as a pancake. I was dismayed to see the change in the ending, but that wasn't the only thing which was changed. The whole feeling of the movie was different than the book. I wasn't even compelled to feel sorry for Sarah, because she comes across as spoiled and superior in the movie. Her charm and imagination never shine through. All in all, this picture was just a shadow of the wonderful story Francis Hodgson Burnett wrote."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better then the Shirley Temple version","review":"I'm writing this review for those of us who read the book asking: \\"is this version like the book???\\" No it isn't, I love to read and up until I saw this movie I thought that the book was always better then the movie however here that is not the case. This movie surpassed the book in many ways it evoked more emotions then the book ever could and though I loved the book it never made me cry like this movie does every time I SEE IT! It is also way better then the Shirley Temple version which was sickeningly happy and seemed to gleam over the fact that her father died on her birthday!!!! I watched the first 30 minutes of that version and turned it off right away. This movie is beautiful and I recommend it to anyone especially people who read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"MAGICAL AND ENCHANTING!","review":"A movie based on the novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett, is an enchanting masterpiece, that will take you to another place only by listenig to it, this movie is magical, an teachs valueble lessons to everyone, not just children, that money isn't all in this life, how can you have all a loose it in a minute. Sara the little princes is a wealthy kid, orphan only my mother, his father has to go to the war and sents her to an exclusive school in New York City, were she's treated like a princess, until her dad supposedly dies in action, everything changes, she becomes a servant in the school, but she never stop believing in magic, and telling her wonderful stories about \\"India\\", great movie, magnificent scenary, great movie for you to own.....magical...."},{"rating":"1","title":"there are better versions","review":"When my girls were young, we read the book several times. This is very disappointing in its departure from Francis Hodgson Burnett's story. (The Shirly Temple version did its own thing.) Wonderworks has a wonderful production which is true to the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's a better version, true to the book","review":"While this version of A Little Princess is not necessarily bad, the producers took so many liberties with Frances Hodgson Burnett's novel that people who've read the book may be unable to watch it. The boarding school is in London, not New York, for example, and the addition of songs and fuzzily filmed dancing detracts. If you want the accurate and entertaining version, go for the WonderWorks A Little Princess with Amelia Shankley, Maureen Lipman, Miriam Margolys, and Nigel Havers. I hope you need not be warned away from the Shirley Temple version."},{"rating":"2","title":"A treat for the eye and the heart","review":"Very few recent children's movies portray young characters who are capable of kindness, empathy, intelligence and who possess, as well, an adventurous, imaginative spirit. A child watching this movie sees Sara practicing all these attributes and is treated to lush and artful cinematography that, during a few of the scenes, nearly takes your breath away. It reminded me of some of the Latin American literature classified as \\"magical realism\\". I am grateful that Alfonso Cuaron has directed a family movie that I, the parent, will enjoy watching again and again. I think that the children watching this film will also benefit on many different levels. The film may be different from the written version but it illustrates an important topic with its treatment of the classic story; how it is possible for people/children to face adversity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it...","review":"I wasn't expecting much from this movie. It's an adaption of my all-time favorite book, and figured I'd invariably be disappointed... I was surprised to find a simply delightful movie. Great fun. I liked the Shirley Temple version even better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a BEAUTIFUL movie!","review":"Oh, wow. This movie is just so magical. Everything about it is absolutely captivating. I love the the time it's set in, because this allows for a lot of beautiful, old-fashioned backgrounds that accent the perfectly poignant acting! The little girl is so adorable, and there are some scenes in this movie that seem to belong in a painting, they are so visually-appealing and colorful. This movie is one of those movies you can watch and totally immerse yourself in and forget you're watching a movie, actually believing you're IN it. I wish I could give it more than five stars, because it truly deserves it. It really gives you that deep-down, warm feeling that only the best movies can make you feel. It's rare to find such a deeply-moving movie that can be enjoyed by anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"No words can describe it. All I can say is that this film is inferior in the genre only to \\"The Secret Garden.\\" A great film for a father and daughter to watch... perhaps on Father's Day?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Princess or not...","review":"this movie makes you believe you are one whether you are a maid or an ordinary little girl. Beautifully told and absolutely the best version of this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best movies ever","review":"I first saw this movie 10 years ago and I recently watched it again and can honestly say that this is one of the best movies ever made and I don't know why they never make movies like this anymore. The cinematography is great and the characters are convincing that you feel their emotions all throughout the movie. Not a lot of movies today do that for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome","review":"i got this movie for my princess \\" daughter\\". she loved it and the price!it ran good and was awsome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Capable adaptation","review":"The Bottom Line:Though A Little Princess sometimes veers too much towards stupid-kid-cinema (e.g. awful reaction shots of little girls snickering while some evil adult gets his/her comeuppance) it's a pretty good adaptation of the classic children's story that (mainly) resists amping up the drama and is directed with a deft hand by Cuaron; it's not great but it's a family movie that won't make adults reach for the nearest handgun.3/4"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"I think this movie is a great family movie.

Personally, I like the original better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Princess","review":"I've never read the book, but I really enjoyed the movie.

I think it's a good movie to show to your children."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Princess Review","review":"This review is from a guy who sees almost every moviein the theatre and likes very few of them. I saw A LittlePrincess at the FineArts theatre in Chicago when it wasin business. A little Princess is one of the few trulymoving films. The story, imagery and music in this filmgenerate a magic that Disney has rarely if ever matched."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorites.","review":"I have read the book and have seen and own all three movie versions (Shirley Temple, BBC and this one) althouh the BBC on has the correct story, this is my favorite. I don't care that they changed the story in fact I liked it better this way. I have probably seen this movie at least 15 times. It is one of my all time favorite movies. My favorite part is when the indian guy does that mind thing with Sara's father and then her father runs outside and screams on the top of his lungs \\"Sara\\". That part is so good. I could go on and on about all my other favorite parts but that would take too long and I would end up talking about every scene in the movie. BUY IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not true to book","review":"Doesn't it bother anyone that they changed the book so much??? New York instead of London, Sarah not looking at all like she's supposed to, and a different ending? If you REALLY want to appreciate A Little Princess, why doesn't someone make a DVD version of the BBC Production with Amelia Shankey, who is a much truer Sarah in a much more faithful version. We managed to find it on VHS but not DVD. The book has been loved for three generations -- why mess with it??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some pleasing settings - but atrocious acting","review":"Okay, maybe it's because this was designed to be a \\"children's movies\\" and the powers that be decided acting was not a priority... I can overlook that the people in the movie are caricatures and stereotypes more than developed individuals. Okay, the main character is unbelievably good and the school master is unreasonably mean. That is to be expected. The problem for me was that every time a character opened their mouth I cringed at what came out.The plot was good, but I was amazed at how terrible the acting was. It was as if the children were asked to read their lines in the most sugary tones possible. Especially the main character.I think \\"children's movies\\" can certainly have layers to their characters and can feature actors that can actually act. Unfortunately, this is not one of those movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"movie little princess","review":"this is a nice movie for the family as there is no bad language,violence,or sex. the family values are also intertwined in the movie.i watch it with all my grandchildren."},{"rating":"2","title":"The princess. 16th april 2004.","review":"BRILLIANT.

Life imitating art?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Precious Gem Of A Film","review":"I can't stop raving about this movie!!!! There are so many things that touch my heart and make me cry. The fact that young Sara remains so optimistic and kind throughout her ordeal is enough to recommend the film (and the book). Liam Cunnigham is so handsome and gentle as her father, who adores his only and motherless child the way all children want to be loved. And the \\"curse\\" put on the snobby Lavinia is priceless!!! They could not have chosen a better child actress to play Sara. Liesel Matthews embodies her character so well that you forget that she's acting. The fantasy sequences are glorious to look at, and the little girls at the school are adorable in their uniforms. Eleanor Bron is superb as Ms. Minchen. You just love to hate her. This movie should be watched with \\"The Secret Garden\\" (1993). Both are timeless, touching, and beautiful masterpieces. Share it with your children and your inner child. Remember 'Every girl everywhere is a princess.' Need I say more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful movie to share with your daughter.","review":"We saw this movie on HBO and purchased it because it is so beautiful. My daughter is 6 and the message that EVERY little girl is a princess, no matter what your clothing or jewelry is like, or from where you grew up. The movie, in a few parts, is a bit too 'unrealistic.' But then again, that is why it is a movie! The bottom line is that my daughter and I watch it often and always cry at the ending.... The love of a daughter and a parent truly transcends all."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing and breathtaking.","review":"I am rarely moved by a film as I have with this one. This film is fairly flawless with wonderful (not over the top) acting, zgreat wonderful visuals and a poignant adaptation of the novel. Liesel Matthews is just wonderful never going over the top. It would be so easy to camp it up and get that hollywood feel but instead you are drawn into a story of complexity and drama. I can't help but think about Oliver Twist when I see this film but it's a different story altogether. I recall when this first came out and Gene Siskel argued that despite wonderful films like this, everyone complains that no family fair exists. It's out there if you look for it. This is a real gem that sadly tanked in the cinema."},{"rating":"2","title":"very pleased with the product","review":"Just as the product was described.

Very happy to have found it in dvd to share with my children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Favorite","review":"Our family loves this story. We like this version and the original also. I think this version has better acting and script for the \\"little princess\\" and does not concern itself with too many side stories. In this story Sarah must live in a boarding school away from the land she loves (India) and the man she loves (her father). It is difficult enough for a lively girl with a big imagination to thrive in the stifling school, but when Sarah's circumstances change for the worse her imagination, belief in magic and determination serve her well. This movie will pull at your heartstrings and inspire you; I would give it 10 starts if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good story","review":"This is an absolutely wonderful, beautiful movie. It only has 1 flaw: it's not entirely faithful to the book. In the movie, Sara and Becky are accused of stealing the the things that the \\"magic\\"brought and are therefore forced to cross a narrow plank seperating the school from the Indian Gentleman's house in the rain to escape the police. this is exciting,but it doesn't happen in the book. I'm giving it 5 stars anyway because it isan absolutley beautiful movie and it is the director's call to decide to tweak things. I reccommend watching it because Sara Crewe is the nicest princess you'll ever find"},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't the one...","review":"\\"A Little Princess\\" is a great story. Sadly, this movie doesn't tell it. A Hollywood-influenced director got hold of the story and stuffed it with all the elements of a cheesy American thriller film -- a chase with the heroine dangling by her fingertips from a balcony, a villainesse too evil to imagine, AMNESIA (for crying out loud!) I was especially put off by the 20th-century attitude coming out of the mouth of this Victorian-era girl.Don't buy this version; find the Wonderworks version of A Little Princess, and buy that one. It's faithful to the novel, and it's superb."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Garden\\" > \\"Princess\\"","review":"\\"A Little Princess\\" is a second-rate melodrama for children. It gives us a glimpse of trench warfare in World War I, complete with poison gas. A small but important part of the action takes place in images from East Indian imagination.The movie apparently teaches that make-believe can transform your world and make it wonderful, though the teaching is undercut by the slapstick ending of a comic romance and elopement.Fantasy stories can help us see clearly and prepare us for real life, but I don't think this one does so. After one viewing, the effect was not unlike a large helping of strawberry ice cream in a bowl of beef stew. \\"Princess\\" has its good points, so let's give it 3/10 (vs. 6 or 7/10 for \\"The Secret Garden\\", which has a better story and fine photography). If you buy \\"Princess,\\" consider getting the dvd with \\"The Secret Garden\\" on the other side."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Most Charming Movies Ever Made","review":"I think this is one of the most charming movies I ever seen, the performance of Liesel Matthews is outstanding, capturing your heart with the spirit of her caracter, no doubt that more movies like this should be made. the scores are also something worth to be heard. no matter what kind of person you might be, A Little Princess will kinddle your heart and leave a pleasant memory within for the rest of your live, for reals"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute movie!!","review":"A sweet movie, well made, well acted out.

Being familiar with some of the people and incidents, I thought it may be a good book. The first 100 pages were well written, but after that it's like a first grader took over the writing. Mis-spelled words, sentences fragmented, etc. Throughout her writing, Ms. Woods decided to add every National Inquirerer article from the time period into her book, even though THEY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HER! So if there was an L.A. rumor going around, she implied she had some kind of knowledge or involvement about it. But if you read her writing, they had nothing to do with her. I could not finish the book and was not upset when my puppy (literally) finished it for me. I just wish I could get my $5.00 back!I noticed that the book was written in 2001, had it's first (one star) review in 2008, and suddenly has 13 five star reviews ALL written in February of 2012...???

She has a lot of fun pretending to cook and make meals.The one thing I did notice about this kitchen compared to other kitchens is that it doesn't really make any \\"cooking\\" noises but it does have a grinder that makes a noise, a phone and the recipe cards which take you on a \\"cooking adventure\\".The other thing I had to look out for was Amazon's price - as we bought this gift just before xmas, the price was changing constantly - I saw two prices within an hour.All in all this kitchen was good value for money and can keep my daughter occupied for hours"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dora's kitchen not super realistic but great for Dora fans","review":"No this kitchen doesn't have a back to it or super realistic features but if your little one is a huge Dora fan they will love it.

There is not a lot of space for cooking really and inside the \\"fridge\\" and oven there are racks so it is hard to place things because things fall through the holes of the racks. I solved that by giving my daughter containers where she could put the food and I tought her that thats were she had to put it to keep it neat and organized. Also the back of the kitchen has holes so things easily fall. the oven is not too spacious, its hard to fit things in because of the rack. I think for this price or a little bit more you can get a nicer looking kitchen with more space in the fridge and oven to store things and to pretend. There are very nice and realistic kitchens out there, get one of those and if your child really loves Dora, just get Dora cups and plates or other accesories for the kitchen.

He isn't quite tall enough to pull the phone out when it's firmly in its holder, but when someone else helps with that, he loves to hear who's calling.It's true that it takes an extra push to make the refrigerator door stay shut, but that doesn't really matter. The open back isn't a problem either. We were afraid the oven door might break off if he used it to sit or climb on, but that hasn't happened.Assembly was quite straightforward and pretty quick.

I don't think I am even going to bother getting a 3rd one. This kitchen has been sold out everywhere I have looked for it Targets, Walmarts, etc. so I thought it must have been a great toy.

When she first saw it set up in front of the tree she was thrilled. Upon trying to play with it, she was bored within moments. The quality is mediocre at best, the door falls open, no back on the set at all so the accessories fall out the back. The recipe cards are not entertaining, and it is limited in what this does. For the $65 we paid for this (amazing how it is cheaper after Christmas), is totally not worth it. I wish I had not thrown away the box, because I would have for sure returned it. My daughter plays with it only if passing it and it catches her eye. The cooking pieces are more entertaining than the whole kitchen. Would not recommend this to anyone over the age of 2.

It's an okay Monogram programmer, nothing special but it doesn't put you to sleep either with its short running time of 61 minutes. Not much of interest to train fans, just a few stock shots of a moving train and a couple of train terminal (depot) scenes, probably shot on the studio back lot.

The author's rendition of music, the ballet and poetry also gave me a new respect for and joy in these forms of art. I'll read the book again and again and again - it is sanity in a world gone mad.

It's really a nutshell about unfair competition law (the foreword reveals that the book used to be called \\"Unfair Trade Practices in a Nutshell\\"). Intellectual property law is discussed, but only inasmuch as it relates to unfair competition law. Lots of IP is left out--the section about patents, for instance, says very little about best mode, statutory bar, and other basic concepts, other than defining them in a sentence or two.While this is still a useful guide for business lawyers and law students, the title is very misleading.

What little I did comprehend when building my studio has now been further explained to me in this book... NOW I KNOW!!!The text is written so that it's easy to understand.

I was very excited about the \\"link\\" option as I wanted to see the relations and applications. But, no. Amazon CS states they can't do anything about it on their end. I think Tyndale needs to fix it on their end. But any way you look at it, Kindle needs to boldly state on the purchase page that the links are a bust and the eBible is no good for what it says it can do.

My biggest complaint is that last summer, I left the bible in my car and the leather melted to my seat and when I tried to unstick it, it only ruined the bible because the leather stayed stuck to my seat. Now the bible is ugly and the spine came unglued. I was very disappointed. I own a few more bibles that are bigger and bulkier that I don't like carrying to church every Sunday that I leave in my car during the week and none of them have ever had any problems. This is the only bible that's melted in my car, so to me it must be the bible...not the fact that I left it in my car."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a great purchase!","review":"Dont be in too big of a hurry to open that bible as soon as you purchase it. The honest truth is that it takes about 40 minutes for your kindle (WIFI) to index this bible. After it is indexed, have at it. It is helpful to have your kindle plugged in to a charger when it is indexing, so you dont drain your battery as WIFI will do. Yes it is easy to use, easy to find passages and easy to study. Definitely take the time to watch the short video on indexing it, otherwise you may be very frustrated in attempting to find a specific book or verse. Once indexed, there are several ways to find what you are looking for. I am very happy with this purchase. If I had one wish, it would be that they come up with a way to \\"red letter\\" (or otherwise designate---different font?) the words of Christ.

If you really like to drill down to gleen all there is in this great Bible, it really requires a quick finger session with your Android to get back to where you were. The regular back button that requires only one tap is not functional with this Bible and/or my smartphone while using this Bible. The regular back button is functional with other apps. If using this in a Bible study setting, you may find it quite frustrating. I am using an LG G2X smartphone, but sometimes I it acts like a dumb phone.I sure hope they fix the navigation for this Bible and put out a free update."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome bible","review":"This is an awesome bible. I cannot stop reading it. I have always had a hard time reading various bible, such as NKJV, KJV, NIV, etc. But this bible provides a lot of additional insightful information and further reading that goes beyong the bible verse. Sometimes reading the bible verse doesn't make sense and can be discouraging for the reader. This bible provides answers and thought provoking caveats. I highly recommend the Life Application Bible New Living Translation. I bought the leather addition.

Well if they missed ingredients that's still ok only if it tastes good because other products also use sugar and preservative. However it was the worst dried mango I ever had. It is neither pleasing nor healthful. I already lost money spending on it and didn't want to bother my mouth nor my health with the worst. So, I threw away the whole bag decisively. No attachment. I recommend philipine imported dired mango products. 7D mango is fine. For your reference, I bought some organic or natural dried mangoes. They are quite different from philipine products.

Bailey and Darden are critical of everyone and everything involved with the entire case, but they do not attempt to actually understand Koresh's point of view, nor do they seem to have tried to read any of the explanations put out of Koresh himself. Undoubtedly there were problems with the way the events were managed (or mis-managed) by the American government as well as the way that Koresh and his followers reacted but what the authors neglect to realise is that Koresh was highly intelligent and certainly believed in everything that he was doing.Really, I was unimpressed by the flippant handling of a sensitive subject and I would not recommend this to anyone that actually wants a balanced account of events."},{"rating":"2","title":"McClaine Lee has done it!","review":"Open any newspaper on any day of the week, but do not look at page one.

This book is not only the best inspirational guide out there, but it rivals being one of the best books I've read. A complementary book to this is Dreams gateway to the self by Ryan Belcher. It supports the view that all humans can achieve their lifes' goals by conscious acknowledgement of their inner selves.

This book should not have been written."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"Bronson obviously wasn't interested in anyone who didn't graduate from college, I guess they don't ask these sorts of questions and who cares what they do with their lives, anyway. Apparently how much your life questions matter is directly proportionate with your education, how prestigious your college was, and your annual income. Oh yes, and you best be between 25 and 40. Those with a Wall Street background and/or politics are preferred. This struck me as interesting as those two groups more than any other can be held responsible for the mess we are all in and they, more than any one else, came out of it smelling like a rose. Boy, I sure want to emulate them! The author's superior attitude came through in his writing and I found his elitism insulting."},{"rating":"1","title":"amateur writing and disingenuous","review":"I was very disappointed in the misspellings, the atrocious grammar and the definite narcissistic bent. (Many others have commented on this as well.) Too bad.Not only that, the author makes a big deal about interviewing so many fascinating people across all racial/economic, etc. lines, but three people featured in book are friends of his wife; two went to high school with her. I suppose it's not a huge deal but seems a bit lazy and disingenuous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trying but inspirational","review":"This is an astonishing collection of stories of ordinary people who \\"had unearthed their true calling, or at least those who were willing to try.\\" They are stories of \\"individual dilemmas and dramatic gambles,\\" not always successful. The tales of the author's subjects are interesting, and at times, inspirational. Unfortunately, Po Bronson tends to intersperse his own story from time to time, making it more personal and emotional to him, perhaps, but distracting and often irritating to the reader. If one skips lightly over these interruptions, the tales of his subjects are fascinating, all the more so for being grouped together in one volume.Vaughan Evans, business and career strategistAuthor, BACKING U!

I must say the designer of the cover did a great job, it catches the eye and the title draws one in. However, this book had nothing of substance, nothing I found thought provoking. I tried hard to like it but ending up thinking, \\"Why am I reading this thing\\"? I plowed through about 4/5 of the book and just simply could not take it anymore. Hopefully, someone at Goodwill will like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most arrogant writer?","review":"The book could have been great--the topic has such potential to be entertaining and inspiring. I don't mind the armchair psychology and I like reading about life decisions of real people. The problem is that the author is so arrogant that the book quickly becomes annoying. By the fifth chapter, it was almost ridiculous how he would compliment himself. I was calling my friends and reading aloud the text, just to laugh at it. By the 10th chapter I had to put the book down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaking new ground in self-absorption","review":"The book's subject is in constant conflict with the author's need to blow his own horn. The book should be retitled \\"Can we talk about me again?\\" It's rough sledding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-Serving and Vapid","review":"Po Bronson graduated from Stanford with a degree in Economics and then went on to a relatively successful career in i-banking. Suddenly he realized that his life was meaningless and be chucked it all be become a writer (What else?).He wrote this book about Yuppies like him who are seeking meaning in their lives. For the most part, they come up with the expected answers -- religion, teaching, working for non-profits.Because Bronson is relatively young (30s), he lacks the experience necessary to provide true insight (Sorry, Po, Silicon Valley existed long before you wrote about it). Because most of his subjects are his age and come from similarly privileged backgrounds, they do too. It would have proven more fruitful for him to have talked with some older people who had fought in the trenches and gained the perspective to view the quest from the far end.The subject obviously struck a chord. It remains for someone else to understand and explain it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Breath!","review":"This attempt at writing something meaningful falls flat on its face because you can sense the author went in this apparent self-help direction only because he knew high tech-based \\"novels\\" were flopping with the bust and he was exploring new ways to make money. The voice is not genuine and the sketches are poor. This book may sell, but it will be in everyone's heap of garage sale items a few years from now, in your choice of hardback or paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"The TV Show Was Better Than The Book","review":"I ran right out and purchased this book after hearingabout it on Book TV.

It was not helpful at all and was a waste of money. I think the author should change this title to Interesting Stories of People Who Changed Careers.

Well, this is NOT one of those books. I had heard it was a more \\"realistic\\" book about people who tried to figure out what they wanted to do with their lives, but so far, it seems that 90% of the people in this book either never figure out what they want, or they don't get it. I am through only about 15 chapters in this book and unsure if I want to continue! makes me long for the happy talk books...upshot is, don't waste your money on this book, when you can depressed by watching the news for free!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What you should do with this book.","review":"ASK FOR Y0UR MONEY BACK!!!

No such luck.In my progress through the book, I haven't read one profile where someone answered their question of personal meaning -- they're still looking. I finally got fed up after the third consecutive profile of a six-figure yuppie with an ivy league degree whose big-name job wasn't fulfilling them. Big freaking whoop, right? This just wasn't a helpful book at all, and it lacked the redeeming qualities of Bronson's prose in The Nudist on the Late Shift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disingenuous title. Should be called \\"Cute Little Stories of How Some Rich Overachievers Followed Their Dreams\\"","review":"I listened to this book on tape during a long car trip. Instead of offering real vocational advice, as the title seemed to promise, all it presented was a series of biographical sketches and interviews with high-powered people who changed careers. That's inspirational as far as that goes, but it doesn't really provide any useful information that the individual reader could apply to his own life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but agree with need for an editor","review":"I actually purchased the Audio CD version. In in the audio version I had to fight through the odd metaphors and exaggerated descriptions at every turn. The sporadic curse word \\"sh*t\\" and \\"FU money\\" were ill-fitting and shocking. Overall, there were some good stories documented and a few bits of wisdom interwoven throughout. It won't answer the ever popular, \\"What should I do with my life\\" but there are some questions that the author poses that anyone searching should consider."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Home Run","review":"Po Bronson came up to the plate, stared down the hardball question of what he should do with his life, and answered it by asking others what they wanted to do with their lives. He stays away from the diadactical, generally gets out of the way, and lets others tell their stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was the first book I ever threw in the recycling bin","review":"I've read a lot of these books, and I read this one after it first came out (before all those negative reviews were posted). I was telling a friend about this book the other day, and told her that I never throw books away. But I threw this one into my recycling bin rather than donate it to the local library book sale, because I wanted to save another poor soul from reading this book. And then I realized that I could save more poor souls the trouble if I added my opinion here. This book is all about Po Bronson. Read Barbara Sher's or Martha Beck's books if you want some sound advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Answer: Spend it doing other things than reading this book!","review":"The title is what makes this book sell well, not the content. I was intrigued by the hope for personal stories that added insight to figuring out one's path. This book is so obviously a self-indulgent journey for Bronson, who often interjects his own advice to the subjects throught their stories. From they way it is written, one would think Bronson has all the answers and that each person written about is so glad to have gained such wonderful knowledge from him. I have never experienced an author come across so cocky. What makes him a guru of how to choose a career path? While some of the stories were slighty interesting to read, the lack of any useful information along with the grandiose way in which the author views his own opinion, I would recommend spending your time on something more productive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't recommend it...","review":"I'm not even sure what the purpose of this book is. If it's meant to be a guide for people considering a change of careers, it fails. There's nothing here in the way of things to consider, questions to ask yourself, etc. But if it's just meant to be profiles of people who changed careers, it also fails. It sounds like all of these people have an interesting story to tell. But we never really get to hear too much about what they were thinking, or how they reached their decisions. What we do hear a lot about is what PO BRONSON thought about their situation, and how PO BRONSON contacted them, and what PO BRONSON learned from them, etc. That's when Po Bronson is not talking about moments in PO BRONSON'S life, and decisions PO BRONSON had to make. If he wants to devote one section to his own story, fine. But it seems like every story comes back around to PO BRONSON."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Be Much Better","review":"I had reservations buying this book based on the reviews I read on Amazon. I decided to give it a try anyway. I am only on page 19 and I am already sick of the author's analysis of his interviewees' journeys. The author would have benefitted from reading Stud Terkel's book Working. Just let the people tell their own story without an unqualifed analysis or counseling session! Their own simple words would have been much more beneficial. Please spare me the ego!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting idea","review":"\\"What should I do with my life\\" is an interesting and very well timed book that made me think a lot about my own futur. The concept of collecting stories is quite interesting although I enjoyed some stories a lot more than others. The only downside is that the writer seems to think he has the answers to everyone's questions although he is trying to convince for the opposite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are my people","review":"In theory, I should be the sort of person that Po is writing to and about - white, educated, middle-class - but I have to agree with the other negative reviews. The book is littered with MBAs, doctors, lawyers and the like who have made some sort of career transition. This falls so short of answering the ultimate question, but it also falls short of being an interesting career book unless you happen to be a banker or lawyer and you're looking to get off the fast track by BUYING A COMPANY that is a little more prosaic than what you did before, but nevertheless lucrative. I want to see stories of a ghetto kid who does NOT rise to become a doctor, but becomes a surfer and is happy. Something, anything, that doesn't sound so middle America as the stories in here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"When I found this book, I thought it was going to be about regular people who hated there work and the steps they took to get to a better place. Instead, the author uses many examples of his own life which make the narrative sound arrogant and self-serving. This is made more irritating by the fact that his life isn't really that interesting to begin with. There are a few parts that have merit but the bulk of this book is pointless drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"When did Po become the story?","review":"The author would be better served sticking to novels. 'Bombardiers' was a great piece of work. 'The First $20 Million...\\" was a good read as well. I can even stomach 'Nudist on the Late Shift' because it had some excellent reporting.But with this book, Po has clearly lost his way. As evidenced by the accompanying 'Fast Company' article, Po no longer thinks of himself as the writer. He nows sees himself as the central piece of the story. Further evidence was a recent San Francisco Chronicle article reviewing the book, replete with beefcake-like photos of the author and a 'review' that read something like a teenybooper scoring an interview with Justin Timberlake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reader from California","review":"After seeing the author and several of his subjects on Oprah, I bought the book. Unfortunately, the Oprah show made the book seem much more interesting than it really is. I found it boring, and the author's analysis of his subjects seemed forced and simply did not ring true to me. Overall, a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"What about the rest of us?","review":"This book is very narrow in it's cast of characters. Bronson would have all of us believe that only the super educated have problems with what to do with their lives and us blue collar types should.... well, he didn't even mention us. Read two chapters and you've read the whole book. Sorry I wasted the time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool concept, poor execution","review":"While this book surely contains a few interesting stories, I just couldn't get over the arrogance and ego of the author. In way too many stories Bronson writes about how his own genius suggestion or question to his subject suddenly makes them have an amazing epiphany, like they've just been hanging out for 20 years waiting for a rich white guy to tell them to what to do. If Bronson stepped back out of the action and let the subjects themselves remain the story, this book would have been much stronger."},{"rating":"1","title":"All About Po","review":"If you want to hear Po Bronson's value judgement about your choices in life, or anyone else's, buy this book. That is mostly what you get along with an incredible amount Bronson's egotistical commentary. Some of the storys were very interesting but Bronson interjected himself to the point of irritation and, in my opinion, belittled almost every one of his subjects. I've read reviews that criticize the book for being limited in its subjects (to over-educated white people), I'm one of those people and still couldn't stand to read it. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"the underbelly of a weird subculture","review":"The reviews here of this book amused me as much as the book itself distressed me. Like Po, I'm a Stanford grad. Unlike Po, I'm about 5 years too old to have gotten in on the dot-com bubble. I graduated into a recession! The mindset of most of these disappointed dot-commers is quite familiar to me. It's a subcultural attitude that led me and many of my set of Stanford \\"misfit\\" friends in droves to the campus counseling center to examine our \\"lack of ambition.\\"If you spend your late teens and early twenties \\"searching for meaning,\\" you can move on and pursue or attempt to pursue a suitable career path with an adequate balance of financial and psychological rewards.

Not very well written. No real insight, lessons learned, etc. Just not worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a miserable book!","review":"Don't waste your money. Read the title. He has nothing to say that the title doesn't say."},{"rating":"1","title":"What would Po Bronson do?","review":"After reading numerous reviews and after the NPR interview, I was really excited to read this book. In the end, it was nothing like I expected it to be. Instead of reading essays about career changes and interesting occupations, I felt like I was reading essays about what the author would do in each of the given situations. I find this to be rather arrogant given most of the circumstances. The book has much thought-provoking potential, but it falls way short. I found Bronson's observations to be a bit short sighted and not always on target. In the end, I was just annoyed. This definitely would have benefitted from a more \\"hands-off\\" approach on the author's part. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"anecdotal sociology","review":"The author evidently interviewed nearly a thousand people before selecting 50 odd stories to tell. While the selection bias is evident in the stories, overall it provides grist for the mill of \\"how might I plan the rest of my life\\". No answers but I wasn't expecting any. Were you? Some reviewers were bothered by the author's interjecting himself in the cast and into others lives. I found it humanizing. I supect the author is still wrestling with the what should I do with my life question himself, trying to decide whether to do social work or write. Stick with writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peoples' Lives are always interesting","review":"This is NOT a career guide as described in the Amazon text above. To me this was simply a book about people. It is the people here who speak, not Mr. Bronson. He is being a modern day Studs Terkel perhaps, but this book let's a variety of folks talk about how they stumbled through their lives trying to figure out what gives them satisfaction, how to earn money, where to live et. Peoples'lives and struggles are always interesting, and sometimes their mistakes do not have to be our mistakes, but their lives can be inspiring nevertheless. This might be a nice gift for younger people."},{"rating":"2","title":"We all face this at some point","review":"What Should I Do with My Life is a collection of personal interviews examining how people have answered this question and changed their lives. Many of the people in the book have different backgrounds, educations, and circumstances and came about their change in a variety of different methods. Some are stories of courage and some are stories of chance. Each story examines how the person arrived at their answer for their life. The stories include young people just starting out in their careers as well as older people looking to change careers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommend","review":"If you're looking for a self-help book or an easy answer to the question used as the book's title then don't bother buying it.But if you want to read about how others made critical changes in their lives and how they overcame the excuses that most of us make then you should buy this book.If I could afford to buy this for all of my friends then I would have done it months ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"It didn't work for me","review":"If you have an amiable or expressive social learning style this book would interest you. I have an analytical driver style so after the first chapter I was bored. I thought the book would be more like 'What Color is Your Parachute' or 'Whistle While You Work'. I expected some interesting means/methods to discover what I want to be when I grow up. If you find yourself lacking self-esteem or seek the comfort how others finds themselves, try this book. There was too much emphasis on the Generation 'Why' crowd in the interviews. Maybe the author feels more comfortable interviewing his generation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-Provoking, Artfully Written","review":"I've heard it said that you can tell by how someone writes whether they genuinely like people. Po Bronson clearly likes people, and it shines through in this book. I highly recommend it for anyone seeking to set foot in others' shoes, whether you are in the midst of self-examination (and shouldn't that be a constant for all of us, really?) or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you asking the right question??? Read this book!","review":"This is an amazing and truly inspiring book. Definitely not a how-to book with road maps but a book that guide you to the right questions..Thanks to Po, for the first time in my life I asked myself: \\"To what do I want to devote my life\\", instead of \\"what kind of job do i want to have\\". The amazing thing is, the right question in itself brings clarity and inspiration..This book is for thinkers who enjoy having their assumptions challenges.."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED","review":"After reading some reviews, I was looking forward to this book. I am amazed that this book received so many good/excellent reviews. I found that the stories were told in a very superficial/anecdotal manner. I did not find them interesting nor did I learn much. The author did try to present this topic in a new manner but I find that it does not work. The book is also mistitled since most of the people described in this book did not find an \\"answer to the ultimate question\\". Finally, the author refers to himself in every story. It was not necessary and I found it very annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Po-ly Executed","review":"As you read this book, it occurs to you that Po Bronson is nowhere NEAR as smart as he thinks he is. Of course, that only occurs to you after it dawns on you that he is a pompous idiot who thinks himself a genius. Isn't that the most annoying kind of idiot, after all?Anyway, Bronson apparently convinced some people to open up their lives to him so that he could either write annoying, limp-wristed paeans to them, praising their industrious souls or so that he could cruelly rake them over the coals and mock how lazy, stupid and spaced-out they are. After reading a few of his snide, superior, hyper-critical appraisals of peoples' lives, you begin to fantasize about the semi-talented Po Bronson getting the same treatment. If the quality of product reflected in this book is anything to go by, Po Bronson should have never \\"changed course\\" to become a \\"writer.\\"Certainly not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your life with this book!","review":"Short, sweet and just NOT worthy of an adult's attention.What appears to be a good insight into finding direction in your life is ACTUALLY a disconnected portrait of many people changing their lives. I felt the book just didn't come across as I had intended it too, and wound up feeling like I had just finished the supreme 'head scratcher' of all books.If you are looking for some direction or trying to facilitate some change in your life, do NOT waste your time or attention on this junk. It will only add to your confusion at an already confusing time in your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the \\"Boomerang Generation\\"","review":"Brosnon looks deep into peeople's personal experiences to find out how and why they chose their particular lines of work. This book certainly caters to a white-collar crowd. That, however, does not make it bad. For all the kids who are currently moving back home after college, this book is a great read to show them that there are many people in their situation and that they are not alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconclusive","review":"The book presents a large number of cases that are neither well-categorised nor described."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect ... not bad either","review":"This book obviously caught my eye because of the title. Everyone asks themselves this question... no matter where you are in your life's journey, it is a question that arises. Many of the stories were very inspiring, little bits that you remember through the day... some were definitely better than others.I bought the audiobook format which was perfect for my commute to work. The worst thing about the audiobook? Mr. Bronson tries to imitate his interviewees in the recording, and I found his accents quite annoying... the overall story was very good, but the delivery made me cringe! Sorry Po--stick to the writing, not the recording!Other than this flaw, I found the book enjoyable and inspiring. It gives you a sense of empowerment and inspiration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't look to it for the answers","review":"Trying to find your calling? Want more happiness and fulfillment in your life? You won't find it in this book. Bronson interviews a bunch of people who, for the most part, don't know what they want to do, and are still searching blindly.I have to suggest \\"Finding Your North Star\\" by Martha Beck for those who want more but aren't sure what. Then you can read this book for further motivation. But Bronson's book doesn't give t you those answers.The answers to the question, \\"What should I do with my life\\" lies in your heart, not this book. And Bronson doesn't tell you how to listen to your heart.And if there is any grammatical problems with this review, blame Amazon.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great title, doesn't deliver","review":"The few stories that are helpful are completely overshadowed by the rest of the book which really has nothing to do with his premise. The author's armchair pseudo psychological evaluation of the people he interviews completely muddles their stories. This book would be so much better if he culled more than half of them and got himself out of the way of the remainder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring romp","review":"If you read the Fast Company article profiling this book, then don't read any further. That article summed it up. It felt like Po went on a quest to find something truly meaningful in all his encounters with these people, but found little. I think his goal was simply \\"write another book no matter what\\" and so he did. Yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly bad","review":"A true waste of time. I was given it as a gift and felt like I had to finish it. There is simply way too much amateur psychology in the book, and way too much PO in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"what should I do with my life","review":"Mildly complex, mildly amusing tales of (usually fairly young) individuals who are searching for the \\"true\\" story of their lives. They hope and long (consciously, but mostly unconsciously) to align their work lives and work-identity with a sought-after \\"truth\\" about who they really are. Most of the individuals in the book have obviously not done intrapsychic therapy work, and therefore have not learned that their stories (some long and complicated, some short and obvious) all revolve around family-of-origin themes. Most of the individuals in this book have not yet recognized that reality, and the author only addresses this important issue briefly overall. Too bad, because it would be a much more powerful and useful exploration of the search for meaning, if Mr. Bronson included more wisdom about the REAL underlying themes of the human condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why me?","review":"Hoping to find inspiration in this book, I did find some. At least my life isn't as condescending and dull as Po Bronson's.Thank you for sharing some of the dullest stories I've ever read (although I'm sure they COULD be interesting if told by another less self absorbed writer).Also, your views of Texas, San Antonio and Alamo Heights are clouded.I think Po Bronson has potential as a writer (and as a person) if he would stop believing that the world revolves around him. Just look at his web site...gads!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Liked It...","review":"I have to agree... there are no answers here, only questions.

His approach to 'making it' is refreshing and informative. Thanks Po for the change!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't spend any part of your life reading this book!","review":"Waste of time. I was not looking for any divine inspiration (luckily), yet, still was disappointed. The author gives too much insight on himself (he is self-impressed and boring), preaches about what the moral of each profile should be (which should be self-evident), doesn't provide a fraction of the success stories that the publisher's review promises, and has his ugly mug blown up on the back of the dust cover, so I had to put it face up all of the time. Very few of the profiles were of people who actually figured it out, mostly of people who made mistakes, which is not what I purchased the book for and was not the premise of the subtitle.I don't write book reviews, but this one stank so bad, I couldn't help myself. But, let me help you: don't do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gaining wisdom from the experience of others","review":"Like many others I am currently asking myself the very question that is the title of this book. I found it fascinating to read about the stories of others from a variety of backgrounds and circumstances who have asked the same question. I didn't find the answer to my own question in this book, but by reading about the way others have answered it I gained a great deal of wisdom and insight. The style of the book is conversational, which works given that the book is essentially a series of personal stories gathered from interviews. The author adds some of his own analysis throughout the book, which provides food for thought whether you agree with him or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Should I Do With Po's Ego?","review":"This book was a terrible disappointment -- rather than thoughtfully exploring existential questions, Bronson supplants his subjects' stories with his own, constantly injecting his successful-millionaire-writer-who's-lost-his-way angst into anecdotes that might be insightful or instructive otherwise. Really, a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are over 35, don't bother...","review":"Bottom Line-- If you are young, well-educated, and making lots of money on Wall Street or Silicon Valley, but feel you need some inspiration to decide on a life-purpose or direction, you might get something out of this book. Otherwise, I would recommend that you look elsewhere.If you are older, you probably know more about life than what is presented here. However, some of the stories are interesting, so if you like to read about young, well-educated, rich people and how they, too, struggle with life, go ahead and read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"When I first heard of this book on the Oprah Winfrey show (she devoted an entire show to it) I was excited and thought it would help me make a career choice, as I was unhappy with the education field. I promptly went online and ordered it. Unfortunately, when I started to read it I did not find anything that would help me make a career decision or give me inspiration. The book is filled with stories about individuals who were unhappy with their current careers and make a 360 degree career change. For example, the businessman who became a police officer, the surgeon who became a shoe designer, and the lawyer who became a cake baker. While the stories are interesting I didn't take anything away from the book that would help me in my own search for a fulfilling career."},{"rating":"1","title":"trite and incomplete","review":"I read the first 50 pages before I decided to stop reading this book. Bronson slaps together trite, incomplete and uninsightful interviews with a lofty title. Instead of developing the stories of a few individuals, Bronson gives the reader many 4 page interviews that are full of irrelevant discussion and Bronson's own trite analysis. Perhaps only a page or two are devoted to describing the struggles the person went through to arrive at his/her decision. This book has no answer's and also fails to ask the right questions. It also does a poor job of describing the stories' of the interviewees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Po Bronson - What Should I Do with My Life","review":"The notion of searching for purpose has intrigued me and as a consequence I purchase and read a broad variety of books on the subject. This book is one best left in warehouses left gathering dust. It is superficial hype and damages the broader reputation of the industry and writers interested in providing perspective and programs dealing with the subject of calling and purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I can't understand those that think this is an important book. I thought it would be an interesting study, so I kept reading, hoping that the next chapter would show people that knew what they wanted to do with their lives and how they got there. Instead, more of people with no idea. Directly after reading this, I read Michael Lewis' Moneyball. He presents person after person who knows exactly what they want to do with their lives. Great book, read this instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"S Wong (San Francisco)","review":"Like any good book, there will be people who love it and then those who don't get it.

It will not get you any closer to answer 'what you should do with your life'. You are likely to be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jack M. Zufelt","review":"Not bad --- just not new. Po misses the boat -- unhless you like stories. I am so tired of hearng the same old things about success and how we can make our lives what we want which is why I wrote the book, The DNA of Success.There is a better, simpler way"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be called \\"What Does Po Bronson Tell Me To Do With My Life\\"","review":"Rarely do I ever stop reading a book, but I just had to quit on this one. The idea of the book is great, I'm a year or two out of college and am not quite sure what I want to do and where I want to go in life. I picked this book up at a used book store, and was excited to get started. Unfortunately, after only a couple of interviews it's painfully obvious that \\"Po Knows Best\\". This man is in love with himself. Every interview goes something like this:\\"So what do you want to do with your life?\\" - Po asks.\\"I'm not quite sure, but I really like to do ____\\" they respond.\\"Hey, why don't you do THAT for the rest of your life.\\" Po says.\\"You are a genius, I never thought of THAT before\\". they reply.And that's it, every story seems to be about how great Po is, and how he enlightens them to go for their true calling. It's also about how highly they all think of him, and how they all become friends with him. Please, avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of breath!","review":"I think Mr. Bronson must like to hear himself talk. This book is nothing but a rambling succession empty stories. The author offers no real insight, rather he is content listen to himself go on and on and on without making any meaningful contribution to an important subject. If the reader is asking themselves the question posed by this book, they would be better served by reading elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted More In-depth Profiles","review":"No, I am not having a midlife crisis. This book was on my to read list, but I forget the reason why I added it. Po spoke with 800 some people for this book and it shows as he skims through their experiences - I wish that he had winnowed down the list and did some more in-depth profiles. I did like when he went beyond a page or two with a particular person."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good title can sell an awful book","review":"I browsed this one in the library - and then berated the acquisitions person for wasting funds on it. Despite what the title implies, this effort is not the least bit insightful. The repetitive career-switch tales are more monotonous than interesting. Do not confuse this author with a \\"writer\\" - that term implies, at the very least, the ability to competently use the language and sensibly organize information. The only thing an intelligent person can take away from this book is that a catchy title and cover copy can sell any book - even if the text is garbage. Those 4 and 5 star reviews have to be bogus."},{"rating":"1","title":"a dull experience","review":"I bought the audio version of this book because it was under five bucks and I was trying to get my Amazon total over $25 so I'd get free shipping. I should have just paid for the shipping. Not much to add to the many negative reviews other than to say it's read poorly as well as written poorly due to Bronson's somnambulent articulation and unflattering imitations of various interviewees' voices and supposed accents. I listened all the way through, hoping for a redeeming bit of insight at the end, but no such luck. At least the audio version was abridged."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuppie transition UGHHHHHHH","review":"I picked up this book in the library because it sounded interesting. Bad move. This book shows stories of professional,educated white collar workers who decide they would like to follow their dreams and passions. This usually comes after a few years of gorging themselves on their six figure salaries,reveling in self-importance and pondering life's meaning. This low review is not indicative of Po Bronson though. I enjoyed his personal anecdotes and two stories in particular. The suicide story was really well written and the lawyer who became a truck driver was also. How are techies,investment bankers,and tax attorneys more interesting than ski guides and militia men."},{"rating":"1","title":"Massive waste of time","review":"I am upset at how much of a waste this book was ,nothing useful or insightful just unfinished stories of quick coffee cup meetings with people in flux."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such twaddle!","review":"I could tell from the other low rated reviews, and from the title of one of Po's other books, \\"The First 20 million is the hardest\\" where his head is, and how useless anything he could say could be!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One thing you shouldn't do with your life:read this book","review":"I was very disappointed with this book.The title and theme really grabbed me. What you will read are the ramblings of several peoples current life stories that are boring and unhelpful. It is like Po searched out a bunch of aimless people doing strange things.The bookis no help for a typical middle class person or a blue collar worker trying to get a foot in a new door. I am tired of publishers publishing books that never arrive at any point or recommended solution. Like the readers are just blessed to be reading stlye, good English, and punctuation. Where are the solutions?Or at least be thought provoking.This book was neither."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless Book With No Answers","review":"If the title of this book interests you, it's probably because you're confused about your life and where you fit in. It is seemingly a \\"self-help\\" book, or at least that's what the title implies. While the writing is okay, the author and the stories fail horribly in providing what is most important -- the ANSWER TO THE TITLE QUESTION - What Should I Do With My Life? I still don't know what to do with my life and, although I laughed a few times and connected with some of the stories, this was a useless read. It's all well and good to present stories about people who wandered for years and couldn't find their calling, but the book doesn't give any depth or helpful advice. If you're confused already this book won't help clear anything up -- skip it and put the money towards a job counseling session instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice title, but not so good content","review":"I began reading the book with a lot of spectation, but after the 4th or 5th chapter I was bored. It's about life of people that decided to change their lifes but it's just too superficial.I left the book, and just when I don't have anything else to read I open it again and read one more life.I hope there are better books to help us decide a change of life style."},{"rating":"1","title":"didnt buy","review":"to be honest, i was going to buy this book, i saw it in the bookstore, jumped through different sections, read several pages, then realized.....the title is a misleading. It should say \\"what other people did\\". And is that the type of book i was looking for....no. I found the book basically just detailed other peoples lives, and most of them that found success or happiness....seemed to fall into it by accident. There was no lesson here, or magical formula. Just luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better to look elsewhere","review":"Po Bronson offers really no insight, and the writing drags and exhausts. I recommend readers to Working by Studs Terkel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time!","review":"This book was not at all what it seems. The idea sounds great, and the write ups make it sound like Po has put together a masterpiece that should be required reading for someone who is searching for their lot in life. ThIS BOOK IS AS FAR FROM THE MARK AS CAN BE! It is absolutely terrible. How could something that sounds so great be so bad? I thought it was me. So I lent this book to my friend because he was doing some soul searching as well. He also concluded that this book is an aweful read and not what it seems. Save your money...this book is not worth the paper it's printed on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst book i have ever read","review":"This book was terrible. It was all about rich people complaining about what they should do with their life. In this book Po Branson makes out janitors and other low paying jobs as not having any meaning. When are people like Po and these other rich people in the book gonna realize that a job does not make the person. After all jesus was a carpernter and look at the signifigance of his personality. According to Po and the rich people in this book a carpenter wouldnt be a good enough profession for them. The people in this book disgust me with their consumerism and shallow personalities. All they care about is themselves and what other people will think of them. I dont define myself by the job I work or the things I own. But the people in this book all care about those meaningless things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy the hype","review":"If you're interested in what some unbiased reviewers actually think about this book you might want to check out the excoriating reviews in the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice stories but no real answers to the question he poses","review":"I was disappointed in this book. I felt it was a bait and switch. Some of the stories were interesting to read, but at the end of book, I was thinking \\"So what?\\" Po Bronson is a good writer, and he interviews a lot of different kinds of people, but his insights are quite limited, and colored by his limited perspective. I agree with one of the other reviewers- I found The Purpose Driven Life: What On Earth am I Here For? to have a lot more meat to it. Bronson's book was entirely predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't look for answers here","review":"If you are looking for answers then this is not the book to buy. Its messy and deliberately so as it reflects ordinary people questioning their lives and making choices that don't always work out. Treat it as a dialogue that provokes insight perhaps into your own situation. At least it shows you are not alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"weight gain","review":"I have a 2 yr old Doberman who I have tried on EVERYTHING.

As the liner notes state, Merle Haggard has \\"updated\\" his sound and the songs that he chose to record for this album are well worth the investment for this CD. Especially take note of the duet with John Anderson called Winds of Change. A handful of the songs on this CD should be hits and would be hits if today's radio stations would give this country music icon some air-time. When I saw Haggard in concert recently I was extremely dissappointed that these songs were not performed. So....the only way to hear them is to buy this CD.

After replacing with a OEM filter I noticed that these filters have a \\"round\\" gasket while the OEM filters have a \\"flat\\" type gasket.

The size of the flare is just slightly off. When the flare is forced into the actual position, the other side pops off. I've had them for a week, and I had to purchase more trim tape. When this tape is placed on top of the original tape, it causes a gap. I haven't found an answer yet.Pretty to look at but not really funtional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice book","review":"This is a very well put together book.

It is amazing how much dirt it picks up. It goes in all the nooks and crannies that I avoid and of course it goes under the bed and other furniture. And it is soooo easy. If you have oriental rugs then make sure the fringe is tucked under."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's cheaper to sweep!","review":"I really, really wanted a Roomba, but it's just not what I thought it would be. It would probably work better if we didn't have any furniture, because once it runs into a table leg, it has to keep hitting it until it works far enough to the side for the sensor to send it off in a new direction. I have tile floors through my home, but in the kitchen the Roomba will wedge itself under the cabinets and get stuck. In the living room it will bounce itself off of one sofa leg into another, same thing in the bedroom, it bounces off of one leg of the bedframe into another. The result is that there are a lot of spots that the Roomba never covers and some that it covers over and over. If you have huge rooms and minimal furniture the Roomba may work for you, but if you live in an 1800 sq foot home with the average amount of furniture, it's much faster and more effective to just use a broom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steer Clear of Remanufactured Roomba's","review":"We're long-time fans of the Roomba and decided to pick up another unit for our beach house. The price on the reconditioned units was appealing. That was the beginning of the nightmare. The first unit would run for about 5 minutes and then just stop. The replacement unit (weeks later!) would run about 2 minutes and then had a dead battery. If their new units worked like these reconditioned items, they would have been out of business long ago.

I turned it off and packaged it back up and sent it back. I probably would have been fine keeping it, it did pick up like it should. It just sounded funny compared to my new Roomba.

Oh well, I guess we'll be trying it out early."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not yet mature","review":"The Roomba failed to clean all areas of my apartment (which has a hardwood floor plus some rugs on top). Often it recognized the rug's edges as barriers when coming from the plain floor. Though, even in rooms with no rugs, it didn't clean all the spots. The cleaning algorithm is pretty insufficient. I expected the robot to create some map of the apartment on the go and to then clean it in a systematic manner. Instead, it seems the robot can remember only the last turn. The only really planned movements are those following straight walls.To sum up, hardware itself is very good, but cleaning the algorithm (and possibly the computing hardware) needs to be improved significantly. There are many more sophisticated cleaning algorithms in robot research."},{"rating":"1","title":"misled","review":"When I purchased this item I did not see anywhere that it was remanufactured.

One of the virtual wall units was missing and the brush retainer broke the first time we removed it (the plastic looked to be bad). To IRobot's credit, they immediately sent a new wall unit and a new retainer, however the replacement was also bad (the plastic was warped and wouldn't fit). The third retainer was fine and again, IRobot responded very quickly. The unit works great, although I don't get the 120 minutes indicated on our carpet (more like an hour 15 or so). For the price I paid for this unit, I can't fault it and although I'm not sure how it will hold up over the long term, it does work well now and I'm impressed with the quick response I've received from the company!

He also loves gadgets.The first time we ran Roomba, it got clogged up and stopped running before it got back to its base. My husband cleaned it out really good, vacuumed the floors with the old vacuum cleaner so we would have less accumulation (assuming a week's worth was too much for it to deal with), and set Roomba to work in the middle of the night every night.It works great!

We used it infrequently . . . my husband was a bigger fan than I. And, after no more than 6 uses over a period of 4 years, it simply stopped keeping a charge. In addition, the robot is rather noisy on hardwood floors (not so much on carpet), and more cute than thorough (misses under some furniture and in some corners). But, when it worked, it captured most of the dust, ash, cat hair, and grit that finds its way onto our floors every day.

The little rotating \\"corner\\" brush flips crumbs like a hockey puck to the far corners of your room. It leaves little piles of debris in the crevice of the threshold and next to the area rug or kitchen mat. Pet hair and dust get inextricably wound in the brushes. Roomba can't seem to climb onto an area rug from the bare floor, but has managed to tumble down the cellar stairs more than once. It won't pick up cereal or kibbles or chips, and when I put a pile of dust in the center of the floor to test it, it only found half of it.It's a neat gadget. It just doesn't clean.

I tried to use it after this inactivity. The battery was dead and could not be re-charged. As it was an old model Roomba would not replace the battery. They would give me 15% off the $85 price to replace the battery. I considered it until one CS rep told me the whole unit was probably bad due to the long charging with no use.

In fact, this was my third purchase, but my first remanufactured product. What a headache! The product worked correctly just three times, then died. Both technical support and customer service from Irobot were helpful and prompt, but still took weeks to resolve the issues. I tried a different way of recharging, which didn't work. Then they replaced the battery, but that still didn't solve the problem. Ultimately I had to send the product back, then waited more than a month for a replacement, which was on backorder. Finally, they substituted a different model, and which works just as advertised. I'd never buy another remanufactured model. But I still believe in Irobot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last long","review":"Within a couple of weeks, my roomba had some sort of mental breakdown and now will only go in a small circle, like its confused and imaging objects blocking its way that aren't there.

Well, that is until today....My cat (who is angry we won't let her go outside) left us a little present on the floor. The roomba found it and proceeded smear the gift all over the apartment. I've now had to bleach my entire apartment floor and clean out all the little nooks and crannies in the roomba.

On that day you are completely out of luck with any servicing. Ours quit operating properly shortly after the one year warranty expired. I would expect to pay for shipping and even pay to have my unit serviced. But all Roomba would do is offer to sell me another one. Why would I buy another unit of something that already broke once and that no one on God's green earth can service. It is a complex machine. So about a hundred different things can go wrong. If you are beyond waranty period forget IRobot company helping you. Their phone support is pitiful and their service department does not exist. Any company that wilfully turns happy customers into unhappy customers everyday will soon be out of business."},{"rating":"1","title":"there customer service stinks","review":"I had a problem with my roomba after only two days. I wasn't really too worried about it because it was remanufactured so I thought I might have a problem. I contacted irobot customer service. They diagnosed the problem and told me they would send me out a replacement roomba. After a week went by and no one contacted me with any shipping information I went back to the customer service site to complain. Thy had closed my service ticket. I asked for someone to update the status and this went on for more than a week with no response from them. When I asked them to do something to male this experience a little more palatable for me they wouldn't upgrade the shipping of the replacemnet roomba. The roomba may be great I have no idea but the company behind it doesn't take care of it's customers. I would not recommend purchasing a roomba for that reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product was defective had to order from Allergy Be Gone","review":"We ordered this product from Amazon, but product arrived defective.

It really looked beat up.We did not want to bother going for an exchange. Our feeling was that if they let one really bad unit leave their shop, they would probably let another one go out the same way.We asked for a refund and are waiting to find out how they handle returns.Bottom line: Wasted money and wasted time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roomba Bafoomba","review":"I'm not overly impressed with this vacuum cleaner.

It arrived in a fairly thin bag, around the regular roomba box which had a tear in it and had clearly suffered some abuse either in transit or before shipment. At any rate, it turned out that the bristle guard was broken, and after we got that replaced by the iRobot people, the Roomba still doesn't retain its charge well. I'm guessing since it was refurbished, the Amazon customer service people, who were very prompt in response, were out of stock to send another one (hopefully an operational one) and could only offer a refund if we sent it back, plus a $10 discount on future purchases. Perhaps this was an anomaly, but at this point in time (about 4 weeks after the roomba arrived in the mail), the fact that it does not run properly still has not been resolved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after 1 week","review":"I bought this remanufactured roomba from amazon.

We just put in hardwood floors and he keeps the grass out of his part of the house. He runs for a little less time then advertised but still goes for almost an hour.

The new one works great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product *Small Mis-Advertisment by AMAZON*","review":"First, I want to say that this is not a review of the Remanufactured Roomba, but more of a notice. The AMAZON website states that the Remanufactured iRobot Roomba 4230 Remote Scheduler Robotic Vacuum comes with a cleaning tool and spare brush pack (which is a $30 value). This is not true. The box for the remanufactured roomba states that it includes a Roomba Scheduler, scheduling remote, scheduling virtual walls (2), home base, fast charger, and APS battery.

This thing always has dirt and cat hair in it at the end of the day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"I love my Roomba. Even though it was refurbished, it works wonderfully. Hard wood floors are a nightmare when it comes to hair and dust buildup. I used to have to sweep at least twice a week. Not anymore.

My only complaint is it has trouble climbing from the floor onto my rugs. I usually have to prod it along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, if amateurish, debut","review":"Shadows Fall debuted with this album, a slice of aggressive, although diverse metalcore. Boston, MA has emerged as a sort of capital for metalcore bands in recent years, and this band played a significant part in the burgeoning scene. With that aside, I feel that Somber Eyes To The Sky stands as the band's greatest musical statement, despite an apparent number of flaws.Due to lousy production, the songs suffer during the transitions from acoustic breaks to pummeling riff assaults, much like in the second track \\"Pure\\". I noticed that the drummer falls behind during more of the technically demanding parts, but on a debut album this can be overlooked. The layered vocals and graceful guitar harmonies deserve praise, and the band never steps into self-indulgent territories. Although the second half of the album isn't as strong as the first, I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys hardcore, metalcore, or \\"Gothenburg\\" tinged metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the album that started it all!","review":"Originally released in 1998, this Shadows Fall CD features original lead singer Phil Labonte, who is now with a great death metal band called All That Remains. Although some of these songs were re-recorded for the latest release \\"Of One Blood\\", this is still a great CD to pick up, particularly if you prefer death metal vocals. Although Shadows Fall is not considered to be a death metal band (especially now), Labonte brought that element to the band in a very positive way. Although I personally prefer \\"Of One Blood\\", \\"Somber Eyes to the Sky\\" is great and well deserving of 5 stars! Shadows Fall fans really should pick up both of these CD's. Also, be sure to check out All That Remains, you'll be glad you did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"greater things to come","review":"This cd is so bad its not funny...sure if you like bad metal all mushed together thats sounds like static than this is the album to get.

The original 1970 film may provide an insight as to how Barfly's Wanda found herself in her present state seventeen years later.

Most of the plots are very predictable. It always starts out with our duo finding a body. The rest of the mystery kinds of dribbles away after that.

But the object lesson the author is trying to teach is the unpleasant truth of 18th century English inheritance laws. There are many repetitive passages about her full lips and swirling,falling,curling, auburn, tresses and rustling of her silk riding skirts, and much admiring her self in the mirror; all observed from Beatrice's point of view. Makes for very flat secondary characters. I agree with another reader that VC Andrews is better at this sort of thing.I would not read another book in this series, but her book about Anne Boelyn was very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite Phillippa Gregory","review":"I would like to add my comment to the many reviews already here. I was very disappointed in this book. It was totally different from her Elizabethen stories.

Reader beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite","review":"I am a huge Philippa Gregory fan and it all started with this book and the rest of the Wideacre series.

She has a style fit for anyone who loves the written word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made me sick","review":"This book made me sick! I wish I would have ready the commentary about the incest before I bought the book. I thought the incest portion would just be a small part and then move on.

I loved Gregory's later books about the Boleyns, but this one was depressing, depraved, and very disappointing. Beatrice, the main character, is beyond evil and twisted. As I read, I kept expecting (hoping) she would have a revelation and redeem herself. I'm not one to put down a book once I've started, so I continued reading, but in hindsight I wish I had not wasted my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filthy","review":"This is the first book I have read in a while that I just didn't like and really didn't want to finish AND would never recommend. I can't say I hated it because it did make me hope for the redemption of the main character and I could understand her love of the land. However, the main character is everything you wouldn't want to be and will stop at nothing to get what she wants. I just couldn't stomach a lot of what happened; it was too much. She commits about every sin you can think of (and beyond). It was like reading into every dirty, twisted thought in the authors imagination that no one else would dare put on paper. So if you are interested in that kind of reading you'll probably love it---but not me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Disgusting Character Ever","review":"I actually read this entire book just to see if/how Beatrice would get what was coming to her. Yes, the book is about incest. The ads and cover I've seen for this book state something like \\"Murder, Incest, Betrayal\\" or something like that so it should come as no shock that it is about incest. The thing I didn't like was that about 2/3 of the book seemed to be about nothing but sex. Sex scene after sex scene. I frankly belive it's better to leave it to the imagination. We all know what happens when you have sex. But really it seemed more wrong that Beatrice and her brother acted like a couple in love. It wasn't just the incest that was gross. Gregory's descriptions of other physical things left me queasy at times. After everything, I think what Beatrice did to her husband had to be one of the vilest acts I've ever read. This book was at the most okay and I do not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is pure trash","review":"I have enjoyed two of this author's books, and thought this would be of similar quality.

This novel has characters with no redeeming qualities and after an interesting beginning, goes steadily downhill from there. I doubt I will ever read another book by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I had read the whole series of books written by Gregory on the court of Henry the VIII and I loved them. I felt like I was really learning about history at the same time that I was reading an interesting story with a bit of romance/intrigue, etc. I thought that the Wideacre series might be more of the same. Instead, this book simply reads more like a torrid romance novel set in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book.","review":"I read all the Philippa Gregory novels about the English royalty and loved them. Wideacre is a depressing, preposterous, terrible book. I can't finish it. Two hundred pages to go, and the heroine has already killed her parents, attempted to murder her lover, and made a lover (and two children) from her brother. Yuck! There is nothing that redeems this piece of crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"guilty pleasure","review":"It's like reading a better written \\"Flowers in the Attic\\" but with a historical backdrop that makes you feel less dirty. Same scandalous and incestuous themes, but with a slightly more intellectual veneer. Still, reading it was like passing a horrible car crash on the highway and not wanting to rubberneck like the rest of the fools, but not being able to tear your eyes away from the carnage. Exactly like that.Couldn't put it down. Sabotaged my plans to complete my Advanced Physiology reading for two straight days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid This Book","review":"I should have read the reviews on this book before reading it. I managed to finish it only because I kept hoping for Beatrice Lacey to come to her senses. The incest plotline, which captivated me in V.C. Andrews' works as a teenager, now repulses me and made me want to throw this book into a raging fire. I can only recommend this book to people who thrive on watching people self-destruct. I think the author was shooting for something similar to The Picture of Dorian Gray (Oscar Wilde), and grossly missed the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"portrait of a sociopath","review":"The book is fascinating in the fact that it is a study of a woman with antisocial personality disorder (the traditional psychopath or sociopath). She is also extremely narcisstic.The fascination with her lessens as she progresses in her mental illness. She plays the dominatrix with her brother and makes all the people around her suffer. She is responsible for many deaths in her short life. The amount of suffering she caused was disturbing to this reader. I disliked her so much!Soon her psychopathology became more that I could bear to continue reading. I only finished the book because of the other characters. I wanted to see what would happen to them.The details of farming and the class systems were interesting to read, but I do not recommend the book for lovers of historical fiction with strong women characters. Beatrice Lacey has been compared to Scarlett O'Hara in some reviews I have read. Scarlet had many redeeming qualities, and Beatrice has absolutely none."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrifying!","review":"I've read The Other Boleyn Girl and a great deal of Philippa Gregory's other works and found them to be thoroughly enjoyable and hard to put down. It is therefore unfathomable to me that she could have written such a disgusting, morally-repulsive \\"novel\\" (and I use the term loosely)such as this.This book is about a woman's desperate need to retain control of the land she grew up on. Land which, by legal rights, passed to her dimwitted, sexually depraved, mouse of a brother. The incest scenes are rife and horrifyingly detailed.I could not bring myself to even finish this book, and I certainly was not about to read the final two in the trilogy. If you have even the smallest thread of moral fiber...run the other way. This book will make you ill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome","review":"I have nothing against antiheros or evil characters, but I absolutely hated this book. In Beatrice Lacey, Philippa Gregory gives us an utterly unlikable heroine, one completely lacking in redeeming values. As a result, the book becomes a depressing slog through one predictable mess after another. Every time Beatrice is presented with two possible courses of action -- one that will spare herself and others pain, and one that will cause more pain and loss, she chooses evil, even when the kinder choice would also be better for her, practically speaking. After a while, this gets terribly boring -- the reader doesn't know exactly what horrible situation will arise next, but he or she can rest assured that Beatrice will make the worst of it. Frankly, a character this one-dimensional is just no fun. I found myself wishing her ex-lover would just come back and kill her already so the book could end (I'm not giving anything away here. It's clear almost from the outset how things will end)."},{"rating":"1","title":"You must be joking!","review":"This is possibly the worst book I have ever attempted to read. I say 'attempted' because I couldn't bring myself to finish it. Instead I skipped to the last page, just to confirm that the end was exactly as I expected it to be, and saved myself reading the rest of this drivel.I picked up Wideacre because I had read some later stuff of Gregory's and really enjoyed it. She has certainly come a long way as a writer, because this is woeful. Wideacre is bizzarely implausable and yet completely predictable. It's hard to fathom how Gregory expects us to swallow so many improbabilities in 600-odd pages and not place the book in the fantasy category. Apparently it all happens again with a sequel, but I won't be reading it.If you enjoy historical fiction read The Other Boleyn Girl. Read The Wise Woman. Read Earthly Joys. They are all great. Do not read Wideacre - it will only make you laugh (and it's not a comedy)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the Novice Reader","review":"This piece is not for the novice reader, but if you yearn for literary analysis on innumerable levels from Feminist to Freudian, you have found it here. However, if you want only a pleasant, obvious historical romance, keep on looking. There are themes here that are congruent from Medea to Weathuring Heights. It embraces literary themes from Greek tragedies to Shakespeare. The levels of analysis here are endless. One could read it hundreds of times, and close the book with different impressions each time."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful historian","review":"I couldn't put it down. This book is a page turner. I love the writings of philippa gregory. She is a wonderful historian. I recommend anything by her if you love the history of England."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it!","review":"I read this trilogy a while back and based on the reviews, I felt compelled to write my own. I thought ( as creepy as it may be in parts) that this book, and Meridon may be the best of the three.Without giving detail away, as strange as it may be, I find myself still thinking about these books. Wonderfully written. Philippa can capture anyone in her story telling. As much as you may find yourself hating a character in this book, you cannot put it down. It's exciting, and thrilling and that's what I look for in these kinds of books. I found myself a bit bored at times with The Favoured Child, but I enjoyed Meridon, which made up for the second.If you like Philippa, you'll enjoy these, as a break from her usual. It's even better to read an author who can do more than just one type of novel.She's a wonderful author and I am never disappointed. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never met a character to unbalanced","review":"I started out liking Beatrice, feeling maybe a bit bad for her. But she had serious mental illnesses and it bugged me more than any of the other things going on in the novel. It felt like a cross between Gone with the Wind and The Other Boleyn Girl. I could barely stand to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is it crazy to root for an insane heroine?","review":"Beatrice Lacey was such a strong character and heroine that I felt guilty rooting for her as she got more and more insane. I never knew what Beatrice was going to pull next, or if she would get away with it. So many twists and turns among a rich history, I enjoyed learning more about the people who lived during this pivotal time. I am looking forward to reading the next Wideacre book to see how Beatrice's legacy unfolds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incest!","review":"I've purchased and enjoyed several Phillipa Gregory novels and was very dissapointed to read a about an incestual relationship between a brother and sister as if it was a romance. Very dissapointing. Would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gregory can do better","review":"I enjoyed \\"The Other Boleyn Girl \\" and \\"The Queens Fool\\" tremendously. Foool that I am myself, I enthusiastically ordered all three Wideacre novels. What a disappointment. If you are looking for the same delightful period historic drama you will not find them in the \\"Wideacre\\" trilogy. Here is the romantic drama at it's lowest - incest, spicy sex and Fate without the merit of the honest, interesting characters Gregory learned to build later. The writing is unripe and the story sour. I AM looking forward to reading \\"The Virgin's Lover\\", hoping, with some trepidation, to discover again the mature Gregory I enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get past the incest of this book - made me sick","review":"I enjoyed the first act of this book, but just couldn't believe, and then couldn't continue with one of the main plot lines of this novel which involved the continual discussion of overpowering lust between brother & sister. Call me old fashioned...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"I absolutely hate this book! The incest is so disgusting - and the auther tries to make is appear normal and sexy - I got the stomach flu after starting this book - it was probably the book that caused it! I threw it away and did not finish it! Very dissappointing!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a shame...","review":"...that Ms. Gregory felt she had to resort to the crude and vulgar story lines in this series. Yes, I read all three. They came in a set and I was hoping the other two books would explain whys and wherefores of the first book, perhaps to redeem the characters and justify their actions. They didn't. The plot and characters just got worse and worse. And like a car wreck, I couldn't help but look.As many have said, there are no redeeming qualities in any of the main characters. I hoped for Beatrice to have a change of heart which never occurred. She makes Scarlett O'Hara look like Mother Teresa.I, too, really enjoyed the Tudor series and was wanting more. Unfortunately, this series doesn't even come close.While I didn't go as far as to shred the books, I put them in my \\"things for the garage sale\\" box. Maybe I'll get a few of my wasted dollars back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possibly the worst book I have ever read","review":"I very much enjoyed some of the author's other books. Even keeping in mind that this was her first novel, it is thoroughly sub-par. The character are unbelievable, the situations are unlikey and the justifications for the actions of the characters are badly conceived.Skip this and go straight to the author's books on the Tudor women, don't waste your time with this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repulsive waste of time","review":"Having read and loved several other items by this author, I was delighted to find this book cheap at a garage sale. Knowing nothing about it, I dove right into it.Voluntary incest!?!The main character was repugnant and the plot ridiculous. The whole thing made my skin crawl. It is one of the few novels in my life I simply could not finish. I actually SHREDDED it! I laughed at myself afterwards but at the time I found it so disturbing I didn't want any responsibility for some other unsuspecting reader to pick up my copy of this book. (As I recall, I chose the shredder, which I ruined, because the whole book burning thing seemed so reactionary--as if shredding was normal!)The world is filled with good books, challenging books, thoughtful books, happy books, sad books. This is not any of those. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Woman Had to Do","review":"To begin with, Phillapa Gregory is one of the most inspiring authors I have ever come across. She writes with such detail its like the words create a perfect video for you. While this book is different from her others because this is based on a fiction character (unlike her Tudor novels) it is just as good and as well written. Many of the reviews talk poorly about the main character, Beatrice, because of all of her selfish and somewhat sick motives, what they may not understand is this is what she had to do as a woman in that time period. Back then women were given no respect and men were given everything automatically (even though most of them were selfish pigs). So to get even an ounce of respect she had to be just like the men. I feel like back in those days women had to go even farther than men in terms of backstabbing to get what they wanted in life. So I would most definitely recommend reading this book and the two after in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favorite Gregory novel....","review":"After reading numerous of Gregory's book, I was so looking forward to another. This book is about the young and beautiful Beatrice, who does pretty much anything to keep her land. Since she isn't able to inherit it at her father's death (which, of course, she has a hand in) she does pretty much anything to keep her hold on it.The incest really turned me off. I kept hoping it would eventually fizzle out, but after fathering the 2nd child by her brother, I just was even more turned off. There is no limit to what Beatrice will do to keep her land, but it gets a little ridiculous.After making it through about 2/3 of the book, I had to skip to the end and find out if it would be worth finishing. It really wasn't, as there is no silver lining. She does end up getting what she deserves but there is no joy in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the faint of heart","review":"I love Philipps Gregory and I love books that follow a series- so I must admit I really enjoyed the Wideacre trilogy. Beatrice is a great character, even though she is evil and perverse, especially in the second half of the novel, you cannot help being attached to her. I loved the setting of the novel, and it is a page-turner. However the incest, murders, and shockingly evil behavior of Beatrice could turn many readers off. Through parts of the novel I was simultaneously repelled and enthralled. So be forewarned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely horrible!","review":"I could not even finish the book because of how disturbing, as well as unrealistic, the plot was. It was a complete waste of money. This was my first time reading Philippa Gregory and though I still think I am going to give her other works a chance, do not waste your money on this one. If you do feel compelled to read it, check the book out from your library; at least this way it won't cost you anything when you are disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent writing fails to motivate reader to finish book","review":"I rated this book four stars only because the writing is so excellent. I could not finsh this book however, merely because I was so sick of how vain this Beatrice was. You can only stand to read \\"I was so lovely\\" or \\"I was as lovely as a sleek pampered cat\\" so many times before I wanted to throw the book down in disgust.Also, if there would have been any way of sympathizing with the character, I would have finished, but I read about 300 pages and couldn't take it anymore. Not only endlessly vain but totally psycotic! Read The Queens Fool instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incestual Yet Fascinating","review":"I love Gregory's books, however the \\"Wideacre\\" series is slightly odd. I might be biased in my opinion because I adore Gregory's other books \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" and \\"The Queen's Fool\\" and had I read \\"Wideacre\\" before falling in love with those other novels, I think my opinion would be quite different. \\"Wideacre\\" is wonderfully written with an easy reading flow and an addictive story, yet some aspects might be rather condradictive to most morals and values. I find the idea of a character that seduces her brother into having 2 children with her (which strangely enough seem to surpass all rules of incest and are born without birth defects) quite disturbing. I think it is a wonderful story about a woman's struggle in 18th century England to claim land and titles through her own cunning. It is pleasantly wicked yet disturbing. Beatrice is truley unlike any character you will ever run across."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wideacre","review":"I have never sent in a review, but this novel is so disappointing I felt I owed it to your readers to say: \\"Don't bother\\"! I thoroughly enjoyed \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\"..it is intelligently written and a fun ride! I was eager to read another by Ms. Gregory - \\"Wideacre\\" is tedious and uninteresting and dull and long and....etc etc. Don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SICK!","review":"OK, As stated by many others, I am not a prude, but this book was twisted! The incestual relationship with the brother was (I am sitting here trying to come up with the right words, but can only come up with...) gross! Whenever the main character had the chance to do right, she screwed up. There was not one redeeming quality in her, making it difficult to want to continue on with the book.

Not one of Gregory's best, that is for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a car wreck....","review":"you don't want to watch, but you can't help yourself.A few times I was tempted to put the book down, as it was quite disturbing. In the end, I stuck with it.

I was extremely disappointed by the mentally disturbed heroine who whips her brother, fobs off their offspring into other members of the family and proceeds to single-handedly bankrupt the whole estate in a time when women were delegated to housekeeping roles. A little reality, please!!! I finished the book by reading only one or two sentences per superfluously verbose page, since unfortunately I was on vacation with little access to other reading material. I promptly bought the other trilogy books to the used book store without even opening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eeeeewwwww!","review":"I kept wondering for a while where this story was gonna go.It had the makings of greatness. But I guess the author wanted to keep predictability to a minimum---I assumed it would be something of a ROMANCE! Hello!? I read ahead when I got tired of messing around with the stable boy or whatever----I am sorry, but I am not interested in a book on INCEST. That is disgusting.I just don't want to do that. Especially as engrossing an aspect as sleeping with your brother for 600 pages. Yuck.The beginning bones of the story were good. The rest of the tragedy was great. But incest I just can't take. Another person, have at it. For the most part, it was well written in a Scarlett-O'Hara-ish way. That part was good. Can't tell ya anything else.Oh, and if you're interests incline towards Historical British families and incest, read \\"Angels and Insects.\\" Just as yucky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing but unbelievable novel!","review":"I started this book awhile ago, but stopped because i was revolted by the incest. Recently i decided to give the book another try, and this time finished it! Although the book is very disturbing, it is one of the most riveting and haunting books i've ever read. I am literally still thinking about it weeks later, its that powerful. I think the thing that sets this book apart from others the way you get inside Beatrice's head. Its amazing how she makes her despicable actions seem resonable, so although you want to hate her, somehow you just cant! This is a very worthwhile read, but not for the faint of heart..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasty!","review":"I couldn't get past the first quarter of this book, which never happens. I did like the Other Bolyn Girl (although some of the scenes were totally gratuitous) but I couldn't stand this one. I suffered through the whole \\"Ralph\\" serial (which seemed like it walked right out of the Saturday Night Live skit \\"Tales of Ribaldry\\"), then was absolutely disgusted when the author decided to have the siblings hop in the sack together. This book reminded me of the VC Andrews \\"Flowers in the Attic\\" books I remember when I was a kid - trying to sensationalize and romanticize incest. Gross. Ick. Run Away. Don't read this junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hated to love her.","review":"I am reluctant to admit it, but I loved the heroine of this book. Beatrice is greedy, selfish, manipulative, undoubtedly mentally ill, and all-around horrible. In spite of all her faults she comes across as a strong likeable character determined to live life on her own terms. Philippa Gregory does an outstanding job of creating a realistic historical setting full of vivid description and colorful characters. Beatrice, for all of her horrible and evil deeds, made me laugh out loud many times as I read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother...Worse than a soap opera.","review":"Wideacre went on and on and on and on and on and on, same blather on and on. Could have been an interesting story (hence the \\"2\\" stars instead of the \\"1\\" I was tempted to give it) if the author had not felt the reader wouldn't catch on to the theme unless she hit us over the head with it a million times. Had to fill those hundreds and hundreds of pages, I guess. I ended up skipping whole chapters I was so tired of Beatrice and Wideacre, and still knew what had happened and what was going to happen; the author was so hamfisted with the \\"suspense\\". I regret to say I have all 3 of the trilogy, not sure I'll ever pick up the other 2 as this one has been such a monumental waste of time. It left me feeling cheated (out of my money) and sorry (that I had read it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must I give even one star?","review":"Where to begin. This is a horrid book - it's the sort that takes several doses of Austen to get over the nightmarish awfulness of it. Incest. Patricide. Matricide too, of course. Adultery - lots of it. S&M - pages of stomach turning episodes. Children born of incest - twice. Every moral character suffers and is tormented by the 'heroine' and her lovers. Really, not what I expected. For those who don't want to delve into the darker side of Philippa Gregory, be advised that this is a really rough read, with no redeeming qualities at all. I couldn't finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually Made My Skin Crawl","review":"I absolutely fell in love with Gregory's writing style in \\"The Other Boleyn Girl.\\" I picked up this book next thinking that a trilogy would keep me occupied for a while. Unfortunately this was not to happen because I could not make it past page 160 in this first installment. I gritted my teeth through the trahsy romance novel-like sex scences, Beatrice's whining about not inheiriting the land, her plotting of one murder and her twisted attempt at another, but around the time Beatrice seduced her masochistic brother I had had ENOUGH! Never had I wished that books came with ratings, but after not even one third of this one I did. Perhaps some warnings of what was to come would have been enough to keep me from wasting almost $20 on it! I only wish I had read all of these reviews before I bought it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Main Character Too Awful to Get Over","review":"I don't often review historical fiction, but I am a fan of Philippa Gregory's other books. I think she is a decent writer, and has brought many historical characters to life. But like many others reviewers here, I really despised this book, and almost didn't make it through. I kept plowing along, hoping beyond hope that some redeeming feature would surface in Beatrice, but it never did. And I didn't feel that her background and love of Wideacre sufficiently explained the awfulness of her deeds, so I was just left feeling like I was reading the biography of a sociopath. Which is not much fun. Maybe if the book had been positioned as that, I would have felt differently about it.So I am firmly in the camp with those reviewers that felt Beatrice was just too disgusting and awful to devote an entire book too, and that the elegant book structure and prose didn't make up for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING","review":"I don't know why a talented writer resorts to smut in this novel.

I found this book to be horrifying, and not in the good, spine tingling way. The story is hardly plausible, although obviously it is intended to be fiction. I find it hard to believe that a woman can come to hate the man she loves in a matter of minutes when he discovers her betrayal. Reading the relationship she came to have with John and her horrible cruelty make it impossible to stomach the result of the novel.

But the trouble is that the central character, Beatrice, is so thoroughly unsympathetic and so many of the events of the book are so vile that it's hard to view the book with anything but distaste. On top of everything else, most of the characters are pretty sketchy... Beatrice has one motivation only, and nothing that much makes you care about her plight, and nearly everyone else is a stick figure for her to play with.

This was an airport buy, and I've never made a more sorry reading choice in my life; I spent ten hours on a flight from the U.S. to the U.K. wincing as I turned every punishing page.

I highly recommend that you give it a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gothic Novel starring a sociopath","review":"I too am contemplating what to do this book when I am done. Usually, when I finish a book I tell everyone about it and lend it out. This book is another case altogether. The immorality in the book offends me but also makes it hard to put down. I keep ploughing through thinking that Beatrice can't possibly do anything worse than she's already done...but she does. I especially feel awful for the John McAndrew character. She does make me think of Scarlett O'Hara but Scarlett was a much nicer personality than Beatrice. Gregory seems to be writing about a sociopath rather than a normal human being. I would not recommend this book or this author again. I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money!","review":"I read The Other Boleyn Girl, and although I found some elements of the story distasteful (i.e., incest) I enjoyed the book overall, so I thought I'd give Wideacre a try. It was awful. I try very hard not to give up on a story too soon, so I kept putting it down and picking it up again to see if it would improve, but no such luck. It was so bad that I actually had to throw the book out (I NEVER throw out books - I usually hand them off to friends, but in all good conscience, I couldn't with this one)! What a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get through it","review":"I have read other books by Phillipa Gregory, which I loved. This book however, I couldn't finish. I found it terribly disturbing and even depressing. There was never any attachment to the characters and with every turn it seemed to get more and more ridiculous. I am glad to see that the author has greatly improved with her more recent books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"If you liked \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" you'll hate this novel. This is a classic case of an author who stumbles upon a best seller, and the publishers quickly trot out all the writer's earlier bombs. This is a silly story of a sex crazed teenage girl who commits just about every crime in the book to hold onto the estate she loves but cannot inherit. This is the first of a trilogy, and reviews suggest books 2 and 3 are rewinds of the same basic idea. Ridiculous!--never would have read it except I had the flu."},{"rating":"1","title":"not great, but ok","review":"This book would be great if the main charater,Beatrice, wasn't so annoying, selfish and all-around crazy. I mean don't get me wrong, Philippa Gregory is a great author and I like all of her other books that she's written but Beatrice is just so evil. I mean who would destroy her reputation, murder(more then one person), and destroy a whole peice of land just to save it?? I don't expect every heroine to be like Jane Eyre, but I don't think that Beatrice even deserves the title of \\"heroine\\".Now, the other charaters are great, the story line is good, the setting is perfect, but I just wanted to throw the book across the room whenever Beatrice came on the page. It gives me shivers to think about what she did to her people and land. I'm sorry if I sound really negitive, but even though I liked the book I really didn't like the main charater and that's never good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good... if you're into incest...","review":"I bought this book as part of a book club I'm in with friends (so this wasn't my personal top pick and I had no idea what the book was about). Before I even got mid-way through this book grossed me out enough to stop reading and lose all interest in the story.Lets just say the main character has some relatively graphically descriptive sensual moments with a relative... not my cup of tea but hey, if you're into that.... this is your book."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO SORDID AND UNREALISTIC TO BE ENJOYABLE READING","review":"\\"Wideacre\\"'s theme of incest and sexual perversion totally repulsed and sickened me. It's just too sordid and disgusting for words, and I found reading it, disturbing and unsettling. Not to mention, an unrealistic plot. Too sick and grotesque for words.Don't waste your money.I had high expectations for this book because I had so thoroughly enjoyed Philippa Gregory's other books. However, I will think twice before buying anything else by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A slow tale of corruption","review":"There have been many both positive and negative reviews for this book. I frankly, loved it. Beatrice is a compelling character. She is in love with her home, but through her desire for it ruins everything. However, she never loses sight that it can be restored. Everything she does is for the land...and she does have a conscience, but it falls to the wayside. If you don't like strong women characters who are cunning, ruthless and a tad amoral, don't read it, but if you do, it's an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh... not much else to say","review":"I read this book several years ago and I was flabbergasted. I don't have a problem with sexuality in literature, but incest is another story especially when it is used in this way. To me it did not seem to be painted in a negative manner. It was like you should feel proud of Beatrice for using any means necessary to keep her land. I literally felt ill after reading this. It's disgusting and I agree with some of the other reviews that you just can't feel empathy for the main character. She's a sociopath and there is not one part in this book that makes you care about her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read!","review":"Made the mistake and got the second book first, and I just had to get the first.

But I could not read past chapter 13. Its horrid. So much incest, so many lies. I first wanted to see Beatrice, the main character, threw them but it was no use my mind could not handle it any longer. Anyone reading this do not buy this book, Read the OTHER BOLEYN GIRL instead its wonderfull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on you , Philippa","review":"If you loved Philippa Gregory's other books, as I have, steer clear of this one. It's trash. It's poorly written, sophomoric, overly dramatic and a tad depraved.

I am also not a prude but I found the sexual aspects of this story depressing, depraved and unrelenting. I spent the better part of the book hoping that someone would pull out a gun and blow Beatrice's brains out - - I hated this book - - and now having read some similar reviews on-line, I see now that it wasn't just me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Totally Horrible Book","review":"Except for the first few chapters of description, I hated everything about this book. Ms. Gregory is such a really fine writer of word pictues and so her descriptions of Sussex and Wideacre were amazing. But after that the whole thing horrified me. I skipped over many pages and chapters just to get to the end which left me totally depressed. Why does such a fine writer write such drivel?I should add that I realize she has to be an extremely talented writer to make us hate the main character so much. But I read to be uplifted and enlightened. And I want to care for the main character even if they are not perfect. I couldn't feel any of that at the end of this bookOn the other hand, when Gregory writes good stuff, there's none better."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAN SOMETHING BE CLASSIFIED AS BEYOND PURE GARBAGE?","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read- granted I could not finish it- hit the 3/4 mark and questioned why I was subjecting myself to this vile piece of trash that should not even be classified as literature or even reading material for that matter.

It's like it was a bulk item the seller had, but didn't necessarily pass along the savings to the customers.We can't get the table to cave in - in the middle.. instead, it wants to \\"break\\" up, so that each end goes down and the center cracks up. Then the cross bar on the legs broke off and the tabs broke with it, so that piece is just trash now. The table works, just not like you'd think with a wrestler being \\"thrown\\" on top it.. The ladder is just a ladder...If we'd have spent a total of 10 bucks, it wouldn't be so bad, but we spent just under $18 (my sons money he earned from dog sitting).. just too much for this item.

He had an impeccable ear and with it a sense of production and composition rare in rock music (more akin to jazz and classical music). The most talented and skillful session musicians of the time came aboard for his two companion piece albums which were both completely instrumental conceptual pieces based on the visionary and mystic Romantic poet William Blake. Fusing deep, thick, and soulful bass grooves and drum breaks with psychedelic atmospherics, acid rock guitar, and orchestral grandeur, David Axelrod created a masterwork that has been sampled countless times as the bedrock of ambient, electronic, and hip-hop music and is still being rediscovered today.

This collection of anecdotes captures the essence of a rambling high school essay. How fortunate is he to have a sympathetic literary agent such as to allow him to finance his lifestyle with such dreck. One hopes the author keeps digging deeper into Rome only to find perhaps the muse of Pliny, something to bring the writing style to at least a level fit for publishing. For something slightly more intellectual and thought out, read Barzini instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Have visited Rome twice before and wanted to get into the spirit before our upcoming trip, but sadly, this book generally fell short of the mark for me. There were several moments of enjoyment and delight, but I found it to be mostly self-indulgent and more often than not, did not enjoy the prose. Often I found things too \\"wordy\\" or phrased in a manner that detracted from the point he was wanting to make.Additionally, I wasn't pleased to discover that it was written in 1999. Although at the time there was much excitement about the upcoming new millennium, that excitement has now waned, and much of the book that was focused on that (as a result of being written when it was) is hard to get excited about today.I simply wanted to read something that would 'charge the batteries' and kick start our preparation of the upcoming trip, and although it did have some effect, it just didn't meet expectations for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"don't leave home without it.","review":"We have been to Rome four times and after reading this great book,we can't wait to go again.

The author presents un-connected chapters, each containing musings about some aspect of Rome, but none has much of an idea, theme, or point. Reading this book reminded me of why I don't like to be invited to a slide show of somebody else's trip-- you had to be there. Amateur photography and amateur writing just do not convey the essence of a place very well.

A good read !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited and tedious","review":"This book is not an American family's odyssey but pompous blather about a very limited slice of Roman life. Having lived in Rome, I don't agree at all with much of the author's perspective (one example: he brags that Roman women dress fairly formally, to the max -- but observation on the streets, restaurants, theater etc. shows that as in other European cities, some dress up, most don't. A small point perhaps, but revealing of a limited vantage point) Much of the book seems mostly about his ego."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel!","review":"Clearly this author had two goals in mind: 1) to take advantage of the Americans-living-in-Europe publishing trend, a la Frances Mayes, and 2) to brag endlessly! I tired of reading about the author's expensive apartment and furniture, his Mercedes and his impressive friends after a few chapters and gave up on this. Too bad the author doesn't have the skill to write what the cover promised: an entertaining tale of a family living in Rome!

I am sure that no one ever gets to the position of power in a dictatorship such as in Romania at the time without being just as unprincipaled as his boss. Pacepa never admits any wrongdoing on his part. This was difficult to read because although at least partially factual, Pacepa is never honest. While the facts are damaging enough to the Ceausescus, Pacepa never passes up a chance to denigrate and belittle them in the most childish ways.

I just ate breaded chicken breasts that I made on it, and they were juicy and you did not need to use that dredded oil! I love this machine, and it is wonderful for when you want a quick small meal for yourself or for quick appetizers.

The problem is they made this a push button as well - pushing the toggle pauses USB and CD playback. It takes concerted effort to push that toggle w/o pushing it any of the 4-ways at the same time.

I trusted Milwaukee because of their reputation for fine tools and am not disappionted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's Not Get Carried Away","review":"These are good bits and I applaud Milwaukee for making them in the USA. These may very well be the last Milwaukee bits made in the USA and I would encourage you to get them while you can. These bits probably ARE better than anything readily available considering the sad state of the times. However, I just compared these bits to 10 year old DeWalt bits in drilling through some thin galvanized steel and the results may surprise you. The Cobalt Milwaukee went through easy enough but the 10 year old US made DeWalt -nothing special I assume they are HSS - went through A LOT easier. I was surprised because I had heard so much about how great Cobalt bits were. Can you say a lot of crap? Now, you can't get these Dewalt bits anymore as the current ones are junk from China so that is why I say the Milwaukee's are probably as good as you are going to get but let's not get carried away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eyewitness New Zealand","review":"As an airline employee, I have found my new bible. This book is an excellent (pictoral) reference guide, skipping the usual 2 page historical write up on every attraction. It is very concise, has pictures of the area/attraction with an accurate two paragraph description of the place depicted with maps included. I purchased two other New Zealand books prior to this one, and borrowed 5 additional ones from a friend. This book was equivalent to having all 7 books in one. I would give the book a '10' if it contained the hours and admission prices to the attractions/events, however, it does not. I would also recommend to venture beyond the hotel/restaurant section listed as we found many fine establishments beyond their limited list. A great line of books to have if you want a quick overview of things to do in other countries. Once you've determined what to visit, then purchase the book with the historical write-ups."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish it were available before my trip","review":"Most people would buy a travel guidebook prior to the trip.

The photos are great, the coverage on each area's attractions/activities extensive, and the maps up-to-date. It even covers information which I wasn't able to obtain from other guidebooks: special features on Coromandel gold fever, \\"Wellywood\\" (NZ's film-making industry), Nelson arts scene, West Coast coal-mining heritage, high country farming etc. If you need one book to show you how beautiful NZ is (in panorama and culture) and how to go about experiencing it, grab this book.

I stayed true with Native Tounge, when a lot of fans bailed. I bought the Greatest Hits, craving anything new. I loved Crack a Smile and have listend to it every day since it came out, but Power to the People is a huge let-down. PTTP is a decent track, and I hate every bone... is interesting with CC on lead vocals. But the tracks are poorly produced and the band is too hard. I listen to a lot of harder bands than Poison and love them, but that's not Poison. I'm all about change, but this was not the direction for Poison to take. The live cuts are also overkill. We heard these songs on Swallow This Live, and again on Crack A Smile: Unplugged. It's getting old. I'm still a fan and love the tunes.

Fallen Angel and Something To Believe In don't sound as good as on Swallow This Live. I saw them this summer and they can still rock live as far as getting into it, but the music isn't what it used to be. I'd buy Crack A Smile instead of this album. Better luck to them next time...

The other 4 songs are very good and shall be listened to for many a day. With the live tracks you get nothing you have not really heard before, there are no tracks of Native Tongue or Crack A Smile which is a bit of a let down (maybe CC can't play em!). On the whole a good CD the live quality is not brilliant but you can tell that there have been no overdubs. If you are a Poison fan buy it for your collection if you are new to Poison just buy it anyway for the 5 studio tracks.

It was worth the wait.This has five original songs, only one of which really deviates from the Poison tradition and that song is Powere to the People.Yes the title track of this album is a different direction for the band but good regardless.The other four will be recognizable instantly to the Poison Fan's ear.The real stand out of the record is I Hate Every Bone In Your Body But Mine sung by the one and only C.C. DeVille.The infamous guitarist flexes his singing skills on the song and actually sounds very good.The majority of the album however is live.There is nothing wrong with that though some believe it should've been left to the band's Swallow This Live album but I own that CD aswell and prefer Power to the People because it seems a more energetic recording probably due to the fact that the band had just reunited.Overall this is a solid peice of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poison - Recycling the Music","review":"I am a diehard Poison fan, but this album is really not that good.

Sorry, it's not. The live tracks which we've all heard before on \\"swallow\\" are recorded horribly. It is so muffled, and they included the solos from C.C. and Rikki. Puke.

Her voice might be able to be classed as big, bold, clear... Maybe that was too much. Yet another collaboration of covers, and acapellas. The \\"highlight\\" being \\"How Do I Live\\", and being an Aussie, it was good to here the US National Anthem, something different. Some songs could have been taken with a more quieter and softer approach. Like, \\"Clinging To A Saving Hand\\". The violin intro was quite catchy, but then came in this loud voice to disturb the peace. In \\"You Light Up My Life\\", she has taken on a whole new genre of music. And I would like to know how I am supposed to inspired? To take up volleyball next summer? Or listen to this album with its covers. Blue: Excellent debut. Unchained Melody The Early Years, OK, but a cop-out on all the tracks she re-recorded after \\"Blue\\" became a success. This one, it is a great one too, but coulb be greater."},{"rating":"1","title":"It would have helped if she didn't sing too LOUD on this one!","review":"This wasn't a good followup to Blue to me. It would have helped if LeAnn Rimes didn't sing too LOUD on this one! While the emphasis is on inspirational songs, the music comes off as overproduced, overblown and LeAnn tries to pull off her own Celine Dion by overdoing it a third on most of the ballads.Even the remake of Debbie Boone's overplayed You Light Up My Life comes off as limp. The listening performance comes off as as disturbing and misconceived, not inspiring at all as the album title wants you to believe. It's like LeAnn was pressured to get a record out on the market after the massive success of Blue. Would have been better if she sang an album of new material instead back in 1997."},{"rating":"1","title":"What inspiration???","review":"I am so sorry I bought this. I was seriously impressed by Miss Rimes singing \\"Blue\\". But what sort of inspiration can a 17 year old give.

Two albums guaranteed to inspire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me when its over","review":"Can you say boring? I mean, this cd will put you to sleep. I bought it, listened to it, then threw it out.

Sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great voice, insufferable songs","review":"Leann Rimes is a very talented singer, but the sappy stuff she put on this album is nauseating.

Sadly, the rest of the tracks aren't as catchy and lack the power that was \\"Blue\\".

This was the first time I had heard \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" sung by anyone other than Art Garfunkel, and it more than holds its own against his. I was also blown away by her a cappella rendition of the national anthem, which surpasses Whitney Houston's Super Bowl cut. Those who whined about this album's content make me laugh.

Backed up by the powerful choir performances of The London Voices and the bold brass of the London Symphony Orchestra, Debney creates a swashbuckling adventure score if there ever was one - each track is its own breath-taking journey seeking perfection, and it's hard to pick any favorite ones out of such excellency. The sound quality on this Silva Screen release is outstanding, too.Even though the film itself wasn't a huge success, I'm yet to meet a person who doesn't like the score. You can't go wrong with this one, or I'll eat my hook and eyepatch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this Disney?","review":"What is this? This is a pre-Titanic-movie. Contains: no intellegence, no plot, a lot of special effects and good-looking actors. When Morgan and her boyfriend fell off the rock, I was a bit hopeful at least one would die. But not at all. It was very confusing to see them both survive. It's just not realistic. The only good thing about it is Christopher Masterson as Bowen. But his role is too childish and too small, besides, he's only good-looking. But come on, do you really think the actors are acting? No, I've seen better movies. PS: That treasure wasn't very big at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash extraordinaire!","review":"This has got to be the most crappiest, idiotic, pointless, shallow, boring film of all time! It has no logic whatsoever and the props are atrocious! The actors like Geena Davis and Matthew Modine are horribly miscast. This movie has no meaning and my friend said he'd bet me 20 bucks that I can't stay awake during this garbage. I asked, \\"how bad can it be?\\" I rented it, he watched over me so I wouldn't fall asleep. I lost the $20......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible...Just Horrible","review":"This movie could be one of the worst I've ever seen. The acting is formulaic, the action and story are too. The only difference between this movie and other \\"action\\" movies is this one takes place with pirates and on ships. Some of the scenes are beyond laughable (for instance, Geena Davis, in one scene, outruns a team of horses while jumping through windows, dodging obstacles and leaping out another window). If you are aged 10-13, you might like it, otherwise consider yourselves warned. Oh, and the \\"bad-guy death\\" scene is the funniest thing I ever saw, but wasn't supposed to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS CD!","review":"Firstly, although I received the product in good time, the CD case cracked upon arrival. Second, I was very disappointed with the CD. This is an amazing soundtrack, to which the movie did no justice. If your a collector of soundtracks, this one is a must! But do not buy this extended version! Your wasting your money. The bonus track was a lousy synthesized version (yuck!) and the other previously unreleased tracks were OK...not spectacular in the least. The price I paid for this product was a huge mistake! Do not buy it. I have the original version (before this newly released version was released) and I have to say..............the original was better (so buy that one if you really want to add this soundtrack to your collection). This expanded version is a WASTE OF MONEY!!

Everything you look at or touch blows up it seems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review- ( Not Worth It )","review":"I know that all Score fans, and John Debney fans will be mad at me, but I am only telling the truth. The reason I give Cutthroat Island a low rating is simple, because it has a great theme, but that is not good enough to save it from my rating. The only good tracks are \\" Main Title: Morgan's Ride \\", \\" The Battle \\" and End Titles. Out of about 23 tracks only 3 are good, but if you love this Score so much then maybe you should buy it. Good theme everything else is bad. Sorry. If I were you I would check out Willow by: James Horner."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst movie I ever saw!","review":"I saw this movie on a double date in college because the other guy recommended it. Everyone agreed it was just about the worst movie we had seen and vowed never to let him pick the movie again. The dialogue is cliched and not acted well. Everytime there was a set up for a line, we would say it a second before the actor said the exact same thing and we had never seen the movie! There are many errors in the film. See if you can spot the sneaker imprints in the sand as they run up the beach. I guess maybe you could rent it for laughs if you just want to see a really bad pirate movie. I'm going to avoid seeing it again, thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun movie, albeit corny in places","review":"If you like Pirates of the Carribean at Disney, or Pirates games on computers, you will be entertained by this title. It was definitely a sleeper when it came into the theatres. The story is somewhat believable, though the acting in places falls short. I don't think Geena Davis was the right choice for this role, but that's something I can get past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality DVD","review":"Some like this movie..others hate it.

Well worth owning if you're an aficionado of the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste.","review":"When I heard about this movie I was hoping for a revival of the old swashbuckler genre. Instead, I got Cutthroat Island. A lot of money wasted on a sort of overblown B-movie. The stes look grate, the fighting is acceptable, theleads are hopelessly miscast and the plot is so thin, that I wish the Geena Davis could wear it as a dress. Now that would be an interesting sight! A lot more interesting at least than this movie, that just moves from one scene to another, without any story to keep them together. There are heroes, there are villains and there is a whole lot of stuff inbetween, but the connection seems to be a bit lost. Sorry guys, but some viewers like to see a little more then explosions. A bit of suspence would be nice. So would a story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Pirate Movie Ever","review":"They had the special effects, they had the budget for actors but...Geena Davis is not Pirate. Hardly any of the actors pulled off the Pirate look.The dialogue was of the 1990s.The story line was unbeliveable and predictable.There where many gaps that needed a narrator saying: \\"And then something incredible happened\\"Mystery Science Theater would have loved this film.Buy or rent Pirate (or Pirates?) with Walter Matthau. He pulled off a great grimey scum of a Pirate."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can you like this movie!","review":"How in the hell can somebody like this movie,this must be one of the worst movies of all time.Me and my friend watched a lot of movies one weekend and tried to find bad things from good movies and good parts of bad movies.When this movie came along we had a helluva time trying to find good parts.The only good part we found was that there isn't any other modern pirate movie.Truly bad and badly acted.Why cant i give it zero stars(deserves actually -5 stars)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loads of fun...if you're 13!","review":"It's understandable that this movie never made it big. The acting is ridgedly cardboard, the realism strained, and the underlying romantic story nearly non-existant. There are some nice blockbuster special effects and some crafty stunt work, but they too often get mixed in along with the lousy (obvious?) effects and ridiculous sword play. The two saving graces of the movie are the fantastic (if not unrealistic) pyrotechnics work and the movie score. If you have to choose between the two, pick up the soundtrack over the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only one reason to watch this movie","review":"Alright, first things first. The only reason I gave this movie one star is because there are explosions. Aside from that, this movie is on a list I've been compiling of the worst movies of all time. If you, like myself, enjoy watching bad movies for the sole purpose of laughing at the poor attempt at \\"art,\\" then buy this movie. And, while you're at it, buy something to hit yourself with when you are done watching this, trust me, you'll need it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arrgggg!","review":"An oustanding swashbuckler! I once read in a review that when Renny Harlin (Director) doesn't know what to do in a movie he blows stuff up! Yep, he sure does that in this movie, but its a lot of fun! It is non-stop action and a simple story line; Find the treasure before the bad guys do! If you want a good pirate movie with great action and sword fights, then pick this up right now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Arrr, matey!","review":"I bought the CD before I ever saw the movie - I heard a snippet of the soundtrack somewhere and that did it for me. There's not much I can say that hasn't already been said: fantastically loud (even on my low-end speakers) and thoroughly rousing, but with its gentler side as well. When the battle themes play I just want to take up a sword and start running folks through (no, I have nothing to worry about!) and climb up into the rigging. That's how much of a pirate/maritime flavor it has.It's a shame the movie wasn't worthy of the epic soundtrack, but at least the ships looked good. Debney really hit gold on this one - absolutely fantastic. I can't recommend it enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE! This 2007 Lionsgate release is NOT anamorphic, NOT enhanced for 16:9 TVs.","review":"BEWARE! This 2007 Lionsgate release is NOT anamorphic, NOT enhanced for 16:9 TVs.This release is basically no different than the 1998 Artisan edition, wide-screen view, but not enhanced for 16:9 tv sets, and therefore has black bars along the top & bottom, and along the left & right sides. Actually, the Artisan edition contains both the full-screen (standard) and wide-screen versions. So, this more recent Lionsgate edition is actually less than the previous. So far, the only way to get this movie in wide-screen enhanced for 16:9 tvs (anamorphic) is on the recent blu-ray release (but you'll need a blu-ray player).And, shame on Amazon for not including the enhanced 16:9/anamorphic status of all their DVD titles! The whole system is designed to trick buyers into buying something they might not have wanted - GOTCHA!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time with this film.","review":"Pirates go after gold and then only to be asked to give it up to continue the life of being a pirate. There were some cool stuff like two big pirate boats shooting at each other. Explosions were somewhat convincing. Nonetheless, this was almost a \\"B\\" movie. Why Geena Davis take the role who seemingly kept clean clothing throughout the movie even after the fight scenes, is beyond me. Don't waste your time with this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars without a doubt","review":"1st Ignore the \\"professional reviews\\"2nd Read this and other \\"real\\" reviews.3rd Rent it, then if you like it buy it.This is action and humor, a real swashbuckler.

(If you want a boring documentary, or philosophical discussion you wont find it here). If you want action, pirate ships, swordfights, explosions, swashbuckling fun and humor, get this movie and enjoy the ride.Check out the \\"Long Kiss Goodnight\\" another bit darker serious secret agent/action flick of Gina Davis's that professional reviewers didnt like."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a shame I have to give this ANY stars","review":"I found this to be a mind-bogglingly stupid film. Bad acting, miscast actors, bad script, bad direction, laughable plot. If you feel an irresistable urge to see this film, just hit yourself in the forehead with a hammer. It will feel the same and you'll save some money by not renting this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arr, another pirate movie!","review":"If there's one thing that film-makers should know, is that pirate movies are risky buisness. CUTTHROAT ISLAND holds the undesirable distinction of being the biggest box office bomb of all time. It's overblown, messy, and worst of all, not very entertaining. Director Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger) seems to have forgotten the one crucial rule to these kinds of films, and that is, story before spectacle. That's not to say it is devoid of merits; there are some impressive battle scenes, it has a great musical score and Geena Davis is good, but it leaves the viewer ultimatley unsatisfied. Ignore it's glaring flaws, however, and there is some fun to be had. DVD extras include a trailer."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST THING FROM HARLIN !","review":"I stopped watching it at the middle of this movie, then took courage and watched the other half. Geena DAvis is horrble, like Modine too. Everything is forged, forced, not natural, not a good action movie at all !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent Story; DVD Just Doesn't Make the Cut","review":"I caught this movie in the theater. I loved it. As soon as the DVD was released I purchased it with great enthusiasm. When I got home and played the DVD I discovered, to my great disappointment, that it is in the wrong format and displays with very poor quality. The video looks horrible. I returned the DVD for a refund.Technical Details for the curious:While this DVD offers both full-screen and wide-screen versions of the movie, the wide-screen version is not anamorphic. That means when you play it on your new TV it just looks bad. If you have an older TV and don't care about video quality you probably won't notice or care about this.I just don't understand. If you're going to stick with VCR-quality transfers, why bother making a DVD. Oh, I forgot. A DVD disc costs pennies so it's cheaper than ever to dump trash on consumers. I'm so glad we have these forums to share this information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes Pirates of the Carribbean Believable","review":"I really wanted to like this flick. I love old sailing ships and pirates and all that good stuff. This movie has single dimensional acting (except for Frank Langela who was quite good), retarded special effects where cannonballs cause huge chemical explosions and bodies are bouncing off of springboards while watercanons cause huge splashes in calm seas. I understand that this is an escapist flick and and some creative license is to be expected, but there are limitations. This ain't Indiana Jones.All in all, this huge-budgeted turkey should have been great, but falls way short in acting, unbelievable special effects and Geena Davis' cleavage shots. You can only see a petite woman overpower so many 200+lb stout sailors before becomming rediculous. If you want to see a good sailing flick, check out a little picture called \\"Master & Commander.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Letterboxed Again-Not an Anamorphic Transfer","review":"This review is for the DVD only, not the film. I already owned the original bare bones Letterbox edition of this film. When I saw that Lion's Gate was re-releasing it on DVD, I rather stupidly assumed that it would be an Anamorphic transfer. When I put the new DVD in my player and saw the postage stamp size picture on my 16X9 television, I was sorely disappointed in Lion's Gate for releasing the EXACT same version. The only difference is the cardboard slipcase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie... Shame on Lion's Gate!","review":"I see I wasn't alone assuming a new package would mean anamorphic wide screen.

Peerce is abetted by great camerawork and brilliant editing. There are varied subplots involving the games spectators but they are merely filler. It is debatable as to whether this film is exploitative and could be the impetus for some copycat. As for myself, I am not certain. I am certain that \\"Two-Minute Warning\\" is thrilling entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding me","review":"See Leonard Maltin's review. I love Chuckie, but this movie has no point other than violence is senseless. I already knew that."},{"rating":"2","title":"On Dangerous Ground","review":"The basic premise of this film is quite obvious. I always thought this was a curious film. It is basically a violent thriller selling itself off as a disaster film, which were in vogue during the decade of the 1970s. Having an unseen sniper murdering people at a stadium during a championship football game is really on the fringe of the disaster genre. That same line of reasoning could be applied to DIRTY HARRY as he tracks down the \\"Scorpio killer\\" who picks his victims at random. As a thriller, I find TWO-MINUTE WARNING to be a solid film. However, as a disaster film, it seems to build itself into frenzy with each grotesque and bloody killing, which seems to be gratuitous in nature to satisfy some prurient nature of the viewer. That is dangerous ground to walk on. Actually, through the years, it is the stoic performance of John Cassavetes as the professional leader of his SWAT team that remains a standout."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tense, slow burn","review":"This film is a slow burner, with almost no action for nearly the entire running time, and then everything goes crazy at the eponymous two minute warning. It has a huge, ensamble cast, led by Heston and Cassavetes as the lead police. Almost every character gets a moment to shine, and when the bullets finally start flying there is a lot of tension as these characters run for cover.For such a large cast and huge spectacle the film seems really small for a large portion of its running time. Only in the final, action packed minutes does the movie really use its cast and scope to full potential.This movie is a wonderfully refreshing change from the frenetic action of contemporary film, really drawing out suspense as long as possible. The enigmatic, never clearly seen sniper adds to the tension, and his motives seem to be as an agent of chaos as much as anything else. I highly recommend this for anyone who loves slow-burn thrillers and the style of 1970s cinema."},{"rating":"2","title":"70's DISASTER MOVIE JUST FOR FUN !!!","review":"Dont watch this movie looking for any deep meanings about why people act the way they do.

This album set the bar very high for all other bands. This album builds on the first three ( Motorhead, Overkill and Bomber). Lots of great catchy riffs, and some pretty cool lyrics as well. You can't say that Lemmy is the next Tolstoy, but his lyrics are plain and simple. This was my first Motorhead album and they became my band. The extra tracks are great for the compleatists out there who may not have picked them up the first time around on vinyl. It's nice that they kept the original ( from the pounding \\"Ace of Spades\\" right thru to \\"The Hammer\\") order of songs from the European release instead of the mixed up North American. It's a shame that this would be the next to last studio album for this lineup ( Lemmy, Fast Eddie and Philthy ) which in my opinion was the best, of the many different incarnations with Lemmy always leading the way.

At first, I was such a fan, but this book goes nowhere so slowly I find myself putting it down every time I pick it up, it's that bad.I won't spoil anything, but I will say that Jordan writes about everything unimportant, and very little about the main plots of the story.I am entirely fed up with the petty power struggles among new characters. I am tired of the petty power struggles among old characters, which doesn't happen much because the book is so full of new characters.What happened to the story?"},{"rating":"1","title":"All talk -- no resolution","review":"Many of the multiple star reviewers criticise the poor reviews by claiming we only want \\"action,\\" and that a good book is more than just action oriented.

None.I could put us with the multiple other flaws in the book, and I think most of the fans could also, if only things progressed and we saw some finality in the sub-plots before a dozen others were started.

Sorry, I love the series, and I'm not harshing the author, but after the great read of 9 I was sorely disappointed by 10.

It can only make you want to give up on the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tragic in retrospect","review":"I really wanted to love this book. Some of the previous books were a little slow, but I still enjoyed them. This one did not do it for me. If you dig deep, some important information is passed along, and a few events of significance take place, but not enough to justify an entire novel. Everything of importance in here could have been worked into the subsequent book on a much smaller scale. When I did my traditional reread of the series prior to the Knife of Dreams release, I skimmed it, but did not bother reading it. It was not worth my time. I think the great tragedy is that if Robert Jordan had back the years spent on this book, he might have come close to completing the series before he passed on."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Stuff and Nonsense","review":"Having read all previous volumes of the Wheel of Time, I was very disapointed in Volume 10: Crossroads of Twilight. It seems to be no more than 700 pages of filler between volumes 9 and 11 (whenever that appears). The book does little to advance understanding of either the characters or the plot - although it does leave you hanging at the end, certain that another volume is in the works.Furthermore, the publisher did little to enhance my enjoyment of the book as a volume as it was poorly bound and began to fall apart from the moment I opened it.I have enjoyed Jordan's \\"Wheel\\" up to now, but if the next volume is anything like Crossroads, I probably won't finish the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word, \\"Zzzzzzzz.\\"","review":"I believe in his \\"about the author\\" piece on the slipcovers of his novels Mr. Jordan indicates his intent to keep writing until they nail his coffin shut. So I assume that given the recent long-winded and incredibly slow books, he's just pacing himself. I must say that I hope he's able to finish the series before he checks out. For that matter, before I check out would be nice.Thus far I have purchased the hardback versions of all of Mr. Jordan's Wheel of Time books. However, after slogging through page after page of, well, nothing much at all in Crossroads of Twilight, I'm going to grab the next one--probably to be released a few decades from now--at the library.

An old friend asks Miss Marple to look in on his stepmother, Carrie Louise Serrocold, at her palatial estate on the outskirts of London.

And what I love about this second CD is that it isn't more of the same but rather an extended repertoire covering more modern and impressionistic classical pieces.Her playing is beautifully balanced and graceful. I enjoy listening and it is full of expression and technical skill. My only personal criticism (if I may be so bold) is that the Franzt List \\"Sonata in B minor\\" is slightly muddled in a few parts. The technicality occasionally overrides the sensitivity which for the most part, she displays wonderfully. It has nothing to do with her capabilities. I find many superb pianists have the same problem with this piece. That is why my personal favorite is Krystian Zimerman's rendition. Still, in all fairness, Naida can play just about anything and I would be interested in hearing it.

Louise is a Science of Mind minister, and she has taken the philosophy into her own and speaks the Truths it contains brilliantly.

Transmorphers was okay despite a lot of issues with its production values, while Universal Soldiers was quite horrible. \\"I am Omega\\" is the slickest of the 3 Asylum films I have seen to date. Its setting is really ideal for a low budget film like this as there aren't any expensive sets needed and the effects are all done for the most part with make-up and good old fashioned stuntwork.

I was the only one to finish the book - and I only did so because I felt obligated to. This book is just too silly and over - the - top. I got the impression that this book is working too hard to shock you - it's too in your face, trying too hard to impress you with its antics.

There are some cute but overworked southernisms (I know southernism since I was born, raised and still live in Atlanta.) Sadly, the middle school humor wears thin, but the cynical male-bashing is over the top. When men have attitudes toward women as this book suggests women should have toward men (\\"You need at least 5 men...\\", \\"The Promise...\\", \\"...being a widow is better than divorce...\\", etc on and on), we are called pigs. The double standard is too much. Most women are smarter that this -- y'all can do better. Save your energy if you want southern and read Lewis Grizzard..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a book?

I wanted to care more about the Tammy's and the whole \\"institution of Sweet Potato-ism\\" but it in no way held my interest as much as Rebecca Wells did with her Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.

Jill Conner Browne has said what most of southern women have thought. Her wit and humor will have you snorting in a very unladylike fashion and having a strange desire to throw a tiara on your head and proclaim yourself Queen of your life!

Fewer still that do it with any kind of humour, joy, wisdom and attitude. The Sweet Potato Queens' Book of Love does and does it in spades. Who among us could not love a book about women that does not once mention estrogen replacement therapy, but does speak long and lovingly of Fat Mama's Knock You Naked Marguerita Mix? The Sweet Potato Queens represent a celebration of what we are; outrageous, loyal, funny, smart and real. Oh so real. It makes this reader want to ditch my Northern Canadian pasty white demeanour, find me a big old red wig and something with enough sequins to blind a sled dog. You go girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh Out Loud Funny","review":"This book was hilarious from start to finish.

No one can write and become your best friend like Jill Conner Browne. I really missed her after I finished the book....missed the other Tammys too. This is a book that draws you inside and you want to stay. A group of us are so excited about these Sweet Potato Queens, that we are going to Jackson and marching in the parade! Our policy is to spread the word about the book and insist that the next person buy it...making sure that Jill and her fabulously fuuny book become household words.

I'll buy anything she writes."},{"rating":"2","title":"we are all float-worthy","review":"If you are, were, or always longed to be a beauty queen, this book's for you. No longer limited to the young and beautiful, the Sweet Potato Queens demonstrate quite ably that we can all be QUEENS. For any woman who grew up in the South or who admires Southern humor, this book is a must read. And if you've ever had the honor of queenhood -- I as a runner-up for Miss Northbrook 1968 had the extreme honor of riding in an Oscar Meyer Weiner float --let the Yam Ya Ya's show you how to release your inner queen. I can't decide what I like best, the laughs, the recipes, or the essential advice. How did I live without The Promise?

In this book, their leader espouses the Queens' views on (primarily) Queendom, gender relations, and food.\\"The Sweet Potato Queens' Book of Love\\" is entertaining and a quick read. However, its attitude of postfeminist dominance is grating: the Queens espouse - seriously or not - the belief that they, as women, are the intellectual equal of any man, but are still entitled to the deference accorded to women by less enlightened schools of thought. Their demands for homage grow tiresome, even from the point of view of a feminist, and by the end of the book the author's message (\\"worship me! worship me!\\") has grown stale. This is strictly a Friday-night read, and not an excellent one at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"It seems that this book is loved by many but, unfortunately, I just did not have the same reaction. About 80 pages into the book, I had to put it down. Now, I hate not finishing the book but I felt as though it was a waste of time. Maybe I just don't get the whole Queen thing - I don't need someone else to worship me to validate my goodessness. But more than anything I just found the book to be stupid. I would recommend \\"Kiss My Tiara\\" instead. Happy reading!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I plunged into this book anticipating lots of laugh-out-loud fun but these moments turned out to be few and far between. Rather than finding a group of lovable southern belles, I found a group of loud-mouthed, vulgar trailer trash. Yes, it had its moments but not enough for me to bother with the next book in this series. Looking back, I guess I misinterpreted the reviews. My mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idiotic","review":"...I guess there are people out there you who like this type of book; books about oh-so-eccentric Southern women run around playing the part of aging Southern Belles, as if in this enlightened post-slavery, post-feminist era, it isn't downright idiotic or even offensive to behave like a such a shallow ninny. I am a woman from the Deep South (born and raised on the milk of magnolia blossoms) but if my close circle of friends and I met any of these women in person we'd find them instantly annoying.I'm not humorless, or a book snob -- I love \\"wasting\\" an afternoon reading something completely frivolous and unnecessary, but this poorly-written book was just a true waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I had hoped it would be","review":"This book is poorly written and to say the least not entertaining at all. It is very vulgar and not funny at all. I enjoy Rebecca Welles writing so very much, that I had hoped this would be good. The jacket and back of the book make it sound like a good read. I had to force myself to finish this book. All Jill Browne thinks about is sleeping with men and how to get them to do what you want them to. I cannot in good conscience recommend this book to anyone. I had planned to give it to my sister, but I would never give this trash to anyone. The reviews that I read were good. I have never written a review before, but I could not let the great customer reviews that this book got stand. Naming everyone Tammy was also pretty stupid. This is, according to the back jacket, irreverent, but not funny. Don't waste your time or money buying this book. They must pay the people who comment on the cover and jacket a lot of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow trash, a major disappointment","review":"Am I the only one who thinks this book is just trite trash with a Southern accent? I was hoping for some wit or some redeeming wisdom, but Jill and Tammy(s) bring naughty to a new low. I hoped for Winston Churchill, but what Browne delivers is pure southern governor with pants down. I've already heard enough about blow jobs to last a lifetime. \\"Sweet Potato Queens'Book of Love\\" is not perfume, merely toilet water written at tenth grade level. After the Ya-Yas, I was looking forward to a good Southern fix. But this book confirms the worst stereotypes of crass Southern Dingdongs. I'm not passing it on or even selling it at a garage sale. It's going in the garbage with \\"A Monk Swimming.\\" Don't waste your time or money. I'm sorry I did. One star is one too many."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it!","review":"I guess you must be raised in the south to enjoy this book. We California girls just don't think that way!!

We are reading it for our book club \\"Book of the Month\\" and I give it a thumbs down! So do most of the other members of our club!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Impressed With The Tammys...","review":"All these good reviews make me think that the Tammys have been doing some writing of their own.

Not the worst book I have ever read, but close."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"ya ya\\" copy cat tries too hard and misses","review":"What a dissappointment this book was!

The contents are hillarious. You could read this entire book from the time you start a load of laundry and finish it before the timer to the dryer goes off ...

Jill Conner Browne is so funny and honest that my husband asked me to quit reading this book in bed. (Every minute or two, he asked, \\"Okay, what's so funny now?!\\" And that was actually before I fell out of bed laughing.) Those of us who have always known that women are Queens, or at least Princesses, love this book because it's all true. The Queens' attitude is one of funloving, honest, live-it-up passion. The attitude of: Have fun wherever you are, make fun if there isn't any readily available, and lavish everyday life with laughter and hilarity. These are the stories of some friends who decided to do more with every day, think highly of themselves, express their most outrageous opinions, and be happy. They did it with the classy-tacky style any girl can appreciate, and of which any man should beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wanna be a Queen when I grow up Mama","review":"This is the funniest book I've read this year. I'd seen the Sweet Potato Queen book on the shelves for years but I always found a reason not to buy it. I finally ran out of distractions and I'm so glad I did because this book was a sheer joy.

I was looking for a light, easy read with a high entertainment factor for the weekend, however, it never happened. After a slow start I tried to keep the faith, but by page 65 my faith dwindled down to nothing. This book was always on the verge of being funny, but never crossed the threshold. I thought with chapter titles like: Men Who May Need Killing, Quite Frankly or What to Eat When Tragedy Strikes, I was in for treat, but I never was satisfied.

I do think, however, I would've enjoyed this book more if I were a little more grown-up (read: Older).

True, there are a few clever ideas here, but for the most part, the author just seems to try and be over the top in her writing, with emphasis on the profane and disgusting. I don't find things funny just because they are profane and take away the disgusting elements of this book and you don't have much of a book. This book wasn't worth what I paid for it. I read it, although I'll admit not to the end. (I get bored when authors repeat themselves as this book tends to do.)I threw the book in the garbage and wished I had just checked it out of the library. Too bad, I understand Ms. Browne can write. She reportedly wrote some very clever and intelligently funny newspaper columns that appeared in the Jackson, Miss. newspaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fat Bottomed Girls Make The Rockin' World Go Down","review":"Hey Ladies! I personally did not enjoy this book, because I do not like reading about loose, divorced, bitter women. Just a thought-- It made me thankful though, that I am not a wannabe or a queen.

They have always been a very insignificant detail of the parade. But, I saw the book in the store, and felt compelled to buy it. I was hoping for witty commentary on southern life, but was terribly dissapointed with Jill Conner Browne's lack of humor. I found it a dull read at best. The Sweet Potato Queens in no way compares to the exciting work of Rebecca Wells. Don't waste your time or money.... I returned my copy and got my money back. Your time would be better spent cleaning lint out of the dryer than reading this feeble attempt at southern humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hatemhopetheydie!","review":"To quote the book.

I didn't get most of the humor and didn't find what I did get to be funny. There were a lot of what I would call \\"southern living\\" references that I just didn't understand and entirely too much dialogue about why the Queens are so great. I got about a third of the way through this book before I couldn't take any more and it is very rare for me not to finish a book.I wanted to throw this review out there to try to balance the raves for those of us who just don't get it. I would say that if you're a young (under 40), happily married, northern/city career woman, you might not fall into the target audience. If, even so, you really have to read this, I suggest checking it out from a library or borrowing it from a friend so that you're not sorry for spending the money on it later as I am."},{"rating":"2","title":"Woman Empowered, Inc.","review":"This is a mighty fine book.

Lots of re-directed torque-you can imagine the stress on the gears. I usually trust Milwaukee for tools that can take a licking and keep on ticking, but this definitely isn't one of them. The tool doesn't last for more than a couple of stressful applications before the gears strip. Nobody else makes anything that can get in and out of tighter spots though, and it has become a necessary part of my tool box. I have found that Home Depot will take these back for exchange when give out, if you save the packaging and tell them the tool is defective (which is no lie). Without the packaging they have to go back to the manufacturer, which is a p.i.t.a. and takes time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Necessary evil","review":"Although I've had need for this type of item on several occassions, I am disappointed with it's design and function.

That's about all they're good for, the input shaft fell out of mine, and there are parts rattling around inside. I've always heard good things about Milwaukee, and due to the compact design, i gave it a whirl even though it didn't feel well made. I believe that tools should last for years, and am willing to pay for quality tools.

I think it's partially due to the depth of some of the songs, including \\"Sound Of The Rain\\", \\"Light Up The Candles\\", and \\"Proud Of Our Blindness\\", which are all favorites. However, every song on this CD is a favorite, from the first song to the last.\\"Turn Your Love Around\\" is one of Bill's grammy winners and it's also one heck of a great song.\\"Just To Be Loved\\" is a song that I absolutely love. It's funky, sensitive, and it just begs you to sing along.This CD features superb musicianship, solid writing, amazing arrangements, and the incredible talents of Tom Saviano, Greg Mathieson, Bruce Gaitsch, and Tamara Champlin... among others. But it! You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Musical Masterpiece","review":"Bill Champlin continues to be an icredible songwriter and performer. All of the songs on this CD are individual works of art creating a masterpiece in the finished product. The lyrics are strong and the music helps bring the songs together incredibly well.

If my first meeting had been like the meetings they attend, I'd still be drunk. What a bunch of whine babies. No recovery in this movie.P.S.

If it were not for the AA window shades and slogans on the wall, I would have thought it was a remake of \\"Cuckoo's Nest\\".If I were the guy who \\"didn't have the problem\\" I would have left, dialed 911 and waited for the boys from Bellevue to show up.Richard Lewis was right.

Real AA meetings offer experience, strength and hope, and the solution to how an alcoholic can live happy lives without alcohol."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer..........","review":"I really wanted this film to be GREAT, and it was not. No drama to keep you entertained, it dragged and although this could have been a really wonderful film to use for groups and those entering recovery, I was disapointed.The acting left a lot to be desired too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a true picture of AA","review":"I was horrified when I viewed this movie. One thing AA strives for is singleness of purpose - there are other programs for addicts, shopaholics, etc. What went on in the film more resembled a meeting in a treatment center (where nobody there has more than 2 weeks sober) than an AA meeting. There was not one positive role model in the movie, other than the chairperson, and clearly he had lost control of the meeting. Richard Lewis was touching, but profanity like that from the podium is hardly the norm. No two people talked about the same topic. Barely a mention of steps, traditions, sponsorship. Bill Wilson and Dr. Bob would roll over in their graves. If you are considering AA, please know that this movie is NOT what AA is about. Hope is found in AA meetings. People share their experience, strength, and hope. Lives are saved there. Shame on Richard Lewis for distorting the fellowship like that.

John Elting weaves present day overview well with comtemporary accounts. The book does have an American bias, however. Canadians supporting the USA are given better press than Americans supporting Britain and Canadian/British Irregulars (particularly the Indian) are depicted as little better than rapists and murderers (American Irregulars are, of course upstanding heroes).

I don't see it as a required read for parents to be as the major points are common knowledge now. However, for those of us intellectuals out there, it's a great addition to the usual array of \\"what to expect\\" books with an emphasis on psychological development in the womb.

It stresses the extreme importance of psychological and spiritual attitudes on the development of the unborn child and sheds a new light on the parental responsability in this matter. The author draws extensively on his personal experience as a neonatologist (treating babies that were born prematurely) to illustrate the big impact of affectionate and psychological care on new borns and their subsequent adult behaviour.The author also proposes the prospective parents to actively prepare (and change) their mindsets and attitudes (if necessary) through the keeping of a journal with specific contents which facilitate becoming aware of ones implicit thoughts and vision of the Universe.Well recommended if you are also \\"a prospective one\\" !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as usual","review":"Usually I can't put Lyndsay Sands books down, but I don't have that problem with this one.

I am pretty sure this item causes, or at least, aids in, developing carpel tunnel.

I had left the screen open with it on what i thought was a secure laptop stand. I closed the laptop and put it further up on the stand so i could see if it slipped down by morning. . .Well it did, the computer slipped a good 3 or four inches. This product needs some sort of lip on the end of it so the computer does not fall off. The previous clear model from Griffin had this and I am not sure by they decided to get rid of it. I am going to return the product. My laptop is worth too much to risk it falling again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slip sliding away","review":"I got this product for my 15\\" Mac Book pro and was initially thrilled as it is a nice looking product that keeps the computer elevated at an excellent angle. But after about 4 months, I noticed the computer would start to slip down the stand, that the grip pads were not holding the computer anymore. Maybe the heat from the laptop melted the grip on the pads or something. After the computer slid all the off and hit my desk one night I just threw the stand away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore the reviews about about laptops slipping","review":"These put me off buying this product at first.

It really helps with posture and your neck will feel so much better than it does when working with a laptop on the table.The only problem is the keyboard is too high to type on comfortably. For this, you'll benefit from an extra keyboard and probably also a mouse.I recommend these to any laptop owners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as you would expect","review":"I use this with my 13\\" MacBook and a Targus Laptop Chill Mat, and having the Notebook elevated so that I don't have to look down really helps with my neck strain. An external monitor would be another possible solution, but this was less expensive and works better with my desk space. If you are looking for this type of product, I highly recommend it. It breaks down into 3 pieces for easy storage or travel, but is rock solid while in use. I have no complaints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient Stand, but a Little Slippery","review":"The stand is sleek and convenient, but I have had the laptop slide off a few times (I use a 17\\" MacBook Pro). The key is to position the laptop on the stand with about an inch of the grippy pad on the top sticking out, so the weight is distributed onto the back of the stand more evenly. I definitely like the way the stand looks, but it is a bit pricey considering how simple a piece of \\"equipment\\" it is. Ask yourself if you wouldn't rather just stack up some books?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stand, however...","review":"I have this stand, and like several other have had problems with slippage. In case you're wondering, I'm using the stand with a 15\\" Al Macbook Pro. For a while I flipped the stand over and used it with the clear section on the laptop side, because the laptop side (top) seemed to be too slick to hold my laptop, even new directly out of the box. Using it like that, however, wasn't as nice looking, and it still had some minor slippage.However, I had a thought today, and I pulled the two legs of the U-shaped bracket a bit to adjust the angle slightly. Afterwards, no slipping (even on the laptop side), and the angle isn't appreciably changed. So, if you have this and are experiencing slippage, adjust the stand a little. You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but overpriced","review":"I got one of these at work, and loved it so much I wanted to get one for home.. yowza, too expensive.However, I can say that this thing is great, and does just what it should: it's unobtrusive, is extremely sturdy, and raises the laptop to just the right height, also freeing up the desk space underneath it.At work I had the same slippage problem that people here list and my laptop kept toppling onto my desk. after about 6 months of daily use. I took the stand to the sink, gave the rubber pads a good scrub, and haven't had a problem since, and it's been another 6 months or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until it slips off","review":"I left it alone twice today for less than a minute and I found my macbook on my computer chair (luckily not the floor).

Sort of a bonus is that it leaves me room to stick an external disk drive (MiniStack V3) and my KVM switch under the laptop so that they are out of the way. It's a tad wiggly and might not do for typing, but given that the ergonomics would be horrific (it's way too high for typing when on the stand) and it wasn't meant for that, not being a great typing stand is pretty much a moot point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice height, sturdy, portable","review":"This holds my 13 inch MacBook at just the right height for use next to my external 20 inch flat screen monitor. It's a sturdier design than the previous iCurve (which was nice but my wife took to use with her laptop).

This time, though, it's not the individual songs that make an impression, it's the mix as a whole, which flows very smoothly and melodically, at a sufficiently fast tempo. By the way, I recently had a chance to see Kimball live, and unfortunately the stuff that he spins now (maybe to keep up with the times) is a lot more progressive, with almost no melody.

Choosing a new book is an investment of the reader's time and some trust is put into the author's ability to tell a good story. From START to FINISH. This ending turned this book into a tease. The author obviously had an editor deadline and rushed it. Maybe the editor finished it herself. Anybody can come up with the begining and middle of a mystery. It takes real talent and skill to satifactorally tie up all the loose ends and not leave the reader feeling like a sucker!

All around it was a big disappointment in an otherwise excellent series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissapointed Fan","review":"I have been one of Grafton's biggest fans, but K is for Killer is an embarrassment. It's bad enough that every plot twist is brought about by Kinsey making a lucky discovery, but the resolution is as ameturish and just plain ridiculous as any I have ever read in a book. You read 300 pages and then in 2 lines the book ends and nothing in the preceding pages is explained. In fact if you go back in the book after seeing who the killer is, you see incredible holes in the plot that make the ending incomprehensible. It really appears that Grafton ended this book 50 pages too soon. Probably cares more about deadlines that her fan's hard earned money which went to buy this trash. An complete waste of time and this is from someone who loves everything else she has written. Shame on you Sue!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series","review":"A great series.

Her trouble is that her complicated plots are often implausable and confusing to follow. Worse, is the number of characters that populate her books. In this one I counted 22 characters (and there were many more to come) by page 63. I kept turning back pages to sort out identities. .She needs a tougher editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfinished and disappointing","review":"I have to agree with some of the other reviews on this book, it was terrible! I feel almost cheated that I spent the time reading it and the ending was unfinished, there was no sense of closure what so ever. It was as if the author was having trouble meeting a deadline and just ended the story. I would suggest skipping this book in the series, I am only sorry that I spent the money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncharacteristically boring plot ... slow reading","review":"I've enjoyed all the books in Grafton's series up until reading this book. The plot was slow and it took quite an effort to get past the first few chapters. There were too many characters and the ending didn't really make much sense. It was almost as if Grafton was in a rush to come up with a killer. It was quite a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"K is for Komatose and yes, I mean you, dear reader!","review":"This book was a huge disappointment. Sue Grafton and Kinsey meander all over California but come up with nothing of substance. The author spent more time describing the decor of a hospital room than explaining the murder motive. The characters and their actions are bogus and contrived. For example, Kinsey becomes emotionally attached to a young prostitute she met two days before. It doesn't work because it isn't real. It is Sue Grafton bending her characters into grotesque positions as she tries to force a plot into this dull mess. The story makes little sense as we try to follow the seemingly interminable clues and innumerable side characters. When it was all over, I still didn't know why the murders had been committed.Save your eyesight! Do not bother picking up this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your Money","review":"The negative comments here are all valid.

Simply put, this is the worst book I've read in the past year. The plot is ridiculous: it centers around the murder of woman who is prostitute/porn star/water treatment plant worker. The characters only exist as canned responses to the investigator's questions.

The killer of the first murder victim was identified (and the fate of the killer was indicated), but what was the motive? There were two distinct different possibilities. Also, the reader might reasonably think that this killer was also responsible for the second murder (although that was never revealed), but what about the third attack and resulting death? There was no explanation, or motive given - and no indication that the same killer was responsible. Grafton is a great writer - if she had just written 4 or 5 more pages to resolve the unanswered questions, it could have been a good book instead of a very disapointing one."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT!!!","review":"I love this series!!

As a follower of the Kinsey Milhone books I found this one just as good as the previous.

Grafton's laundry-list style of description wherein she lists every item in a room when it has little to do with moving the story along is off-putting. Grafton's earlier efforts with this series were fresh and strong. Lately, she seems bored with Kinsey and it shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Despite the hurried ending, I enjoyed this one","review":"I am an off and on again reader of Sue Grafton's alphabet mysteries. Eventually, I will get around to reading them all, but it is not on my priority list of author's or series.That being said, I enjoyed this one. I thought the plot line led Kinsey to interesting people and places. As others have already noted, the ending is a bit forced. I understand why (Kinsey makes an ethical compromise that she would rather just gloss over) but it does not do much service to the reader.I give this one a B+ and I would say that this one makes me more likely rather than less likely to pick up another one in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time, read something else","review":"The author and publisher of this travesty need to spend a little more time in the real world, perhaps in the helping professions and less time in literati land where obviously they thought this tripe was a good idea. To those who believe this is an accurate commentary on American society, I say to look a little more closely; altruism abounds in our society, it just isn't as sexy or glamorous as the narcissism and the greed and so isn't as easly seen.Further a comment on the audio version of this book: the reader needs to stop trying to imitate regional accents. Speaking as someone who actually lives in Maine, very few of us actually talk with an accent and to hear it imitated (badly) in media is insulting."},{"rating":"2","title":"dark madness lurking just under the surface","review":"I took a workshop with the author at the 2012 Grub Street Muse and the Marketplace and bought this book shortly thereafter.

Well, I have multiple coatings on my lenses for anti scratch and UV and the like, and these lenses do leave a film on the lens. I found that if I use them on clear safety glasses with no coating, the lens dries streak free. If I use these on my eyeglasses though, I need to follow the wipe immediately with a tissue to dry them before the haze appears.Due to this issue, there's no way I would take these anywhere near my camera lenses. I have no idea if the haze would appear, but I'm not risking thousands of dollars of lens to a cheap wipe.Will I still use them? Yes. Until the 180 are all gone. Would I recommend them? No. They are only as convenient as sitting on my desk at work next to a box of tissues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves streaks","review":"No matter how well I wiped my lenses, it always dried with streaks and I had to use another cloth to finish the job (usually my shirt or a tissue!).

Particular emphasis is placed also on the Washington Administration and .

The low reviews this book has been getting on Amazon are really a shame, because it's a work of art. McDonald provides a masterful account of the creation of the American republic, giving the reader not just the major events of the period, but also shedding some light on the reasoning behind those events. His focus on the regionalism of early American politics shows the volatile nature of the compact forged in Philadelphia, which would ultimately lead to the destruction and reforging of that compact some seventy years later under the Lincoln administration. His wit and insight make this a truly enjoyable read for anyone with an interest in the period, as do his careful renderings of some of the more prominent figures involved in the Founding. Highly recommended reading to any history buff, or indeed any American citizen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor graphic quality ruins a useful book","review":"The poor quality of graphics in this print relegates the intelligibility of this book to near zero.

Sure, Liz Phair sounds a lot different now, but she'll always stick to the roots she planted with this masterpiece. If it wasn't for Exile in Guyville, would we have Alanis Morissette or any of her followers? Well, maybe, but they still lack the guts that Liz Phair still has. Think she spit in the faces of her indie-rock fans ten years after Exile? Well, then listen to this album again, friend, and you might just realize that she was doing it to you then, too. And the funny thing? She's still sexy and smart as hell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Liz Phair is refressingly unique in her style and brutally blunt with her lyrics.

This album is so intensely personal for Liz Phair that it can't help be intensely personal for the listener as well.

I have never experienced an album that is as intense, and intelligent, and emotional as this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Opening doors","review":"Liz Phair's debut album, \\"Exile in Guyville\\" is a step forward, a huge step, for women in music. Liz does what, for some reason, other women in music were unable to do--she cries out in this album from a place called \\"Guyville\\" where men in music have reigned supreme. A direct response to the 18 songs on the Rolling Stones' \\"Exile on Main Street,\\" Liz Phair throws a few punches at the world of music, using explicit lyrics like terms of endearment, answering the question of \\"what are all of those good girls thinking on the inside?\\" Buy this cd for its insights on life, buy it for its importance in music today, buy it for its dry, honest lyrics, buy it for its unusual sound, for any of these reasons, just buy it.

Why anyone pays her any attention whatsoever simply baffles me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent cd, but our top 500 reviewer is mistaken","review":"Good try attempting to seem oh so esoteric with that urge overkill reference, but the title of this album refers to the stones classic \\"Exile on Main street\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Eh. It almost sounds like she's making her voice sound like crap on purpose. Like she's giving it some edge that doesn't need to be there.

It's hard to find good music like Liz Phair these days (Radiohead and The Black Crowes are among the only true good bands left). Exile in Guyville is flawless throughout the whole album. It's hard to hear better lyrics anywhere (Except maybe by Lennon/McCartney). She writes about real stuff and that's why it kicks. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Raw Emtion!","review":"I was skeptical to try out some of liz phair's earlier alternative work! I've heard her latest two cd's and thought they were amazing.But didn't realize that she was more of heavier artist back in the and completely changed her image. Which to me isn't really that bad of a thing. I was surprised to find out how emtionally raw this album was. To me it sounded deep and very dark. I think she is an excellent example of some who does a great job songwriting as well. I can see how she's on critics top choice lists. This almost seems to be to be as it were a heavier version of bob dylan. Liz Phair is really one of the best women in rock music in my opinion. If you love alternative or the Nirava / Seattle grunge scene then you def. will not be disappointed by this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"When relationships get filthy...","review":"\\"Exile In Guyville\\" according to Liz Phair is a song by song response to the Rolling Stones' masterpiece \\"Exile in Main Street\\". It includes nineteen songs on relationships and the dirty games of the singles scene. Phair is remarkably succesful as a songwriter because her songs capture very effectively the feelings and situations she chronicles, since they are entirely personal experiences. She isn't subtle but she is disarming (be warned her lyrics can be VERY explicit, in case you mind), and her raw honesty is much more appreciated compared to all the ridiculous, childish sexual innuedo we see in current music. However, it may become a bit tiresome listening to eighteen songs on more or less the same subject after a while.This is a worthwhile album, definetely recommended to everyone interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"It would be nice to know!","review":"This is no longer available ...

I'd have hard time believing that it is. The music sounds like someone is tuning up their instruments and doing a poor job at that. To put it frankly, Liz Phair seems to be tone deaf on this CD. I'd almost rather listen to \\"rap crap\\" than listen to this garbage, I said almost. I would have given this CD a minus star rating if Amazon would have allowed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Love both Ani and Utah but...","review":"I bought this album after buying \\"Fellow Workers\\" another collaboration between Utah and Ani. It has been a drive to work staple for some 9 months. I was expecting more of the same. But I found the only way to actually hear Utah's words which are why I bought this collection was to roll the bass completely off and boost the mid range up. Even so the electronic music seemed to bear no relationship to what Utah was doing.I would have much preferred Utah doing this material by himself or with perhaps another acoustic musician or two behind him instead of all the synth sounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather eat cardboard","review":"This was the worst waste of time and money- boring \\"observations\\" by Utah annoying repeated (like we didn't get it the first time) by Ani's collage of his stories to music.

Of course it'll fit -- how can it not? It expands to about 23 inches, and can get as narrow as 12 inches. I love how wide each drawer is -- I have sets of 12 of knives, and each size spoon and fork.

This extra footage was possibly a project of some UCLA film students, to create a longer movie for television.It is unfortunate that these more recent actors are not in the film credits, since the newer footage is more fun to watch than the original, except for one thing: the head of the Fuhrer. Hitler's head provides the much needed comic relief for the drab situations, mostly by showing some kinds of unrecognizable expressions, and yelling \\"Mach Schnell!\\" (colloq: buck up).

The plot is very hard to follow and the footage that was added makes it even more confusing. Supposedly new footage was added to make it long enough to show on TV. It's very obvious what footage was tacked on. I can't believe they got sponsors for the TV showing.I did enjoy seeing Hitler's head in a jar and also the bad guys dressed as the Blue's Brothers.

Little Feat--when I realized the song came from their 13th recording, I had to grab the CD.Good choice, the Feat's gone from jazzy to bluesy and I like the new revisions, too. Shaun Murphy, the former backup singer, is a nice choice to bring up front.This is a funky, bluesy Cajun sounding CD that I think would do George proud. My favorites:Blue Jean BluesCajun RageDrivin' BlindIf you like the old Little Feat, these guys are still well worth a listen. And, it's great to hear Murphy up front.Rebecca Kyle, August 2008"},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Feat CD","review":"I purchased the CD for my husband's birthday, as a replacement for one he had broken.

The song's a bit different if you compaire it to their other songs because here you'll hear all 5 Steppers sing! And yes they really can sing, all 5 of them!!! It's a great uplifting song (and they've made a fanatastic video for it too).

I liked it even better than Cloud of Sparrows. It's literarily and spriritually more expansive. Matsuoka takes literary risks with the mysticism. But it works. I first purchased the audio version. Listening to it prompted my purchase of the hardcover. Reading it in print is a little different experience. Even deeper. Recommend both experiences to get the richness out of it.Frankly, I'm surprised that this book didn't launch Matsuoka into superstar status. It's that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is in the title?","review":"Autumn bridge takes you into the metaphysical world of Buddhism. The ability to prophesize is more about the ability of enlightened individuals to see time as a continuum, hence it can not be changed. Thus knowing the future is a like knowing the time of your own death, both a blessing and a curse. It is also about a clash of cultures, with the protagonist being a vehicle which to elucidate the clash. That so few of the reviewers caught on to these essential elements, show the subtlety with which it was written.Last \\"what is love?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A captivating novel","review":"\\"Autumn Bridge\\", and \\"Cloud of Sparrows\\" (which is the first novel in this duo), are two of the most captivating, beautiful, artistic, entertaining, and moving books I have read. It doesn't hurt that they will also give you a brief glimpse of Japanese history as well. I would suggest starting out with, \\"Cloud of Sparrows\\" just so that you know who the characters are, and so that you get used all of the references Takashi Matsuoka uses, but certainly you would enjoy, \\"Autumn Bridge\\" by itself.

In fact, it makes for the most enjoyable listening, although surely not as the most revolutionary or influential. It is not as unlistenable to as What's THIS for...! or meaningless rage as their latest (it is the probably only time one can agree with the Rolling Stone review!). The vocal shifts are very in place here, as are surrounding musical landscapes, beautiful and bitter, and it's not as repetitious as their usual material. Acoustic guitar is also very good for variety, and will all the diehard fans ever learn that variety is no \\"selling out\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed but Beautiful","review":"Killing Joke have never been ones to tone down their angry political views, but never before have they been brought to the forefront as on this record. Democracy opens with the brutal \\"Savage Freedom\\" picking up steam until the ear-shattering climax. This sets the stage perfectly for the rest of the album: violent, shredding guitar, vicious percussion and above it all, the hoarse shout of Jaz Coleman's vocals. The biggest suprise is the title track, which begins with sparkling acoustic guitar and reaches anthemic heights with the classic chorus, \\"Sorry, democracy is changing.\\" Of course, it doesn't always work, as on the overlong \\"Prozac People\\" and the simplistic \\"Intellect,\\" but these are small nits to pick on an otherwise violently beautiful album."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd almost rather listen to Outside the Gate!","review":"After loving their last two albums, I was grossly dissappointed by Democracy. It sounds too dense, too ponderous, and too boring to be considered a four star CD. If you really want to listen to a good representation of Killing Joke, buy Fire Dances or Extremities. Avoid this one as your first taste of Killing Joke. You might not come back for more"},{"rating":"1","title":"BRITISH POLITICS","review":"Killing Joke's mix of heavy metal and melodic pop hooks fuel \\"Democracy\\" into a confused, rather bland set of songs that seem a mix of '70s 'Boston', 80's 'The Cult', and 90's grunge, never identifying itself as the dark post punk distinctive Brit sound Killing Joke is alleged to be, but instead revealing a swirl of many hard rock ideas unfortunately anchored in an '80s time capsule where the beat goes on and on but never seems to get anywhere. The songs too often use the same formula of a grunting hard-edged vocal transforming into a lighter melodic sing-song soft core voice with vibrating 'Cult' guitars and repetitious, thump, thump, bang, bang, drums that clumsily combine punk with melody. They seem capable of more and a good Producer could have trimmed the clutter and the repetition in a more pronounced vision of social politics, which seems to be the aim here."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's with the poems??","review":"The music in this dvd is nice. That's about the only good thing. The toys they show between color segments really have no real purpose but to fill up time (like most Baby Einstein videos, in my opinion). The colors they show are yellow, green, orange, purple, red and blue.Each color has puppets and a poem is recited (again, I find Julie's voice annoying). Here's an example of the poem for the color purple: \\"Purple feels wacky, wild, crazy, tricky, mellow, mild. It makes me want to paint my face, kick a ball and run a race.\\" For the color red the poem is, \\"When I wake up feeling red, I swoop down from my little bed, throw on a cape and rush out the door and leap across the scarlet floor.\\"OK....to me these poems are just dumb. Other people proably think they are great, but I can't see having my child sit and watch this and listen to these ridiculous poems.

There's no way to determine if this item is new or used, plus there's no way to tell what DVD it is when it's sitting on a shelf as there is no labeling of any kind.

Now he is nearly two years old, but could not even speak out 6~8 words, much late than my friend's son (the same age), my brother's daughter and my sister's son (compare them at the same age). I become to suspect if the Baby Einstein shows do benifit younger babies. The shows seldom speak, mostly music or silence.

The colors are bright and cheery. The music is perfectly suited. And the puppet, Van Goat, is an absolute delight!! I strongly feel that Julie Clark should have hired a professional voice artist. Her voice lacks \\"umph\\" and is unstimulating. And, I don't think that it was necessary to include all the scenes of the children. While some scenes flowed nicely, others were quite disruptive.

On each color they have a poem, well, you have to turn your volume way up to hear what they are saying! If you forget to turn it back down, the sound effects are even louder!! I would not recommend this DVD unless you really feel you want to purchase it for your child! Though it would be nice to introduce your child to color, I would recommend finding another type of movie to do so! Unless you want to sit with your child each time he/she watches this with the remote on hand to keep turning the volume up and then back down! It just frustrates me, so needless to say, we don't watch this one!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick","review":"I haven't decided yet if this one or the one about shapes is my least favorite. I agree, all Baby Einstein is is a bunch of toys floating across the screen - however, some of them are put together in a way that is educational and fun for my 9 month old son. I've been showing him the Baby Einstein videos since 3 months (and I have reviewed all the ones we own). Like previous reviewers have said, the poems are ridiculous and the way Julie reads them is horrible. I know these are supposed to be \\"teaching aides\\" as opposed to a distraction for mom to get away, but I know most moms use these as a way to take a quick shower or get some dishes done, therefore, the toys they float across the screen don't really have any learning purpose (pointing out the colors or having poems that deal with \\"real world\\" items in that specific color would be more effective). I do like the Van Gogh prints they show, and that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound Modulation Problems","review":"The visuals of this video are fair, though not up to par with those of Baby Dolittle.

The Baby Beethoven didn't do it sadly enough but this one definitely has him crawling trying to get a hold of the figures in the t.v and he's only 5 months. He goes bananas during the intro when the cacti are dancing, he stops whatever he's doing and focuses on the cacti.

With most of them he'll be about halfway through and then get bored. But, with Baby Van Gogh he absolutely loves it. Not only will he watch it from start to finish every time, but sometimes when it's over he'll cry until you rewind it and watch it a full second time through. He will smile, laugh and even yell out at his favorite scenes. If you're deciding which of the Baby Einstein's to buy and not sure where to start, I think this is definitely the right place. Most are not as good as this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Einstein","review":"We have 5 DVDs from this series.

I highly recommend this video. I plan to buy more."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of our favorites!","review":"We own three of the Baby Einstein videos (Van Gogh, Shakespeare & Doolittle Neighborhood Animals). Baby Van Gogh and Baby Shakespeare and definitely favorites of our two 25 month olds.These tapes changed my mind about video viewing in general. In the past I was very anti-video. The great thing about these tapes is our kids do not sit in front of the TV like zombies, mezmerized.

When i saw how much he enjoyed it i had to buy him one and i bought van gogh next. This is the absolute miracle cure for him!!! He will happily watch the entire half hour video, smiling and kicking his feet at the TV. I felt a little guilty at first, putting a newborn in front of the TV. But he is my third child and it is impossible to get anything done with him. I figure it is no different than holding a bunch of toys in front of him myself. And he loves the music, too. We are deffinitely going to buy more of these videos. An unexpected bonus - my 3 and 7 year old girls love the videos too! Especially my 3 year old; she sits and watches with him and she knows what is going to come next. My older girl loves to dance to the music. Worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our second favorite video","review":"I think this is one of the better videos, in the series. I actually prefer the videos with no speaking parts (all music), and this has mininal speaking (a few peoms and the colors are said aloud). My 1 yr old and 3 yr both enjoy this movie. We have 5 of the Baby Einstein videos, and this is probably our second favorite (Baby Bach is #1). But then, I am a graphic designer and love color... and this movie has a lot of color and shows works from Van Gogh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable for little people","review":"All of the Baby Einstein movie collection is wonderful and enjoyable for little people.

We have several other Baby Einstein DVD's and this is probably my least favorite. It is supposed to help children learn their colors, but all it basically does is show a bunch of toys and objects that are of various colors without repeating what the color is. For example: It will say/show the word \\"yellow\\" and then spend a few minutes showing some yellow things, playing some music and reciting poems (really lame ones, by the way, that have nothing to do with colors). My child is \\"entertained\\" by the video at most, he will watch it, but has learned nothing from it.
