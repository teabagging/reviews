Oh well.Overall, my impression is that Geils fans prefer the rambunctious and rowdy. If that's you, this may not be the album for you. \\"Wreckage\\" is another great song: all my favorites here are moody and subdued. The instruments do not overwhelm the songs, the musicianship is playful and skillful.

This is much better than some up-to-date but very dry & stuffy textbook. The Heart that Bleeds tells you what Latin America is really like. Plus, the author writes so well, the stories just fly by.

THe book is based on Rudolf Steiner's philospohy,but does not assume any knowledge of Steiner's work. It is a gem for me as a first time mother anxious to do whatever I can to make the incarnation process easier for my baby. There are so few sensible books on this subject, and it is full of practical advice on feeding, sleeping, rythm, colour, sound etc. A must for any parent with spiritual awareness, and still very helpful for those who just want some non-mainstream sensible practical advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Incarnating Child","review":"Although the book is absolutely brilliant- the production was appalling.

Most of them are in the category called \\"Scramblegrams.\\" The structure of these problems is that a series of words are scrambled, with the letters above a series of dashes to be filled in. Some of the letter positions are highlighted and those letters will then be used to create a final phrase. Another type of problem is the \\"word melt\\", where you start with a word and change one letter at a time to end with another word. Each intermediate step must also be a valid word. There are also a few \\"word search\\" puzzles.In general, I am not a fan of word puzzles; I do them on occasion for a change a pace and challenge.

Only \\"Tales\\" \\"Tormato\\" and \\"Relayer\\" are worse. The songs really don't have that Yes sound. Geoff Downes and Trevor Horn couldn't do much with their former band The Buggles and they don't add much here. This band should have called it quits after \\"Going For The One\\" but they didn't and this is what you get. Subtract Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman and you get what I consider a fake Yes album. Get this only to complete your collection.

Drama for Yes was just that. Trevor was smart enough not to do another album with them...thank God. Very few producers for mainstream records make good singers who have \\"feel\\" in their music. I think he(Trevor) looked at what was marketable and went for it neverminding the music. Drama is pure proof of that. There's only two good things about that record. The cover art (Roger Dean never disappoints) and Squire's bass work. Other than that, Drama sucks. Ranks right up there with Backstreet Boys' Melaluminum or Millenium...whatever. Do not buy this record if you just heard one song by Yes. Go for Close to the Edge or 90125."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate it","review":"I hate it, and I am the biggest Yes freak there is alive.

Quite beyond the inferior vocals of Trevor Horn is the appalling lack of good material. This album sticks out like a sore thumb in the Yes catalogue.

Into the Lens has got to be one of the worst songs ever written. Just completely awful.

What a riot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely forgettable but for tracks 13 to 16","review":"The line up here should have just called themselves DRAMA. As Yes, this was a failure, the one listenable track being essentially a Jon Anderson knock off. The songs don't hold up well, and really apart from tracks 13 thru 16, which show you where Anderson might have taken the band, there is little point in this CD. Squire and Howe are not strong enough on their own to carry YES forward. It was good that Wakeman was out and Downes and Horn do their best, but they were essentially standing in. That role suited neither of them. Downes went on to ASIA, Horn went to the control room.Back then, it was generally assumed YES was dead in the water. Thankfully, Squire and White found Rabin and Kaye. Out of the ashes of DRAMA came 90125."},{"rating":"1","title":"no stars is more appropiate","review":"After listeneing to Yes for over 36 years, there are two individuals that are a must Jon Anderson and Chris Squire.

Rick Wakeman and Jon Anderson left the band...replacing them were former Buggles' front man Trevor Horn and keyboardist Geoff Downes. The album has a harder edge than previous albums, demonstrated in songs like Machine Messiah and Tempus Fugit. Trevor Horn, sounding a bit of a cross between Jon Anderson and future member Trevor Rabin, does surprising well on the album(during the tour, criticisms though flared). Geoff Downes, although not as flashy as Wakeman, shows for the time that he was a very good replacement, at the least, shining on songs like Does It Really Happen. Remaining members Chris Squire, Steve Howe, and Alan White give the album a very driving sound. Some incredible guitar and bass on this album. Although this album doesn't necessarily have the Yes sound of old, it definitely is a hidden gem in their collection, and one of my favorites by the band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drama","review":"On 1980's Drama, Yes lost two key elements of their sound: Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman. However, contrary to popular belief, Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes did a good job on this album. Howe, Squire, and White are all excellent. The cd isn't that much of a departure of their classic material. Classic Yes fans will most likely enjoy Machine Messiah and Tempus Fugit, both excellent songs. This is a very underrated album which deserves more recognition."},{"rating":"2","title":"The last Yes album","review":"This album has more in common with the nine years prior to it than anything the band has done since.

If you love 70's prog, buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anyone notice...?","review":"A change: the coda to \\"Does It Really Happen\\" no longer comes with the quiet swell, but just starts right in at full volume. And what's with putting in those Paris session tracks yet leaving out the best one -- i.e., where's \\"Tango\\"?!?!? God help us, what more understanding is required of me today... And they put in a couple of sucky track-throughs but also leave out \\"Flower Girl\\" from those same sessions. The main album: Not a big improvement on the 1994 remmie but such a fantastic record all the same. Five stars in my eyes for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the five stars!!!","review":"Unless you are a die hard yes fan, no doubt you'll buy the cd anyway despite what you've heard (as i did).

Without Anderson on vocals they end up sounding like a good Yes cover band. Compositions are weak, lyrics trite, and performances uninspired.

Pass this one over...Simon"},{"rating":"1","title":"It is truly a Drama","review":"Unfortunately 80s were not good times for Yes at all and this record is the beginning of te downfall period... In this album there are only two good things: the cover by Roger Dean and the first song Machine Messiah... this is it, the rest is just the average rock music, where such great musicians as Chris Squire and Steve Howe played (didn't help a lot either). The absence of Jon Anderson was a great blow of course, so it is not a surprise that the album was not successful... the songs are boring and too long, a very great dissapointment after Going for the One and Tormato...P.S. I forgot the bonuses, which are rather good... it s interesting to listen to the last tracks what may have come out of Yes if Anderson and Wakeman stayed..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underappreciated Curio","review":"This is the album without Jon. Heresy!Looking at this as a separate band, however, this is one fabulous album.There are no real duds on this album, although sometimes \\"Does it Really Happen\\" comes too close to a funk/disco hybrid that doesn't sit all that comfortably.\\"Machine Messiah\\", \\"Into The Lens\\" and especially \\"Tempus Fugit\\" are very strong. Jon Anderson has expressed that he would not be adverse to singing \\"Tempus Fugit\\" live. Heck, I think they should rerecord this song and issue as a single. It is that good!This album is certainly heavier than \\"Tormato\\" and is very well produced (thanks to Trevor Horn I am sure) and the songs are focused. I'm not horribly fond of Trevor Horn's voice though, maybe it is being pitched too high in order to sound like....No Jon?Heresy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album!","review":"This is one of my favs from Yes; sure it doesn't have Jon Anderson& is not as ggod as GFTO & CTTE, but, it is filled with so muchenergy & the playing is excellent!

Not my favorite(close to the edge, Relayer, Tales of Topographic oceans) but I recomend every album from Close to the Edge thru 90125. I saw a previous review commented that Trevor Horn sounded much like Jon Anderson. I agree but if you are in the new york city area there used to be a Yes tribute band that plays all the classic yes stuff and their singer sounds just like Anderson. I think they were called Yesterdays and the guys were perfect, but it was a few years ago. Anyway if you really love yes you'll want to get the Drama album. I always find the mix of yes members music with new people to be exciting. I also recomend Jon Anderson's \\"Olias of sunhillow\\" album, Asia's Asia album and Alpha album(the ones with Steve Howe, Geoff Downes, Carl Palmer, and John Wetton)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Repent of My Disdain - It's not Bad, Really","review":"For years, 22 approximately, I refused to listen to this music. A strict Yes dogmatic, I knew the band ended in 1978 with Tormato and that was that. But, out of curiousity, I finally listened to Drama, and I must say that it's better than I imagined. No, Trevor Horn is not Jon Anderson, but he does a creditable job singing these lyrics.The core members of Yes, Howe, Squire and White are playing better on Drama than they did on the previous two Yes Albums, almost as if they had something to prove. Geoff Downes's keyboard work is worthwhile too, if only for it's embellishment of the songs, rather than as yet another solo on top of Howe's playing, as our dear Rick was apt to do.Those of you who don't think much of Trevor Horn, think about his position at little. He had a lot guts to do what he did when he did it.So I forgive Yes. I repent. This is good music, recognizably Yes (more so than 90125)and suitable for inclusion in the canon."},{"rating":"2","title":"criminally underappreciated","review":"this album imo is easily the most underappreciated album in the history of rock!trevor horn and geoff downes might not be jon anderson and rick wakeman, (and it is not as if every album with anderson and wakeman is good!), but they're great musicians in their own right.and it shows on the album. almost every track is great on this - especially 'machine messiah', 'into the lens' and 'run through the light'.the album is harder edged than the normal \\"yes\\", but the band somehow successfully reconciles the heaviness with the melody and so the music literally soars on each track. and i love trevor horn's voice which imo is very unique - it is easily the most refreshing, pleasant yet rich vocals i've ever heard.great great great album this! get this if you're above personality cults and like good music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Album","review":"The most overlooked piece in the Yes catalogue. For many fans, the absence of both Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman make this unworthy of the Yes moniker, but the Buggles (Trevor Horn and Geoff Downs) do a great job of filling in. This CD showcases a harder edged Yes. Steve Howe goes for an almost heavy metal feel in his playing on this album. The opeing bars of Machine Messiah set the tone. It is funny, but in some ways this CD sets the tone for the next evolution of Yes wherin Jon Anderson returned and Trevor Rabin took over the guitar duties. Rabin's harder edged guitar playing is more like Howe on this album than any other YES CD. One minus on this is that the CD clocks in at under 40 minutes. The amount of music you get, but the quality is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it a chance!","review":"What a great BASS album! If you're a fan of this fantastic rhythm section.....please check DRAMA out. You won't be disappointed. As Rick Wakeman said, this was a very important album that brought Yes into the eighties and set them up for the very successful 90125! A great recording!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Harder Edged Yes","review":"This 1980 disc by the prog-rock veterans was the only release they recorded without vocalist Jon Anderson. But don't despair Trevor Horn (The Buggles) does an outstanding job filling Anderson shoes. This also is one of many recordings they did without keyboard wizard Rick Wakeman. He is replaced by Horn's bandmate in the Buggles and future Asia keyboardist Geoff Downes, who also does a commendable job.I think that the remaining Yes members without Anderson, decided that they could spread their wings and go for a harder sound and it's evident on Drama.Steve Howe's guitar playing is much more agressive as is bassist Chris Squires. It is some of their best work in Yes.I really liked the opening track \\"Machine Messiah\\" a three part, ten minute and half minute opus. I also liked \\"Into the Lens\\" and \\"Tempus Fugit\\".It may have dissapointed the hard-core Yes fans but I liked it. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Momento de Transicion","review":"Lo digo asi, pues no se sabe que pasaba en la banda por esa epoca, lo cierto que este album lo comprè en vinyl hace 18 años y al darme cuenta que no esta John Anderson ni Rick Wakeman casi lo devuelvo, sin embargo al empezarlo a oir me di cuenta de la grandiosidad de este disco, canciones como Machine Messiah y White Car son verdaderas obras de calidad, sin embargo Yes no puede existir como tal sin Anderson pues es parte esencial del estilo de la banda, a pesar del esfuerzo grande que hizo Trevor Horn, pero Geoff Downes demuestra porque ha tenido tanto exito en su carrera como solista y con Asia, Tempus Fugit pareciera una despedida, que ciertamente asi fue, pues la banda como tal se desmembrò, aunque lo positivo fue que de este proyecto naciò ASIA"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buggles Join Yes","review":"Of all the things that make up the Yes sound, the sprawling epics, the heavy keyboards and the like, the most distinctive element is the voice of lead singer Jon Anderson. His high-pitched, chirpy sound perfectly brought to life the trippy, pixish lyrics he wrote. For 1980's Drama he was replaced by Buggles lead singer Trevor Horn. In fact the other member of the Buggles, keyboardist Geoff Downes joined as well. While the highlight of the album is the superb keyboard work from Mr. Downes, its determent is Mr. Horn's vocals. All too often he tries to mimic Mr. Anderson and he comes off as a bad imitation. There only a couple of good songs and they are the industrial sounding \\"Into The Lens\\" and the unwielding \\"Machine Messiah"},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated.","review":"This first non-Jon Anderson YES album is very much a pre-cursor to 90125. Compared to its 1978 predecessor Tormato, this one rocks with a vengeance. Pacific Microsonics in Japan have brought out much greater clarity and dynamics in this 2001 HDCD remaster, like never before. It's a great improvement on the early 90's U.S. remastered CDs. The miniature gatefold LP jacket and artwork is just gorgeous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great album, but...","review":"... you know that keyboard fade-in that kicks off track 3's rideout? Well, when this track was remastered, the fade-in was not preserved. Keyboards just kick in at full volume, thus ruining the intended gradual build up to the bass-driven rideout. Other than this oversight, which knocks my rating of this edition to 1 star, the musical experience of Drama remains among my favorite of Yes. Keep the Atlantic remaster if you've got it, or get this if you can tolerate the remastering error. P.S., bonus tracks are inconsequential IMHO. The Anderson tracks underscore the fact that Yes was due for a change in musical direction.

I felt like I was in a new-age jazz club when I was listening to it, not a bad mix at all though, very refreshing.The second disk is more of the style Bud displays on Infinity plus Infinity. There wasn't a single track that I disliked or got monotonous. The good thing about these cd's is that they contain 11 new, never before released songs which is a good thing for those of you that hate buying cd's that contain tracks you already have.

While \\"Mombassa\\" adds some African chanting, \\"Sacha's Song\\" goes for straight-up deep house. \\"Soulfood\\" finally gets back to the drum \`n' bass we've been waiting for, and it's worth the wait for the jazzy juiciness. \\"Persian Blues\\" doesn't sound very Persian, but it does have some nice breaks. The second disc is more of the atmospheric drum \`n' bass for which Big Bud is known, but given the development of his sound that was demonstrated on the first disc, it's not quite as exciting as it should be. It's still cracking drum \`n' bass, though, so don't miss out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Duller & Dull","review":"2 1/2The first disc feels of mostly generic downbeat house, with a bit of generic upbeat d&b;, besides for some mildly sleek and exotic production which occasionally distinguishes the material from complete obscurity.

But it was pretty boring none the less and a waste of time and money for the rest. It's not an actual race game or anything, it's just a hit the right spot on the screen at the right moments type of thing.If you think it's going to be one of those racing games where one button is accelerate, ones break, and then steer them around the track, then you will be sorely mistaken. If thats what you are after, try \\"Cars: Mater-National\\" as that is what you'd think these games would be, and the type of games found on this version im reviewing here should be side mini/games on the \\"Cars: Mater-National\\" version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible game","review":"I bought this game for my son (6yrs), after watching the video review on Amazon. The actual game, at least the DS Lite version, is not what you see on the video review. Unfortunately, this is not a typical racing game. Most of the challenges have nothing to do with racing. Plus you have to use your stylus to play it. If you're looking for a good racing game, do not buy this. Its a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult for the younger kids","review":"While the movie appeals strongly to children under 8 years, this game is definitely too challenging for that same age group.

My son loves them and on his own he now possesses over 60 titles. Also, he loves movies, specially Pixar and Dreamworks movies. So, I have been trying to get him some games that are based on a Pixar classic or similar, such as Cars (very bad), Wall-e (boring), Toy Story 3 (excellent), Ratatouile (very good), and so on. There about 20 DS games (besides the ones I already mentioned): Cars race-o-rama (very good), Cars Mater National (very good), The incredibles (good), Up (lacking), Ratatouile Food Frenzy (boring), and so on. Cars is at the very best bottom: very little racing, very hard/boring puzzles (for my 6 year old kid and to me) and very little charm. I'll give it a 3 out of 10 (because of a very little racing game). If you are looking for fun, you have more luck slamming your head with the car door than by playing this game.

I guess it depends on your child's interest, but I can tell you mine just did not like this one at all. They are not hard to please either. Try another game. This is not a racing game at all.

Horrible, actually, unless you think washing cars and matching red-light patterns is fun and challenging. Can't really return it, as fault was not the seller's.

He chose this over several of his favorite characters. The game was fairly easy for him to catch on to but as he continued to play it he seemed to enjoy it more. This game was actually a bigger hit with other kids that went on the road trip as well. The ages were 8, 10, and 12. They all consistently played with this game during the entire trip and really enjoyed it. Since returning to home my son has not played this game, even when I ask him if he wants to play it he says no. I think one of the downfalls for him is that he can't drive Mater, only McQueen.

My only complaint is that it was not as green as it was in the picture...it was more of a blue-green.

Then she returned on Friday and found this side of glory would not only be a one woman sacrifice for all and a fun carousel for all to join.

Diana Ross displays why she's the quintessential entertainer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For diehards only.","review":"I thought this was the worst concert I have ever seen by Ross. The only reason there was so much hype was because she stayed during the storm so the crowd would leave peacefully and she came back the next day. Kudo's. Some of the songs seemed out of place, (\\"Maniac\\"?) and she's not much of a dancer as it appeared she threw in a quick class for this show. Other than her almost falling off the stage, not much to see here. If you want to see a \\"show\\" with Diana, look for Live at Caesar's Palace HBO special from around 1979. THAT was a show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The ever young dynamic Diana Ross","review":"This is a dvd taken of old performances but the quality is surprisingly good. Diana Ross is a graceful as ever.

Listening to the Supremes and then solo Diana Ross songs on our summer road trips always made me happy. As much as I love Beyonce, there would not be a Beyonce without Diana Ross. I have watched her NYC concert over 5 times now. When does an artist become an icon? When they fully command 400,000 people and you can tell how amazing those 2 concerts were from her amazing performance and the audiences roaring approval. I was so touched by her performing \\"Aint Not Mountain High Enough\\" on the first day when it was pouring massively. That, my friends, is an icon!!!!! My favorite quote from the day it poured rain was \\"It's taken me a lifetime to get here.

The second disc has all 13 episodes of the California Raisins animated Saturday morning cartoon series. I would have preferred that they put some of the cartoon episodes on the first disc, so as not to overload the second disc. The audio for the second disc is also not as good the the first disc. Watching with my surround sound system, the speaking voices in the cartoon series only come out of one speaker. This leads to the voices sounding hallow and too soft.

Going For The One was actually their last brilliant moment of that decade (the '70s), before a downward spiral set in that would finally end just recently. The pipe organ-drenched Awaken is the magnum opus here, but Steve Howe's guitar work on Turn Of The Century is timeless and unforgettable. Perhaps not the best album for an introduction to the band (I'd suggest The Yes Album for that), Going For The One is certainly more highly recommended than the disappointing follow-up - a rotten Tormato if ever there was one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Work Of Art","review":"I wholeheartedly agree with the other opinionsabout Awaken.Close to the edge is a mere warmup for this magnificant,uplifting work of art.If GFTT was five times the price and only containedthis track,I would still buy two copies."},{"rating":"2","title":"One thing to say about this","review":"Awaken.

This music is deeply different to all other kinds of music I know. It has something to do with philosophy and - perhaps only for me - with religion. What the people in former times tried to achieve by building the churches very high (reason: to be nearer to godfather) YES tried with their music. If you concentrate on it, it opens your mind and you loose your actual realistic daily problems. You realise that there is more to this world and to yourself as a human being.

Probably because Ganache for Lips only use natural ingredients, my lips can tolerate it really well. I have a friend who also have the same skin issue and I recommended Ganache for Lips to her and she also loves it.Asides from just being good for my lips, these balms also come in delicious flavors. They smell and taste a whole lot better than the other brand my skin can tolerate, Mentholatum medicated lip balm.

As a home educator, I am always on the lookout for multi-cultural resources that provide a window into the backgrounds of others. Since the author writes from personal background experience, as well as research into the African-American folktales, I believe it is an excellent representation of stories that children would have grown up with in that culture.

I do respect and appreciate people who has put big efforts forward and contribute to the learning environment like James Asher.I also found Bertha Segal's materials online to be very useful.Having observed the amazing resemblance between the learning process and the language development of a child and the TPR method(I have a toddler of my own),I am very much willing to use this book as a basic resource for my new student group of teenagers this year.I believe the syllabus has the right logical basis and will stick to it by excluding all different materials and methods.However,I think I must purchase the supplementary materials to help me provide the transition to speaking activities.I thank in advance to the writer for this wonderful study."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book about love and the rest of the world","review":"This is a book of poetry quite unlike anything available these days.

Apart from giving a strong reference point to sound engineers that want to learn how to mix in a full digital environment, Charles Dye giver away a bunch of secrets that will also help many professionals to improve their sound not copying his work but finding their own way to it. Yes, sometimes there are too much of video fx in the low budget way but it looks like the video stuff is not up to the quality of the audio gear.

The DVD did have a lot of theatrics in it which was not a good thing; however with careful eyes and ears, you can pull out some useful information.Now depending on your role and expertise (Song Writer, Sound Engineer, Mixer, Musician, etc...) will depend on your love for this DVD. My cup of soup is musician and I like recording and mixing as a tool for my song creation. This DVD did provide me with a few tips that I can apply to my mixes and recording session.If you're a music gear nut and love to live & breath anything music related (like I), then you're going to own this DVD very shortly if you haven't already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this like the plague!","review":"This DVD is nothing more than a Pro Tools infomercial, and an unbearably pretentious one at that. At $30-$40 it might be worthwhile, but $134?!? It spends a lot of time focusing on basic concepts, while providing little information that will be of value to a professional looking to improve his craft. It promotes over-use of plug-ins and encourages beginners to think that a fully blown Pro Tools HD system is the ONLY way to go.In my opinion, Charles Dye is NOT a mixer that beginning audio engineers should seek to emulate, as he has zero experience with analog techniques or systems other than Pro Tools, his work epitomizes much of what is wrong with today's pop sound, and he is laughed at by old-school engineers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only buy this if you love Charles Dye as Much as he loves himself...","review":"Wow. This is truly bad. I can only imagine how stoned this guy was on his own ego to conceive of shooting footage of himself all over the world blathering on and on. It's a horribly-shot shaky video homage to this geek with money to spend on himself. Oh yeah, and he talks about mixing occasionally, too.In other words, there may be good info in this, but it's so badly done and with so much fluff that you are far better off spending your money elsewhere.

Within 10 minutes I was dtarting to get annoyed with all of the video editing effects that was being used a bit too excessively.

It is as thin as water, acetic in not a good way, and completely lacking in the flavor complexities one wants in a good bottle of balsamic. This is watery dark-colored vinegar. This is NOT 3 leaf balsamic which I hoped I could use as a drizzle or use for a reduction. Is there a board I can appeal to?

This story is full of characters who I think were supposed to by sympathetic. . . Before I was even a third of the way through, I was hoping it would end with some sort of catastrophic event that killed every character in a terrible, horrific, painful manner.The author managed to take a pretty interesting idea - rewriting the genetic code of a man using DNA thought to be from Christ - and made it dull and very predictable. The mosr amazing feat is that at the same time, he manged to write several characters who were all in need of a .45 cranial injection. The only character I dind't want dead soon into the book was Freddy. I liked him.A very disappointing book, which is a shame, since it shouldn't have been. The base idea was interesting, and worthy of exploration, but the author didn't have the courage to see it through, and instead decided to go with old, worn-out plot twists that anyone could see coming from a mile away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book!","review":"I purchased this book many years ago thinking I would just read it because I was bored.

You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"The unbelievable awfulness of the prose makes Dan Brown look like Borges in comparison. Naming characters \\"Guard One\\" just shows you don't even try to care. The plot is so hair-brained that just thinking about it gives me a headache -- I just learned, to my horror, that there are two sequels to this that turn the entire thing into a treatise on the end times. I'd have loved to see what a capable author could have done with the premise, but it's been ruined forever by... this. Somewhere, Baby Jesus is crying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"Extremely simplistic development of character and plot. The technical/chemical detail involved in genetic research was so overwhelming it seemed to be a disguise for the shortcomings mentioned above. I am a fan of the Left Behind series, a genre new to me, so this is my first, and last, Bill Myers book. Given the premise this could have been a fascinating book, but was instead extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing...","review":"This dvd has 3 short films about the holcaust. The 1st one, Lest We Forget, is especially interesting as it's in color, the 1st time I've seen color holocaust footage. The second film, Nazi Concentation Camps, is the longest of the films clocking in a just under an hour. I've seen it before and it is an excellent, and perhaps perfect example of nazi horrors at their death camps. The print is very clean. The final film, deals with Nuremberg and the nazis being put on trial. It's all very compelling and although it's very disturbing, it's a story that must be told,\\"lest we forget\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Beginners Only!","review":"Really, I can't say this book was good or bad, just that it was made for people who have almost no photography experience. Although things like composition are very important, when it comes to night photography, exposure becomes paramount. But this book gives only the most general of advice in that area! It would have been nice if the author would have at least put exposure information next to each picture (exposure, lens, film speed, and other info would have been even better). The book would be better served concentrating less on talking about ideas for nice compositions...let us, the buyers of the book, find our own compositions...let the book tell us how to get the right exposure for the myraid of different night time conditions. The bottom line: This book is a nice \\"chat\\" about night photography: don't expect to find any seriously useful tips about the art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired, boring photo and stories","review":"I don't want to spend more time to write about this book.

Save your $$ and buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Please.","review":"Ah, for those who can't come up with their own ideas... must copy someone elses. Like the Harry Potter imitations, now a series of unfortunate events has its copycats too. However, I was a bit shocked that an author would be sold bold to copy this closely. Right down to saying what the character will have to endure along the way. Truth be told, the reason I bought this book in the first place is because I thought it was written by Lemony Snicket! But as I began to read, the writing style is clearly inferior. Please, don't support an author who is not coming up with his own ideas, go for the series of unfortunate events instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"And that's for the book designer!","review":"Ok, I guess amazon has this thing that if it's a REALLY nasty review, they won't post it.

The ONLY, and I mean, ONLY reason this was posted because they think the Lemony-copiers are gonna sell. It's so stupid. I can't express how much i hated this book. I stopped reading on the last chapter. There was NO suspension, or meaning for me to read.

You are racing against the clock to complete the challenge in 60 seconds. None of us (ages 5, 16, and adult) were able to complete the challenge at all. While it might be fun to try parts of it, it seems impossible to make it through the whole maze without making any mistakes and having to start over.

Well, it's better to find it out yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I'm sorry to say I felt this book didn't live up to its hype. Although the concept was interesting and the writing was at times inspired and evocative, it left me flat. I felt like I'd heard it all before and I found the outcome predictable. I am an extremely well-read lover of contemporary fiction, and perhaps my expectations were just too high. Having said this - I am sure young adults (for whom the book is actually written) would be far more entranced."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLOW PACE","review":"This book didn't live up to its hype and the 5 star ratings it received. I bought it trusting the amazon ratings. The concept was interesting, the writing at times was ok then slowed to a crawl in some of the plots.I wish publishers were more honest with authors and with some rewrites this story should be a 4 star. But it needs more work. I wish Sonya well in future writings and hope she comes up with a winner. Please don't be highly offended by my comments but book buyers need the truth I felt that I totally wasted my money and the ratings on amazon should have been more acurate!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING ROCK OPERA !!!!!","review":"When I got this cd and listened first time it touched me so emotionally. Musicianship and vocals are amazing. This music takes you away from the ordinary. Glenn Hughes, John Lande and Joe Lynn Turner are enchiting.Nicolo Kotzev created something which is the best any musician can achieve. Songs are beautifully played with the touch of symphony orchestra and hint of hard rock.Can not wait for continuation of this great ROCK OPERA.Highly recommend anyone who liked previous Brazen Abbot work but not only."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic album","review":"I've read all of the previous reviews and I have to disagree with them a bit. This isn't really a \\"rock opera\\" in the same way Tommy, Dead Winter Dead, and Beethoveen's last night are. The music reminds me of Jesus Christ: Superstar and after you've heard a little of it I think you'll see a similarity. The music is wonderful and the vocals are very well done. The only thing that I found that I didn't like was some of the chorus parts. Some of the chorus parts are run through a computer to alter the sound and it gives it synth sound. Overall, great stuff"},{"rating":"2","title":"a REAL rock opera","review":"this one is a rock opera in the way \\"Jesuschrist Superstar\\" or \\"Rent\\" is. A REAL rock opera.

It was easy enough to read and enjoyable enough to finish. I felt bad for poor Maggie, being raised by her mother's parents, and then being shuffled off to total strangers to be raised after her parents die. I still feel as though she should have lived with her birth mother, the whole thing was very cruel. This book was not as thrilling to me as Scruples 2 or Lovers, but Krantz definitely gets a thumbs up for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's with the names?","review":"This book was sometimes fun, other times a letdown. It kept me turning the pages, but I found myself wanting to skim it. I guess my favorite Krantz books were \\"Til We Meet Again\\", and the original \\"Scruples.\\" I also still keep a copy of \\"I'll Take Manahttan\\" around, only because the humor makes me laugh out loud in places. But her recent stuff has not been as good. And what's with the names? She seems to like to recycle them. This book has a character named Maggie. There was also a Maggie in \\"Mistral's Daughter,\\" a Marguerite in \\"Princess Daisy,\\" as well as a \\"Maddy\\" in \\"'Til We Meet Again.\\" The latter book also had a character named \\"Freddy,\\" and in \\"Mistral's Daughter\\" there was a \\"Teddy.\\" Now at the end of this new book, the latest Maggie has a baby named \\"Daisy.\\" Does this sound familiar? No wonder her books are starting to seem recycled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not a Page-Turner","review":"It was typical \\"Krantz-Glitz.\\" I probably should have waited for it at the Library rather than spring for it at the book store. I like to share books with out-of-state friends, but hate to spend the postage on a book that is half-ok and half-snore material. Definitely not her best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"a study in priorities set in the most glamorous settings","review":"I found the development of Tessa Kent as absolutely fascinating a psychological study as can be found in popular fiction. Gorgeous, talented Tessa has the strict upbringing and martyr-mother to guarantee a crisis; which comes in the form of her unacknowledged daughter, shielded by a tight web of family lies. Tessa marries for security, is unexpectedly widowed, finds solace in work, new love, and eventually, with the drama lent by a fatal illness, ultimate reconciliation. Could any of us have made different, better, decisions? The detail of the auction house is delightful, the character development of several friends of the key players well done, and the second-guessing of Tessa's priorities, inevitable."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Absolute Masterpiece","review":"Reading reviews of some other novels by Judith Krantz, I read that she uses the same general theme in all the books she writes.

I just swapped out the old filter with the new and the car has regained some pep. After getting all the fuel out of the old filter, I could tell it was noticeably heavier than the new one... that extra weight was the sludge trapped in the filter!Changing the filter was super easy, minus getting the hoses removed from the old one. Once they slipped onto the new one, they were snug enough to leave on without clamps, but I tightened the clamps on anyways.The other 'challlenge' was locating the fuel pump's relay, which I could never find despite all the documents and 'maps' I used...

But, apart from its nice design, this phone didn't meet our expectations, mainly because of its unability to transfer contact data from your Yahoo Adress book. And entering contacts in the phone or simply navigate into the menus wasn't the best part. However, this phone seems to be a better performer for PC to PC calls (Yahoo Msgr directly) since you can directly access your Messenger contact list."},{"rating":"1","title":"User","review":"The CIT 310 phone is a great idea , but there are major problems with the phone that detract from its full potential. The first problem is that the sound volume heard by the phone user is way too low and as far as I can tell unadjustable. This is also true for calls placed over the regular phone line even with the phone disconnected from the computer. The sound heard by the people being called is satisfactory and most of the time they report a real clear sound. The second problem is that if the computer is in sleep mode, either an incoming call or an attempt to use the phone will restart the computer. These two problems make the phone not very useful to me.1/25/07 Beware the obvious. The navigation bar adjusts the volume. The user manuel does not tell you this nor did my contacts with Linksys.

I have never been able to use the phone for VIOP which is a shame since thats why I purchased it. Now it constantly says out of range even though I'm right next to the base.

I don't recomend buying one of these unless you enjoy headaches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not usable for VoIP","review":"As a regular Yahoo! Voice user, I was excited to see this product become available, and ordered one as soon as I saw it.It was easy to set up, and worked well, out of the box. I did some normal land-line calls (non-VOIP), and it worked well. It downloaded my Yahoo contact list to the phone, but I wasn't able to select a number to dial over the normal line. I had to dial the numbers myself.Then I made a VoIP call, and things fell apart. The calls completed successfully, but both people I called complained of echoes and low volume, so much so that they said they felt it was unusable. The problem got worse the further away from the base unit. Given the generally high quality of Yahoo!

Althought the people on the other end sound only slightly disatant, there's not any static or anything of that sort - but it is pretty hard to hear them, and I've not had much luck in finding anyway to adjust to volume in a discernable way. The calling out works fine, once you figure out what settings to put the mic and speakers on - but that took some trial and error. And just when you think you have it, someone calls you, and the settings that worked for calling out, don't work for calling in. haven't had a chance to convince someone to trouble shoot it with me - it'd take them making a few calls while I try the different settings options. So it's functional. partially. And I think I recall recieving a call on it successfully once, but I don't remember the settings I used.

So, I just gave up and returned it.THANKS AMAZON for your liberal and easy return policy. You guys deserve five stars for that.PS to the makers of this procuct: As I say -- it's a good idea for a product and I hope you develop it. I may still be a customer.

I purchased a wireless router from them and, truth be told, it never really worked right. The speed was ok, but it was impossible to set up without tech support and every so often it would simply stop working. When that happened I would be forced to call tech support and spend 30-60 minutes on the phone fighting with them about resetting the router. I recently purchased a new computer and decided to save a little money by moving this router to it. When I called tech support I was told that the router was out of its warranty period and they could not help me... unless I would pay them to. That's right, I would have to pay for the assistance on their product - a working product because it was not under warranty.So be warned that you are only buying the option to use Linksys' products for a limited time - that is if you have any problems whatsoever that require tech support.

You have to go to audio settings in control panel and set the default device anytime you want to change it between the speakers or phone.

It would sometimes have problems if the other end is not a good connection, and the ear piece sound could be louder.The phone's software sometimes mysteriously goes inactive, and has to be restarted, but considering this is one of the few phones that works directly with Yahoo Messenger, it maybe an only choice if you are not interested in the competitor.I also would have expected to customize it better with phone's software, as most phones with a USB port could sync address books, and a number of other things. This only gives you a means to align with Yahoo Messenger. Also with Yahoo Voice Messaging, it is impossible to listen to voice messages without changing the speaker to your PC, restart, and change back to the USB, and restart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad Product","review":"I wish I never bought this phone!Like some others mentioned; it was a huge waste. The landline connection works but it is very difficult to hear the other person on the line, sometimes it is very loud, sometimes you can't tell what he/she is saying. The volume controls are difficult to balance. The menus are very badly designed makes you feel like the phone is a kids toy or something. When dialing a number you will be faced with the number being pressed twice or sometimes it wont appear on the screen, this is because of the lousy design of the keypad.I have hooked it up to my pc and at first it worked and the pc recognized it and it was ok, the second time I unhooked it and then retried connecting it and the pc didnt find it, I unloaded the software reloaded but nothing.Believe me if you like using the yahoo voice features stick with a set of headsets and mic, if you want to get tacky maybe get some bluetooth gear, but this phone is not worth a cent."},{"rating":"1","title":"i guess its ok","review":"well im in iraq and i figured i buy this phone so i could communicate with my wife through yahoo messenger at first the phone was working ok..well for about 3 hours. then all of a sudden my sound settings were altered horribly and the phone stopped working i finally figured out how to properly use it and lets just say it works when it wants...your better off buying a headphone set...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Linksys CIT310 for Yahoo Massanger","review":"Hi I bought this product for my convinience and its perfect.

You aren't getting your value's worth for the amount of content when compared to the preceeding books in this series.By the title, it would seem this is being marketed more as a hint book for the upcoming computer game, but the book is not a hint book. Instead, the name seems to be a ploy to bank on the name-recognition of the computer game. The setting for the book is the same, but the presentation of the material makes it clear that any use it has as a clue book is buried deep... very deep.If the format and concept for this book appeals to you -- a Dungeons & Dragons take on travel guide books -- you'll get more from one of the earlier editions than from this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another in the Volo's Series","review":"Another in the installment (and maybe the last) of the \\"Volo\\" series. The title of this book is semi-deceptive because the book does not give hints/leads to the Baldur's Gate II computer game that is arriving soon.The book does continue its in-depth detailing of the region, with a small overlap with the Volo's books concerning Waterdeep (not very much), and the Volo's Guide to the North (A little more detail overlap, but not too bad).All in all, this books provides an added demension to the area, and a new resource for a DM. If you don't like the extra detail, rewrite it and use it for another campaign world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conflicting Forgotten Realms","review":"While I enjoyed some of this book, it was a major disappointment to realise it bore no resemblance to the Baldurs Gate II Shadows of Amn lands and areas in the game. I wasn't looking for a hint book or strategy guide, but this book arguably should have been relevant to places in the game and really missed a trick in not offering readers info on, for example, the Copper Coronet, purposes of the Hidden in Athkatla, or history of family feuds in Trademeet. I still got through the book and found it interesting, but sadly not related to anything else I've read or played."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with the negative comments","review":"What I read of this book makes me agree with the negative reviews. The cover gives a false impression of the book. The last chapter on Bible translations is amateurish and inaccurate. The beginning cites the faulty and now-disproven Torah codes as proof of the inspiration of Scripture. Maybe the rest is better, but what I read did not impress me.

In my years as such I have used many different types of tape measures. I have found the Leverlock to be my favorite. My favorite feature is that the tape stays out to whatever length you want without engaging a lock mechanism. This is helpful if your tape end slips off the object you are measuring. It won't come reeling back at you at warp speed. I like the feel it, it's solid in your hand. The color makes it easy to find too. The tape has good standout and is easy to read. The only drawback is that eventually the auto-lock mechanism will wear out. Keep in mind that this is an extremly used tool. By then it's usually time to retire it to the wood shop. Otherwise it's the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tape measure","review":"I love these Stanley lever lock tape measures!! You can do most any measuring with one hand.

I agree with the previous reviewer that it is an attractive looking board. If you are looking for something that is nicer than the regular, cheap boards, but you're not quite ready to spend $70 or more on an expensive board then this is the one for you. Better modles have padding in the draws that hold the pieces securely whereas the pieces are loose in these draws, and weighted pieces to withstand being knocked over easily (though the pieces on this one are magnetic which also works very well). If you are looking to spend $70 or more, or are looking for specific qualities such as weighted peices, then you should definitely take a look at some of the other options that look great, but for me this was the perfect compromise between quality and affordability."},{"rating":"2","title":"quality + price = great value","review":"The set is on the small side, but it is attractive and gets the job done.

As such Duke seriously comes up short. Theres a lot of terrible numbers on this album and the only highlights on this album are the 2 and 1/2 minute intros of Behind The Lines and Duchess, the endings of both songs, the instrumental part of Dukes travels (not the lyrics which are unoriginally lifted from Guide Vocal) and Dukes End even though it is also unoriginal. These places show the group could atleast still show great creativity."},{"rating":"1","title":"the beginning of the end...","review":"During the 80s and 90s, Genesis would release many lousy albums, and this is the first. Compared with Genesis prior to this album, \\"Duke\\" is sort of like giving Dali or Picasso a frontal lobotomy, and then watching them drool helplessly while wearing a straightjacket.\\"Misunderstanding\\" is a terribly simplistic song better suited to Barry Manilow; \\"Please Don't Ask\\" might have worked for James Taylor or Bread. But these songs aren't Genesis.The only good tracks are \\"Behind the Lines\\" (first half only) and the awe-inspiring closing suite, \\"Duke's Travels/Duke's End\\", which fully reveals Genesis' potential.Otherwise, this album is mind-numbingly simple and uninventive. Do yourself a favor - buy all Genesis albums before this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can this album be rated 4 1/2 stars ?","review":"I am wondering how can \\"Duke\\" have an average of 4 1/2 stars ?In my mind, the opening and the closing tracks are the highlights of the CD. \\"Behind the lines-Duchess-Guide vocal\\" is greatly done. The best of the album is by far \\"Duke's travel-Duke's end\\"The hits \\"Misundertanding\\" and Turn it on again\\" are totally burned songs, we have heard them too often. The rest is so-so, nothing memorable there..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This is trash! This is where genesis truly sold out and I can't believe all the good reviews it is getting. Genesis use to be a great prog band and then Peter Gabriel left but they were still doing well without him. But Hackett left and Genesis was destroyed. They should have changed their name."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop Masterpiece","review":"Emotional, intelligent music that spans prog and pop music, transcending both. The band reached its pinnacle here. This is the best Genesis album, and a desert island disc. I wish Banks, Collins and Rutherford would regroup and give this sound new life, its so deserving of a wide audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave","review":"I started my fandom of Genesis with Invisible Touch and thought it a great album, only when I started to delve deeper in to their progressive roots did I find how powerful their music could be. With Duke, admittedly, it isn't progressive, since they had all but done away with that after \\"And then there were Three\\" but it is by far their best non-progressive album and the beginning of Phil Collins writing career (two of the songs on the album were actually written by Collins when he wrote his first solo album \\"Face Value\\"). So as far as Modern Genesis fans are concerned this is a complete must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Duke' is an imperial masterpiece","review":"With this CD, Genesis makes good use of its progressive roots for sadly, the last time. The majority of the tracks here use quite a bit of that hard-line progressivism, from the opening \\"Behind The Lines\\" and \\"Man Of Our Times\\" to the fantastic encore \\"Duke's Travels/Dukes End\\". \\"Duke\\" also contains a softer, easy-going side in tracks like \\"Misunderstanding\\",\\"Heathaze\\" and \\"Please Don't Ask\\", which all makes for an interesting, well-balanced blend of music. Since this is Genesis' last stand of progressive rock, you'll want to add \\"Duke\\" to your \\"must-have\\" collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"\\"Please Don't Ask\\" is probably my favorite song ever. It's a shame that that song never became a hit. Heathaze is a song that expresses how life seems pointless and without meaning at times. Dreaming & drifting off seem like your only option of getting away. Misunderstanding is a tune that many of us can relate to. You wait to go out on a wonderful & romantic evening with your lover, your heart pounding--and she's not there. Duke's end was one of those types of musicals that Genesis used to do at the end of an album combining various tunes from various songs sounding a bit different & distorted. A clever idea, indeed. All in all, a beautiful album."},{"rating":"2","title":"There must be some misunderstanding among Genesis purists, this is a good record","review":"The trio get even better at writing short songs here and they even get into the hit parade. I never understood why the Genesis purists would hate them for that. Whats the problem, they are good songwriters and they got lucky and made a little money. In exchange for the fans they lost, they gained even more fans, change is good. If the purists didn't notice, this is a semi-concept album and Dukes travels is one of the most progressive things they've ever done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good now!","review":"I remember well, a flight to India in the 80's and on the audio, Thai Airways were playing this album.Well, its still as fresh and engaging now as it was then....20 odd years later.Probably not as well known as other Genesis work, but still, for me, evocative of a different time.Definitely enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mid Genesis","review":"I'm not a Genesis fan from the 60's. I've grown to love that music, but my first exposure to Genesis was ..And Then There Were Three. Yes, I was a late comer, but a complete enthusiast of all things Genesis going back as far as the.... genesis of Genesis?? So.. here we have Duke. ONE LONG SONG. Break it into singles if you must, this entire album... side A, side B, is one song and it is delivered perfectly. Put it on, lie back and listen... and you won't stop until it's over. From the moment it begins until the second it ends, it is pure perfection. Any album I can fall asleep to..... well, that speaks volumes. Consider where they were in their growth as a group. It's an amazing collection of music. If someone put me on a desert island and told me I only have five albums I could bring with me... this would be one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"I'm a big fan of the early prog stuff (70-77), but found this album to be pretty good, even though this really was the beginning of the pop era for them. Behind the Lines, Duchess, and Man Of Our Times are excellent, don't really care for Misunderstanding, but it's not a bad song, which brings me to Heathaze, I don't know what it is, but I really like this song. Turn it on Again is classic. The rest of what was originally side 2 of the LP is pretty unremarkable with the exception of Dukes Travels/Dukes End.

Self-delusion is the title I chose for this review, because anyone who read this and pretended it was a profound eye-opening experience that revealed hard to grapple with truths about the contradictions in traditional theisms will need a ph.d in self-delusion.

I bought the stage stars version first and was so disappointed in the quality that I almost didn't get this one. What a mistake that would have been!! This CD is so much better in terms of musical quality and the pacing within the songs is very similar to the soundtrack. My only disappointment was that it does not contain \\"No One Mourns the Wicked.\\" I was excited to find that it includes both \\"I'm Not that Girl\\" and the reprise. Also, some people may be disappointed that there are only the instrumental tracks and no practice vocals. Overall, this is a great karaoke CD. For those who love Wicked, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Says CD+G on cover but has NO on screen lyrics","review":"I bought my copy last April (2007) and haven't been able to use it in a Karaoke machine until today and found that there are no on screen lyrics despite it saying it's a CD+G on the cover.

I have hand washed him time and time again since he has been in some sticky and muddy situations. He looks quite loved now, but the only thing that has come apart his the stitching on his nose (but my son walked around with Wooly's nose in his mouth for months, so it was to be expected). Best bear ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books ever!","review":"Monsters in Cyberspace is the 3rd book in the series Monster of the Month Club. It is a very funny and interesting book. It's realistic too (ignoring the fact that it's a fictitious book). Three new monsters are introduced: Sparkler, Butterscotch, and Owl, for July, August, and September. Owl speaks English(the only monster that can), and is a very funny character. He keeps sending e-mail to everyone with a screen-name containing the word \\"monster\\" on Rilla's new internet. He also has a very unique talent to remember information he eats(on paper), which makes it easy to do Rilla's homework, which gets her into trouble. In this book, Rilla is able to contact her father through the computer as well, while having to deal with the monsters gambling. As a result, Owl loses his glasses and his memory becomes permanently damaged. This book is a must-read, as well as the rest of the series of the MOTM!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MC 5 - 'Thunder Express' (Sky Dog)","review":"Whew!

Couple of gems here I simply do not remember being on any other MC 5 release, their well done Stones cover \\"Empty Heart\\" and an original of theirs that was never officially put out on record the, awesome title track \\"Thunder Express\\". Other tunes that might make it nearly impossible for you to keep still the first few times you spin this CD are their Van Morrison staple \\"I Can Only Give You Everything\\", the total ass-kicking \\"I Just Don't Know\\" and \\"Looking At You\\" {maybe best track here, although every tune is GREAT!}.

You can advance through the multiple races, tracing a movie plot that ultimately pits Lightning McQueen against the vile Chick. Alternatively, you can just drive around, complete some mini-games, and generally explore various fun environments.The driving mechanics, at least in the exploration mode of play, are simple and easy, even for 4-5 year old kids. There is relatively little violence or suspense to scare them, and no damage from crashes, however spectacular they may seem.The racing will be challenging for beginning gamers, and the road races especially are boring and repetitive (the off-road and back country races are more engaging, though).

I am already through most of the book again and it's as good as I remember it. A fair warning: some of the scenes of death are vividly graphic (not necessarily for the faint of heart) and there are deeply religious overtones (I happen to be Christian, so it didn't bother me). This book is mostly for the jr. high/early high school crowd and carries with it an important message about the cost of seeking revenge on those whom have wronged you. If viewed as a work of fiction with an important message, you won't be disappointed. If you view this as a 178 page public service announcement for religion and against revenge, you will probably become annoyed too soon and not give this book the chance that it deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"The epitome of \\"Classic\\" rock.","review":"In every sense of the word, Yes captures the heart and soul of any music that would covet the label \\"classic.\\" And Close to the Edge is, arguably the best all-around example of what they do best - incredibly complex, intense, subtle, pleasing, melodic, poetic MUSIC! Any You and I has been my favorite non-classical work since the early 70's (1972). Grab your floor pillow, find a patch of sunshine, strap on the headphones, turn up the volume and get ready for the finest musical travel vacation you'll ever experience...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes has sailed over the edge","review":"The first time I heard the complete album was 5 years ago when I got the remastered version. I had Classic Yes for several years having And You & I on it. I was simply floored by the two other songs.I'm a rather young Yes fan (I'm 28) and missed out on those early and amazing years. Clearly this album is one of Yes' true masterpieces. The atmospheres are breathtaking from the title song, and Siberian Khatru is a mindblowing rocker. I even love the album cover. The hazy black & green captures the mystery of the songs. Also the first cover to feature the classic Yeslogo. This is one of Yes' seminal albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"THEIR BEST.... (4.5 STARS)","review":"Never has an album from this time period felt and sounded so fresh today. Something Yes fans have always appreciated was the timelessness of their albums. Having the opportunity to play an album like this one has been possible for near 30 years, yet you can't get sick of it.And that is true for no record more than \\"Close to the Edge,\\" Yes's contribution to the music world from 1972. The title track is rumored to be their best and one of the best from their time period. The album/song was so successful, in fact, that they decided to do \\"Yessongs,\\" perhaps their second or first best, depending on the fans taste or distaste for live music. \\"And You And I\\" is another muscial masterpiece; a love song that plays out like an antheme. And \\"Siberian Khatru\\" is no different to the other two in terms of genious. It's featured in most of their live albums and \\"best of\\" packages. This is their best, and great way to be intruduced to this amazing band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh for the days of Yesteryear...","review":"This was one of my first \\"rock\\" albums that I bought. Back in 1973, when I was 15 years old, I can remember laying on the front room floor with my Realistic AM/FM receiver and my Realistic MC1000 speakers, each positioned about 9 inches from my ears, digging this album. I got off on Chris Squire's fabulous bass guitar riffs, especially on the title cut. I loved the whole album then and as I think back, I still love the album. I bought the CD and my 3 sons love it as well. It does this 41 year old fart good to see that music appreciation is apparently genetic. The only reason I did't give it 5 stars is because I reserve that rating, personally, for early ( read this as pre-1979 ) Genesis and J.S. Bach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Yes","review":"One of the best Yes studio albums; title song could well be considered Yes signature song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly transferred to CD","review":"This is almost completely unlistenable because the quality of the CD is so poor. This is true of all the YES records. They weren't transfered to CD very well. Re-mastered versions have more recently come out. I haven't heard them, but this is not worth buying and, unlike the other single-star reviewers, I LOVED this record when I was in my early 20s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece of classicial rock","review":"this is an example of how rock music could be blended with themes and seperated by movements.

Try it young guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garbage lyrics, superb music.","review":"My feelings about this album has to be divided between \\"before and after\\" I got the complete lyrics. Before this I liked the album without any reserves, the combination of music and words' sounds, the voices, the atmosphere it creates, that takes you to a world of dreams. This sensation was augmented by the fact that it is rather difficult to understand the lyrics, word by word, therefore I had to imagine what I thought the composer was trying to say. What a disappointment when I finally got the complete lyrics, nonsense garbage! It sounds beautifull in conjunction with the music, but still garbage. What did Jon try to say with it?, well, in my opinion, absolutey nothing. After this shock though, still the combination of words'sounds and music remains superb."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the original versions!","review":"I bought this album exclusively for \\"And You And I\\". Although the instrumental sections sound basically the way I remember them, the vocals by Jon Anderson are NOT the original version! It is an \\"alternate\\" version from the original album. If you've never heard the song before I guess it will sound OK, but if you grew up being transported by the original version you are likely to cringe at this re-styling. I had to look to make sure this wasn't a Yes cover band! What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"New tracks? Bonus tracks?","review":"All of the songs on this album rock. All the bonus songs rock. But im giving this 1 star. Why? It isn't original. The original \\"Close to the Edge\\" album and CD release had 3 tracks: \\"Close to the Edge\\", \\"And You and i\\", and \\"Siberian Khatru\\". When i buy a cd, i expect the cd: nothing more, nothing less. im terribly disappointed to find that record companies are slapping other crap in these \\"reissues\\". Even if the bonus tracks were the BEST SONGS IN THE WORLD, that would still be tampering with history. So if you are a classic Yes fan expecting \\"Close to the Edge\\" untampered, im warning you: this has been messed with. Use caution when buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees!!!","review":"I wonder how many times I have listened to this record and every time I\`m finished hearing the title track I have tears in my eyes! I can\`t think about any song that has more emotions than this song! The start is very exiting and it moves you when you hear the great guitar by Steve Howe and suddenly it disapers into a wonderful tune. In the middle it\`s the great church organ by Rick Wakeman that sends shivers down my spine! oooooooooooh, I can sy no more! The whole album is wonderful and all progressive rockers will probably love it.......some probably won\`t because it\`s a very sofisticated album but that\`s great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Timeless Masterpiece","review":"This is the album that definitively put progressive rock on the musical map. Yes is considered a \\"dinosaur band\\" by many. I would venture a guess that those have never really \\"listened\\" to this album. It is not the kind of work you will get into on the first try. It will probably take at least three sessions to start hearing the incredible melodic passages. As Yes often does, they hit hard with what seems to be an incoherent piece of music. Further listening will reward you greatly with some of the most beautiful melodies ever written; truly diamonds in the rough. I still remember listening to this over and over in 1972.

Enjoy!Greg"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best Yes album","review":"After reading the scathing review by critic David Cavanagh I just had to respond. The typical rock critic seems to think that any band that slightly deviates from the Beatles format is beneath contempt. Yes may have been pompous but their music is far from unenjoyable. The band has always had some of the most talented musicians in rock history. Close to the Edge has always been one of my favorite albums of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still excellent after more than two decades","review":"I had the privilege of seeing Yes in Boston... (6/98) They played the entire contents of this album and it was as good as it was when I first saw them perform it 22 years ago.Progressive/classic rock at its finest by first rate musicians. If you like music moody, melodic, complex, finely constructed, and at times challenging, this is well worth investing in. One prerequisite is an attention span longer than ten minutes.Mark"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing music to take you away","review":"This is music of such genius, both in composition & improvisation. The 20 minute monster masterpiece title track feels like it just goes everywhere & does everything after starting with incredible counterpoint.

This is the cornerstone of Yes."},{"rating":"2","title":"pass the marijuana","review":"It's difficult for me to understand how the pop music world has turned it's focus away from real musicians; I don't smoke pot anymore;but I will listen to Yes, it's still damn good music..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for the time capsule","review":"Take all the superlatives said below, and add my voice to the chorus.

Orgaans, drums, even a harpsichord, for Heaven's sake! Massive floating vocals.I am not sure that it would be possible to over-praise this album. No one sounded like Yes before them.

All of the worst excesses that have marred later Yes music begin to show themselves here. Featuring weak songwriting and endless solo noodling, the album lacks focus or ultimately enough rock enerygy to sustain it. And without strong songs to wrap his falsetto voice around, John Anderson can be one of the most irritating singers on the planet. Stick with the previous two efforts mentioned above and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superb musicianship, still an exercise in wankery","review":"I think Yes are the fathers of Dream Theater, indisputable chops; horrible and boring, utterly unmoving songs.

It seems like they are constantly overdoing the complex nature of their music, but I just could never figure out what the point was. I realize that they are good (if not great) muscians, but they seem to try to make up for lack of real creativity with tons of disjointed oddities. The lyrics are at times almost sermons, but nothing is said. \\"I get down, but I get up, I get down but I get up\\" etc. etc. I have listened to these guys off and on throughout the years hoping to get it, but they never changed and neither has my opinion. Who wants to listen to a church organ? Emerson, Lake, and Palmer. King Crimson. All the same. Jumpy, irritating mishmash of whacked out tangents. Confusing and weird for the sake of weirdness. They can play their instruments, but they just need someone to calm them down and write a few good tunes for them. Oh yes, and can the castrato vocals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry but I had to do it!!!!!","review":"I know that this MUST be Jon and Steve's favorite because they ALWAYS do it \\"live\\".

Remember Bill Bruford quit over it. I cant blame him........try \\"Tales\\" or \\"Relayer\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"pointless","review":"Yes was not a creative band. They simply cared to push the envelope. This album is not a seminal masterpiece but more a plea to the people of guiness. Yes wanted to be the most complex band in the world. They did succeed at that but nothing else. The music is bewildering and unlistenable. Whereas other progressive rock bands had something to say in their complexity, Yes was doing it to be the most complex. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where they Close to or just over the edge?","review":"Yes, they made their mark on symphonic music in the early 70's. After the disappointing 'Fragile', full of ego documents, 'Close to the Edge' was and is a strong landmark, with the long but not too long title-track standing out. They never made anything that came close, but as a sign of the times, with the very trendy Roger Dean artwork, 'Close to the Edge' remains something special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic YES as good as it gets.","review":"This 2001 HDCD version is sonically by far the best version available on CD, even if your player doesn't have a HDCD decoder. The dynamics are as good as I've ever heard. I own a copy of the Original Master Recording vinyl edition by MFSL and I must say that this one comes damn close (no puns please). All the original artwork and gate-fold sleeve are replicated in miniaturised form. Very cute.Bear in mind: \\"Remastered from the original master tape\\" means there is going to be the odd dropout here and there. After all, the tapes are 31 years old! It would be a miracle if there weren't any flaws!So, if you ever hear a \\"perfect\\" edition re-master, ask yourself \\"how was it all repaired all of a sudden?\\" Hmmmmmmm......I tend to listen to the music and not get too {uptight} about the inevitable ravages of time. Hell, most YES fans have developed some dropouts of their own!!! How are yours, by the way?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The *Standard* by which all others are measured","review":"In my opinion, this is the Standard by which all other Progressive Rock and Art Rock albums are measured. If Yes had only produced this one album, I believe they would still be considered one of the greatest bands ever. Entire academic theses have been written on the magnum opus that is the song \\"Close to the Edge\\". If there's one Yes CD to own, this is it. Simply the best, a complete masterpiece from start to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION OF JAPANESE REPLICAS","review":"YES......

While I have a love for many styles and types of music I find the feelings expressed by Yes in this album are superior to anything else they have written. You can keep your \\"made for the radio\\" songs, getting lost in the long melodies found in this album is like an amazing trip!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock perfection","review":"I discovered this album in the winter of 1982-1983. Though I was mainly a follower of Top 40 music, I also liked classic rock and friends had been telling me I would probably like Yes. Not knowing which album to buy, I closed my eyes and picked \\"Close to the Edge.\\" Although (and perhaps because) I had never heard any of the three (?!) songs on this album before, I was completely blown away. From the exotic and intricate yet aggressive opening strains of \\"Close to the Edge,\\" through the grandiose beauty of \\"And You And I,\\" to the unforgettable hooks that drive \\"Siberian Khatru,\\" I knew I had discovered greatness. The album instantly became my favorite - and has been ever since. Close to the Edge is sonically superior, brilliantly played, and beautifully written. It's a timeless piece of music, and in my opinion, the closest any album of the rock era has come to perfection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't find words","review":"It's as simple as this: No words are able to describe the greatness and wonderfulness of Close To The Edge. It's the first Yes album containing epics only - three of them - and they're all among the best Yes symphonies of all times! In other words, this IS the best Yes album. Ever. That says it, doesn't it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A progressive rock classic!!!","review":"This album is a progressive rock classic!!! Only 3 songs on the original album(CD thses days!!!),but they are all classics!!!And the bonus tracks added to the newly remastered CD sweetens the deal!!! A great package!!! A+!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music.","review":"Every track is excellent.Close to the Edge is great 3 out of it's 4 parts. And You And I is great all around. And Siberian Khatru has a great beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Yes Masterpiece And One Of The Greatest Albums Of Modern History","review":"Nice to see and digest a multitude of five-star ratings from obviously intelligent music fans. I am a Genesis fan first BUT, I will concede that Close to the Edge, along with Foxtrot by my dudes, is the single most relevant album in music history. People, this album is PERFECT. The title suite takes you places unheard of and features unparalled musicianship by Bruford/Howe/Squire/Wakeman; And You And I resonates in it majestic glory, counterbalancing Howe and Wakeman's bombast with Squire and Bruford's dynamic restraint; and Siberian Khatru is Yes getting down and dirty. If you want one of the \\"holy grails\\" of progressive rock, it is indeed Close to the Edge."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Musical Climax of Yes","review":"On Close to the Edge, Yes reached the point of decline. This release stands stronger than Fragile, including the 20 minute title track. And You And I is a great Yes song, which Jon Anderson wrote for his wife, and stands today as a Yes masterpiece. Moreover, Siberian Khatru is one of my favorite tunes, featuring sick guitar and awesome bass. But beware, non-proheads! This album contains :only: three tracks, one 20 minutes, and the others ten minutes each. You would not enjoy this record as a YesFan would.Unfortunately, after this album, YES was never the same. They declined both musically and creatively."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST ALBUM EVER","review":"this is the best album ever. not just the best yes album. it includes the greatest songs ever recorded. You can say that close to the edge is the best song and album ever. And you and I is one of the most inspirational and uplifting songs i have ever heard and Siberian Khatru is a very very cool rock song. BEST ALBUM EVER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inadmisible sound dropouts","review":"YES......THESE REPLICAS ARE ALMOST INCREDIBLE... TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE... THE PACKAGING IS EXCELLENT, BUT.....WELL, MY CLOSE TO THE EDGE COPY HAS A COUPLE OF CHANNEL SOUND DROPOUTsTHIS IS UNADMISSIBLE FOR A YES FAN THAT PAYS 30 DOLLARS FOR A CD!MY GOING FOR THE ONE DOES TOO, SO DOES MY FRAGILE REPLICAS. I HAVE CHEKED OUT AND THIS DROPOUTS ARE on BOTH CLOSE TO THE EDGE AND FRAGILE MINIATURES. THE REST ARE OK.LITTLE DROPOUTS, BUT FOR THIS PRICE, I CANNOT BELIEVE IT ! I PAID A LOT OF MONEY FOR THIS STUFF !"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Best Yes Album I Have!","review":"This is an amazing, extrordinary, powerful, shocking, mind-blowing, (...),fantastic, awesome, snazzy, album. Close to the Edge (the song) just blew me away. It was the longest song I had ever heard, except for some live Grateful Dead song, and you know how long those can go on. People may disagree with me , but I actually thought that The Solid Time of Change was the best part of the song. And You and I was born to be a classic. It's just great. I can't say it any other way. Well I could, but I'm not going to. And I can't really discribe Siberian Khatru. I have no clue what the heck a \\"Khatru\\" is or means or whatever. The song is good, anyway. So all in all... get this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb musical art","review":"Tell you what: I enjoy contemporary rock music for sure. But the fact is that, after some 25 years since I last heard this Yes album, it still shaked me from inside as it did before. To put it short: this album is polyphonic, creative, and...effusive. Try it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"superb","review":"This is the greatest popular music album of the 20th century. Period. Apart from it, only Abbey Road, by The Beatles, shares the top position of creative innovation in the history of contemporary music."},{"rating":"1","title":"FridayMusic 180g LP reissue sounds worse than my copy from the 70's","review":"I just listened to FridayMusic's 180g 2008 LP reissue of Close To The Edge and I'm very disappointed with the quality of the pressing. Before putting the LP on my Pro-Ject RM5 turntable with Shure V15VxMR cartridge, I washed it thoroughly with a Nitty Gritty record cleaner. Unfortunately, I found that there is a lot of unwanted noise on this LP that can only be attributed to the quality of the pressing. I'm sending it back. This is unacceptable for the price. This is my first FridayMusic pressing and I think it will be my last."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't believe it!","review":"Whilst I agree with most of the reviewers here that Close To The Edge is a very fine album indeed, and one which is probably Yes's finest hour and is without doubt a classic of the progressive genre; I am not so sure about the bonus tracks.To me, the editing of Yes track to make a single version destroys the original piece of music. We are not just removing the middle 8 from a standard 4 minute song! Each piece should be heard as a whole, as it was originally intended. Therefore, although it is nice to get bonus tracks, I find that these detract from the quality of the original album. In my opinion, I would have rather had a 40 minute CD of just the original three tracks, than a 65 minute one."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is, but it isn't Grand Deveraux Style.","review":"I can tell this is one of her earlier works, perhaps written before The Enchanted land, but published after it. And finally having gotten hold of a copy, I can see why it was allowed to go out of print.I'm glad to own a copy, and will probably never relinquish it, because I wanted the complete Deveraux collection, and this one marked its completion. However, I have to admit a serious disappointment, especially since I prefer her earlier works to her later ones.To forewarn all the romance fans--this is not a romance. It's a grand story of a woman who grows up and discovers herself, and a fantastic tale of the business she starts, but overall, it's rather drawn-out and the conclusion seems anti-climactic.Anyone who wants the complete collection should buy this, definitely, and even read it through, but I doubt it'll be a favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT LIKE ANY OF HER MORE RECENT BOOKS.","review":"I WAS LUCKY TO FIND THIS BOOK IN MY LOCAL LIBRARY. I HAVE READ ALL OF JUDE DEVERAUX'S BOOKS (22) I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR IT FOREVER. IT IS NOT HER USUAL STYLE, BUT I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH IT. AS A MATTER OF FACT, I HAD TO RATION IT OUT SO THAT I WOULD NOT RUSH THROUGH IT AND MISS SOMETHING. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Practice Makes Perfect","review":"Jude Deveraux's first book, to me, left a lot to be desired. As usual the description is wonderful, but the story was a bit lacking. The ending left me wnating more and trying to figure it out. Other of her novels, especially the historical ones seem to be the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disappointing for a Jude Deveraux","review":"Too many characters are described, the title of the novel suits well.The one night weakness of the heroine is not something common we can find on other novels from Jude Deveraux."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very confusing, disappointing","review":"I've always used Princton Review for my test prep, but this was all they had at the bookstore, so it's what I purchased.Besides being extremely confusingmethods and formulas that they tell you to use on one page, if you try to apply them to a problem on the next page it won't work.And though I'm only on page 60 of it so far, I've already found four mistakes in the answers for it's section reviews.I would never ever suggest this review guide to anyone, and am very sorry I deviated from my usual brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Comprehensive Review","review":"I've been trusting Barron's prep books since I started studying for the SAT, so I bought this book in Taiwan despite its previous editions did not receive many comforting remarks. While reading it, I find it comprehensive enough for even a freshmen like me to understand every little detail in math problem solving. Therefore, I do not regret buying this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Portable phone I have used","review":"This is a great phone system. The features are designed for easy use without haveing to read the manual. The speaker phone works great when you need hans free operation or get put on hold. Battery life is very good. I had considered cheaper, but very glad I got this one, the best I have ever used."},{"rating":"2","title":"This product works!! I was amazed","review":"I have tried tons of products to cover my old acne scars and they always wear off quickly or it looks like I have caked on makeup.I use only 2 products from Laura Mercier and I look like I have flawless skin all day. I first use the camouflage for the dark spots or blemishes ( just on the spots) and then lightly bush the powder over my entire face and I honestly look like I have flawless skin. I have also noticed that my skin is looking healthier.I never write reviews but I really wanted to share with other women who suffer with these issues and have tried every kind of makeup there is out there to cover up there blemishes. This product really works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moderate coverage.","review":"I used real sand color (I'm Nude in LM tinted moisturizer) and wanted to love it. The quality is great, very fine powder, but it gives sheer to moderate coverage which wasn't enough for me-I had to layer too way much product to have similar effect like with other mineral make up (BE, jane Iredale, Lancome etc).I also like dispenser, spill free, great for travel.I also think that LM use too much package for the product, make it smaller (container is the biggest I saw in mineral foundations), without the box, and lower the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Natural","review":"I love the mineral powder. It feels so natural not like the other mineral powder that I used."},{"rating":"1","title":"product was not received","review":"i didn't receive the product from the seller however i bought it from the store and it was great, it looks like a second skin. very natural looking.the coverage is medium but its build-able."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob the Bouncy Kitten","review":"If you have a pet lover in your household and a child making that transition from picture books to chapter books, then check out Bob the Bouncy Kitten. Bob will make your young reader laugh and giggle.The story is told through the eyes of Bob, so you get a kitten's view of the world; this alone is worth the read. In addition, if your child is still looking for pictures there are enough sprinkled throughout to keep a child going.And if your child like Bob, there are other books in this pet series featuring puppies and other kittens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Have Been OK","review":"The boots were delivered within reasonable time. The boots fit well and are comfortable to wear. Leather quality is OK though I have seen better quality leather for the same price. There is however a defect I noted on the second day. There are small cracks, about 12, 1/4\\" long each at the back of the right shoe. Photo sent. Manufacturer responded to my query and offered replacement or refund. Unfortunately, I am based outside of US and cannot ship back using prepaid UPS provided. Could have been nice shoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Acoustic Gold","review":"This is a haunting and hypnotic collection of acoustic lovesongs, with melodies which creep under your skin, and well-crafted, enigmatic lyrics. The album is stripped down, avoiding excess instrumentation or production (similar to their original version of 'Sailing' on their eponymous follow-up album). Oustanding tracks for me are the bittersweet lovesong, 'The Pie', the atmospheric, doomed 'Midnight Avenue', and the enigmatic lonely heart of 'Medium Wave',all with exquisite, magical lyrics, but this is a strong album throughout. Given the price it's selling at, I assume the album must be deleted, but that's okay, as you can sample, then download your favourite mp3 tracks. Nevertheless, why is it that an album this good isn't available? Any answers out there?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"Thought I was going to get the indicator shown in the picture along with the mag pot. Why would the indicator be shown in the picture if it is not included, very deceiving. Description of item at the bottom of page, says system of measurement, inch.. Thought this was referring to the indicator."},{"rating":"2","title":"the beginning of Ponty's mature '70s style","review":"This album to me represents the beginning of Ponty's run of raw, energy-infused jazz-rock fusion albums of the mid to late '70s, notably his first heavy use of pentatonic scales, distortion, and rock rhythms. Granted, most of the tunes here don't contain the mind-boggling virtuosity which he displays in later releases, (with one notable exception - 'Fight for Life', the second half of which contains a great early example of Ponty's potential to let loose.) Also, this album contains what I think is one of his most beautiful slow songs, 'Now I Know'. The musical inflection he imparts to this remarkably simple melody in B minor is truly something. 'Polyfolk Dance' is the third gem on this album, with some fantastic solo moments by Ponty. Finally, 'Question with no Answer' is a blast to play along with, if you play the violin."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Surfed Out Wild Swans","review":"Like The Wild Swans, this band is outright awesome and do not get the recognition they deserved. This cd is so hard to find and it's kind of weird because it was released in 2001. I'm glad I have it as it's one of my prized treasures. The best song on this cd is \\"If Only Words\\" but I also like \\"Halcyon Days\\" and \\"A Place To Surf\\". New Wavers from the 80's, search high and low for this one, it's worth your time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sock Aid","review":"I really like the sock aid. It has made my life so much easier. Although I could put a sock on, because of a hip replacement, it was time consuming and frustrating. Now, I get the sock aid and within moments my sock is on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total piece of trash!","review":"This is with out a doubt the worst item I have ever purchased!! Cheaply made and designed. Once it's folded and the sock is placed over it. It's just about impossible to get your toe's/foot into the opening to pull the thing over your foot! I tried to do it a few time. I'm going in for hip replacement surgery and could not imagine using this piece of garbag after surgery when I can't use it now. What a waste of time. So mad, I just tossed it in the trash!! Looks like I will be going sockless until I can find an assit device that works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done","review":"This is a really great flick. Fun, funny, definitely worth the watch! Writing is solid, directing and acting sells the concept."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their First And Best Album","review":"Just another album I'd bought over 20 years ago on vinyl,cassette and now on cd. Every track here is terrific,and my favorite is the old Isley Bros. tune \\"Work To Do\\", it never sounded better! This is jazzy rock at it's best. Highly recommended for anyone who loves good music and this is great for long drives in the car too."},{"rating":"2","title":"People...THIS is the real R&B, Funk....","review":"OK people - if you want real R&B; - if you want real FUNK - this is it. Oh-Hell-To-The-NO!, you say....But their White! But their actually playing music - WITH instruments - of music that THEY actually composed! Their WHAT??? Their Scottish??? How can I put this......THEY HAVE NOTHING NOW THAT EVEN COMPARES TO THIS LEVEL OF R&B;, ABSOLUTELY - NOTHING. Jamiroquai reminds me of them. They are different but it's the closet comparison I could think of. Jamiroquai uses a little more Electronic sound but Average White Band is where they started."},{"rating":"2","title":"BONUS TRACK CUT SHORT BY 14 MINUTES","review":"Nothing more needs to be said about this great album. It is indeed a classic. The idea of adding the live track of Pick Up The Pieces from the Montreux Jazz Festival was a great one that made me purchase the CD - only to find out that the original 22 minute jam session had been cut to 7 or so minutes. WHY? The disk has over 20 minutes of blank space, so it wasn't because there was no room.It could have fit with room to spare. The full version is one of the greatest jam sessions you'll never hear unless you have the original 2 lp set from that time. It is not available on CD. The fact that some genius made this decision is mind boggling. Because of this I can only give it 4 stars. With the full version it would go beyond the 5 stars allowed to a 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work To Do","review":"The reason \\"Work to do\\" is under a different license and not credited to AWB is that the song was originally written and performed by the Isley Brothers. AWB's version is quite good however, as is the entire album."},{"rating":"2","title":"These things are getting hard to find","review":"Been looking for these, Amazon had them. I want a tape that stays out until I want it to retract, this is it. I use a tape every day on the job, all the others are too fat and bulky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use, durable mini camera case","review":"I like this case very much, and think the inside web pocket for an extra battery and memory card, is very good. Price was fair, but it is too bad that shipping charges (ground UPS) were 60% of the cost of the case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little case","review":"It is small and it doesn't make taking your camera out a nightmare.

You have to have it fully extended full blast or nothing. If you want to just turn the water on lightly, no luck with this faucet - the faucet handle will just slowly descend from it's own weight until your water shuts off. From a review I read elsewhere, apparently Price Pfister knows about this problem but is still selling this borderline useless product. Amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Duped by Home Depot","review":"Unfortunatley I did not thoroughly research this product before purchasing it and I am having the same problem where the weight of the faucet handle turns the water off. I purchased this faucet at Home Depot and am extremely disappointed that they would offer such a dismal product. Point forward I will be shopping online and scouring the customer reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Water everywhere!","review":"Same problem here. Handle's too heavy. Now husband wants to throttle me. Hey, I installed it! What's he crying about? Just because you have to have the water fully ON or the handle drops and shuts everything off... Jeez.

PPf should recall this product or provide a free fix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two problems with this faucet","review":"While I don't have this exact model kitchen faucet, I've been trying to work with it for over two years and am ready to scream. We did a kitchen rehab and I picked my Price Pfister because it looked so nice...and a week after it was installed, I had to order a part due to the diverter not working. Hardly any water would come out of the faucet. The side spray worked fine, but not the faucet. The next problem --and current one--is that the handle drops unless the water is on full force. According to the Price Pfister site, I need to replace the retainer nut. I say \\"nuts\\" to all this and will never purchase this brand again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed and then some","review":"Agree with all of the other reviews about the design flaws - and then, the hose, unbeknownst to me, began springing small leaks under the sink. Finally, one sprung at the neck and I called a plumber - too late. I had inches of standing water under my sink, sprung a leak in the basement ceiling, and grew mold. Stay away from this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this faucet!","review":"This faucet always drips after it is turned off. We have replaced cartridges and even replaced the entire unit! Pfister sent us a brand new one after I complained many times, and hoping the original was bad my husband suffered through another install. In addition to the dripping, it shuts off if the water pressure is too low. Sometimes it will drip randomly, even when it hasn't been used for a bit. I would not buy this product, it is poorly made and wastes water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfactory replacement part","review":"I bought this faucet as a replacement for the same model faucet. I had received good service from the original for about 6 or 7 years. The replacement soap dispenser was cheaply made and didn't work at all. The faucet was brushed chrome instead of the polished chrome I expected (the information on the faucet did not disclose that). And while the faucet works ok it tends to drip more than it should when turned off. I get the sense that it won't last long."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good","review":"We installed one of these in May of 2005, and in less than three years of service three different problems have arisen:1. The rubber gizmo on the tip of the soap dispenser fell off and was lost.2. The spray switch on the faucet head won't go from spray to stream by itself. You have to pry off the rubber cover and lift it up with your fingernail.3. The handle won't stay up. In fact, the handle won't even stay on the faucet. (At least now the water stays on, which it wouldn't with the handle on.)All in all, a poorly-designed, cheaply-made & flimsy product. Stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Price Pfister Single Handle Kitchen Faucet TOO HEAVY????","review":"I almost laughed at my plumber when he told me the reason my water shuts off on its own was because the handle was TOO HEAVY! Apparently, he wasn't lying to me. Many other Price Pfister owners have the same problem!Is it true? Is the reason my water turns off on me because the handle is too heavy? Wow, and does Price Pfister know this and still sell the item? More time and money spent on a faulty product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very poor design","review":"I would give this less than one star if I could. The water has to be on full blast in order to keep the faucet from turning off due to it's weight.

I am very displeased with this product and will not be tempted to purchase another Price Pfister faucet."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointed","review":"I was so excited when I remodeled my kithen and I found what I thought was the perfect faucet. It was the Price Pfister pull brushed stainless. Looked great. But pressure through this faucet sucks. I even exchanged the pull out thinking there was something wrong with it. I have cleaned the screens, nothing works....now I have to buy a new one to get enough pressure to wash down the sink. Pressure is so low the sprayer doesn't do anything but dribble."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a total piece of garbage","review":"Bought this from Lowes. I didn't install it for a few months or it would have gone back to the store. I can't find a receipt, so it will just get thrown away. I could have saved a trip to the store and just thrown the money in the trash. And of course, it wasn't inexpensive, so you'd think it would be worth something. The hot water cuts out and unless the thing is turned up full blast, it turns itself off. I'm one of those quiet customers that will never buy another Price Pfister product again, and will tell everyone I know what crap this is..so congrats to this company..ya saved a few cents and lost another customer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty handle and dispenser","review":"Not counting for the current issue of having sprung a leak in the pull out faucet, we have had 2 major issues:1. The handle dropping down to the off position.2. The soap dispenser spitting out the rubber tip.For each of these issues, when we called Price Pfister, they sent replacement parts at no cost. The handle repair appears to have fixed the problem. The soap dispenser still spat out the rubber tip along with the soap when we dispensed soap, so we do not use the soap dispenser.I do feel the fact that they send the replacement parts under lifetime warranty is a boost in the positive direction. I'm not going to hold my breath on the most recent issue, but, if I get that part replaced at no cost, I will report back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pfister offers free repair parts, but no recall of the product.","review":"I've got the same floppy handle problem as many other posters. I've contacted Pfister and they just sent three new parts under warranty (a new ring, cartridge and handle). Faucets purchased after 1 January 1997 are covered by a lifetime warranty. The parts were easy to install.This is all thanks to the brick & mortar plumbing supply house I first called: they said \\"we don't stock repair parts, but you can get them free from Pfister\\".The faucet is still make for looks not function.

While the synopsis isn't going to set the world on fire - Birding? - this bizarre yet mundane subject turns out to be the perfect subject for a comedy. The Big Year probably isn't going to win any awards or make millions at the box office (note: it didn't), but it's the kind of well crafted and scripted filmmaking we used to enjoy back in the 1960s or 70s before things got complicated with lame gags and explosions. The cast is in great form. If anyone could make an entertaining film about birding, it would be director David Frankel - and he succeeds.

My family is full of birders, and I never really quite understood the \\"madness\\" that consumes them, but now I \\"get it.\\" This movie is wonderful for the birder AND the non-birder, and it will lift your spirits. I recommend that you not only buy it, but buy a few copies for friends. I would love to see more good movies like this one succeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I ranked this movie with the worst movies ever made, but what can you expect when Owen Wilson is part of the cast, I don't know how he ever got hired as an actor. The plot behind this movie is among the stupidist I have ever seen and shows just how desperate hollywood is for something to dump on the public. Jack Black and Steve Martin must be getting really desperate for work to be a part of this waste of film. The writers, director and producer should all be banned from film making for life so we don't end up wasting our time watching any more of their crap! I just wish Amazon would allow a zero star rating which would be more appropriate for this thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"great cast. horrible movie","review":"Forget bird watching, suicide watch is more like it. Totally awful.

Save your 3.99."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delusional portrayal of \\"Real\\" Americans.","review":"Not only was this bad it was really bad. Poor acting, poor story and too long.What I find entertaining about this little gem of a movie is that every last problem the characters have, can be solved with copious amounts of money, and driving.Rubbish like this portrays a way of life that does not really exist, thankfully the characters in this movie were either wealthy New York ad executives, or had their Daddy cover the costs of their fun when they are 36 years old. I marvel at the level of delusion in this film. Since I am not a wealthy executive I am now out of $3.99, money that would have been better used if thrown in the street."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extended, but not necessarily better","review":"I purchased the extended edition after watching the original release. Both versions are fun films that explore relationships among people through the vehicle of birding. Two key differences: 1) The extended version looks at the competitive efforts among the three birders more objectively than the original release, and 2) the extended version offers a little more information about the ecology of Neotropical migratory birds and the perils of migration than the original release. If you are already familiar with birding and North American migrating birds, then the extra information is just that: extra, not significantly added to the story. If you are not familiar with birds or avian migration and want to enjoy a story along with some biology, the extended version is for you. If you are not familiar with birds and want a more singular human-centered storyline rather than a semi-complete parallel avian plot, stick with the original release."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first time I ordered.....","review":"the DVD did not work. A little frustrating since it was a Christmas gift for my husband who is a bird lover. But, once we exchanged it with ease he watched it and really liked it. He had not heard of \\"The Big Year\\" as related to birding and how serious people take it, so it was an eye opener for him. It is comedy yet serious at points.

There is no plot other than who gets to see the most birds. Since it has good actors, it was enough to keep me somewhat interested in watching it. But, overall, it was pretty boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Big Year","review":"You'd think a comedy starring Steve Martin, Owen Wilson, and Jack Black would be pretty funny, if not uproariously hilarious, especially when the film is centered around competitive bird watching. Based on the book by Mark Obmascik, The Big Year actually hopes to accomplish a bit more depth, but it largely falls flat. At various crossroads in their lives, Stu, Brad, and Kenny embark on a cross-country trip in hopes of spotting the most bird species in North America; along the way, they each discover enough about themselves to move on. Directed by David Frankel, The Big Year certainly cares about its characters, but I felt the film had little forward motion, and its surprising lack of humor made it feel all the more stagnant. If you're into self discovery movies, you might enjoy this; just don't expect to laugh much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful.","review":"I don't know what the previous reviewers were smoking.

It is a wonderful movie about birding and birder competition and relationships. As a birder, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and the movie is pretty faithful to the jist of the book.

The competition is called The Big Year. Finding over 700 species takes them across the country and into various environments to which they flock with the enthusiasm of a hawk on a mouse. Owen Wilson's character, Bostick, is the previous year's winner and he wants to defend his record while the others are out to overtake his birding prowess. Extensive time away from home and family takes a toll on the birders and has Bostick's wife crying fowl. Nothing over the top happens in this film, just birders on a mission, yet, The Big Year strikes me as an undeclared salute to Audubon and I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's not to love?","review":"Jack Black, Own Wilson, Steve Martin and the hunt to spot the most birds!

My wife is a birder, currently working on a backyard Big Year, and so was eager to see it. I can't tell a Pacific from a Winter Wren and have never been a particular fan of Steve Martin's \\"wild and crazy guy\\" shtick, so I fully expected to dislike it. I was wrong. This is a very nicely done film about family, friends and priorities. That could be boring, but not here. It doesn't hurt that it was filmed in some stunning locations. A few of the bird models were a bit unbelievable, but the rest of the cast was very convincing. This movie deserved a much better box office reception than it received."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Big Year","review":"An excellent movieThe Big Year, good moral and fun to watch.I enjoyed seeing the many birds and their efforts to see them.

I was ecstatic when this split came out. Leatherface's music is all its own, with some fairly intricate guitar work for a \\"punk\\" band. Frankie Stubbs sings with heart, and his gruff pipes (you'll get used to them) are the perfect instrument with which to portray all of the emotion. The second half of this CD, by Hot Water Music, is okay.

I keep expecting something that just isn't there.It seems that it takes too long for a plot to unravel in this series. Then the ending happens so quickly that the reader is left pulling all the loose ends together in a page or two.Faith is not a very active sleuth either. She's kind of dry and often just happens to be there. Nancy Drew is much more of a determined crime solver than Faith.I wouldn't recommend this series to anyone. I find it disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much Gulf War Illnesses, not enough military history","review":"I'm sorry to say, but this CD-ROM is simply disappointing from a military-historian point of view. 545 MBytes of the 576 MBytes of data is an off-line version of the GulfLINK web page, which is focused on the Gulf War Illnesses. The remaining data are some interviews, some maps, some photos/artwork and the electronic version of \\"The Whirlwind War\\". For a CD-ROM that is centred on the history of the Gulf War this is simply not enough. There is another edition from the same publisher centred only around the Gulf War Illnesses for those who seek such information, so there was no need to recycle this data here on this CD-ROM and leave out all those other official important documents about the history of the Gulf War."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like the girl","review":"I don't think this book is nearly as strong as Ebershoff's The Danish Girl.

The characters are nowhere near being developed. Unless judging people by the size of their bank account or their bodily parts is considered character development. I can barely believe that saying an off hand prayer or biblical reference makes this a Christian book as another reviewer J. McLellan said it was categorized as. It's crude, full of cheap shots and cliches.It's so full of vulgar sexual innuendos and just so much trashy talk and so little story or character development.

The author obviously doesn't know anything about being a flight attendant. The main character hooks up with a guy by closing his arm in the door of an aircraft, and she isn't aware of it until he tells her! If this were ever to happen it would gross negligence on the part of the flight attendant. The captain makes an anouncement in flight for the flight attendants to prepare doors for landing, which is ridiculous, doors are armed and disarmed on the ground. There are so many mistakes like this that it distracted me from the story. This book is so full of cliches it's maddening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed over the friendly skies","review":"Believe it or not, this book was listed as a Christian Romance!

The hour-by-hour meticulous planning that is required in the hidden world of the assassin is uniquely portrayed, saturated as we are by big Hollywood versions of hit men and snipers. What is far more plausible about \\"Vengeance\\" is its humanity, the basic small details of a team working closely to kill others, their conscience, disgust, and the overall context of being used by the Israeli system. There are many who believe in the book, and many who say it is fiction, but it is up to the reader to judge. Ultimately it comes down to the final quote from the author himself; \\"I was intrigued by the character Avner appeared to be. I did become preoccupied by his story. But in the end I do not think this is why I believed him. I believed him because he knew how the light switch worked in an obscure apartment building in Rome.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"I have studied the history behind the PLO and the terrorist organizations that evolved during this time. A lot of the children in our time that lived through 9/11, feel that terrorism is relatively new. When you read this book, and other information regarding middle east turmoil, you will understand that terrorism has been developing for years.This book is truly fascinating when you think of these young Israeli agents that basically disappeared for years from their families to seek revenge for the deaths of their countrymen.The age of terrorism is here, and it is certainly not anything new. It is only evolving. I highly recommend this book, simply because of the understanding that it provides to the reader, in regards to the emotions that governments have in the protection for their country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - this book is a hoax by a known fabricator!","review":"This book has repeatedly been determined to be a hoax by a known, prolific fabricator named Yuval (or Juval) Aviv.

The book provides an abundance of information regarding the political origins of this revenge killing, the toll it took on the members of the team, the role of the U.S.S.R. in supporting the Palestian cause, and the group in-fighting within the Palestinian movement. The author's thoroughness leads to some redundacy which causes a degee of tedium in reading. The reader, however, is rewarded by reading through these few sections by experiencing the intensity of the reaction by the group's leader as he has to deal internally with the reality of his and their task.

My only regret is I didn't buy more than one. I had gotten it for my entry way table but that didn't work out as this lamp is very tall and the shade was too big for my space. It is quite sturdy and very unique. The shade seems very durable as I had it in my kitchen for a little while and it got something splashed on it.

Few records have defined a decade, or a generation, as this one has. Classics such as \\"Carry On\\", \\"Teach Your Children\\", \\"Helpless\\" and \\"Woodstock\\" (to name but a few) helped influence and inspire a number of bands that came after (most notably the Eagles) and still sound just as fresh and compelling as they did when they first appeared on the radio. Crosby, Stills and Nash had already had one hit album, but the addition of Neil Young to this recording gave the group a little added punch. Whether it was gentle, soulful ballads, infectious pop standards, or four guitar rock workouts, CSN&Y proved that they could, and did, it all with equal ease. A must-have for any collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"It seems like I have reviewed this before . . .","review":"I downloaded this album because it was one of my favorites 40 years ago.

Julian Sands is in some of the best paranormal movies in my opinion.

Scrolling through songs to find your old place is not fast or convenient on the radio, and thus you are pretty much left with suffle play only. Another more minor bug is that when returning from an adjustment mode, the display does not return to it's full setting until something like the display button is pressed. This kind of sloppiness is not typical of Sony when dealing with Sony products, but is Sony's typical NIH (not invented here) attitude when dealing with a rival's product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply horrible","review":"This is probably the worst piece of Sony equipment I have ever purchased.

It's true that \\"I've Seen All Good People\\" hasn't aged particularly well, but \\"Starship Trooper\\" expresses the opinion that isolationism leads to such behaviors as intolerance for regionalistic speech, and the songs \\"Perpetual Change\\" and \\"A Vision\\" contain cautionary lyrics that inspire me to look at pictures of pretty actresses as a deterrent to self-indulgence and/or complacency. The band members' belief that the young Australian tourist jailed in Indonesia on drug-smuggling charges was unjustly convicted makes this CD an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Transferred to CD","review":"This is almost completely unlistenable because the quality of the CD is so poor. This is true of all the YES records. They weren't transfered to CD very well. Re-mastered versions have more recently come out.

But by the time they did The Yes Album they were relatively unknown -and that is what saves the thing to a certain point."},{"rating":"2","title":"A progressive classic - you may want to spring for the CD","review":"If you don't like progressive rock, stay away from this. The lyrics are kind of hippy-trippy. The musicianship is superb. I was blown away by the clarity of the Rhino-remastered CD. If you have the gear to appreciate it, I'd recommend the CD rather than the download. Frankly, some modern recordings are so poorly recorded and mixed that I don't sense much difference between the CD and a compressed MP3 file. (U2's All That You Can't Leave Behind being a case in point, but it is typical of many hit albums nowadays.) The Yes Album is nearly 40 years old, but the sound has a richness, detail, and sparkle to it that is remarkable. It's a great album either way, but if you get the MP3 you may not know what you're missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quintessential Yes","review":"_The Yes Album_ is a great place to start if you're new to Yes - not as \\"out there\\" as _Close to the Edge_, _Tales from Topographic Oceans_, or _Relayer_, but definitely more adventurous than their more stripped down 80's and 90's approach. It contains some of their most played radio \\"hits\\" (\\"I've Seen All Good People\\", \\"Yours is no Disgrace\\", \\"Starship Trooper\\"), and it contains a nice balance between the different genres that Yes have always experimented with. It's one of those albums that once you get into, you'll play it over and over again. It especially highlights Steve Howe, Bill Bruford, and Chris Squire at their creative peaks - the early 70s. Even people who normally *hate* a lot of Yes music, usually note that this as an excellent album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes to the Yes Album","review":"\\"The Yes Album\\" marked the pinnacle of Yes' career. While follow-up releases were often self-indulgent or boring, \\"The Yes Album\\" contained a number of great songs that showcase the superb musicianship of the band.To classify it as \\"progressive rock\\" is a mistake. \\"The Yes Album\\" explored a number of different musical genres -- from jazz to country -- that the band would never again, unfortunately, particularly with the subsequent arrival of Rick Wakeman, Alan White, Trevor Rabin et al.Throughout \\"The Yes Album,\\" Steve Howe's guitarplaying was melodic and diverse. Bill Bruford's drumplaying was outstanding. Chris Squire's bassplaying was thunderous.

Fade-out guitar solo on Starship Trooper is infectious. Yours is no Disgrace has some great sterophonic effects, sounds great with head phones. After a few listenings, you'll find yourself chanting \\"I've seen all good people turn their heads each day so satistfied I'm on my way.\\" A tight, clean album with memorable themes and melodies. Great craftmanship and musicianship without the self-indulgence of some later albums, i.e. Topographic Oceans. Every musical bar of this album is forever etched on the hard drive of my brain. This is certainly a very significant and classic album in the evolution of progressive rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please more about the bonus tracks","review":"I appreciate the background information and statements of adoration about this early album by Yes.

Casual fans might feel like they have heard Yours is No Disgrace or All Good People or Starship Trooper enough for one lifetime. Anyone who bought a greatest hits package at any point probably has at least half of the album already, so why bother buying it again for just a few extra songs? Plenty of albums, from Pink Floyd's The Wall to Billy Joel's The Stranger to damn near any Beatles' album, suffers from classicrockitis.And that's a shame, because much like those albums, The Yes Album is a joyous thing to listen to in its entirety (OK, the Wall might not be joyous, per se, leave me alone).

But added surprise of how Dungeons & Dragon got started in the first chapter really pulled this book together for me as an indie game developer. Hoping to walk in the very foot steps of those mentioned in this book, I found it more as a roadmap of how to plan ahead for my own future gaming company and things I should consider. Without trying to, this book represents the D&D-SCA-Gamer type of person, who wishes to escape the mundane world around us. To live and breathe in a Fantasy world where the possibilities are only limited by the imagination.

Forget this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kiosk Rating <1","review":"Doesn't even deserve the honor of being called a parody. An obvious Bond 007 takeoff that was just dumb, not funny. Had that silent movies slapstick feel in which the viewer's time is better spent in watching the originals. Slapstick was funny the first time through especially since movies were still a novelty and anything that appeared on the screen was capturing, but reruns just get old. Basically the plot is of an MI7 agent who continuously makes stupid mistakes that help the bad guys more so than if he did nothing at all. Not to be confused with, or even in the same conversation with, the Peter Sellers' Panther movies although there seems to be, politely stated, a lot of borrowing from his movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Johnny English Reborn","review":"Because the world was simply chomping at the bit to get more of bumbling secret agent Johnny English back in 2003, he made a return to the big screen eight years later and Johnny English Reborn was... born. I, however, found the sequel only slightly more bearable than the first film and another unfortunate waste of Atkinson's comedic talents. Reborn finds our wacky hero off the grid and training deep in Asia when he is called upon once again by MI7, this time to help thwart an assassination attempt on the Chinese premier; double crosses and pratfalls ensue. If you're familiar with Rowan Atkinson's previous work, then you know what you're getting here. Expect a lot of broad, slapsticky humor in service of well-worn spy spoof clichés, and if that's your thing, then have at it. But, there's no guarantee this will appeal to anyone outside of its target PG demographic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silly yes but a lot of fun","review":"Rowan Atkinson shows once again why he is widely considered to be one of the top living comics. In lesser hands this film would not have been worth the price of admission. It took me back to the glory days of Peter Sellers and the inimitable Inspector Clouseau. Atkinson is also supported by a strong supporting cast including Gillian Anderson and the very lovely Rosamund Pike (Die Another Day). I can actually remember some James Bond films that I didn't find as entertaining as this movie is. I don't know why it took eight years to get this sequel. I would not mind another outing for Johnny English if it is as much fun as this one. Be sure to watch the end credits for one last scene!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Humorous, with the classic \\"Johnny English\\" genius","review":"This movie is a well written, action packed, dimwitted flick with the characteristic Johnny English intelligence (literally.)

The resurrection of Johnny English is likewise inevitable. And while not totally successful, this movie made me laugh a lot and is ultimately quite entertaining.Rowan Atkinson is perfect as the deadpan agent who invites disaster and mayhem. He ranks right up there with Inspector Clouseau in comic ineptitude. Gillian Anderson brings an icy persona as English's no nonsense boss; Dominic West is good as arrogant agent Simon Ambrose; and Rosamund Pike, a former Bond girl, is the sexy psychologist.There are plenty of hilarious sight gags and many action scenes parallel some of the 007 films.

They also try to get inside Boles' head in an effort to explain this obviously intelligent and courageous, but morally flawed, man. However, there are some obvious errors, most notable to me -- geography of Calaveras County, of which I am a resident.

All the previously unreleased charts but Sahib Shihab's 'Peter's Waltz' are Boland originals.

It's a great, great album if you like folk/indie-pop with smart lyrics that actually mean something.This is Josh Joplin's first (and probably last) album without the Group and while it is a little more folky in the sound, especially than \\"The Future That Was\\" by JJG, it's just as good as \\"Useful Music.\\" The album starts off with the catchy \\"Mr. New Year's Day\\" and goes on from there with songs about love, loss, living in New York City, and of course the son of the dry cleaning king of Baltimore.As mentioned before this has more of a folky sound but it's not just Mr. Joplin strumming an acoustic guitar.

A short sequence is missing from the episode Birthin', probably due to BBC not wanting to spend the money on the copyright fees, but apart from this, everything is on the DVD. Also, this series has 8 episodes instead of the usual 6, so despite the considerable lack of extras, there is still a bit more to see than on the average AbFab DVD.Remarkably, even though this probably is my least favourite AbFab series (yes, I'm one of those who actually loved series 4!), I still think this is a fabulous season and well worthy of praise.

It is not very noticeable in a light open area but when you are in a relatively dark room the blur is very noticeable. My solution was to get a pen and round it out. The blur becomes less noticeable but it is still there. Another problem is that the speakers are completely covered at the bottom.

The basket is slanted and open, so you can rinse it out faster than the older juicer style with a \\"basket\\" that's harder to reach in and place a filter or dig out the fiber. This one throws the fiber out the back into a container that comes with it, juices really well, is compact in a small kitchen, and cleans up so much more easily than my older Omega juicer. It's wonderful, especially for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Juicer!!!","review":"Bought the O2 directly from Omega -- that was the first mistake. Almost 3 weeks later the O2 arrived after virtually harassing them into shipping it. First time to use the juicer: apple, carrot, ginger juice, nothing robust. The O2 kept shutting off. Some kind of internal breaker was tripping. Second time juicing, same thing. Can't seem to make more than half a glass of juice at a time before the thing shuts off. Great juice...if you can get it.I've had another Omega juicer which was a work horse. VERY, VERY disappointed with the O2 and Omega's service. Now I am absolutely dreading going through the return process with Omega. If you're buying Omega, I definitely encourage you to spend the extra money. The O2 is not where it's at."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive guide to Sensitive Subject","review":"I applaud the work that went into this book from the standpoint of how widespread the author's subject matter stretched. From a chaplain's perspective who has worked in an ER for several years, I found its content refreshing, especially coming from an physician. It is my experience that many doctors have trouble in breaking bad news. Grave Words gives many good ideas for different kinds of situations and specific pathways that one could integrate into their setting. I have given copies to my ER head nurse, the Trauma Specialist and to the Trauma Surgeons in my center. It had served to bridge our discussions around family care.

The backlight is great.

I took it to have a new battery installed and to my surprise I was informed that the battery was working just fine. Something else had failed. To find out, the watch would have to be sent in for diagnosis and the cost is unknown in advance. So I decided not to have it repaired and look for a new watch. Too bad, I really liked that watch.

The principle reason is that they are mechanically substandard. The focus wheel, which is quite stiff anyway, has several mm's of free play before engaging to begin changing focus. In addition, it was not clear that the diopter functioned properly to alter the focus in the applicable barrel. Because of these problems, I did not use the binoculars in the field, or, indeed, for more than a few minutes testing. However, my impression was that the barrels were not perfectly aligned, a fault that would lead to eyestrain with extended use. Bushnell knows how to make good binoculars.

It doesn't come with any paper at all, or at least it didn't arrive with any this time and that was another person's complaint as well. However, past that, the book is good. I liked the way it first goes through teaching the different folds before getting into the actual figures. I also liked how it again shows how to do the basic fold for a particular figure at the bottom of the pages of the figures, and how it has easier figures first, progressing to harder ones toward the end of the book.

This book tends to give more focus to the Republican's policies, but it also discusses the Democrat's mischievous ways.All in all, after reading this book I understand better why I don't support the dual party system that we have in the US (both parties are sell-outs to big money corporations and special interest lobbyists) and why I support third & fourth party independent candidates."},{"rating":"2","title":"The truth is there for all to see","review":"Greg Palast uncovers the truth and exposes it without siding or leaning with any political party. This is what true journalism is, we have too many \\"news programs\\" digesting the news for us and showing us their interpretations about what really matters. Most journalists nowadays are afraid to expose blatant injustices perpetrated by our government because those news are not what sales to the lethargic majority.

Once you read how the vicious removal of voters was practised in Florida in 2000, (and presumably before) it is more obvious how access to voting booths and even onto voting rolls is still currently hindered and controlled.This is a good start to Greg Palast's writings, as in some later books he brushes over these stories on the assumption you would have met them before to the slight detriment of those other books' narrative flow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Connecting the Dots","review":"I read this book in record time. Greg Palast took all the pieces of the jigsaw over the last few decades and put them together in a succinctly written way to make me see in a new light this 'government'.

From Iran to Iran Contra to Iraq and the Oil fields, from the Halliburtons and all the cronys names who have been hiding for so many years doing so much harm.

I began by actually taking his work at face value, and eventually got tired of writing frustrated notes in the margins, counting the logical fallacies on which Palast relies to make his very flimsy arguments. You'd have to be pretty gullible to believe that Palast PROVES anything at all in this book. What he does is draw very sketchy inferences, coupled with aggressive, manipulative language.

Neither side has clean hands here folks. Many illegals voted in Florida, military ballots were excluded and an early call sent panhandle conservatives home. That Palast ignores all of these facts reveals him as a partisan.

So, although I agree with most of the points exposed in the book (that are very well researched), my two stars rating is not about the text, but it is due to bad writing style.The book lacks cohesion and a smooth flowing of ideas.

This book has snapped me out of that dangerous mindset.

However, as a practitioner of rigorous, tireless research into the subject of Bush and his dubious administration, Greg Palast is miles ahead of Mr. Moore. Palast has cultivated numerous insiders in Washington and in corporate offices, who are only too willing to pass on incriminating information about wrongdoing by senior people in government and business. Palast is as much a detective as a journalist. If Moore uses a shovel to dig into his stories, Palast uses an excavator. I admire Palast for his energy level, cleverness and tenacity. My jaw dropped many times as I read his book, finding it hard to believe that people in positions of authority could be so greedy, crooked and nasty. Thank goodness we have people like Greg Palast to offer sound alternatives to the pap we get from the complicit \\"media giants\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bold and Persistent Journalism","review":"The claims made by Greg Palast in this controversial book appear at first to be so over the top that no one could believe them. Then, as time and investigations continued, much of his early reporting about the Florida election fraud turned out to be right on the money. The result was another black eye for the mainstream media who was so afraid of being wrong that they said nothing at all. Greg's notes were so revealing that I took them to heart when writing my own novel about the six year long Florida election scandal. After a year of study I was unable to disprove a single thing he wrote.

Make sure you read the post when ordering from this seller and might want to ask for more clarification on the item before buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seventh heaven for RAYMOND fans......","review":"The seventh season was a time of transition for the Barones (Ray Romano, Patricia Heaton, Brad Garrett, Doris Roberts, Peter Boyle, and Sweetin children). Some ups and some downs. Yet, they made it all look easy and very amusing. I don't want to ruin the plots or episodes for you. I will say this, Robert (Brad Garrett) is not destined to be all by his lonesome self for eternity (though, there were times you had to wonder!). This seventh series of episodes was actually, for me, some of the most intelligent comedy of the series I had seen. It took a really honest look at the dark realities of life and the crossroads that we find ourselves in that can ultimately change our destinies. Yes, I am waxing philosophical about RAYMOND, and for good reason. Check it out for yourselves and find out why......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the best comedy around","review":"Season 7 is as great a set of episodes you'll ever get in comedy series. Baggage alone is worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fly returns and Brad Garrett and Ray Romano are great in it.","review":"One of my all time favorite episodes this season is \\"She's the One\\" where Robert finds the most perfect woman until she invites him back to her apartment where he finds that Ray's \\"allegation\\" that she ate a fly is probably true.The show is in it's prime here and no one should miss this season or this episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this show!","review":"This is a great product.

Definitely recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another funny season","review":"As someone who prefers sitcoms from the 70's and 80's because they were all about making you laugh without having to resort to simply being crude, this is one of the few recent sitcoms I really enjoy. Season 7 has some episodes that I can watch over and over again and always laugh - which is nice at the end of those long stressful days. These include \\"Homework\\" where Ray thinks Ally is getting too much homework and delivers a speech to the school board, and \\"The Plan\\" where the three men deliberately produce lousy invitations for Robert and Amy's wedding to get Robert out of having to do any work for the wedding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this show","review":"I watched this while in the Sinai after getting it in a \\"goody box\\" from my wife.

I bought this when I was going on a trip to Argentina. The little old lady that ran the hotel in a small village heard me laughing and came in my room to watch them one rainy day. There is no language barrier with this kind of comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incorrect product description","review":"I received this product for Christmas and was disappointed. The product description provided is wrong. The ruler is regular steel colored with black etched markings, not \\"Unique high visibility black blade with deep etchings filled with yellow paint\\". At first I thought they might have just shipped the wrong version, but it came with clear marked package labeled with the model #46-123.Yes, the square works but it isn't nearly as easy to read as I had anticipated. I'm very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap, yet overpriced","review":"My wife had one of these and I used it for some rough construction work outside. It was not perfectly square but it was close enough for building a fence. The level was so far out of plumb so as to be useless. Besides, it broke when I knocked it off my bench. The blade came out, the holding pin was lost, so it can't ever be used as a square again. For less money, you can buy the Empire \\"pro\\" square, which, although it is no Starrett, is still accurate and much more robust. I keep the Starrett inside my shop. The empire is in the traveling toolbox. The old Stanley blade will make a great scraper or paint-can opener."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not hold up over time","review":"This story arc was one of the most memorable of its time when I read it originally back in the day.

I would recommend to other collectors of the LSH volumes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hummmmph.......!","review":"Although I have heard about this story since I started collecting comics in 1987, as it being a classic for DC Comics and the Legion of Super Heroes in particular, I could not came to enjoy it while I was reading it.The art if nothing to write home about. I could understand that maybe at that time, the art was considered good or great, but there is art from the 70s (Neal Adams' Batman, or Marshall Rogers') that is way better that this. Also, the build up to reveal the \\"ultimate\\" villain behind all the troubles in the story is definitely killed by know, as everybody know who he is, without even opening the book.I just like that this is a Deluxe Edition, as I have other deluxe edition books on display in my house, so it serves as a nice companion. But, I think it will be maaaaaaany years until I re-read this story again, in hopes of finally enjoying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intriguing but.....","review":"After completing this book, I was horrified to discover that the author is an editor for a major newspaper. While the story is intense and intriguing, the writing was pitiful. At times, I found it difficult to continue reading because of the lack of fluency and transition. The story plot is original and clever but I fear the author needs to revisit grammar and sentence mechanics 101."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Writing","review":"I'm not going into indepth description and assessment of this writer. I read alot. Especially James Patterson and Stephen King. I will only say this. For a first effort, Tom Coffey is absolutely \\"ON\\". Read this book. I have laid aside books by supposedly \\"better authors\\" than this guy, such as P.D. James, because I got so bored by the ineffectual descriptions of petty details that I couldn't continue. Enjoy Tom Coffey for his flow, the way he just lays it out there, the awful 'in your face' violence and the seduction of the question left in the last chapter you read. Not rocket science. But, Tom Coffey knows how to spin a tale. I didn't jump from chapter 3 to the end. That is good reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Attempt...","review":"I don't care if this book is supposed to illustrate the moral deprivation of the modern world... it is terrible. Other books that deal with the same sort of \\"essential human sickness\\" that The Serpent Club deals with usually have some sort of resolution; that is, something that makes you put down the book nodding your head in agreement and fulfillment. This book leaves you shaking your head in disgust. I found no pleasure in this novel, becuase it is a case of depravation triumphing over reason and good, even in retrospect. Usually I have great respect for books: this is the only one in memory that I have tossed straight into the trash when I was done reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"an involving, at times troubling, thriller","review":"I found the book involving, and the voice of Ted Lowe, distinctive and a little troubling. Coffey's spare, muscular writing appealed to me and I never got bored. I hope the book does well. It deserves to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author's First Book - Hopefully His Last","review":"The reader is asked to believe that a reporter discovers that a gang of well-to-do young men maim, rape, and kill just because they get a kick out of it - and then - the reporter does very very little to bring the killers to justice. Of course, if the aforesaid reporter did so there would be much less of a book here, so maybe that provides the author with a rationale for this ridiculous plot. This author fails to realize that the reading public not only wants to be entertained but also wants to see outrageous behavior punished and criminals brought to justice. That does not happen in this novel. Too bad someone cannot plot for this author since he can write. But to detail sick, offensive, disgusting crimes and then to have the \\"hero\\" of the novel ignore his responsibility to act is not only ludicrous; it is offensive. I wish there was a way to award \\"minus stars\\" to rate this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This may be a SPOILER so only read if you've read the book","review":"Here's my problem with this plot (which has more holes than Ollie North's testimony): If a man commits a murder and the female victim has his DNA under her fingernails, but the authorities think his son actually committed the murder so they check the son's DNA, then wouldn't that still be a match? It seems the son in this book was glad to give up his DNA sample because he knew his father did the deed. I'm no expert on DNA testing, but I think that the son's and father's DNA would match so closely that the son would still be a suspect, even though in the story the DNA didn't match and that was part of the evidence used to exonnerate him. I could go back and reread some of the story, but there's nothing good about it so I'll just spend the rest of my life wondering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are people really this callous?","review":"The very most shocking and disapointing event in the book is when the main character fails to save his ex-girlfriend and her daughter from inevitable death. As a matter of fact, this character failed miserably. Lots of people stand by and let bad things happen - fail to get involved - believe they can't make a difference. Sadly, that's sort of what this book was about. I hope our culture produces better than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down. Obviously a first-time novelist.","review":"The book starts well, pulling you into the situation. As the story progresses, it is easy to see certain connections early. Most of the side stories are unbelievable and have nothing to do with moving the story along. I did not find myself identifying with or liking the protagonist in the story. Very unsatisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping you until the last page","review":"This is my kind of book. To be held until, literally the last page of the book. Tom has a gift for writing suspense thrillers. I read this book in one sitting. It is absolutely amazing stuff. I am eager for his next page turner. GREAT WORK!

The three stories in this book were an exception. The female characters were immature, unimaginably inexperienced and irritating. The word selections in the writing itself I found to be old-fashioned and out dated, even for a story set in Texas. I did like some of the qualities of the male characters but they were still far from likeable. I also didn't like the way the male characters treated the female characters - as if they were all pre-teens! This will be the first book I have ever parted with, and I do so with regret that I wasted $6.00."},{"rating":"2","title":"Orange is a beautiful color.","review":"An engrossing read on my kindle albeit with some odd technical formatting issues on my device.

Herb Alpert's trumpet is a nice fit on \\"Just Another Day\\", and Culbertson does some nice playing here and there. But for the most part there is too much of the same feel, with little spontaneity. This will probably do well with the wine-and-cheese crowd."},{"rating":"2","title":"A SMOOTH JAZZ - MUST HAVE CD","review":"Brian Culbertson is young and talented. This is evident by the content of his latest release. He is smart enough to work with some major smooth jazz talent, like Dave Koz, Herb Alpert, Jeff Lorber, Tony Maiden, Ricky Peterson, and Kirk Whalum. He also has some of the best studio musicians in the business working with him too, like Alex Al, and Lenny Castro. This cd combines smooth jazz with a touch of r&b, resulting in a satisfying blend (I Wanna Know, Nice & Slow, Someone). Brian's keyboard style easily jams with the funky grooves (Get It On) as well as the soft and smooth ones (Just Another Day, I Could Get Used To This). This is by far one of the best cd's I've purchased in 2001."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is for the jazz in you","review":"this jazz cd is one of the best of the year.this dude can play those keys.he has other good artists working with him on this project.my favorite cut is the title cut with trey lorentz singing lead vocals.for those who love jazz,especially the piano,this one's for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent smooth jazzzzzz","review":"Smooth jazz lovers will treasure this CD.

I found this book extremely helpful in pointing out manipulative, controlling tactics she uses with her son which makes him feel completely guilty when he has done nothing wrong. I found myself in a similar situation with her, which is why I purchased this book, which I shared with him. He read parts of it before confronting his mom in order to help give him the strength to stand up for himself.Mama Drama does a good job stressing the positive aspects of a controlling mother while outlining ways for you to gain control. I found that it does speak to both women and men, and I find it unfortunate that so many books target the mother/daughter relationship; my fiance is living proof that these relationships also exist between mother and son."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I found this book very disappointing. It kept repeating that we should let things go, that we should reestablish a good relationship with our mother, with no guidance whatsoever. It either oversimplified things, or just said things like: after 20 years of work she had the relationship she wanted with her mother...To begin with I don't want the process to take 20 years, and second, what do you do? Women who buy books like this are looking for specifics, not anecdotes."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a lifesaver","review":"Just a few pages into this book, I felt instantly better. It's not that you forget all the pain you've been through dealing with your breakup, it's just that reading about all these women dealing with the same pain, emptiness, loneliness and confusion makes you instantly feel less pain, emptiness, loneliness and confusion. Especially wonderful about this book is that it deals with male/female and female/female relationships, the latter relationship one that most books overlook. I've recommended it to many of my broken-hearted friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing quality","review":"For the price, I thought these would be closer to sterling, or that the \\"crystals\\" would look like glass, at least, but the \\"crystals\\" looked closer to plastic, and the metal was nowhere close to sterling, or so it appeared to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"a much-needed book on Latinos in America","review":"*Latinos: Remaking America* is heady stuff that is the perfect textbook for a Sociology class with an emphasis on Latinos. It's perfect because there are so many issues that this book addresses that readers can relate or connect to today's current events on Latinos. Such issues are education, language, religion, health, women, employment and many more. This book should serve as the bible of Latinos in America.The reason I said it was heady stuff because there are a lot of statistics in the book. While I believe that statistics are important, I do have to say that some of the graphs are not \\"friendly\\".However, I did wish that there were essays or articles by grassroot Latinos to give readers a \\"breather\\" from heavy reading.

And to be honest not many people appreciate house music for what it really expresses. House is music to soothe your soul and make you open up your mind.

Wonderful mixes from the top house DJ's around the world. All I am going to say is that if you love underground garage, 2-step, and/or trip-hop, you WILL love this"},{"rating":"2","title":"Original, quirky, dark and funny","review":"Not quite a great film, but an entertainingly odd and unique one. Fullof rough violence and noir situations played as dark comedy.Alec Baldwin is very good indeed as a killer sociopath who somehow isalso very likable when he's not robbing and beating people. Fred Wardis terrific as the scraggly cat of a cop who chases Baldwin down afterBaldwin steals his badge, gun and false teeth, and starts to run aroundpretending to be a cop himself. And Jennifer Jason Leigh underplays togreat effect as a pretty, dumb hooker, who falls for Baldwin, anddoesn't figure out just what kind of guy he is until very late in thegame. That said, it doesn't add up to a lot emotionally, Leigh's roleis underwritten, and there are several gaping logic holes the film justignores (Ward has dinner early on with Baldwin and Leigh, clearly knowshe's a criminal, but just leaves?!?)But all that said, I've seen it twice, and fully enjoyed myself both times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smell the raw, primeval air of the Indian Jungles....","review":"Kenneth Anderson shares an intimate relationship with the denizens of the Indian Jungle...the tiger, the elephant..His compassion for the creatures is evident throughout the pages, even for the man-eater, whom he has to kill, before it kills others..Interspersed are tales of the supernatural, which he records and which recreates the Still air, and the crackling fire of the campfire on a still, dark, silent jungle night...Indeed, a great personal view of Dark India.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly classic music","review":"What can I say about this album?

How disappointing it was to listen for the first time and not even recognize those favorite songs of mine. Sure, the band does a highly-professional job in the live versions included here, but neither even approaches the genius of the studio version. The recorder on \\"ISAGP\\" is barely audible, and the singing on Roundabout is altered from the arrangement I know and love. If you're a generic, know them from classic rock radio Yes fan like I am, steer clear. Leave this one for the Yes anthropologists who want to own these obscure versions.There. That review should offend every serious Yes fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"Yes is a great band, but unless you want the live versions of \\"Roundabout\\" and \\"I've Seen All Good People\\" do not buy this CD. The CD cover does not state that these are the live versions, which I thought was very misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes taste changes....","review":"I liked this band when I was a kid. They are incredible musicians, but it seems the songs are a reminder of when music was more about the spectacle. The lyrical content is often struggling to keep up with the grandiose musical visions and generally failing miserably. The Roger Dean cover is appropriate; fun to look at, but basically a cartoon. That equates fairly well to the music on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Falls Short of Great","review":"Once you recognize there is no perfect Yes collection, you'll eventually come around to the idea that Classic Yes is a pretty good album. A reasonably complete compilation of Yes' best work would consume several CDs. This single CD does a decent job.The album suffers from poor song selection. How could anyone put the LIVE version of Roundabout on a best of album and still call it Classic? Unbelievable. There's also the issue of mediocre sound qualty. The more recent Highlights has improved sound quality and the studio version of Roundabout...but it has problems of its own. Classic Yes is an imperfect collection, but still a must for fans of 70s Yes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the best single disc compilation of YES's career!","review":"By now, there have been numerous YES greatest hits packages, including two large box sets; yet this is the compilation I keep coming back to because it captures YES at the heart of their progressive stardom from 1971 through 1977.You get full-length versions here, including \\"Long Distance Runaround\\" immediately followed by \\"The Fish\\". You also get \\"And You And I\\", which has managed not to be featured on many other YES compilations. Pity, because it's one of their most enchanting songs; although I believe on the YESYEARS box set, there is a live version recorded during the Trevor Rabin years.The only down side is that \\"Roundabout\\" and \\"I've Seen All Good People\\" are live versions taken from their 1979 tour. While they're still enjoyable tunes, the original full-length version would have made this CD perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Summary of the Early Yes Phenom","review":"If you want to get a taste of the best from the early years of Yes (the best in this reviewer's opinion), this is a great CD for you.

Good hits package."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 and 1/2 Stars","review":"Okay this is Yes, Classic Yes after all, so the music is really 5 stars. So why didn't I give it 5 stars? Because it could better. Also, Yes, being progressive rock, are not well-suited by compilations, you should just buy the albums (Yes Album-Going For the One are the best). But if you don't want to spend all your money on the band's many studio (and live) albums, well, then this IS the best single-disc introduction to Yes. Personally, I would've left off Wonderous Stories and The Fish and put on Close To the Edge, Siberian Khatru, and others. Most of the band's best pieces are lengthy (CTTE, Awaken, The Gates of Delirium), and won't fit easily on collection.

This album was a top ten hit in the US when it was released in 1982 and produced two hit singles \\"Wasted on the Way\\" and \\"Southern Cross\\" and a third minor hit \\"Too Much Love To Hide\\". Other strong songs include \\"Into the Darkness\\" and \\"Daylight Again\\", which is an excellent update of the Stills classic \\"Find the Cost of Freedom\\". This release is helped by the addition of 4 bonus tracks not included on the original release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daylight Again","review":"Crosby, Stills, and Nash did a wonderful job. Most of song are slow, but they have a message with each song and you can hear each instruments. They did an excellant job."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointing album","review":"The band had splintered. Crosby was in full crash and burn mode. The trio's harmonies had always been their greatest strength, but they felt it necessary to pump up the vocals with ringers (Tim B. Schmidt and Art Garfunkel). The songwriting was their weakest yet as a trio. There is a total of three good songs (\\"Delta,\\" \\"Southern Cross,\\" and \\"Wasted on the Way\\"). The fact that their subsequent albums are actually worse isn't much of a recommendation.Skip this one. Buy their first album, Deja vu, 4-Way Street, and CSN. If you want more, pick up some of their solo albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Concert","review":"To my mind this is a far better concert than their later Acoustic set from 1991. Stills and Nash are in fine form , Crosby plays a minimal part due to his \\"blissed out\\" state , but he's not really missed . The backing Band are excellent and add a solid punch to the songs they play on .The vocals and harmonies from Nash and Stills are wonderful and far truer to the original songs than the later Acoustic set and it is this aspect of the concert which truly makes it great. Five stars for me, I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"daylight agian","review":"this is sweet. had it on tape and worn it out an long time ago. never could find it agian until amazon.. thank you. laurie"},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITES!","review":"I love this collection. \\"Southern Cross\\" is my single favorite song on this collection and as one reviewer aptly noted, it is the music that keeps us alive (to a certain extent). Crosby, Stills & Nash show great growth and development in this collection, while they remain true to the gentle sounds that made us love them. \\"Song for Susan\\" and \\"Might as Well Have a Good Time\\" and \\"Delta\\" are songs of extraordinarily high caliber.They did a nice job. And like another reviewer stated, we'll pray for them to do something like this again. This CD has a place of honor for car listening as well as home listening. And yes, I do have my 1982 original (from the stone age before CDs). CROSBY, STILLS & NASH ARE MY ALL TIME FAVORITES!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a pretty good album","review":"This album is not one of my favorites from them, but it does include the big hits--Wasted on the way and Southern Cross. The harmonies are great of course, has an eighties sound to it now, but still good. If I had to pass on one of their albums I would pass on this one and just buy the box set which includes both hits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jumpin' Graham Nash; it's a gas... !","review":"A marvellous slice of 1982. An evergreen supergroup. A testament to friendship in its darkest hour, apparently.While the historical background of this appearance definitely has its place, knowing it now does not spoil the impact it made on me when I first saw this DVD. Of course these men are older than when a number of the songs were first recorded, of course their voices do not sound the same. But the fresh arrangements of many of the songs and the excitement level -- pumped up largely by the humble yet formidable Graham Nash, a true 'son of encouragement' -- do make this an item worth having.Concerts are NEVER meant to be slick -- they are meant to be experienced, particularly when songwriters are involved. This happened to be a big chance to see CSN in LA that year. 'Magical Child' is a moment as tender as 'Sleep Song' over a decade before, 'Treetop Flyer' is a gem, and 'Delta' more than an act of courage. Is it any wonder CSN are still on tour in 2008?"},{"rating":"1","title":"no fun","review":"well, I love hanoi rocks old albums, and I love twelve shots, but this album is below there standard, sounds like a decent mike monroe album not a hanoi rocks album, best track is a cover of phil lynotts dear miss lonely hearts and worst is reggea rocker (the worst song they have ever recorded), I really wanted this album to be great, but it's not, sorry"},{"rating":"2","title":"7 Mos and still going strong.

John Lejeune was a senior officer who was a brilliant leader of Marines and US Army soldiers in WWI. He did not win a medal of honor for falling on a hand grenade or for taking out a machine gun nest with just a rifle and grenades. Lejeune's greatness was in the way that he recognized how best to train the individual Marine to be an expert rifleman first and to instill leadership in each and every one. In addition, Lejeune was able to use his experience from the military war college, to understand and use winning tactics in actual combat. He used that tactical experience to win battles and later to come up with the tactics, training, and logistic used by the Marine Corp today. This book finally explains why I am always so pround of the traditions of the USMC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this light","review":"I am an electrician and when I found this light I thought it was a Godsend.

The view is presented to accompany the promise that believer would sit with Jesus on His throne as promised in Revelation 3:21. The book mentions that Jesus said that He could have summoned twelve legions of angels to protect Him.

I couldn't. It just made me so depressed. I thought, this is one of the great bands of the 70's, reduced to pablum? At that time I didn't realize that this was an \\"outtakes\\" album. That might be an excuse, but it doesn't make it any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dog's breakfast","review":"I bought this garbage when it came out and found it less than rewarding. Everything I found interesting about ELP is missing from this album of novelty and filler songs. Think Jeremy Bender or the Sheriff tho of lesser quality.

This is the music of rockers who lost their confidence in the medium."},{"rating":"1","title":"hip tones for self absorbed twerps","review":"John Lydon, Mick Jones, and Joe Strummer took one listen to this nonsense and said \\"we have a future in this business!\\"....the single worst album title in the history of Rock and Roll...do yourself a favor...remove this CD from your machine..and put in London Calling...and make believe \\"progressive rock\\" never existed!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"delightful production","review":"Using a traditional score and a concept setting, the operetta comes alive in a new way. Peter Cousens brings a musical comedy interpretation to his Nnnki-Poo, while the set is changed to a Victorian Orientalia shop in London. Anne-Maree McDonald is a very traditional Yum-Yum, adding different elements which work as a whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Album","review":"This is absolutely the most underrated album from the era!!! It can't be described simply..Combine Zao, Converge, Strongarm, Countervail, and Mean Season and you get \\"Joshua Aiken\\".

This is the best .99 you could ever spend on music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shivery romance, palpable heartache","review":"Although it has the radio-edit of \\"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\", this is most likely the best collection of Roberta Flack's love songs to date. The only omissions which disappointed me were \\"Making Love\\" and \\"When You're Smiling\\" (from the \\"Dollar$\\" soundtrack). \\"Killing Me Softly With His Song\\" is just as devastating today as it was in the early '70's, when Flack was a glittering diva on the singles charts. \\"The Closer I Get To You\\" and \\"Where Is The Love\\" outlass the Carole King covers, and the Donny Hathaway duets didn't do much for me, but \\"Jesse\\" and the little-heard \\"If Ever I See You Again\\" (sort of a rewrite of \\"You Light Up My Life\\") are priceless heartbreak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fond memories aroused","review":"Back in the 1970s we went to Mr. Henry's in Washington, DC regularly to see and hear Roberta Flack.

If you leave in the NJ area don't expect to get this in the mail. I ordered it twice and both times got a flat, electricity-guzzling USB powered cooling pad that was not anywhere close to being the item I ordered (this one, with the three adjustable positions)!! Way to go amazon. I can't write a review for the item because I've never been able to use it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very high quality","review":"when looking for a cooling pad I figured that it would have a fan to be considered a \\"cooling\\" pad. So, I was a little disappointed when it came and it is just a stand that allows for better air circulation. Within the first few days EVERY one of the rubber feet on the bottom had fallen off. And, one of the clips that holds the stand up also broke. So, it is hard to get it level. So, if you are looking for something to really cool this is not the product. If you are looking for something to raise your laptop off the desk and not move, this product is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cooling Pad does as advertised.","review":"This product is just as advertised. It is lightweight so goes with you easily and definately keeps the laptop cool. The only thing I haven't liked is that the little rubber pads on the bottom that keep the cooling pad from sliding when used on a tabletop, have fallen off and will not restick."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Poor quality. Little instructions (I know...who the heck needs instructions for a simple item such as a cooling pad but this cooling pad is a different story.) I opened the box and two small black parts fell out of the inside of the cooling pad. Not sure how they are supposed to install but the three adjustable levels won't work without those 2 black parts. Used the cooling pad on my lap and when I lifted it up, the soft-felt circles on the bottom of the pad had fallen off! This cooling pad touts the great feature of a swivel but the swivel doesn't readily move, the entire pad will slide on the table before it swivels. With shipping, I paid $20 for this and it's not even worth $5!

There really is nothing on this album that works for me. I'm into the progressive/epic trance, and this is neither. It is dark sounding, and doen't give any upbeat energy and emotion that I like in my music. Everyone has different tastes, so maybe this will work for you, but for me it didn't. Take a look at the reviews for Tisto, Acosta, Paul Van Dyk, Sasha/Digweed, Armin Van Buuren, DJ Micro, etc. If these artists are more your style of trance, stay away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital Copy","review":"I bought this product thinking that I was getting a digital copy in a CD format. When I opened the package, I realized that the digital copy had to be downloaded from the internet. If I had wanted to download the movie, I would have bought it on the internet and downloaded. I needed the CD version. On top of that, the website that I was told to go to download it will not pull up by the link that was given to me. Very dissappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATE UltraViolet, Movie a 5 star","review":"Just wanted to rate this as low as possible simply because the Digital copy is something new called Ultravoilet. You have to stream this version, and it requires proprietary software that requires you to sign up for 2 more accounts. *sigh* Can't load into iTunes, DRM encoded to only play on Flixster app, which sucks. Never again will I purchase a Bluray that has Ultraviolet as the digital copy source.As far as the movie, 4.5 stars. Awesome family movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER EVER give UltraViolet as a Gift","review":"I bought this as a Christmas present for my nephews. I had never heard of 'UltraViolet' before so I thought it would be 'better' than any other DVD out there, and I would earn some 'Cool Uncle' points by buying them something 'better'...My nephews have no idea the stress and confusion this 'UltraViolet' feature/service/thing has caused their parents. Instead of phone calls saying \\"Thank you so much for the Dolphin Tale DVD you gave the family,\\" I have unwillingly become technical support for my frustrated brother-in-law who wants to know why he has to register at the website and divulge his closely-held personal information.By buying this 'UltraViolet' thing, I have given myself and my family members headache and frustration.

That said, I really did enjoy it. It had all the elements of a cotton candy fluff film (just like you'd expect from Disney), but this one worked for me. I think it was the uplifting message for people with disabilities for me. There were lots of positive messages addressing a wide range of issues (social, economic, environmental, etc). In the end, I'll say this: shed your cynical self for an evening and let yourself enjoy a good old fashioned tale of hope and dreams.

Plus, I'm a sucker for ANY animal movie, especially if it is true.You can't turn off the movie as soon as it ends. You really need to watch the WHOLE thing. Yes there is more after the movie ands and I love this. You will recognize where it came from. 'Nuff said.Plus, you can follow up on Winter at [...].

I do not go to movie theaters much due to their costs ever rising. I usually wait for dvd anymore. This one we actually did go see on the big screen. My 5 yr old wanted to see it. I took her and my mother to go see it and we ALL loved it. It will make you laugh, and cheer and even get teary eyed. It is not super depressing like some animal films. Instead it shows hope, courage, faith and perseverance and how people can come together and make things happen through trials. Great cast, cute movie.

The movie is great my family loves it! I would give the movie a good 5 stars and the digital copy portion a 0 since it's useless for the purpose we purchased this item.

She did not get to go see it at the theater because very few theaters received it with the track.

My case inserts say Skip James and the printing on the CD does too. However, the artist on the CD is not Skip James. It's actually a female blues artist named Georgia White. James and Georgia came from the same time period and both sang the blues, but that about all they had in common. So I got a factory defect - I'm not totally dissapointed though because Georgia White is an awesome artist that I wasn't aware of until this happy accident happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cecelia-Voice of the Feminine Spirit","review":"It depends on your likes and dislikes, but for me this is the most incredibly beautiful music that I've ever heard.

This DVD is wonderful, I love Paul Simon's work and this doesn' disappoint. If you are fan, this should be in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing performance experience","review":"I was not sure that I would enjoy Paul Simon's music performed by others. However, it was beautifully done and Simon performs some numbers himself and with others. He even reunites with Art Garfunkel. Just a truly outstanding event. I recommend it highly if you love Paul Simon's signature music."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Paul Simon Testimonial Concert","review":"This concert was definitely a special tribute to Paul Simon for all his good, hard work, and dedication. I say,the best performances were the ones of James Taylor, Lyle Lovett performing with Buckwheat Zydeco, and Stevie Wonder performing with the Dixie Hummingbirds. I think the most special performance was the one of Art Garfunkel singing with Paul. All the other singers were good, too. Steve Gadd is still the most brilliant drummer he's ever been.This DVD is definitely a collectible item. All Paul Simon fans should own one. (I do!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Paul Simon, mixed friends...","review":"I enjoyed this concert and the production/audio/video is first rate. The two numbers by Allison Krause are truly reference quality as are the two numbers by Laydysmith Black Mambazo. I stopped short of 5 starts because of some of the other performances - artists whose interpretations seem to miss the mark (Lyle Lovett, Marc Anthony, James Taylor - and I'm a big fan of Lovett and Taylor). Although personally I could have done without the video-based cuts included in the event, they do add some history and remind us what a great and lasting talent we have in Paul Simon. I highly recommend this for any true fan (just don't get frustrated if you find you want to skip some \\"chapters\\" after the first one or two viewings)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entirely Memorable!","review":"Paul Simon's songs are all special and memorable and are beautifully performed in this video. I saw this performance first on TV and was so happy when it finally was offered on DVD! Mark Anthony just about brings down the house with his performance; Simon and Garfunkel singing the classic \\"Bridge over troubled waters\\" brings back so many memories. The African singers, Lyle Lovett, etc. all were exceptional. This is a must get AND must play often!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul Simon: Gershwin Prize","review":"Happened upon this program on PBS and had a thoroughly enjoyable evening.

Most of the music is done without Simon and there is something missing. It is sort of like having George Bush juniors portrait on the dollar bill instead of Washington. It may spend the same but it isnt. Even with Simon it really isnt that good. If you want spectacular Paul Simon get the 25th anniversary concert for the rock and roll hall of fame held in 2010 at madison square garden. Save your money on this poor example and get the other concert. You will be alot happier with the result. Even Garfunkles performance was light years better at the rock and roll hall of fame concert than here. I can watch Simon again and again with the hall of fame concert and it is always great. This dvd is a watch once and throw it out. Nuff said"},{"rating":"1","title":"Friends and Paul Simon","review":"This is not worth the money you pay ... It is not a Paul Simon in concert disc . Out of the 25 songs or so in the Blu ray disc , hardly 7 or 8 features Paul Simon . Some of Paul Simon's \\"friends\\" are no way near the maestro when it comes to singing his tunes. I would give this disc a 2 / 5 rating"},{"rating":"1","title":"Paul Simon only in the end...","review":"Could be better! No Paul Simon till the end of the concert.

Unfortunately, when I play it on my computer (using legally bought Cyberlink PowerDVD), the FBI warning stays over the middle of the screen even after the program starts. I just paid for a disk that I cannot play because someone thought it necessary to tell me not to steal the disk! How frustrating.Fortunately, I bought the DVD at the same time and I am watching that right now. Had I not done so, this would be the moment I would go online to \\"illegally\\" download the show. Thank you very much FBI/MPAA/RIAA and associates. :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disapointement, really","review":"Could've been a great concert if only better friends had been on hand.James Taylor is the worse of the bunch: I didn't know SLIP SLIDIN' AWAY was a FUNNY SONG until I watched him perform it here! Man, was he constipated or what? Only the great Steve Gadd on drums plus Stevie Wonder and the quite numerous background musicians save the day.There are good moments indeed, like Art Garfunkel's heartfelt finale on Bridge Over Troubled Waters (only due here). So buy this thing if you're a completist. Otherwise, let it pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary Coming Out Story","review":"Without a doubt one of the finest gay teen coming out stories written, The Geography Club features the likable and very believable gay teen Russell Middlebrook who develops a crush on jock Kevin who so happens to be gay as well. The story deals with the difficult issues gay teens face trying to cope with their sexuality in the clique-ridden and hostile environment known as high school. The strongest aspect of the story is Russell who speaks in a contemporary voice, full of humour, angst and insecurity. Highly recommended for teenagers both gay and straight, as well as parents who want to better understand what their gay teen may be going through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Geography of the Heart","review":"Even with PFLAG and gay-straight alliances, how do you handle being a gay teen, which, if the locker room crowd finds out, makes you lower than lunchbox-toting Brian Bund in the hierarchy of high school? How far do you go to prove you're straight? And what happens when the straightest butch hunk o nthe football team starts making out with you in the parking lot?I could say \\"Be true to yourself, don't forget your real friends,\\" but Brent Hartinger says it more eloquently than ever in this first-love journey into the geography of that strange alien place known as high school."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Literary Hindenburg","review":"How this book has one positive review is beyond comprehension. \\"Geography Club\\" would be a disgrace were it written by a third grader. It is, perhaps, appropriate for \\"tweens\\" but I found it to be horribly written, preachy, condescending, predictable, completely unrealistic, cliched to a fault and lacking any meaningful character development or plot lines. F minus, minus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"This was a great read I wished it would have ended a little differently but I have to say it was still a fantastic ending I would reccomend this book to everyone! 4 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting","review":"Middle - end got my interest...its sad at the end in my view...It is pretty good.you may think this leads to sex or what not.. but doesn't it's a short romance and friend ship.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Geography Club","review":"What a wonderful book! It's a vivid, endearing, and human portrayal of teenage struggle, discovery, and ambition for truth, authenticity and friendship. A beautiful story not only of a personal journey but also of how society can evolve to become more appreciative of diversity and friendship. Protagonist Russel Middelbrook is sure to become an important part of the memories of many young readers, though this book is also wonderful reading for adults. Yes, do buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Story","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The author created many memorable, distinct characters, both gay and straight. The main character was so likeable and real it made the book very involving. And the supporting characters also were well drawn.I loved the many twists and turns of the plot. I never knew what was going to happen next, which made this novel almost impossible to put down.This book made me think about love, homosexuality, peer pressure, friendship, and other interesting issues. But it didn't hit me over the head with them. Mostly, it told an exciting story, layered with deeper issues and insights.This is not just a book for gay teens, by the way. I'm a heterosexual middle aged woman and I was completely engrossed by the story and the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Join the Club","review":"I just joined the Brent Hartinger fan club! This book is not about being gay, or being straight, or being bi. It's about kids who feel alone, and who reach out to each other and find other kindred spirits. THE GEOGRAPHY CLUB is a great read, no matter who you are!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing!","review":"This book is truly one of the best books that I've ever read.With that said, I'll say that the book seems geared towards young adults but I'm 25 and I can still relate to the book. This book actually brought forth a lot of emotion within me - especially since I've dealt with many of the issues that this book deals with. There were points throughout the book where I found myself actually holding my breath and reliving part of past experiences because all of it was so real. Brent is an amazing author with a mastery of words and a rare talent for imagery. I absolutely respect him for what he has done with this moving story that truly is a part of all of us whether we're gay, straight or otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think I'm in love","review":"Seriously. I love this guy Russel Middlebrook, in these two books. I'm actually kinda bummed that he's a character in a book, so he doesn't really exist. Cause he sure works for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thinks the audience is stupid","review":"I purchased this book, hoping to find a funny and riveting tale of growing up gay. Instead, I purchased a book whose author believes that his readers are unintelligent. The story itself was not all that bad (though a bit dull and predictable). However, the manner in which it was written was absolutely pathetic. Hartinger explains each and every thought the character is having with such detail that you begin to feel like he is patronizing you. There is one section of the book where a boy named Brian Bund does a nice deed for the main character, and Hartinger compares him to Jesus Christ dying on the cross! Sorry, Hartinger, but I don't think an unpopular boy who does something nice should be compared to a man nailed on the cross. All in all, I will agree with my fellow reviewers in saying that this book was a breeze to get through-but that was because everything was explained for us and did not contain one thought-provoking moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story about friendship and empathy","review":"High school student Russel Middlebrook is not out, but desperate for some honest conversation with other gay kids. After discovering that one of his good friends, Min, is bisexual, Russel suggests they form a club for gay kids at their school. But how do they make sure no one else will join the club? Thus is born the Geography Club, a club so boring-sounding that no one will want to join.I found this novel a heartening story about honesty, friendship, and doing the right thing even when that means risking losing one's social status. This is not so much a coming out novel as it is a novel about how so many kids, gay and straight, are judged and misunderstood by their peers. I loved how Russel developed empathy for other kids in the story.My only complaint with the story is the almost complete absence of adults in it. Teachers were props, parents were non-existent, and the teens seemed to live in a world in which they had complete autonomy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The sound of Bahia","review":"If you never heard of Bahia, go there. This is a beautiful tribute to one of her greatest sons, the composer Dorival Caymmi, hauntingly sung by one of her most beautiful daughters, Jussara Silveira, and produced, scored and performed by one of her greatest musicians, the amazing Luiz Brasil.If you want to understand what \\"saudades\\" means, buy this cd, fly to Salvador, Bahia, stick it on your walkman loud, and drive into town, along the miles of coqueiro-lined beaches, from the open air seafood market at Itapo to the Porta da Barra, and breathe in the salty sea air and the spirit of Caymmi that shines and lilts and flows from every bar of music, and smile, because you're in Bahia.Lá Vem A Baiana, O Anjo Da Noite, Voc No Sabe Amar, Saudade De Itapo are all great versions of great songs. This whole album is a gem."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE ORIGINAL STORY BY R.D. BLACKMORE!","review":"This book is not the original story by R. D. Blackmore.

The only bad thing about it is that it eventually ends, at which point you have a tough act to follow. Of course there's always the option of playing it again! Which seemed to be requested fairly often at our parties. The energy this album dumps into a party has to be seen to be believed."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN, FUN, FUN!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I love this CD. You can tell with the selection of songs and how they are performed that The Blues Brothers concerts were really fun with a lot of energy! Ok so John Belushi doesn't have the greatest singing voice but he can carry a tune and doesn't attempt to go out of his range! Dan Akroyd's harmonica playing sounds great and is timed perfectly with the songs. My favorites on this album are Almost, I Don't Know, Soul Man, Flip, Flop, & Fly. I read one review that said the album only had two good songs on it! That is a mis-statement, all the songs are great. This is the album that got me looking further into blues music; artists like John Lee Hooker, Junior Wells, etc. Great album, a classic live album that I listen to a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Recording","review":"Very disappointed. This, along with the last several CD's I've puchased through Amazon have been of extremely poor quality; so much crackling and popping over the actual recording that I cannot even listen to the music. I guess I'll have to start buying my CD's elsewhere. CD's I've purchased through other companies have been just fine, so it's not my equipment."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Blues Live Today..Thanks To The Brothers","review":"It's one of those you remember where you were and who were with moments when the Blues Brothers first appeared on SNL in 1977. Back in those days we had SNL parties and I remembered how everyone was floored when Jake (Belushi) unlocked the handcuffs and opened the briefcase. Elwood (Akroyd) pulled out the harmonica and began tearing it up with 'Soul Man'. Then it was Belushi's turn with the lead vocal. Awesome! It was history in the making. Possibly one of the greatest alter-ego acts of all time.And from the standpoint of impact on the music industry, it revived the true roots of blues to a whole new generation. When the movie was first released in the miserably hot summer of 1980, it was a word-of-mouth sensation. Underscoring blues brilliant legends such as John Lee Hooker and Cab Calloway.I'm in awe at just how re-masterfully the CDs are today from their first vinyl releases in the 70's. Timeless sounds and an essential investment to any music library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth a penny, even though it cost a little more.","review":"2 songs out of 12 isn't good. This isn't even worth the cheapo price. I really liked the movie and the soundtrack. The only thing I like about the CD are the songs: Rubber Biscuit, Soul Man, and the photo of Dan Ackroyd. Digitally remastered doesn't matter if the songs aren't any good to start with. This doesn't add anything to the soundtrack, so save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Xeroxing a Van Gough","review":"I got the joke of the original Blues Brothers segments on \\"Saturday Night Live,\\" and I do think that they should be credited with reviving interest in a genuine American art form.

The SNL skit was amusing at times, but recording albums was an insult to a vital American tradtion and art form. Shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"It never was and still isnt a joke","review":"I think these guys really did love the blues and they have some talent. They assembled a good band and the performances are worth listening to again and again. The songs they chose are mostly humorous, so listening to these blues will not drive you to drink or something worse. When I first saw them debut this Blues Brothers act on SNL in the 70s, I thought it was a joke. Especially because i recall Dan doing the Rubber Biscuit song, which is humorous. Soul Man was the only cut that got (maybe ever got) any radio airtime, but it's probably my least favorite song on the album. I had the 8 track of this, and before I finally bought the CD, it had been maybe 27 years since i had listening to the whole album. Still as good after all these years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NO WINGS IN THE AIR","review":"This is a great idea for people like me. There are no technical details, and a very good explanation on how a helicopter works. It is a great idea to learn how the helicopter flies and see it in action. I would like this video must have contained more natural sounds included, very specially the scene where a crew is ready to board and start the engine. I consider this video a good form of entertainment for both adults and children. The contents are nice and enjoyable.

I love psychedelia, I love hard rock, and I should have loved this, right? Unfortunately, almost all of the songs have extremely weak melodies, and the trippy sentiments, poorly thought out to begin with, have aged very badly, reminding me of something that Neil from \\"The Young Ones\\" might sing. The singing is probably the worst I've ever heard from any \\"major\\" band - its terribly whiny, nasal and thin. Its clear that the band thought that the instrumentation was far more important than the singing, but the singing is so bad I can't even listen to the instruments. And it didn't even deliver the all guitar chops I was expecting. If melody, tightly constructed songs, or good singing is important to you in your '60's blues-rock, there's nothing here for you. Check out \\"My Friend Jack\\" by The Smoke, the Who's first album, the Stones' \\"Aftermath,\\" \\"Nuggets,\\" or Jimi Hendrix."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best albums of the 60s","review":"This album stands cheek by jowl with the Beatles \\"Revolver.\\" From devastating psychedelia (\\"Happenings Ten Years Time Ago\\" with both Beck and Page on lead guitars) to Russian rock n roll (\\"Over, Under, Sideways, Down\\") to Gregorian chants (\\"Turn Into Earth\\"), this band could do it all. It's a shame that this is the only full length album the band was able to record in the studio. And they did it in less than a week.

Then I suspect they hadn't a good promotional support, &/or a very good manager.All allong their musical career they had two or three major hits only, included in this album.In addition, there's a nonsense track titled 'A conversation with Wilson Phillips' (not interesting at all), but definitely there are two other tracks worth more than a try... These are the covers of Elton John's classic Hit 'Daniel', the other one is a live in Japan performance of Eagles' megahit 'Hotel California'.If you really, really love to hear music and add new funny things to your music collection, maybe this CD will make you happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good music","review":"Wonderful music by great musicians!

Well, believe me, there are plenty of other \\"greatest hits\\" CDs out there with only one or two top 40s on them! Regardless, what makes this CD important for fans is that it includes the single versions of all their hits. The single versions of \\"Hold On\\", \\"Release Me\\", \\"Impulsive\\", \\"You're In Love\\" and others were all edited versions of the album tracks, and I was very happy to have these versions available on CD. That said, some of the filler material is pretty lame, especially the interview.

Stokes was born on January 1, 1888, which makes him one of the oldest bluesmen to have recorded. He was an excellent guitarist who had a beautifully archaic and gentle tint to his vocals. The major drawbacks of this cd are the nearly horrendous sound quality on two or three of the songs at the end of the cd, and the three versions of \\"'Tain't Nobody's Business If I Do\\" which become quite repetitive. Perhaps a better buy would have been Yazoo's Stokes disc, which doesn't have nearly as many songs on it, but does boast much better sound quality.

Curiously, however, at the same time the nation's math skills are weakening decade by decade.John Allen Paulos's \\"Innumeracy\\" attempts to address one aspect of this situation by offering some rudiments of probability theory. Many times in the lives of individuals and of nations, poor decisions are made due to an inadequate knowledge of probability. Some of the topics the author mentions include regression to the mean, coincidence, correlation and causation, and trade-offs between societal and individual rights. The author also discusses innumeracy as it relates to ESP and UFOs.Knowing the basics of probability can even help your health.

While he gives the impression that he wrote this great little summary of basic maths for those with little grasp for numbers, one gets the impression that he has little concern for the feeble confidence of his would be disciples. Personally , I think it makes the book more entertaining as he casually tears pseudoscience apart , but not without pointing out grave concern for mankind given the amount of followers it has. The book itself is a livley course on practical mathematics and it is very interesting throughout.

This book is not worth anyone's time - it has no moments - and is flat out boring. Jack is one of the most irresponsible, self serving and clueless characters I've come across to say nothing of being stupid. I can't imagine how he survived as a policeman for all those years.The French female character is slightly more likable and believable, but then going for a loser like Jack drops her I.Q. considerably and ruins whatever empathy one might have for her. I stuck it out to p. 337, but had made up my mind if he did one more stupid thing (which was inevitable) I would toss it, and I did. I realized I didn't care how it ended, but I hope he got what he deserved. This is not my idea of a good police thriller or procedural.

The cop, Jack, was a selfish man that was always thinking of himself first, his wife and everyone else, last. There was some action, but not enough to satisfy my taste, and the adventure...well, was there \\"really\\" any? If you've got nothing better to do, and I mean nothing, this book may be worth the read. I only finished it because I had paid for the unabridged audio version and it was thus, being read to me.

Daley has the ability to transform what, in many ways, is a rather pedestrian environment into an exciting and adventure packed story, with a heavy dollop of sex and romance thrown in to add to the mix. In this novel, he contrasts the gritty world of the New York street cop with the very different world of the French Finance officer, while showing the real parallels that exist in any law enforcement environment. As an ex-cop himself, he really knows his subject matter, but makes it immensely readable. It is a treat to be both entertained and educated in the workings of the police world.

This album predates New Jack Swing era etc. UTFO member EMD had just completed a rehab program and was a welcome addition back. (Skeezer Pleezer was an awful album prioor to Lethal which EMD did not participate in). Lethal is hard rap with a pop edge. It makes for an easy listen especially for new hip hop fans looking for old school records. It is in my top ten rap albums released from 1983 - 1991. After purchasing some 1500 rap casettes from 83 to 91 I feel somewhat of an authority on the old school. I still love this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"They dropped the ball on this one","review":"After two excellent albums, UTFO put out this piece of tripe. The only thing that would remind you of their ealier stuff is Diss. On everything else they started experimenting with their sound.

Okay, I don't know HERO very well, except for the very nice single \\"You're A Friend of Mine.\\" But RESCUE --- Wow!! An amazing and overlooked album, brimming with soul. This is an album I bought on vinyl back in the 80s and kept checking back to see if it was out on CD for more than decade. Check out \\"Money to the Rescue\\" and \\"A Woman's Got the Power\\" for starters. Classics that hold their own with Atlantic-Stax. Cut in the mid 80s, this is great 60s-70s dance music, the ballads are fine make-out music. Note: Clarence does not do the vocals, but he wisely found a singer who's as good with his voice as the big man is with his sax. I'm embarrassed I can't recall his name, because he belongs in the pantheon with Otis, Sam & Dave and Wilson Pickett. If you love soul, you will love this album.

While I was not very interested in the ideas for the theme parks, I found the book to be very informative, increasing my excitement to read on.

Poorly written, poorly acted, and it seems to drag on forever. Half way through I was wondering when the plot was going to begin.

Very reflective of the early 80s musical climate."},{"rating":"1","title":"only interesting as a 80s study","review":"This movie is just awful. I bought it because I was curious about the young Nick Cage. Well, he has less wrinkels. The plot of thismovie is: boy falls in love with girl. Its not even clear what he likes about her, but hey, its teen love. Had I seen this movie 10 years earlier I would have thougt all the setting is plain fiction and totally made up but I am afraid that is what was (is) true life for US teens in the 80s. Its not even romantic. Its not funny. Not even her Hippi-parents. Its just shallow. Mightbe useful if you are a teacher to show it in class. It is interesting as a 80s study and shows your children how innocent they ought to be.The only thing worth mentioning for me: I was suprised that Sushi got IN that early. But hey, I am from Germany and compared to LA thats the other side of the moon, right?"},{"rating":"2","title":"FULL frontal nudity!!","review":"This would be an awesome movie if it wasn't for that.

Nicolas Cage and Deborah Forman although very young perform one of the most memorable movies in 80's era history. It seemed like they both had chemistry working closely together as the two main stars of this movie. Deborah Forman unleashed the beginning of a new fashion and language era that could be seen and heard for almost the entire 80's era. Of course anyone that grew up in the 80's won't ignore the fact that the soundtrack for the movie is unforgetable as well. I say this is one of my favorite movie of it's time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why is Deborah Foreman not on the cover?","review":"I totally agree with viewer in Walnut, CA.

The music and garb is all hauntingly familiar, and that chick Julie is \\"truly dazzling\\". Cage is riotous, Foreman is obnoxiously cute. Not \\"one of the best pictures ever made\\", but it would definitely be on my island. Case in point: It is 3 am during finals week in college. 20 completely fried frat brothers and I have just finished watching Apocalypse Now on cable. Of course everyone is ready to crash but the tube room rules are that you can't leave until you see \\"Next on HBO\\". General consensis is that it really doesn't matter what is on, we're all leaving. Alas it is Valley Girl. By the end of the movie we had recruited another 15 or 20 fellows dying to see the movie again. One of the more enjoyable all-nighters of all time. A must see for anyone nostalgic about the 80s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got the movie but it was in FRENCH","review":"This is the best 80's movie ever!

Teen cultures clash when the punker from Hollywood meets the elegant prom princess from the Valley and the kids fall in love. Nicolas Cage shows his future promise in this early role, and the climactic fight scene, where he whips Julie's boyfriend, hijacks their prom limo and then takes her to the hotel room the boyfriend had reserved is still one of my favorite movie scenes.

I bought the Omega 2005 because other review I read said that it was extremely quiet - which it is. But, I have found that it produces slush instead of juice.

Ive juiced apples,carrots,beets,broccoli,celery,spinach,wheat grass and some other fruits berries ect. and every thing did great except pulpy fruit. Those made me wonder if i would get more juice if i just squeezed myself or perhaps blended them then added them.Let me tell you this thing is fun to watch. A crunching carrot is louder then the machine, its very quiet. i could totally see myself juicing in the morning while people sleep. Its also easy to take apart and clean, no biggie.

The new face of Omega juicers :-(","review":"Omega used to be THE juicer brand, and we waited for a good sale to invest in one. Well, we were very disappointed. First, they now make the units in Korea - Omega used to be made in the USA. This model, now made in Korea, is VERY cheap. It's all plastic parts, even the base was a cheap plastic with chrome finish. The chute could barely fit a full carrot or celery stick in it - EVERYTHING has to be chopped up or dissected in order to fit. To juice an orange, you have to put in individual orange segments! The juice and pulp cups are also extremely tiny and made of cheap plastic that probably contain BPA. This juicer really looks like a child's toy and we laughed in total disbelief when we unpacked the box. This one just isn't for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome juicer","review":"I already had a Jack Lelane juicer it was my introduction into juicing. I want to lose weight and get more nutrition in my diet and wanted to juice leafy greens. My centrifical juicer did poorly. I shopped around and decided on this juicer. It does great with everything including leafy greens. I like that I can do other things with it like making nut butters and sorbet using frozen fruit. I've not done that yet, but I have confidence it will do the job great. My only issue with the juicer is the foam and bits of pulp from softer fruits I get with my juice. Depending on what I juice sometimes there is a lot sometimes very little. I don't necessarily think its the juicer but juicing in general. To solve this situation I purchased a nut milk straining bag on amazon. I am still waiting for it to come but I think it will work good. Next purchase is a vitamix.

This is just what I need, but it may not be what you need. I'm happy with it's quality. The discarded pulp from apples and carrots (hard to juice) is very dry. Those fruits didn't produce much juice, but my 8005 sqeezed 'em out for sure. I wish it was a bit easier (faster) to clean. But good things come to those who wait, i guess.

Don't believe it! I've owned both the basic Omega centrifugal juicer and the pulp-ejecting centrifugal version, and this 8005 model (which is the only one I use now) I believe does as good a job on fruit as those other models. And the ease of cleaning on this model blows the others away.I juice oranges, grapefruit, and apples regularly. I think the yield is high and the ejected pulp is very dry. Not a scientific test I know, but I guess my point is just that if you are on the fence about this model because you've heard it isn't as good on fruit, I'd recommend you go ahead with it.

I've done side by side tests and there is no comparison. What you save in price up front will quickly be thrown out in wet pulp with other juicers. If you only do fruit, then the Omega is overkill. It's the best for Kale and Spinach. No comparison.. but it's slow and tedious so buyer be aware. It does clean up very quickly and it's the \\"tank\\" of juicers. It will last forever. Green juice has managed my M.S. for a year and I feel great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Juicer","review":"What can I say other than it works great and is quiet.

Guess this is when it is beneficial to buy an actual store front.

The feed chute is tiny (barely big enough for two fingers), the tray above the chute doesn't hold anything (most things fall out), clean-up is a nightmare, and it takes forever to get a usable glass of juice.Stick with a centrifugal juicer like the Breville Elite 800, unless you enjoy torturing yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to assemble, easy to operate and easy to clean. I love this machine!","review":"The black and chrome appearance of the juicer goes well with all the other small and large appliances in my kitchen. The juicer operates very quietly and is simple to use. I run the solid fruit and vegetable pulp through again, after the initial extraction, to really get all the juice. I have not made pasta but all the other features work fantastically. I use this product daily and feel it will be around for quite a long time.

Easy to use. Easy to clean. Gets more juice out of produce than my old centrifugal type juicer. It doesn't take up much counter space, either.

Boy was I wrong. This juicer has changed my life, made my skin so much clearer and helped provide consistent energy for me and my girlfriend. The Omega is super easy to clean; it takes 4 minutes and comes with a cleaning brush to help get off tough vegetable residue. So far I've had no problem juicing the following: carrots, apples, pears, kale, oranges, grapefruit, ginger, beets, and radishes to name a few.I'd highly recommend this juicer to anyone. It works really well for me, a lazy skeptic new to juicing, and equally well when my pretentious-heady-organic-yoga friends come over to juice their own concoctions."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"this is the Machine!

It is an amazing machine with the most intelligent design I can imagine. Incredibly easy to clean (this is a huge deal since it WILL dictate how much you use it). Much quieter than the vertical juicers and produces much more juice - get every drip out of your produce.My first juicer was some no-name $70 vertical fountain and I used it once before I took it back because I knew I would never use it again; cleaning it took 30 minutes and I wasn't able to get it all nicely.Cleaning this juicer takes about 2 minutes of running the parts under the faucet and it's ready to dry and go again. Comes with a strainer and a large \\"toothbrush\\" for even easier cleaning.Honestly, if you're even considering this juicer, do yourself a favor and get it. You will use it every day.I pair my juice with a tsp of Spirulina powder for an incredible nutrient punch in the face."},{"rating":"2","title":"great juicer!","review":"Fast, super quality juice, compares favorably with a $1,000 juicer I own.

It is super easy to use, as well as juicing every last drop out of whatever I put in the juicer. Carrots seem to be the most difficult - however if you slice them thinner, they will go through no problem. I timed the cleanup from when I stopped the juicer to when all was clean including the counter - 3.5 minutes. Whether or not you use a bag in the rinds catcher matters not as well. Just toss it in the trash and rinse out the container. I hope it lasts forever!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent juicer","review":"Great quality juicer. I love hearing it crunch up my veggies. Ive also used it to make almond butter. It works very efficiently"},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps the grocery bill when juicing","review":"I bought this model to replace juicer that was pretty decent but wasted a lot of what I was juicing and left the pulp too wet for me. I have used this for a few weeks now and love it. It isn't perfect, what juicer is?, but works better to get as much juice out of the produce as possible. They really do mean it when they say to go back and forth between soft and hard produce. The feed tube is smaller than my old unit, which means cutting up items more but it doesn't slow me down because I can cut and feed the tube at the same speed. The clean up on this unit is awesome. Takes me about 2 minutes with only a little scrubbing. The parts dry quick on my dish rack and I reassemble it for the next round without having to wait all day for metal parts to dry (like my old one).I would definitely recommend this juicer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I hadn't purchased this","review":"I had a Champion juicer for 15 years that finally wore out, so I bought this one. I've been using it for about two weeks. It's ok for juicing if you just want a little juice at a time, but I like to do juice fasts and drink 32 to 64 oz. of juice per day while on them. It will take me an hour to make that much (at least). It is also hard to take apart and put back together. For the price, I would have thought it would have more power. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money piece of junk","review":"Do not waste your time with this one as it is not worth the money! I only gave it one star since I had to give a rating, but it is not even worth that! I am so sorry I ever bought this! Because of a health condition it is really important I get the 5 fruits and vegetables a day so thought this would be a great way to accomplish that! So thought it important to spend a little more money on a good machine; however, this machine is a piece of junk! It gives you very little juice out of the fruit, and is a mess, gets clogged very easy and ends up being more time than anything to get maybe 2 or 3 servings out of what would be considered 5 servings. I have only had this for 4 months and am already having problems with it. I am obviously going to have to buy a new one so this will just be written off as a bad investment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best Juicer Built","review":"If you are in a hurry, this is not the machine you want to purchase. The attachments are cheaply built with thin plastic; and, I just hope that it doesn't break before I get my value from the money I paid to Amazon. The juicer waist is not as dry as they should be....and I am not going to push the scrapes through to get more juice. The motor is quite, but the plastic attachment makes noise when it turns. It also doesn't hold stiff in the machine housing and cycles in an up and down motion as it turns. As cheap of an attachment it is, I would fear placing any downward pressure on the food items as I loaded them into the machine will snap off the Auger/drum assembly"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent it back","review":"Don't waste your time, I expected it to at least work, wont even grind coffee beans 1 at a time, and jams up with one small piece of carrot.

I tried adjusting this thing at every angle, every range, lights up, lights down, with no success. What I can't believe is that this light will detect any little wind, but it won't detect me. Perhaps this is due to the fact this light does not detect motion but changes in ambient temperature. So, if you live in a hot climate like me, I would avoid this light.

The only beef I have with it is that the batteries fall out relatively easily. There isn't a guard that keeps them in, only a couple of 'teeth' on one and the pressure of the spring holding the other. It's a pain when you spend 10 minutes programing it, the batteries pop out and then you have to reprogram the entire thing over again.As a thermostat it works as advertised, just a design issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does what it claims, but.","review":"Easy to install and turn on.A pain in the buns to program, that takes some time.The real kicker is if you have carpeting in your house you will spend several hours resetting and reprogramming the unit.

It works really well, we love the indigo glow, and the program is really easy to use and really convenient for people who don't work the standard 9-5 M-F that some thermostats limit their programs to.

It has a limited amount of information on Tokyo and Kyoto, to the point of being almost useless. This would be the equivalent of someone making a travel guide for the US, and all it included was 15 minutes of Seattle and 15 minutes of Detroit. Think of any place that you really know and like; how much could you show them in 15 minutes?Kyoto and Tokyo both need their own 40 minute plus video, and that is only two major cities of Japan, and no smaller cities or countryside.If that isn't bad enough, although Kyoto is known for its gardens, instead of showing as much footage of the gardens, he spends most of his time talking to one gardener about maintaining it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed","review":"I bought this Blu-Ray and I was expecting a show that actually took a look at what makes Beautiful Japan. Sure the locations are pretty and beautiful but without any cultural insight it is lost on viewers. Some effort to provide genuine cultural insight would have been appreciated. He shows you a traditional Japanese inn but instead of following the tradition of donning a yukata (Japanese summer kimono) he just plops down and eats. Japan is not a place where you go and just look around. You need to immerse yourself and leave behind your Western culture. I was disappointed at what appears to be a lack of interest on Mr. Maxa's part where it seems like he is there because he is forced to. For a true look at beautiful Japan where the gem that is this truly unique culture is genuinely displayed, try Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations (Season 4 Episode 16).

All the songs sound alike and I liked the silence between the songs more than the songs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"And then they were twee...","review":"As the follow-up to the epic Wind & Wuthering, this album is thoroughly disappointing. With a batch of lame, radio-friendly songs purposely kept short to garner airplay, Genesis should have titled this album And Then We Sold Out... Also quite embarrassing is Mike Rutherford's weak attempt at mimicking Steve Hackett's sorely missed guitar work. Burning Rope and The Lady Lies are the too-few highlights here. The band made a slight return to form on the following album, Duke, but this one remains an aberration within the Genesis catalog. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genesis lands on its feet","review":"Phil Collins comes into his own as a singer and Genesis's new leader on \\"And Then There Were Three.\\" The band begins moving away from the art rock of the old Peter Gabriel days and toward the more pop sound that would make them superstars in the 1980s. This album is somewhere in the middle, and the strong collaborative songwriting from all three members makes it one of their better albums. \\"Follow, You, Follow Me,\\" was a minor radio his, and other fines songs like \\"Snowbound\\" and \\"Deep in the Motherlode\\" can be found all over this album. This is a solid album that is a must for any Genesis fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not their best","review":"This was very much a transitional album for Genesis, and it shows. Some of the songs -- \\"Undertow,\\" \\"Burning Rope,\\" the lovely \\"Follow You Follow Me\\" -- are as gorgeous as anything else in the band's enormous catalogue, but a good many others seem underwritten, overplayed or forgettable. Genesis recorded this album quickly, and did so in the wake of guitarist Steve Hackett's departure, so it's understandable that the album doesn't measure up to early masterpieces like \\"Foxtrot\\" or their later self-titled collection of pop gems. For new listeners, this wouldn't be the first -- or even the fourth or fifth -- Genesis album that I'd recommend, but it does have three or four excellent songs that make it worth coming back to."},{"rating":"2","title":"What happens when you take two virtuosos out of a band...","review":"What happens when you take two virtuosos out of a band? In general, that band has no air left to go. But if the name of that band is Genesis, then the answer is: there are three virtuosos left.Once Peter Gabriel left the band in 1975, people feared that the singing part could not be substituted by anyone. Phil Collings proved everyone wrong.Next in line to leave the band would be guitarrist Steve Hackett, in 1976. This time, the guitar would suffer, as Mike Rutherford, though good is never as good as Hackett. But album-wise, the album that the remaining trio recorded is one of incredible beauty where the solo capacities of the members become very obvious.Probably not the best 'new era' Genesis album (my vote for that one goes to 1980's 'Duke') but a very good album though."},{"rating":"1","title":"No wonder Steve Hackett left the band","review":"Ugh.

Nevertheless, the band members' musicianship is still much in evidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak and insipid","review":"This album lacks the kick and stamina of A Trick of theTail.

Boring, stupid and all in all the worst Genesis album ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"And Then There Were Three was the final album of Genesis' middle period (1976-1978) and first album without Steve Hackett. Steve was the final cog in the wheel of Genesis as a glorious prog rock band. With this album Genesis made an album with only 2 highlights Burning Rope and The Lady Lies and 3 ok songs Ballad Of Big, Deep In The Motherlode and Down And Out (a critical stab at Steve Hackett for his departure due to the more commercial and less creative sound cropping up in Genesis). The rest of the album is awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I expected.","review":"This disk is just what I expected from the old Genesis, which was perfect.

The rest are just ok, but not memorable cuts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe their best.","review":"Foxtrot has always been my favorite Genesis album. As I am still discovering all the gems this band has released--this album has turned into a recording I can't stop listening too. Tony Banks' \\"Burning Rope\\" is a good enough reason for you to purchase this recording. Great melody, inspiring lyrics, and nice changes make this song a favorite. Also, \\"Undertow,\\" \\"Snowbound\\" and \\"The Lady Lies\\" are all great tunes. Even this album's hit is a nice addiction--\\"Follow You, Follow Me.\\" If earlier Genesis albums are difficult for you but you still enjoy the progressive touch--this is \\"progressive pop\\" at it's best. A true winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three is the Charm","review":"Genesis enters there middle era with just Phil, Tony & Mike. This is a great album - songs, arrangements, etc. Down and Out starts the album out with a bang. There is some beautiful music in Snowbound, Undertow and Burning Rope. Epic progrock in Ballad of Big.

In my opinion, the greatest Genesis albums are (in no particular order) \\"Selling England By the Pound\\", \\"...And Then There Were Three\\", \\"Trick of the Tail\\", and - perhaps the best - \\"Wind and Wuthering\\".\\"Follow You, Follow Me\\" is a nice song, but it's the only one on this album that foreshadow's Genesis's future. The rest of the album hews close to the fantastic progressive rock sound of \\"Trick...\\" and \\"Wind...\\", despite the loss of Hackett. \\"Burning Rope\\", \\"Snowman\\", and many others are standouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing creativity","review":"phil collins comes to the front of the band with this album,his creativity becomes evident and he goes down in history."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's good if you like Scrabblegrams","review":"I wanted to get a book with word and number puzzles, like the crossword number puzzles (sorry don't know the names).

This movie takes you on an awesome ride full of twists and turns. In the beginning of the movie, Moran's character (a young doomed theif) arrives at his father's(played by Hurt)home after being shot, and with an offer he knows his father will not refuse. Moran's character's reason for concocting this plan, is to save his friend from death. During the entire movie your trying to figure out which story that moran's character told is true. Hurt and moran's characters seem to be caught in their own tangle of hate and distrust, that only seems to untangle when each is facing death. Close to the end of the movie I was left wandering if anyone would survive. For those who have not yet seen the movie I won't say who lives or dies, just that the ending is totally twisted.

And the reason given for dusting FIRST and then vacuuming is laughable and rather disgusting all at the same time. How dirty is your house if you have chunks of stuff on surfaces that you need to sweep off to hit the floor and then vacuum up? I mean really!! Dust and chunks of things/bits/pieces are entirely different things. One (the latter) is debris, and dust is not something that \\"falls to the floor\\" as you dust.

I love Davies very much, but this book is nothing like his work - it's m-u-c-h slower and much less far-ranging. It's dull, dull, dull. And the characters are one-dimensional -- either they're pathetic or corrupt.Just goes to show once again that what deeply moves one person can leave someone who loves the first person cold.

In fact, the whole album seems to want to be pretty great but it's buried in a deep compression it cannot transcend which the remastering exacerbates beautifully and which suppresses any dynamics the band tries so hard to express. Take a track like 'Blood On The Rooftops', for example, and gloss it with lots of echo and then remove all the lower frequencies; it'll probably sound great on the radio but elsewhere it only frustrates close listening. And Genesis can quote Emily Bronte all they want for song titles, and I'm sure she would have appreciated it, but where the heck is Steve Hackett? Barely anywhere, that's where. It's mostly Tony Banks' synth affair. No wonder there were only three on the next go around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong Post-Gabriel Effort","review":"After Peter Gabriel left Genesis with the landmark album The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, Genesis, now headed by Phil Collins, wanted to show that they could still produce ethereal rock with misty landscapes and long story-telling. Winds and the Wuthering, which followed The Trick of the Tail, showed that for two albums in a row they could do quite fine without Gabriel. Winds and the Wuthering features their spiritual hymn \\"Afterglow,\\" its melancholy lament \\"Blood on the Rooftops,\\" and their love ballad \\"Your Own Special Way,\\" and the album as a whole confirms that they continued to make a smooth transition from their Peter Gabriel days. Don't be fooled by Phil Collins' pop idol reputation. Before he went solo, he created an entirely different world with a voice that seems totally Other than it does pop. At times his voice reminds me of a munchkin or a gnome. I mean this in a good sense. His other-worldly voice seems to complement the fairy-tale atmosphere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Closing Chapter","review":"This is Phil Collins'second time up as Genesis' lead vocalist and the group's farewell to the prog rock scene. \\"Eleventh Earl of Mar\\" is about a father telling a bedtime story to his child. \\"One For The Vine\\" is a tale of religious disillusion and restoration. Tony Banks does an excellent job with his keyboard and synth arsenal. As disjointed as this song is to most fans, it really does have some beautiful chord progressions in it. \\"Your Own Special Way\\" is a too-often-knocked ballad. \\"Wot Gorilla\\" sounds as if it could have been done by Weather Report. \\"All In A Mouse's Night\\" is the album's most amusing number. \\"Blood On The Rooftops\\" is about those who get lost in the \\"boob tube (TV)\\". \\"Unquiet Slumbers\\"...\\"For The Sleepers...\\" \\"In That Quiet Earth\\" all bleed together seamlessly with \\"Afterglow\\", which has faint traces (in mood)of 1973's \\"After The Ordeal\\". So the play ends, and the curtain falls."},{"rating":"2","title":"So good it's painful...","review":"Why is this? Simple, no more Steve Hackett studio work after this and the live Seconds Out. This has everything that made Genesis one of the greatest bands of the early and mid 70's. Two songs at the start that remind us of how good prog rock is. A ballad that points to a diferent future. Then a couple of crazy songs to mix it up and finally the final several pieces ending in Afterglow. I feel that Steve added a texture to the band that is lacking after this. I love Genesis in all of their lineups, but the best was behind them after this (and of course Seconds Out confirms all of this)."},{"rating":"2","title":"wind and wuthering","review":"I purchased this cd about 6 months ago and i think it's great. i have every single genesis album the whole way from \\"from genesis to revelation\\" to \\"calling all stations\\". Wind and Wuthering is the first album released after Peter Gabriel left and Phil Collins came to the lead singer spot. this album seems overlooked but it definitly should not be! It captures the Peter Gabriel era sound of genesis very well. The band took a turn towards pop soon after the release of this album. I highly recommend this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wuthering comes down a notch","review":"This followup to Trick of the Tail sounds like that album and you won't be dissapointed if you like Trick. Steve Hackett claims he tried to get \\"Please Don't Touch\\" and \\"Inside and Out\\" on this record but was often the victim to the bands overruling.In retrospect his \\"Please Don't Touch\\" and \\"Inside and Out\\" would of been better than the songs they chose instead \\"Wot Gorilla\\" and \\"All in a Mouses Night\\"and would of made it a 5 star record and maybe then he would of stayed with the group?"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all in a Genesis album.","review":"With the exception of WOT Gorilla the music on this album is amongst the finest Genesis has produced. The rating should have been 4 and three quarters because it does not equal The Lamb lies down on Broadway, but it comes close. The truly outstanding songs are One for the Vine, 11th earl of Mar, Blood on the rooftops. And then there is that absurd song about the nightly adventures of a mouse. This song alone is worth the rating. Simply a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic and poetic","review":"I remember when this first came out in vinyl in December 1976. I bought it along with The Missing Piece by Gentle Giant, and spent all afternoon progging out on both splendid records. Both epic and poetic, Wind and Wuthering is the last Genesis album with Steve Hackett on Guitar. It is in a way the last of the truly British folklore albums by Genesis, dealing with historical epochs like 11th Earl of Mar, or fantasy tales such as All in Mouse's House. The production quality on the re-master is superb, whether you play it on surround sound or a portable player. Wot Gorilla is a clever jam tune, and of course Your own Special Way was the single for this record.Blood on the Rooftops seem to be the consensus favorite of the band itself, according to recent interviews in Prog Magazine this last summer. This song is still timely today, in light of the Mid East situation.This is must own for Prog rock fans, and will appeal to devotees of fantasy and mythology as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best of the best","review":"Young people today totally miss the boat with song only downloads, this album and I do mean album is one of the finest sit and listen albums ever produced. I love it so much I can't go more than a month without listening. It is dynamic, intelligent, and can create a fantasy in the listeners mind unmatched by any other piece of music by a rock band.

Two best songs are One for the Vine, I think it must be a song about a failed military campaign, one of genesis best songs.

You're own special way gave genesis some air play in the U.S for the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Genesis At Their Worst","review":"This is the one Genesis record I can't listen to. The production is flat and lifeless, the tunes boring. The desolate looking gray and brown of the cover art sums up perfectly what's inside.

Pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"weakest 70s effort","review":"This album sounds uninspired, has long boring songs on it and even the band itself must have not liked it that much since only \\"afterglow\\", appeared on the next release, the live \\"Seconds Out\\" (which includes 4 tracks from the previous release \\"Trick of the Tail\\", to prove that point) Phil Collins when through an emotional low at the time of this recording and it shows, he is squeezing out Banks' out-of-this-world lyrics as if he has just ran a marathon. Most of all near the end of the 70s Genesis decided to follow up on classic \\"Trick of the Tail\\" with a forced more prog-rock sound (we can do it without Gabriel! ) and fails miserably. While other bands try to freshen up their sound in the era of disco, punk, the police, blondie among others, genesis decided to put out an album that makes Pink Floyd's Animals(1978)sound uplifting!Fastforward to \\"Duke\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Think of your own W's...","review":"I have to fall in with the negative reviews on this one. I remember when this album came out when I was in colege.

For wusses only."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of their best peter or not","review":"This is truly one of Genesis' finest albums. It is better than the previous \\"Trick of the Tail\\" and stands up to any of the albums featuring Peter Gabriel. After this one Steve Hackett left and they started going downhill rapidly. The first track, \\"Eleventh Earl of Mar\\" is one of the highlights and shows the band in its traditional story-telling mode, with brilliant results. Another highlight is the extended instrumental \\"Unquiet Slumbers for the Sleepers\\". If you like the albums with Peter Gabriel and have been putting off buying this one, do yourself a favor and check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Of Really Unique Genesis Music","review":"An album released just prior to the Seconds Out tour, Wind & Wuthering has some very beautiful music within the fragile state the band seemed to be experiencing. Art rock was waning and the band was trying to hold on to its musical core. Much of their effort is successful, although purists will begin to notice Phil Collins slipping in and out of some very obviously POP style phrasing-- foreshadowing the artistic death of the band.

It is filled with trivia and several false statements. For instance, on page 247 the author states that 'until recently, additional income was provided by a large naval and military base [Kenitra], shared with the US, but the Americans left after the Gulf War...' Well, this is absolutely not true. The Kenitra Base was closed in 1978 and the last naval activity there was the taking of the [then Port-Lyautey] airfield by US forces during Operation Torch in WWII. This, in turn, is followed by a derogatory comment about \\"a rather sad array of bars, pizza joints, and discos [that] struggle along in their wake\\" which indicates that the author of this section not only failed to research his subject...Therefore, if the authors didn't even take the time to verify these facts then just how reliable can you expect the rest of the book to be?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfulfilling","review":"As we loaded our backpacks hours before our jet departed Vancouver, my partner and I debated about whether to bring Lonely Planet's Morocco guidebook, or the Rough Guide. In the end, mostly due to weight considerations, we left the Rough Guide at home. I would advise any first-time traveller to Morocco to do the same. It's a tired, rambling, incomplete guide, full of inconsequential information and generic descriptions. Hotel prices, strangely, are not listed. There is scant reference to Morocco's massive social ills. And there are too many references to writer Paul Bowles, who, I admit, is the be-all-and-end-all of western Moroccan ex-pats.

Calm have created a wonderful, relaxing soundscape populated with soothing percusion.

Dim the lights, grab a drink, and luxuriate in the sounds of Calm.If you get the chance, also pick-up the equally (if not more so) wonderful \`Moonage Electric Ensemble' also by Calm.

His album, Shadow of the Earth, is suffused with a spirit of relaxation.

Should have been my first clue. As someone who designs and makes custom clothing, I'm always looking for references to help with customer body types and the best silhouettes. This book got it all wrong. Unless you're a celebrity and a sample size, don't bother. They don't know how to dress you. The authors/editors have no experience dressing you and they never will.

There are some helpful hints but nothing I hadn't already seen in the Chic Simple's Women's Wardrobe. It is a good overall guide if you don't already own any of these kind of books but if you do, you could probably save your money and stick to what you've got.

This book is so full of posed photos of celebrities looking wonderful in their size-2 clothing that it doesn't have enough room to help me figure out how to camoflage my less-than-perfect derriere. The focus is SO heavy on the celebrities -- not nearly enough time is spent on what to do when you have two figure flaws that work at cross-purposes to one another. For instance, I'm short and small-busted. Short women are advised to avoid double-breasted styles...but small-busted women are advised to go for double-breasted. There's not much in this book about how to solve these sorts of issues. Instead of showing me Nicole Kidman in a $10,000 suit, why not show me a woman with a figure problem in side-by-side photos showing clothing that enhances her positives and hides her flaws and clothing that doesn't?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really helpful","review":"It's easy to be impressed by all the gorgeous outfits they've put together, but I found this book short on helpful advice on how to do this oneself. I was hoping for more basic suggestions for what shapes and styles look good together.And some of their advice about \\"must-have\\" basics just isn't universally applicable. Half of their \\"6 figure-flattering classics no closet should be without\\" are not great. As a curvy woman with tendency towards pear-shape, I have yet to find straight-leg pants than don't make my legs look like tree trunks; I do much better with bootcut. A straight-cut turtleneck? Completely hides my waist and makes me look boxy. And flesh-colored pump? Yuck: double yuck. How about you show us *one single example* of an outfit in this entire book with flesh-colored pumps, and then I'll agree that this is an important basic.So after buying and reading this book, I feel like I wasted my money.

The second song Morning Sun starts slowly and just when you think you will fall asleep, the tempo changes and Klaus Doldinger's sax work demonstrates why there will never be another sax player to match his talent.The rest of the album is marginal, but is still better than any fusion being done today."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"great price compared to other cookers.

But looks aside, it's got all the features I want: porridge/soup settings, makes perfect white or brown rice, chimes when done and switches to warm mode, steamer rack, delayed timer, slow cooker (to 2 hours) etc. etc.I just wish the instructions didn't tell me the inner pot was not dishwasher safe, because I plan to wash it in the dishwasher anyway, top rack. The manual also says to clean EVERY part of the cooker after EVERY use. That's not gonna happen.

I bought both the backboard and the mounting bracket from Lifetime. I followed the instructions to the letter. Not only did they have me drive a lag into the plastic hole, they later had me remove it and add an additional bracket that just made the whole assembly less secure as now the lag was not able to fully tighten. By the time we had the thing on the roof and secured the lag was already pulling out of the backboard. I re-tightend it as well as I could without stripping it but I have no hopes that this installation will last. Wasted money.

It looks ok, appears to be well-made, etc; it just has a lot of flex to it.As a result, when the B-ball hits the backboard, the backboard flexes and this results in an unpredictable rebound.I mounted it to a brick wall using Lifetime's universal mounting kit and 5/16\\" Red-Head masonry anchor bolts.

I'm not finished with it yet but it feels like it hit the core soul of the country at the time. Separate articles, opinions, thoughts really point out the conflicts at the time.

But you could certainly do worse.Pratchett isn't at his funniest here, but the read is entertaining, insightful and jaunty; a 'good' reader should be able to get through it in a few days worth of casual reading. It has some religious themes in it that manage to be insightful without being offensive, and the book ends cheerfully. I think that might be it's key flaw: It almost ends TOO cheerfully, as if none of the conflicts ended badly for anyone. I mean, even the characters who die don't have it bad.At any rate, it manages to be a more relevant vampire novel than 'Twilight.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another hilarious masterpiece from a great author!","review":"Terry Prattchet always impresses me with his wordskill, but his books about the trio of witches- Nanny Ogg, Granny Weatherwax, and Agnes Nitt- are my favourites.

What a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"New theme (vampires), same old witches","review":"I give the book 4 stars (probably 3.75) because of putting the witches through a new theme - vampires invading Lancre!

I guess you can only do so much with the same characters though."},{"rating":"2","title":"The WeatherWax Waxes and Wanes","review":"This is another Granny Weatherwax book, but in fact she shows some human failings in this one, which is startling, and is nearly turned to the dark side.

This time out Granny Weatherwax, Nanny Ogg and the other witches of their coven must protect their homeland of Lancre from an incursion by a clan of vampires who have been training themselves to be immune to such things as garlic and religious icons (it's all psychosomatic, you see). Pratchett, as always, is brilliantly funny and biting with his satire. No target is safe. As the title of the book implies, Pratchett's motto seems to be \\"carpe jugulum... go for the throat.\\"I must admit, as far as the series-within-a-series Discworld books go, it took time for me to warm up to Granny Weatherwax. She and her coven have become some of my favorites among Pratchett's creations, though, and this book was perhaps their best outing yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Let's face it, Terry Pratchett is a legend!

Yes, the phoenix wasn't necessary, and there is a resemblance to \\"Lords and Ladies\\", but PLEASE! How can you say the 'Pictsies' were neglected? Pratchett often gives us only a taste of a character (or group) before he decides whether he wants to take them further. These guys brought tears to my eyes! I want to go around saying 'Bigjobs!' at people, except I'm afraid it's some obscure English slang that'll get me punched in the face by some guy from Birmingham. Igor and Nanny's patter in the second half is reason enough to get this book! And who thought that Granny would meet her (mental) match in an Omnian priest? The discussion of passion and faith, doubt and belief gave this story an amazing depth, while also making the funny parts even more so.

They were beginning to look middle age. So at the end of '82, ABBA went separate ways, destined to indulge themselves in solo projects from then on.

Of course other villains have gotten suspicious of the new outgoing Batman and wonder if its the same man behind the mask.While I find this book entertaining its pretty pointless because DC is rushing out the return of Bruce Wayne because they were late on the ball with the death and resurrection of Captain America.

In 1997 the film Good Will Hunting made the same point: if you're working class and you have a genius friend, you should be willing to give up your friendship so that he can be free to climb the social ladder. Stella Dallas is similar in this respect. I could not see how embarrassing the wealthy is such a crime that one should be forced to give up one's child. Therefore, the entire premise that the film is weighted on, Stanwyck's marvelous performance even, fall flat in front of this egregious premise.I think the British handle class drama far better than Americans, it's the subtlety that counts and this film had none."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unconditional Love","review":"This is a great classic old film that will simply take your breath away.

It marked a real breakthrough for Barbara Stanwyck into the emotionally charged type of roles for which she became renowned for in the next decade and won her a richly deserved nomination for Best Actress that year. I can't understand those people that nowadays dismiss this wonderful film as \\"syrupy\\",or \\"dated\\".

The book has only two pages (simple drawings of a cello and bow) that contain any information whatsoever about the instrument, and one of those pages recommends games which encourage children to handle their bow like a toy, to be waved about like a worthless stick.

It contains all the classics as well as the wonderful new tracks \\"J'te mentirais\\" and the arabic-influenced \\"Au café des délices\\". Gone is the over-electronic sound of some of his earlier CDs. The musicians play beautifully, many of the songs are supported by a full (31 member) string orchestra, and there is a medley of old chansons acting as a taster for the new live CD which contains only old chansons. It's a CD I put on and play from beginning to end and just dream. The sound quality and stereo imaging is excellent. On some of the early tracks one can hear the audience singing (and they are encouraged to sing), but where important the CD has been mixed to give Patrick Bruel a complete dominance over the audience without losing the live atmosphere. This is my favourite Patrick Bruel CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money -- Good songs drowned out by shrieking fans","review":"If you want to feel thoroughly cheated, buy this album. Why didn't they edit out the screaming girls?? This live concert album couldn't appeal to anyone except those who attended the concert and want a memory of the event. Bruel sings his most popular songs, which are indeed lovely, but he's frequently drowned out by his screaming fans, who sound like a bunch of hysterical high school girls. Don't bother with this one. Collect these songs from other (studio) albums instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Informative!","review":"Keeping it brief, this is a great book with tons of interesting facts about mysteries that are in the Bible.

After realizing that my reservations made me more authentically Native American than it's author, I thought it best to write the review as a living record for my people. While recipes like \\"Cold Omelets with Crab Meat\\" take we back to the days when I would sit around the AGA with tribal members reading the Virgin Islands Daily News. I thought that the recipes only had a hint of the betrayal and blood that is so central to the Cherokee life. While Ms. Warren's \\"Round-up Tear-Drop Stew\\" has subtle tones of irony, it's taste is still bitter.You may wonder as to the authenticity of crab meat in recipes for down-home Cherokee meals.

This 624-page manual complements the romance and idealism of that earlier work with practical information and instruction. Over thirty tribes collaborated in testing, composing, and editing the book's 62 sections, which range from Affinity Groups, Coalition Building, How to Beat Republicans and Mental Health to Sabotaging the Liberals, Squatting, and Wheatpasting. These are illustrated with extensive technical diagrams and first-hand accounts, and prefaced with a thorough discussion of the diverse roles direct action can play in social transformation.

It doesn't go into detail about the houses, and -- most disappointingly -- doesn't provide much information about the designers, their other work, etc. I don't know if it would help someone who's actually planning to build a home. But for a $10 picture book, this one was very much worth it.Every plan is interesting. Many use new ideas I haven't seen before, and believe me, I've looked at a LOT of house plan books. I had to look through this one about four times before I felt like I'd absorbed all the information. And the homes really are small, when a lot of books seem to have very different definitions of \\"small\\" and \\"afforable\\" than I do.

Period.","review":"I really have nothing new to add, only to agree with all of my fellow Bat-fans that nobody has done the Caped Crusader better than Warner Bros. Beautifully animated and masterfully written, we finally get a grim and gritty Batman who doesn't come across as an anti-social, psychotic jerk like he does in today's comics. He's more like he was during the comics of the '70's, still grim and gritty, but showing some humanity and compassion as well. I recommend all 3 volumes of the DVDs. Now if only we could persuade Warner Bros. to put out ALL of the Justice League episodes on DVD box sets,as well as the rest of the Batman series (The Adventures of Batman & Robin, Batman Beyond),I would be a happy man. And more Superman The Animated Series wouldn't hurt, either. Bring 'em on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome collection","review":"Really awesome collection! Only downfall is, that they probably played football with it during shipping, so the nice US version paper cover didn't resisted much and the corners of the box and inside paper case are badly damaged and as a result, I have trouble to pull it out. Also one error is, that the first DVD in the set is somewhat badly encoded and picture is not sharp, but the lines are blurry. This problem isn't presented on other discs....I love it for the viewing purposes, but as it came this bad and one disc is faulty, I give only two stars.Guys who will steal this for free by download, will get the same thing sans faulty physical thing, which they are forced to look at.Well, Sure I can make a reclamation, but it's painfull process, as I'm living in Europe.When I was buying stuff on Canadian Amazon, the stuff was brought right before my door by DHL courier in next two days (From Canada to Czech republic!!!!).

Kevin Conroy was as course epic as Batman, menace of the night. Bane's sounded a little young, but I suppose that was to show how juvenile he was.

Several episodes (although not as many as the previous two collections) feature commentaries, and one has a rather superfluous and distracting \\"video commentary\\".

The historiography is superb (he obviously is totally bilingual and is fluent in Japanese sources). The history is both descriptive (chronological, social, political, economic, family/personal) as well as analytic (how social structure affected the rise of industrial society, for example). The overall effect is to make Japanese history clear and comprehensible. The people of Japan stand out in distinct relief.I was puzzled that the Boston Globe reviewer was much cooler toward this book than I think most readers are or will be. McClain's history will stand the test of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you plan on doing more than a little cutting, get a lubricated cutter.","review":"This would be good for someone who only needs this for a one time use and wants something cheap. If you plan on using it for more than just a little, do yourself a favor and upgrade to a cutter that has an oil reservoir and a more comfortable grip. They make them in a \\"pistol grip\\" style or a straight style. I prefer the straight style which has a fatter grip area. But even then I still wrap mine with electrical tape so that it contours my hand better.This type of cutter will work, but your cut probably won't be as clean and your hand is going to really hurt after awhile because it isn't very ergonomic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genesis in their prime","review":"Everyone talks about Peter Gabriel and how he has such a wonderful voice and a talent for really good lyrics. While I agree, I have to admit I mostly like Nursery Cryme for all the instrumental bits and pieces that appear throughout the album. Whether it's the mellotron-dominated finale on \\"Return of the Giant Hogweed\\" (which reminds me of a dark shadow creeping over planet Earth- YIKES what a scary song) or the short organ solo appearing somewhere around the halfway point of \\"Fountain of Salmacis\\", these are mainly the things I play the album for.Don't get me wrong, the vocal melodies are great, and the fairy tale-like atmosphere of the entire album is great as well, but let's not forget Genesis was capable of some very good instrumental sections too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A typical Peter Gabriel brain storm","review":"When reading the jibberish added to the \\"Lamb lies down on Broadway\\" album, one learns how incredible is the imagination of Peter Gabriel. He wrote not only the jibberish of that album but its extensive lyrics likewise. Peter Gabriel is very similar to Frank Zappa and his imagination really takes off in \\"Nursery Crime\\". In \\"The Return of the Giant Hogweed\\", one learns how the British Royal Family garden is attacked by a terrible weed imported from Russia. This song is a hidden jewel and one has to wonder why these fellows put such effort and complexity into it. One day people will fully appreciate the special time which was the early seventies. This time produced a huge amount of music which was both creative and very high quality. Genesis and its production of \\"Nursery Cryme\\" commemorates this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not completely fulfilling","review":"This album, like any of the other Genesis albums from the 70s, is great. Songs like \\"The Musical Box\\", \\"...Hogweed\\", and \\"The Fountain...\\" are Genesis classics. But here's the only problem:You listen to the first three songs, completely amazed after the Hogweed's ending. Then the next three songs pass; they're OK. All of a sudden, The Fountain is on, and once that ends, the album is over! Don't get me wrong; it doesn't matter that the album is just under 40 minutes long. I loved \\"Trespass\\", and that album was pretty short. However, the difference between \\"Trespass\\" and \\"Nursery Cryme\\" is the fact that all six songs on \\"Trespass\\" were long and beautiful. Only three of the songs on NC are similar to all six Trespass songs, and only Musical Box matches the beauty to any of the six Trespass songs.In conclusion: this album, albeit not the best Genesis album, is still great. I would recommend it to any prog fan who doesn't have it yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peter Gabriel","review":"This is not Foxtrot. Selling England by the Pound or the Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, I am a Gabriel fan not Genesis. Gabriel with Genesis created some of his most remarkable material vocal range wise. There are inklings of that on Nursery Cryme especially with Musical Box but not much. The album is interesting in showcasing the inadeqaucies of Genesis even with Peter Gabriel. The Genesis Live cd with Gabriel is much better but this one has interest to those music historians interested in progression of artists. It is amazing that the phenomenal Foxtrot followed this sophormoric work and then the masterpiece Selling England BY the Pound followed by an underwritten classic The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway. A dj friend of mine used to assert that Lamb was probably the first issuing in of the punk rock era as we knew it.

The troops were greatly disappointed when he eventually moved on to higher command. Under his impetuous leadership the Brigade gained respect for the Union Cavalry and its' famous red ties, emulating Custer, were a badge of pride and honor. Books by members of the Michigan brigade make it clear that the youthful Custer was greatly respected by his troops. The book is a useful tome describing the times and experiences of this unit. Like most Civil War books it bypasses the hardships, disease and despondency of the troops in favor of describing the battle related history. The book is worthwhile reading for students of the war, cavalry and Custer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michigan Calvary","review":"I really enjoyed this book, the book is not so much about Custer, but his calvary.

ToT was a great band, but they're going too far into another direction that will not yield good results. The same techno thing happened to Danzig and Paradise Lost. The strained relationship between the members of ToT and Liv Kristine were obvious in the last few albums. She definitely was not feeling their new music as she's a devout metalhead. If you like old ToT, buy Liv's Leaves' Eyes album.Getting back to Closure, the Aegis songs are great. The techno songs don't fit at all. I was like, \\"WTF?\\" And I'm open to that stuff. Der Tanz wasn't so great because they played the version that doesn't rock as much.Overall, this was a bland live album and I'll be reselling it most likely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Really About NLP","review":"Chapters 1-4 seem to be restating a few basics of NLP in an unneccesarily complex and pointless sort of way.

These are all fine topics, but they're not really what I paid for nor are they addressed from an NLP perspective.Basically, this book is unnecessarily complex and does a poor job of elucidating the finer points of NLP Modeling. I assumed it would expand on the basics of NLP and delve into the specifics of Modeling, but it doesn't. And to add insult to injury this book cost me $30.. and it's a paperback!

A great read for those who are may have encountered a Jehovah's Witness for the first time or are unfaimliar with the religion, as it offers a brief history of the organization,and analyzes many of their doctrines. As you may have noticed, all the negative reveiws of this book offer no real supporting evidence for their claims of the book being \\"distorted, inaccurate regurgitations of half truths\\".

From what I know as a former Jehovah's Witness, a true Jehovah's Witness cannot read books like this one because the group considers this type of book as \\"apostate material\\" that is unfit for a true Christian to read. Any Jehovah's Witness that did read the book is actually going against the church and could be severely punished for doing so.My point is, do not make any judgements on this book without actually reading it first and try to look at it with an 'unbaised' attitude. If a person cannot seperate their strong feelings one way or the other toward the group, I do not believe they are able to give a 'unbiased' opinion on how beneficial or non-beneficial this book really is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good summary","review":"Touches on the key points all should know about the JWs.

This is more of, like the title says, a book of facts as opposed to a book of experiences by folks who've been involved with the Witnesses. This is clinical, like a textbook, but the information is factual based on what I remember being taught as a young Witness. This is somewhat of an expose, a taking to task, a calling out on the mistakes, turnarounds, and inconsistencies within the organization.

As if that weren't bad enough, the loudest volume setting and the mute setting are adjacent settings. In other words, pressing the ringer volume key one time takes you from loudest volume to mute.

That is all I have to say. WOW! This movie was the best! Kevin Smith has outdone himself this time. He borrowed from the best and improved on the bad.

SB only talks like twice in the whole movie but as always, he shows his underlying intelligence. And J? Well, we ALL thought it was about time for him to get some, so why not let it be Shannon Elizabeth? Oh, and if you have seen the movie already, this next line was indeed long awaited and I'm glad that Kevin convinced Mark Hamill to say it: \\"Don't fluck with the Jedi Master!\\" :) So in conclusion, Rock on, Kevin Smith!

The only complaint I have about this disc is that the intro's to the deleted scenes go on for waaaaay too long.

Naturally, it loses a bit of its comic impact on the small screen. But the bonus goodies that come with this 2-disc set more than make up for that shortcoming.

I missed this latest film of Kevin's at theaters, and couldn't wait for the dvd release...I bought it right away, without any preview or rental. Such is my faith in Smith's ability to entertain. And I always found Jay and Silent Bob priceless. I couldn't believe what I saw. The movie let me down. It seemed like a two-hour inside joke that I wasn't in on. I kept on trying to look for some redeeming joke or humor in the film, but as the credits rolled I was at a loss. There are some funny moments---Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and Jason Lee goofing off. But that just didn't justify a purchase at all. For fans I'd have to say it's a periodic rental at best. If you aren't a fan, don't even think about seeing this film.

All the premises were right on; I don't think the actors were all \\"on\\" however. It must have just looked a lot better on paper, than it came out on film.I didn't have any problem with the vulgarity; except maybe it was a tad excessive, and gratuitous..I just didn't laugh through this whole movie.

However I did not give it 5 stars because at times the humor is down right corny (ex: the girls robing the jewels and trying to avoid the beems)...lude conduct, Obscene language, strong sexual content, and probably one of the foulest comedies you can watch, what more could you ask for? Great beer movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where is Mewes","review":"I loved this movie from the opening song till, I forget how it ends. I guess I shouldn't try to copy the two stoners. But my real reason for the review is to ask if anyone knows anything about Jason Mewes. I know he's addicted to heroine and wondered if anyone knows or knows of his present status. Is he alive or in jail. He isn't in any new movies and even though the new Kevin Smith flick isn't out yet, I figured he'd be in some stoner movies. If anyone knows about him just respond on the JSBSB reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"An EXTREMELY disgusting display of garbage","review":"This is by far the WORST movie I have ever seen, totally topping supertroopers. It doesn't have a real plot, and is just an excuse to corrupt the youth of America with vulgar obscenities, total sexual displays and language, and promotion of drug use. How this movie ever made it to theatres I will never know. Absolutely a waste of time, lucky for me the store I bought it from refunded me since I was so disgusted with it. If you have any morals or sense of a good movie of any kind, stay away from this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"When I was eleven or twelve I thought being offensive and swearing as much as possible just for the sake of being offensive and swearing was funny. Other than the first scene where the words used are funny because of the situation the movie has no more than a brief chuckle or two. The very over-rated Kevin Smith must have aimed this at twelve-year-olds even with the R rating, so if you are out of your adolescence don't waste your time. On the other hand, if you are over eighteen and have a twelve-year-old mentality, enjoy! Kevin Smith made this for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Two Hours of Your Life and Don't Watch This Movie","review":"Don't get me wrong, I think Kevin Smith has genius, but this movie doesn't touch it. This movie is perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen. What was Smith out to do with this film? He wanted to see how many pot-smoking idiots(with all due respect to those who smoke pot) would shell out hard cash to see a movie in which every bad aspect of every other bad comedy was included. Is there anything good about this movie? Not much. Silent Bob(Smith) is the only character who is in the least bit interesting (besides the HOT female characters). The cameos have potential, but miss the mark. The rude humor isn't the least bit humerous, and the protagonist (Jay) is too stupid to exist. If you're looking for a humerous satire on Hollywood, this isn't it. If you want to see Kevin Smith's genius, see Dogma, Chasing Amy, Mallrats, or Clerks. If you want to kill braincells stay home and smoke pot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smith fails miserably","review":"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is one of those movies that would have been funny when I was in 5th grade. It is loaded with profanity and graphic sexual humor, but not a witty or funny line is to be heard. It's just all gay jokes that I've heard before, and mediocre potty humor that just doesn't work. The main reason this isn't as funny or fresh as Clerks is that since that movie, profanity-laden scenes have become quite normal in movies. And I can only hear the f-word so many times before I just lose interest. Lastly, Kevin Smith doesn't have a visual sense or any sort of visual style, so there isn't much to recommend if anything at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Jungle love","review":"This movie is just straight out funny.Jay:Just your average stoner who hung out in front of a store with his friend Silent Bob. When they go to a comic store, and find out that they are being put into movies, they want their check, but when they find out, people think there just freakind dumb, stoners, then they try to stop the inevetable, prevent the movie from being made.Silent Bob:He doesn't talk much, but he's Jay's best friend. He agrees on everything Jay does, and he goes with Jay to stop the movie, so he wont be called him names, for the rest of his life, as well as Jay.Right when the movie started, it was just flat out funny. I memorised the whole song easily. But just like a lot of comedy movies I see, it got weak near the ending. Just when it was blazing with comedy, it just ran out of gas. But if you love comedy, and are looking for something worthwhile, I don't need to say anything, pick this up.peace"},{"rating":"1","title":"Always Raunchy, Often Disgusting, Rarely Funny","review":"And definitely not worth buying.

I had an *indecent* amount of fun watching the movie, more than I ever expected to. It's stupid, it's silly, it's rude, it's socially unacceptable. As long as you know that and can - even for just 2 hours - suspend any lingering amounts of prudeness in your soul, you should find some memorable humor in the movie. I have a lot of friends who consider me too boring and prudish (yet also liberal, as I have a large number of gay friends) who would be shocked to know that I loved this movie.And somehow, that makes me happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A loving tribute for two wackjobs","review":"Kevin Smith writes and directs a fast paced and hilarious send off to his two beloved and disturbed characters.

If you don't know Kevin Smith's other works then this movie will be seem to be a lame joke-a-thon. This was definitely Kevin's lightest of all his movies. It was obvious he was just having some fun, and if you are a TRUE fan, you will get the inside jokes, and would have seen it in the theatre. Jay and SB are on a trip to stop a bad movie of themselves from getting made, hince \\"Stike back\\" itself is a \\"bad movie\\" of themselves that was made. See Kevin's other movies first, twice, then go to his website- then see the movie. It's definitely a lot of good friends that made a movie. Kind of like a card \\"From all of us\\" to \\"All of you\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh...","review":"I feel like Kevin Smith said to the world: 'Okay, folks, you wanted a movie entirely about Jay and Bob? Even though it couldn't possibly be as funny as you seem to think? Well, here you go.' And in the meantime, he also decided to make fun of the studio execs who no doubt were also pushing him to make a movie that was sure to pull in millions at the box-office. And based on what? Name recognition and cameos. So I suppose if you want to see all the old characters from the other Smith movies thrown together, saying the same things they did in the other movies, go for it. I suppose, to be fair, it's hard to top a movie like 'Dogma.' That movie may have had its share of cameos, but at least Jay and Bob were funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"stale jokes, self-serving acting","review":"Jay and Silent Bob is an exercise in how to be unfunny, lewd, and offend everyone's intelligence.Why anyone enjoys this movie is beyond me.

If you're waxing nostalgic, thinking that perhaps Kevin Smith has regained something from his Clerks/Mallrat days, you'll be sorely disappointed.The thing I loved about Kevin Smith was that he had intelligent humor. He was funny. He was witty. And the cast complemented his vision. Even though he wrote what some people would refer to as \\"trash\\", he wrote it well and made me laugh.I did not experience any moments during this movie that made me laugh out loud. There were times I chuckled to myself, but overall this whole movie was a disappointment. Kevin Smith is relying more on shock value, controversy accompanied by publicity to make people see his movies. this is one person who will never see another movie he makes. buh bye."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obnoxious movie","review":"I guess being older somewhat dulls the senses to what is hip or not, but I found the film bad. Vulgar is sometimes vulgar and this movie is. I was embarrassed to be in the room with teenage girls watching this, because it didn't deliver enough laughs or have a clever enough premise to cover the foul language.I think the voting on this is the \\"emperor's new clothes\\" syndrome. It just isn't cool to be contrary to the new hip talent...It is also a lame attempt at counter-culture quasi-intellectualism. Who the heck cares if these people are really intelligent or not?

You start wishing that the cameo players would stick around and that Jay and Silent Bob would disappear.I am glad to hear that Smith is closing the book on this world of characters.\\"Die-hard fans\\" (I guess I'm not one of them) should love the two-disc set. It's loaded with deleted scenes, a couple music videos, etc. There's a funny bit where Morris Day is teaching Smith to dance.

It seemed every couple of minutes there was something about how this guy wants to have sex with this other guy but doesn't want to admit it.

Without a framework to hang the jokes on, he has to invent plot contrivances rather than letting the story unfold, and only about a third of the movie really succeeds.On the plus side, the DVD release is primo, with a wealth of additional material to complement the superb audio/video film presentation.

I believe it is missing the scintillating dialogue of Clerks and Chasing Amy. Somehow, despite the familiar characters, I think this movie bears more in common with American Pie and Porky's than it does with Kevin Smith's earlier works. Coarse humour wins out over witty bon mots, but that only makes sense considering the protagonists!The film plays with all sorts of stereotypes, and features actors as themselves, rather like a lowbrow Being John Malkovich. Watch as Kevin Smith mocks elitist director/actor behaviour. Gaze in awe as Hollywood legends are brought to their knees (for naughty behaviour, to boot). Gasp at all the poop jokes.The humour may generally be pretty dumb, but there are enough zingers to keep you from grimacing too much.

First of all, let me reccomend that you watch (OR BUY!) all of J and SR's other flicks such as: Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, and Dogma because of all the inside jokes.From the very start of the movie you know you're in for a wild ride of gross-out crude humor that will keep you laughing 'till the end.

But this is certainly the worst recent comedy that has so many snobbish defenders.I've really tried to give Kevin Smith's films a chance (I've seen four of his \\"trilogy\\"), but they've all been awful. Bad direction, amateur acting, smug-but-shallow dialogue. The one I haven't seen is MALLRATS and I've heard from Smith fans it's the worst, which is frightening to consider. All of this could be overlooked if there was anything funny. There's a recent trend in \\"comedies\\" that if another film is referred to, then it's funny. The SCARY MOVIE guys have beat that to a bloody mess. But to simply just reference other movies isn't funny--it just makes me wish I was watching the other movie!As characters, Jay & Silent Bob have about as much range and depth as Pauly Shore. And will probably share a similar shelf-life...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jason Mewes is the funniest thing about this movie...","review":"I wanted to like this movie a whole lot more than I did. The humor just does not match up to Dogma or even Mallrats. Jason Mewes surprisingly had the talent to pull off leading star status. I definitely look forward to seeing him in future movies. My recommendation is to rent the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jay and Silent Bob Stirke Back","review":"Watched it and quite frankly I did not understand what this movie was about. I gave this DVD away to a family member and they stated they did not understand also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny yet sad ending to the escapades of Jay and Bob","review":"A great way to end the saga that started with Clerks. Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back has the most jokes of any of the other Smith films. It also brings back many of the funny parts of the other films, through cameos of past characters and lines that have been used about such topics as \\"chocolate covered pretzels.\\" I would definitely reccomend seeing some of the other Smith films, Chasing Amy, Mallrats, etc., before checking out Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back since it will make your viewing of Jay and Silent Bob that much funnier.Needless to say this movie is a must for anyone that has at least one other Smith film on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter ...","review":"Saw Dogma (which was funny), this isn't. There is no plot, the whole exercise is just an excuse for swearing and various other obscence dialogue. The film should never have made it past first draft of the script. If this is what the youth of America are watching and actaully enjoying heaven help you all!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Don't buy this Dimension Collector's Series version. The box delivered was the right box, but had the wrong DVD inside. There were no special features on the disc, just the movie and a commentary track. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect topper to Kevin Smith's 5th movie","review":"You must see the previous four Kevin Smith Movies to completely enjoy this comedic masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much of a good thing...","review":"I loved the other four movies and was looking forward to this one a lot. Was there really that much swearing in the other four or am I just getting old? Jay and Silent Bob were my favorite characters in the other movies, but give them the title roles and I thought they lost their appeal. I didn't think they were as funny for 2 hours straight as they were in small doses. I still love the other four movies, (Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, and Dogma) so check them out even if you didn't care much for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"a lot of fun..","review":"Kevin Smith has always been a great director.You should go see this movie because it's a lot of fun. It was like a big reunion. It was the kind of movie where everyone would fly out for one day to be a part of it.It was really fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Go Wrong With Kevin Smith!","review":"Another brilliant work by Kevin Smith. However, there is one aspect to this movie to be aware of...the more of the other movies you've seen in the series (Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, the funnier this movie gets. There are millions of tie-ins to this \\"Jersey\\" story that exists in some part in every movie. Also included on this DVD are a TON of deleted scenes, great commentary, and even a couple music videos. This is a must have for Kevin Smith fans and for those who have no idea who Kevin Smith is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, Just Awful","review":"\\"Mallrats\\" is better than this. \\"Mallrats\\" had characters, at least. \\"Jay And Slient Bob\\" doesn't have characters; it's a stream of profanity and hit-n-miss jokes with a bunch of cameos from previous Smith movie characters and acting alumni. You start wishing that the cameo players would stick around and that Jay and Silent Bob would disappear.I am glad to hear that Smith is closing the book on this world of characters.\\"Die-hard fans\\" (I guess I'm not one of them) should love the two-disc set. It's loaded with deleted scenes, a couple music videos, etc. There's a funny bit where Morris Day is teaching Smith how to dance. I haven't gotten through all the extras yet, but a film of this quality doesn't deserve this kind of treatment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kevin smith has lost all his charm","review":"Kevin Smith's four previous films were awesome I enjoyed all them and I own all of them, however I was horribly dissaponted by this movie for several reasons. The movie consints of stupid one liners, lame visuals, several teeny bopping guest stars, and this movie went over the top with crude language that it just insults the viewers intelligence. Some good points of the film were the performances of will ferral and chris rock which were the only parts of the movie that I thought were actually funny. Unless you are between the ages of 12-14 or a hard core stoner avoid this flick and pick up one of kevin smith's other movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like fart jokes, sex jokes and overuse of the f-word","review":"Watching this, I was reminded of all the crazy movies I loved as a kid - classic laughfests of the like of \\"Strange Brew\\" and \\"Still Smokin'.\\" This is the same sort of gross humor, pothead sillyness except it at times goes a little over the top. Of course, maybe I think that because now I'm 34 and not 12. I do have to give Kevin Smith thumbs up for the use of his \\"friends\\" and the Ben and Matt scene in \\"Good Will Hunting 2\\" is one for the ages. If you like fart jokes, sex jokes, overuse of the f-word and otherwise just pointless humor, then you'll love this. Everyone else - consider yourself warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unappriciated Cult-Movie!","review":"Jay and Silent Bob are the best Comical pair since Wayne and Garth from \\"Wayne's World\\" and just like them, will enter the comedy's hall of fame. This movie is incredibly funny, and I believe will be learned in social studies as the representer of an era. I also believe that it'll be a must-watch classic for every self-respecting teenager. Right on Kevin Smith!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For Kevin Smith Fans","review":"I really liked the movie. Lots of self referential gags make it a must to have seen the other Kevin Smith movies. This is a sort of formula road picture with a couple of characters I have really grown to love. This is in the same class as movies like Strange Brew which take familiar characters and give them a simple plot line to follow. No great surprises but surprisingly witty in parts. This is a straight low brow comedy with none of the controversy of Dogma. If you are looking for the somewhat awkward but brilliant dialogue from some of Kevin Smiths other films you may be disappointed, but as a straight buddy road movie it delivers all the laughs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for big fans (and still a disappointment)","review":"I didn't see this in the theater, but I bought it the other day (so that explains it). The story is pretty weak, but the jokes spread throughout are pretty good.....I guess. The Will Ferrell stuff is worth it, but the movie didn't need to be made. I think that when a director gets to this point, they should just implant some sh#t like in Total Recall, as if you had seen the movie. Money was wasted and cameos are stupid. PS: The stuff with Kevin Smith's wife stuff is grandstanding and stupid. He just talks about getting laid and how now that he's married...etc. Who cares?"},{"rating":"2","title":"George Lucas is gonna sue somebody!!!","review":"OK the Film isn't out yet, but i still wanna buy the DVD. I've seen the internet trailers, got most of the jokes. Even thought Carrie Fisher as a Nun and Mark Hamil as a bad guy was kinda cool. And seeing all the old faces from previous Kevin Smith films. Plus seeing Dante Hicks and Randal Graves again brought back memories of Clerks. Looking forwards to what i hope will be a great film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, Kevin Smith just runs everything into the ground...","review":"Yeah, this movie sucks. It's not that funny, the acting sucks, and Ben Affleck is in it, bla bla bla. That's not important. What's important is that Kevin Smith HAD a reputation with Clerks. Clerks is, and still is, a great movie with some brilliant characters and makes me still laugh after each viewing.But that's the only thing he's ever done.Seriously, every movie has been tied to that movie. Mallrats sucked because it was just Clerks in a mall, Chasing Amy sucked because it was a romantic version of Clerks, and Dogma had most of the cast and charecters from Clerks in it. And now, there's a whole movie about two charcters who spent, I don't know, 10 MINUTES IN CLERKS. The guy can't do anything else except that one movie. So, this is basically yet another rewrite of his first movie. Aside from the George Carlin bit, this isn't good. AT ALL. Avoid if you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who made this?","review":"Charles Chaplin said that make a person laugh, was thew most difficult thing to do in the world, he was right. From the first minute to the last one this movie isn't funny, the acting it's awful, people trying to make people laugh. No plot, bad dialogues and two pathetic guys. Who wrote this trash? This is a ood example of how movies are right now. Don't waste time with this thing and buy a better one."},{"rating":"1","title":"White trash video equivalent of 2 live crew","review":"I did not sit through this movie. I fthe numer of times you hear the f-word is correlative to your enjoying the movie, then get your high-school drop-out firends and watch this tripe.Other points are George Carlin giving head to a truck driver for a ride: sex with clergy etc. It tells you something when the production company hides its name from a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say terrible?","review":"This movie really belongs 0 stars....it wasnt funny at all. Jay is a complete jackass."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an awful movie","review":"i enjoyed clerks, chasing amy and dogma. given how good these movies were, i must say that this movie was the worst movie i've seen in years. i would suggest that you wait until these guys put out another movie, if anyone hires them to do one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrific!!!!!","review":"This movie has got to be the worst movie of all time. It is nothing but downright offensive. When I watch this movie, I realize what is wrong with our world. It is full of nothing but the \\"f\\" world and back to back toilet humor. Anyone who finds this movie amusing should have his/her head examined!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Raunchy fun","review":"I got this DVD early, using my super-secret connections (the \\"CD Warehouse\\" in crossroads mall), and let me tell you, it's damn-good! The film explores the subjects of the internet and the film industly, but the extras are also very good. The deleated scenes are actually funny, as is the commentaty about them.I don't know how Kevin Smith does it, but I liked EVERYONE in the cast, even people who I usually hate (Jason Biggs and James Van Der Beek, to name a few). Well, basicaly, talk about going out with style. The only problem is the apperance of non-stop gay jokes, that would kind of negate \\"Chasing Amy,\\" were it not for a brief doilogue between Biggs and Van Der Beek about homophobia."},{"rating":"2","title":"that's punk rock","review":"I love every thing about Kevin Smith's movies. I also love Jason Mewes. He is very funny and sexy. I really hope to see more of Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes in the theaters. You two have always cracked me up. Now THAT'S PUNK ROCK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The funniest movie i've ever seen!","review":"Jay and Silent Bob rock!I could'nt stop laughing at their sick and twisted humor.I also like the fact that the two finally left New Jersey for a change and went to wreak havoc in Hollywood.It had an excellent storyline,and tied in closely with Kevin Smith's other films,including reprising cast members Ben Affleck and Jason Lee.This movie is the best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmm....","review":"I don't know....Al of the Kevin SMith movies are sooo good. I don't know what happened with this one. Sure it's got it's laughs. but I just think it's way to commercial. Something is just lacking with this film. Like he tried to do too much. I will still buy the DVD because i love Kevin Smith movies but this one is the weakest in the series... But It's only one opinion..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that funny","review":"I think that they tried too hard to be funny and ended up just being stupid.They could have done a lot better of a job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting--not Funny","review":"I love comedies, and I can handle a bit of vulgarity. This movie was nothing but vulgar. It was constantly, \\"Suck this..., [horrible launguage]this, repetitive swearing, and extremely vulgar sexual jokes. I saw it in the theater and of the 30 or so people there, I didn't hear much laughing from anyone. This included kids, teenagers, and adults. True, there are a few good humurous parts, but nothing is worth sitting through this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stale and Uninspired","review":"Two hours of self-referential humor, (\\"Oohhh, lookie! We looking at the audience again! Whoo, we so funny!\\"), and jokes stale enough to make the writers of \\"Family Matters\\" cringe. That about sums it up. If you're a fan of Smith's other movies, you'll probably eat it up, because he recycles jokes from all his other movies. I didn't hate it, but it sure seemed like a big ol' waste of money. I was glad to see Jason Mewes actually ACTING for a change - and doing a half-decent job at it, too. Otherwise I was checking my watch all throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"funniest movie ever","review":"Woohoo, i can't stop laughing from this movie. If saying the F-word every 5 seconds for no f***ing reason wasnt funny enough, all those 'jokes' concerning homosexuality (youre doing it all wrong *shudder*) have got to make you laugh. The funniest part of the movie was when the only people other than my group of friends walked out of the theater before it was even half over. BEST MOVIE EVER! Take notes from this movie, movie directors, because it was funny as hell...... Kevin Smith seriously stunk in this movie ... i want to kick his @$$, but he will probably come over and kill me like in the movie. Oh wait, did i accidently tell about one of the only funny parts in the movie? well now you dont have an excuse to watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be very careful with cats!!","review":"I applied this product only ONCE a week for two weeks on my cats lower back. This product worked very well in stopping my cat from chewing, licking and pulling his hair out. Unfortunatly my cat age 14 in perfect health except this issue had a severe reaction to Synergy Dr. Golds Itch Relief. He stopped eating, drinking and in one week lost an alarming amount of weight. I rushed him to the vet and he was given IV fluids and antibiotics. The inside of his mouth was red and inflamed. My vet said he obviously had a reaction to the product which I brought with me. I now take my cat to the vet once every 3 months to recieve an allergy shot. My cat is now back to his old self. The product worked, BUT BEWARE the results.

The songs are kind of limp-wristed and sissified. Not exactly \\"manly\\" music. In fact, it sounds like it was recorded by a bunch of 11-year-olds boys in a basement somewhere in Idaho.

Although the anime is appealling to a younger set, the plotline is complex enough to satisfy older audiences and wonderfully thorough in tying up loose ends. The characters are easy to get into and grow attached to. Again, I would highly recommend this to any fan of light hearted, comedic anime. It's one that you can watch over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stock but...","review":"This stock is well made and light weight. However there are a couple of things that I should mention that hopefully will be a help to others. They are: 1. The stock is not adjustable it is one size fits all and if you have a short reach like myself it makes the stock a little uncomfortable. 2. I had to carve out the grip slightly to fit snuggly against the trigger guard. 3. The stock should have some shoulder padding to suppress some recoil. If you were to do a lot of shooting one afternoon you would likely be very sore that evening. Well there you have it. In conclusion i found this stock to be well worth what i paid, but with a few simple modifications it could well be the best folding stock ever made.

The detective himself, an American in a British organization, seems like a fish out of water. More character development, beyond making him a blunt man who says ain't and seldom sleeps, would have helped. (Perhaps this is the way British authors see us.)

Excellent guitar riffs and solos by the Young boys and Bon Scott gives a superb vocal performance. Let There Be Rock, Problem Child and Hell Aint A Bad Place To Be are decent tunes as well.

Granted, \\"Whole Lotta Rosie,\\" \\"Hell Ain't A Bad Place To Be\\" and the title track get better treatment on their in-concert \\"If You Want Blood...\\" of a few years later, but there isn't a let-up to be found on this set.

While slightly more metallic, AC/DC's sound was still bluesier than it would be by the time of the band's commercial breakthrough. Appealing in spite of himself, Bon Scott delivers his leering double entendres and humorous asides with typical panache, while the Young brothers' guitars bite, kick, and scratch behind him. While the music still meanders on occasion, the songwriting is overall a bit more memorable; AC/DC classics on hand include \\"Problem Child,\\" \\"Whole Lotta Rosie,\\" and \\"Bad Boy Boogie.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have","review":"This one is my favourite AC/DC album yet so far (Haven't heard High Voltage or Highway To Hell though).It's pure rock'n roll from beginning to end with an energy and raw power that is hard to resist. The title track is the best on the album and probably their best song ever, featuring killer solos by Angus Young and a good fast tempo which I love. In fact there are no bad songs on this album but tracks that standout(besides the title track) are \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\", \\"Bad Boy Boogie\\" and \\"Dog Eat Dog\\".This is a must have for fans of early AC/DC and rock'n'roll in general, and you will surely headbang or play air-guitar at least a couple of times."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album kicks-@ss big time.","review":"One of my all time favorite, raw, driving, hard and heavy rock'n'roll albums.

They cutoff the reprise at the end of Problem Child. BLASPHEMY!!! Get the re-issue, it was remastered much better...warmer, all around better balanced mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"They don't make 'em like they used to!!!","review":"This album can really rock the house. Bon's screeching vocals and Angus' screeching riffs will make your ears bleed, but as Martha Stewart always says 'That's a good thing'. Probably one of the weaker Ac/Dc albums of the 70's but it's still a great look back to when rock ruled the air waves and a time when people would have laughed at names like P. Diddy. Buy it if you like Ac/Dc. If you don't... why are you even reading this. Best songs are Let There Be Rock and Whole Lotta Rosie, but the song Overdose shows why Angus have had a guitar playing duel with Jimi Hendrix."},{"rating":"2","title":"cranks","review":"THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST CD\`S AC/DC EVER PUT OUT.THIS IS A VERY HARD DRIVIN CD THAT MAKES THE NEW AC/DC LOOK BAD.BON SCOTT IN HIS GLORY DAYS WAS FAR BETTER THAN BRAIN JOHNSON.THERE IS NOT A BAD SONG ON THIS,AND THIS HAS SOME GREAT SOLO\`S BY ANGUS YOUNG.CLASSIC LET THERE BE ROCK AND WHOLE LOTTA ROSIE ARE ON THIS.THIS IS A MUST FOR ANY FAN OF HARD DRIVING MUSIC OF THE LATE 70\`S."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a Problem Child (and my mother hates me)..........","review":"To put it simply, this album is a great example of what real rock and roll is really about.

Bon was every bit the rock and rebel lead singer that he should be remembered for, and the Young brothers proved once again why the are the best lead/rhythm guitar duo - period.

The authors wrote the entire book in a style that makes Elizabethan English easy to understand (and I don't mean Elizabeth II!)

It is a shame since the overall structure of the book seems sound. This book is like driving a luxury car painted in a garish color. My advice is to read something else (like Clayson's \\"The Richest Man in Babylon\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"The style makes it Impossible to read this book.","review":"This book is tedious to read due to its Shakespearean style.

On the giddy, exhiliarating opening track, \\"Na Magueira,\\" singer Lilian Vieira bursts forth with an incandescent homage to the sprightly jazzy rhythm style of '60s samba-soul diva Elza Soares -- Vieira's version being draped in a contemporary techno-tinged sound mix... The band's roots in Europhilic dance music come back to the fore in a few of the house-ier tracks, but their explorations of African pop (on \\"Duele Le Le\\") and cameos by dub reggae legend Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry make this disc their richest, most resonant album to date.

There is no other reason for this CD seeing the light of day other than this fact.

This is based off a true story and because of that the movie became so much more real.The movie is rated PG, to be honest the language was harsh for a PG. The movie was a great football movie and got a little political but enough to prove the point of what was happening with racial tension during the day. It did not get into the politics of the issue and I thought that was great. Dennis Quaid played a great role as coach in the movie too. It is well worth the time spent watching!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"This movie is great and I highly recommend it.

The movie is a period film and not a documentary--such that its facts are altered to provide the viewer with a sense of the times---with discrimination the issue of the day. The EXPRESS will become a classic over time...much as did Brian's Song, Rudi, and the Rockne Story staring Ron Reagan. This is a captivating story of its time--the late 50's. Syracuse University was a leader in American sports integration as was their Hall of Fame and legendary Coach, Ben Schwartwalder--recrutiing Jim Brown, Ernie Davis, Floyd Little, and many other athletes of diverse backgrounds. The EXPRESS is a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected...!!","review":"As a true Susan Branch fan with every book, calendar, address book, etc she's ever published, I am so dissapointed with this new calendar.

You have to search for the cursor - too small. Get the puzzle 98% completed and discover an error and you have to \\"undo\\" every move you've made since you used that number. The game should have a \\"delete\\" button in lieu of \\"undo\\" so you can simply place the cursor over the number you need to change. Save your money - these Sudoku electronic games are not large enough or developed enough to enjoy. I'm sure changes will be made after enough bad reviews but for now - forget it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DEFINITELY DON'T BUY IT!!!!!","review":"I totally agree with the other reviewer of this game. The numbers are very hard to read, and many sellers show the screen as being backlit with a blue light and having very easy-to-read numbers, so when you buy the game you think you are getting a decent product but are really just getting a piece of junk! Definitely save your money until the game is greatly improved!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No harm done","review":"Well I bought this for my mother-in-law who is hooked on Su Doku. I bought it just as a small token. The price was cheap and I thought why not?Well it is hard to see the screen. It is also a bit impractical in that if you realise that you got a number wrong 20 turns ago, you have to go and delete all the 20 turns you just spent time doing to get to it and amend it.The price was cheap, so I was not expecting anything fancy but to be honest I was disappointed with it.When I realise that I have gotten a number wrong I do not bother trying to find it, I just start a new game. But the fact that is is so hard to see the screen and find the curser is very annoying and in fact no one even bothers using it now. We just print out the sheets from the web and do it the old fashoned way with pen and paper on a clipboard.As I said, no harm done, it was a cheap thing anyhow."},{"rating":"1","title":"su doku","review":"The screen, buttons, and cursor are so small that you have to have very good eyesight and small fingers.

I found the numbers to be rather small and finding where your curser is can be hard at times so I make sure I always leave it off in an empty space. The navigation arrows are a little touchy. You have to be pressing in the right place or sometimes you may think you are going left and the curser is going down.I enjoy having it and use it often but I am almost thinking I would rather have the paper version as this one doesn't allow you to make mistakes. For instance if you have a 6 already in that row and you try to put one somwhere else in that row it won't let you and part of the challenge is making mistakes that messes the whole puzzle up if not caught on time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Micro Su Doku","review":"The cursor is so minute it is difficult to see it.Makes the game unplayable in most suitable environments.Design issue could be fixed easily!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Su Doku+ Hand held","review":"This product is terrible.

I also have low expectations when it comes to alien/sci-fi flicks, however, this one blew my frickin mind how horrible it was. The quality of the movie seemed like it was filmed in someone's basement with an old school 8mm camera. The aliens were terrible and kind of made no sense.I can't stress enough that nobody will like this movie, no one! I'm actually pissed I spent $1.10 at Redbox on this thing!

Just purchased from a long time Amazon seller of the Document Records LTD titles but this is the first time I know of I've received a CD-R. I checked about 10 Document Records releases I had readily at hand and yeah this appears to be the case. I'm really unhappy about this not being disclosed. Someone, the seller or the manufacture is responsible for informing the buyer and this just isn't happening currently. This also just happen to me with Jazz Oracle from a different long time Amazon seller. So it appears to be the trend and definitely a very bad one for the consumer.

It's light duty, but perfect for the cleaning around the yard and washing the car, which is what I wanted it for. Unfortunately, the hose was kinked when I removed it from the box; I was concerned, but apparently not concerned enough. The second day of spraying down the patio, the hose burst in one of those kinks. The store I bought it from doesn't carry replacements hoses, and they aren't on the manufacture's website. Unfortunately, I can't say that I would recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!","review":"Unless you desire to keep both the electric cord and the water source very close by, this will greatly dissappoint you.I tried to wash my car with it, but could get more pressure from my hand nozzle on the hose.Tried to use in other areas, and even with the power nozzle, the pressure was non existent.Save your money and buy a real one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"homeowner","review":"I bought this and was happy enough at first- used 3-4 times to wash a small (20x25 foot) deck and some brick steps.

It still works, but there is a leak in the trigger mechanism that makes the pump cycle on and off whenever you're not spraying. It's messy and aggravating.My father bought a similar unit a few months later, his pump quit after about 6 months of occasional use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recently purchased pressure washer for home projects","review":"It's spring cleaning time, so I bought a Karcher K245 electric pressure washer for $99.00 at my local Lowe's last Friday and used it to clean my pool cover, pool filter, driveway, trashcans, pool ladder and vinyl siding. For being a lightweight, inexpensive, quiet tool, it's very impressive and does what it's supposed to. Don't expect this pressure washer to be as effective or as powerful as a gas-powered model. Gas models start at $189.00 at the stores near me and they are noisy and heavy. This unit can be easily carried and the hoses and tips connect/disconnect easily. Overall, the unit is worth what I paid for it and I'll use it around the house and yard for light cleaning tasks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave","review":"Finally choose the model 245 at Lowe's for $108.00 because it was light and made in Germany. Wanted something I could pack up and take with me in a motor home. Used it today on my large deck to prep it for staining. It worked fine even though the sales people advise to get something larger. True the power cord does like to wrap itself around the hose, but the trade off is, it is so light and portable you can practically drag it around with you. The power was enough to clean between the planks and if not careful you could get down to the bare wood. I wasn't even using the attachment for maxium scoring. It also adjusts down and I plan on washing the car this afternoon with the lower setting. Can't tell how long it will last but talked to someone who has had one, 240 model, for 2 years and still going strong. We shall see."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"I bought and used this unit 3 times. Once on my deck and then second time cleaning my cement sidewalk.

The hose pretty flimsy and will kink very easily. When it does the hose will bust. You can get a replacement for about $50 but I purchased the washer for $100. You can't use a normal replacement hose that you can find at a hardware store because the propriety connection of the hose to the wand (handle) will only fit the Karcher product. To get around this I had to purchase an entire new wand and hose (Heavy duty) for $50. Now I have spent $150 on a $100 unit. I should have done a little more research first, and then sprung $200 for an electric model with a standard hose and wand. I will never purchase this brand again and have talked several people out of buying one due to my issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little washer!","review":"This is great!

Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent washer","review":"I ordered the pressure washer to wash my car and to clean my driveway.

Today when I read about macho men slaughtering beautiful animals for sport it can get to be sickening. But, again, he is an excellent author and the books keep you on the edge of your chair.

These guys were brave and crazy at the same time while being obsessed with hunting in Africa. The author has done a good job of researching the lives of the men in the biographies.

Not only did I get gas mileage so good no one believed me (20 mpg winter, 23 mpg summer)but it didn't cost any more than conventional oils and I never had a problem with my truck. I recently sold my truck to a guy who couldn't wait to get his hands on it and I now run Mobil 1 in my 2008 Ford Ranger 4 cylinder and am getting 40 mpg (OK, 34 mpg with the engine running, 40 mpg by hypermiling)."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's cheaper at Wal-Mart.","review":"I bought this item on Amazon because of the convenience.

So I had to drive two hours away to the closest Best Buy with my brother and my dad to go and get a silly GeForce 1700 Graphic Card for my computer. It took about 30 minutes to take the old card out and stick the new one in. And once I started to play the game, it was a waste of my time and money! I was very disapointed. It was not at all like the first one. The graphics were better, but the gameplay was not the same. I can't remember all of it because it's been so long since I've played it (about two years).

The story is fast paced and has many twists and turns to keep the reader interested. The hero, Frank Balenger, is a great character with the potential to be another Jack Reacher. He's tarnished and broken in many ways, but still the hero of the story and one you can really get behind.The concept is unique, from the perspective that urban exploration is not something discussed either by the news or other avenues. To see this side of life was really interesting. The thought of scouring long abandoned buildings to understand what life was like in the past is really thought provoking. Our history doesn't go back as far as other cultures, thus the need for an urban archeological perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intriguing Premise, Period.","review":"The Paragon Hotel was built a hundred years ago by a wealthy, reclusive madman.

If you enjoy hundreds of pages of mind-numbingly bad TV dialog, this book is for you. As a bonus, the action is predictable and repetitive.Creepers might have generated some suspense if the author had created interesting characters. But he only attempts to develop one of them, the journalist Frank Balenger, with clumsy and implausible results.

He uses \\"seem\\" too much, way too many adverbs, way too many dialog tags.I had no attachment to anything that was going on in the book. I was certain this MUST have been the author's first published novel and was shocked to find out it is his 24th! A more emotionally rewarding way to spend several hours on the coast of New Jersey would be watching a marathon of MTV's Jersey Shore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb and Suspensful","review":"David Morrell's latest thriller is the best piece of writing he's done in years. The prose and pacing are tight as can be, and the action and dialogue propel the story along at a dizzying pace. Even though I'm in the middle of a forced move at work, and am busy coaching both of my kids' baseball teams, I managed to find time (by staying up waaaaaaay past my bedtime) to finish this in 2 days.The novel is well worth your time, and if you can ignore the cartoonish quality of some of the supporting villains, you're going to read one of the best thrillers in years.Morrell is coming out with a sequel to this book, and I'm eager to grab it and read it. I think I feel a sick day coming..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only Morrell could deliver with this formula.","review":"While I don't think it makes the terror of Testament or the characters of say Long Lost. Creepers is a neat experiment with time and pacing. in the end you get a novel of amazing adventure, suspense and character. Morrell is working on a loose sequel. Good news."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will the real author please stand up?","review":"I await every new Morrell with anticipation. While for a change, I did not read this book; but, rather listened to the cd, I found it to be substandard at best.Not only was the story boring but I found it to be totally implausible. I could not identity with a single character. It mattered not at all whether any one of them survived -- usually I find myself totally immersed in at least one of Morrell's charaters.I couln't wait for the book to end. Furhtermore, I did not care at all for the narrator. Sorry, but this was a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read!","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by this novel. I picked it up on a whim having not read David Morrell for years (I thought his novels were becoming boring and predictable). I am so happy I read this one. I was engrossed from the earliest pages. My only complaint was that I found some of his descriptions of the action a bit hard to follow, but that was probably my fault for not being willing to slow down to truly understand them. I just wanted to know what happened next! I would highly recommend this book for anybody looking for 350 pages of just good thrilling entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"omg make it stop","review":"The publisher sent me a copy of this book to review because I run an urban exploration website. I knew the author and hoped for the best - but got the worst. My advice: read all the 1 and 2 star reviews on here, and believe them. Was terrible, terrible, terrible. I still want to know how a guy with his wrists duct-taped together can slap a hysterical woman, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feels like you're in the story...","review":"This was a very entertaining book. Felt like you were walking the corridors with the characters. Check out the web site \\"theparagonhotel.com\\" to get a flavor for the plot. Don't worry, it doesn't give anything away. I would have given it 5 stars, but the writing wasn't as polished as Koontz, but whose is? Currently enjoying Forever Odd."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"This novel had an interesting premise and was off to an exciting start but it quickly became a mess. The author tried to do too many things with it and the plot suffered. Was it a ghost story, a serial killer novel, a thriller? I'm not sure what it was but it failed at all levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepers on Top!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Morrell is a incredible story teller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Led to believe something else.....","review":"Another reviewer mentioned the blurb on the back of this book, and that it didn't accurately reflect the real story. I thought this book was going to be some kind of \\"monster in the closet\\" thriller. Instead it turned out to be an testosterone-driven, urban-cave-exploring, Rambo-lovin', bore.So, I'm still trying to figure out why they threw in the five-legged cat?!?!?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this one","review":"I never knew what a creeper was and this book has gotten me enthusiastic.

But you can see way down the track early."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointed","review":"After just reading several Dean Koontz books in a row.I bought this book based on the description of a real thriller.Yes it was a page turner,kept me reading,and reading,and on the edge of my seat sort of.I thought the book was quite predictable.The ending was a big let down after the thriller pace of the book.I read lots of Thrillers,Murder mysteries,etc....I was not impressed with the authors writing style,the plot.The only thing I found super interesting was the location of the book in Asbury Park NJ where I grew up near.Save your money,buy Dean Koontz :The Face Instead"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Morrel novel I've ever read!","review":"I've been a longtime fan of Morrel's work, going all the way back to the spy stories \\"Brotherhood of the Rose\\", \\"Fraternity of the Stone\\", etc. I haven't read any books of his since \\"The Protector\\". I picked up \\"Creepers\\" at a used book store and even though I paid half price for it, I feel utterly ripped off. I stopped reading it at the 2/3rds point because it just continued to degrade in quality.This book is the literary equivalent of a Sci Fi channel movie. Cardboard characters, extremely hokey plotline with dumb twist after dumb twist tossed in that didn't make any sense. If this book were to be made into a movie, you would have some hackneyed ham like M. Night Shyamalan directing. Its that bad. Morrel, in the past, always seemed like a pretty talented writer with a good spin and narrative and there is none of that in this book at all. For shame, Dave, for shame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"It was good at the beginning and a real disappoinment on the second half. At the end many things were left unexplained. I anticipated a scarier ending that never came. I could have come up with a better idea for the 2nd half. This is my first David Morrell's, probably the last. I liked Rambo the movie though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great premise, but...","review":"The idea of a thriller based on urban exploration of abandoned buildings is an excellent one. The novel starts out well, with compelling characters and setting. By midway through, however, there were so many unlikely plot turns that the story lost all its credibility for me. I wanted to like the book, but I didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Morrell is the best","review":"Morrells most recent and best in several years,The hero of the story is prior military and at first you think it will be one of the prior special- forces- with- some- black- ops-secret-training type guys. but it isnt quite that way. The story is one tragic blow after another to the characters. They never get the edge up on their ( numerous ) attackers."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 1/2 stars","review":"I'll agree that this is one of David Morrell's better novels. He packs quite a bit of suspense and action into these pages and the adrenaline never seems to let up. I must admit though, at times, I couldn't quite clearly visualize the layout of the hotel and its many secret areas/stairwells. You could say that sometimes I got a little lost. Oh well, it was still great entertainment.Recommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio Version - not exciting, no suspense, lackluster story.","review":"Like other reviewers, I am a big fan of Morrell's earlier works. On a long car trip, I listened to the audio version of Creepers. It just did not play well as an audio book. It didn't help that the reader made a trio of supposedly menacing bad guys sound like the Three Stooges.Not all of the blame is the reader's, however. Morrell's story was pretty flat. No character development. His author's note at the end was more interesting than the book.To be fair, the clerk told me that many of his customers really liked the audio version of this book. Maybe it was just me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peacock Charm","review":"I love this- I love peacocks enough to have them tattooed, and wanted this charm to put a little green into my bracelet.

Not this one. The others were new, but they stopped working within a few days. This one works like a charm.I'm not sure what's wrong with my phone, but it \\"eats\\" chargers and I thought it would have to be replaced. Thankfully, this charger is compatible and hasn't given me any trouble. Now I can continue to use my older phone and not incur any replacement expenses at this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This video lacks nearly half an hour of the film.","review":"Fellini's Juliet of the Spirits is a major film, brilliant both technically and in terms of its rich content. Nearly half an hour of the film is, however, missing in this video version. It appears to have been made from a print from which some collector had earlier pruned his or her favorite parts, two entire scenes and numerous small bits (mainly those with hints of nudity). What a shame. I only wish Criterion would get the rights to this film and do a video and DVD worthy of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAVEAT EMPTOR!!!!!!!!!","review":"One of the maestro's best. BUT, a terrible copy. For some reason on two tapes and the continuity between them is ineptly edited -- in midscene yet. Dumb. Most importantly, subtitles are usually impossible to read, given the generous amount of dazzling white that Fellini used in many of the scenes, for obvious reasons.Avoid this version!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a Ton of Bricks","review":"After \\"81/2,\\" Fellini came apart as an artist. And how have the mighty fallen! Nowhere in film is there a comparable example of an artist at the absolute height of his powers suddenly falling so short of everyone's expectations. \\"Juliet of the Spirits\\" happens to be not merely an artistic failure - it reveals a moral failure in Fellini. Hereafter, his films would become inexcusably more and more self-indulgent. The filmmaker who made \\"The White Sheik\\" and \\"Nights of Cabiria\\" left us so suddenly. Fellini may as well have been run over by a lorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Giulietta's Swan Song","review":"Fellini's \\"Juliet of the Spirits\\" is perhaps his most beguiling. This, his first color film, garnered mixed reviews when it was first released, mainly because it was truly ahead of its time. Today, it is universally considered an outright classic. The film is a tribute to the magnificent Giulietta Masina and her haunting ability to blend pathos and near-pantomime. This film is about war--war against the forces of inner turmoil, despair, sexuality, and dependency. Juliet is the inviolate, loyal, desperate victim amid an absolutely crushing kaleidoscope of physical/spiritual entities. To watch this film with the eye of one who suffers and struggles to be free from interior demons is to feel the poetic mystery of Fellini's great lesson about life: need only yourself, don't fear happiness."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE. It is cut by over 10 minuts. Do not support this kind of bad realeses. It is a pity for the film is really very god and is worth a better destiny than this. To Image Entertainment: DO NOT CUT MOVIES."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Fellini's!","review":"My five stars are not for the DVD transfer wich I haven't seen yet but for the importance of this film. I sent a e-mail to the Criterion a few time ago asking if they were by any chance planning to release this title and I was very happy to receive the positive answer.Though I agree with most people that 8 1/2 is a good work, it is this Fellini film (his first film in color) that I keep mostly carefully in my memory and in my heart. I love this film. Fellini himself once said that this film was very misunderstood by the european audience and was better received in the EUA, for the motive he gave to the psycological matter of the film. Sequences like Juliet daydreams and saving the child in the little room are impressive.I recommend this title very much for anyone who likes Fellini's movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Tune From Euro-Dance Group","review":"KISS ME is a great song in the tradtion of true Euro-dance. E-Rotic, which has been pretty hit-or-miss with its singles, really makes a hit with this one. While there is nothing particularly remarkable about the idea of this song, the sound is appealing ear-candy that doesn't stop. From opening until close, this is one song that will be stuck in your head. Also nice about this one is that, E-Rotic, known for its vulgur song lyrics, keeps the words in this one tame and appealing to all audiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like the band","review":"I like the band. It is hard to find nice white watch bands for summer wear. Also the face is large enough to easily read.

The tenor of the traditional sound is broadened and given a contemporary feel by the pounding rhythm.

Even if you aren't a big fan of Windir, its a good live show and some great extra footage as well. If you are a fan of Windir's music, this dvd is a must own. Valfar will be greatly missed, and this dvd is a perfect tribute to his memory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Repackaged","review":"Our third year Spanish class has used \\"The Aztec Empire\\" VHS video for several years in our Mexico unit. Because second year Spanish wanted to use this video, I looked for a new video. I thought I had found it in \\"Ancient Mysteries: Secrets of the Aztec Empire.\\" Unfortunately, this DVD is the same as the VHS, only it has a different name.

Could the magazines be true? Is At The Drive-In here to save rock-n-roll? The answer could only be a resounding YES. At The Drive-In is one of the few bands out there that actually think before they go into a studio to record an album, instead of forcing feeding us the horrible music that the minority of bad music listerners crave. I usually never purchase singles, but this was well worth the money. Go out and purchase Part 1 and Part 2. You will definately not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Needed to replace a scissor-style latch. This latch does exactly what I need and was easy to install.

Save yourself...it's too late for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who finances these movies?","review":"I honestly can't say this is the \\"worst\\" movie I've ever seen. Considering it falls into the Spoof Comedy category it's pretty average for these types of films. The last 5 I've seen were real stinkers.I couldn't make it all the way through in the first sitting.

It has none.Definitely in the top 10% of the worst movies I've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stan Helsing","review":"Stan Helsing is like A Bad Modern Day SNL Skit(Yes SNL Has not been good In Years). Put in Somebody Unfunny like Thompson From Unfunny SNL,And the other twits in the cast with the Exception of Leslie Nielsen and you have a Mediocre Movie at best from The Catholic Priest/Altar Boy Jokes to the bad costumes of the \\"Monsters\\". I wish they would Stop Milking Scary Movie(the First 3 or 4 were Funny)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried","review":"I tried. I really tried to watch this movie, but just couldn't make it.It's not that the movie is that bad--I wasn't expecting high art--it's that I kept getting hopelessly distracted by the clumsy presentation. There would be, for example, a scene with four characters having a conversation. The four characters lined up in a row, clearly staying strictly on their marks, unmoving, reciting their lines. Clumsy and unnatural. It was stage sit-com style missing 4th wall shooting rather than film style. Odd and very distracting. Just one example but things like this completely took me out of any storyline that might be taking place."},{"rating":"2","title":". . . we laughed thru most of the movie.","review":"Hey lighten up folks . . . . these reviews are so serious for what is clearly a low budget Indie Movie.The whole setup for the story is so ridiculous, the jokes juvenile, we laughed thru most of the movie.We watched it again and found it even funnier.

That said I've thus far avoided the Friedberg/Seltzer films (Disaster Movie, Date Movie, etc.). This isn't made by those infamous producers, but apparently it shares the same DNA - and what a foul specimen it is. I'm pretty sure this is the first \\"1\\" that I've even been inspired to give, and I wish I could rate it lower. I can't say that among the stupid takeoffs of monster/killer names, bad Michael Jackson jokes, and horrific dialog that I as much as grinned once. This movie is truly an abomination. I almost cried seeing Leslie Nielsen here in drag. This is an even darker moment for him than the late 80's craptastic satire disaster, Repossessed. This movie doesn't even make it anywhere near the 'so bad it's amusing' category. This is more like 'it's so bad that I want to gouge my eyes out.' For the love of all that is sacred, STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been there done that (but others have done it better)","review":"Very very silly movie. Received this as part of the Amazon Vine program, so glad I didn't waste any money on this. At first, I thought I didn't like it as I am in my 50's and maybe it was meant for 'younger' humor tastes. However, I tried to share this with my 24 year old son who told me he had seen it in the movies and would never be able to sit through it again (lol). Anyway, Stan Helsing seems to combine all the bad qualities of the Not Another Teen Movie genre films into a not funny spoof on horror movies. Save your money, and don't purchase this movie. Wait for it to come on network television. Just terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Movie! Amazing Cast!","review":"Stan Helsing is probably one of the greatest spoof movies out there! It's definitely my kind of film, and isn't as bad as some of the reviews say it is...the production value is great, not one of those crappy home video looking films, and the cast is phenomenal. It's my go to movie when there is nothing else to watch, and definitely, check out the commentary because its really good. Don't hate on this movie! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie puts the CRAP in CRAPTACULAR","review":"All I can say is wow, and not in a good way! I wasn't expecting much from this and boy did it deliver NOTHING! OK so the chicks were hot but that only goes so far. The jokes were childish and as parodies go I think Leslie Neilson played a woman hoping no one would recognize him! I think Keenan Thompson is funny and the addition of a \\"good burger\\" for him was clever but even he wasn't funny. All the \\"funny\\" stuff was shown in the trailer and when I actually saw them in the film they weren't funny anymore. I think I chuckled once and it was so fleeting that right now I couldn't tell you what it was! Even the out takes during the credits were dumb. I am glad, however that I only rented it on my TiVo and didn't pay the money to purchase the film. Unless you can see it for free, I'd pass if I had to do it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is nothing worse...","review":"Nothing is worse than an unfunny comedy. It literally saps your strength. \\"Stan Helsing\\" is as bad as it gets. The \\"jokes\\" are bad, REALLY BAD.

They should pay you! 1 star for the fine hoochies in the film, 0 for everything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"No laughs, no fun.","review":"Simply put: this movie is horrible. I don't know how you can call any movie that doesn't deliver a single laugh a \\"comedy\\", but this one somehow did it. It's not funny in the least at any point. Leslie Nielsen in drag...that's the highlight of the film. No reason for him to be in drag, but there he is. Kenan Thompson should fire his agent if this is the best he could deliver the man for his SNL Summer break. This film tries to find humor in bathroom scenes (it has 3...all toilet jokes...all stupid). There's nothing redeeming or funny in this film. If you're looking for \\"Scary Movie\\" kind of laughs, you won't find them here."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies I've ever seen","review":"First, let me say that I LOVE stupid, juvenile, slapstick humor. Just for reference, I've thoroughly enjoyed such movies as the 'Scary Movie' franchise, 'Vampires Suck', 'Meet the Spartans', etc - some pretty dumb, but funny humor there. There aren't too many comedies, especially spoofs that I haven't at least CHUCKLED at. Stan Helsing did not even make me smile. It was so bad it actually made me angry for having wasted my time watching it. Absolutely NOTHING in this movie is funny. Not even remotely. The ONLY and I mean ONLY remotely 'interesting' element of this movie were the hot actresses. I honestly don't understand how anyone could rate this movie more than one star. I'd give it zero stars if it were possible. Please do yourself a favor and avoid this movie - even if you can watch it for free. It's not worth your time, let alone your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible movie in terrible condition","review":"Terrible movie in terrible condition.

There are some funny moments, but the plot just doesn't keep it moving.I thought a spoof of several famous horror movies sounded like fun.The characters were good, and the acting very good for typical horror movie genre, but I wish it had more of a story to follow. Oh well, many horror films don't stick to the story very closely, so I guess it was appropriate to get a little distracted now and then.Leslie Nielsen in drag as Kay the waitress was funny, but probably especially because I like Nielsen. (Was he also spoofing TV soap opera's Kay Chancellor of the Young and the Restless?It's not going to be one of the great movies you'll remember forever, but for a Halloween party it might just be a hoot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly Unfunny and Insultingly Dumb","review":"I hope I've led a good life, I've tried to be kind to people, I give to charity, help my fellow man when they are down, and in general have a \\"live and let live policy\\".So why, just why was \\"Stan Helsing\\" thrown into my life? What crimes could one man commit that \\"Stan Helsing\\" would be visited upon him?If the \\"Scary Movie\\" series of films wasn't enough for you, \\"Stan Helsing\\" is like a compilation of the unfunniest scenes from those films.I'm actually angry at the space this dvd took up in my trash bag when I threw it out. That space could have been used for something that was useful at one time, like a spent tube of toothpaste or something. \\"Stan Helsing\\" doesn't even make good garbage.

Stan Helsing is the first one out of them all that I did not enjoy. The plot is non-existent, the dialogue is not well written.. It feels like a bunch of random horror movie scenes connected together with no sort of forward story progression, even for a \\"Scary Movie\\" type film. Diora Baird's appearance was the ONLY thing that made this 108 minutes tick by for me. I would recommend those that enjoyed the Scary Movie's steer clear of this film as it does not have the same charm or humor as the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"A silly waste of energy","review":"I never had high expectations for this movie. Actually I had zero expectations for this movie. I just assumed that it would be random cotton candy enjoyment on the level of a really bad made for cable B movie.

You'll be happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"LESLIE SINKS TO NEW LOW","review":"Even spoof king Leslie Nielsen can't save this miserably unfunny parody of horror movies. Attempts at humor mainly focus on body functions and sexual stupidities.

STAN HELSING fails for two main reasons: it's not funny and it's boring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"like a sudent film, only worse.","review":"Not a (A)class film.

Unfunny, uninspired I can't think of two scenes that made me actually do more than groan or chuckle (well, actually a lot of groaning).

Bo Zenga, retire. Everyone involved in this, hang your head. \\"Stan Helsing\\" is a spoof that can't take an easy target (monster movies and characters that have been around long enough to be self-parodies) and make even a mildly funny movie. I got only one mild chuckle in the whole 90 minutes of this film, and it involved a kids' hockey team. The rest of \\"Stan Helsing\\" is a wretchedly unfunny movie that misses almost every pitch it makes. Top it off with a bad Michael Jackson joke and an inexplicable \\"appearance\\" by Barack Obama and you start to wonder how this DVD got past the discussion stage.

I didn't expect anything more than the below average quality of the Scary Movie franchise, but Stan Helsing sinks to new lows. I thought the idea of having the six (Freddy, Pinhead, Jason, Michael Myers, Leatherface and Chucky) most famous modern movie monsters was a good idea, but they are only in a handful of scenes and those scenes, like the rest of the movie, stinks. The writing and acting are horrible. I will admit that the ditzy blonde and a few other parts were a little amusing, but if that's all you get in a 90 minute \\"comedy\\" then why bother watching it? Having one of the main girls half dressed the entire movie helped me get through it, but just barely.

This is a real treat for hardcore fans like me and will hopefully attract new fans for this overlooked and underappreciated band. My only criticism is of the packaging which does not even include a picture of the band nor does it include any information about the recordings.

The dreck just marches through these episodes, with one-dimensional characters whose uniform demeanor is either wooden-faced confusion or wooden-faced stoic determination. This, even as the show's writers have them do mindlessly stupid things in order to to get themselves (over and over again) into impossible predicaments. The only redeeming thing about this series is its innovative chronological pacing, showing events in real time over a twenty-four hour day.

Owning the DVD makes it that much easier to relive the incredible events of the first season. I could not recommend this more highly to anyone who loves good television. You could even treat this as a 16-hour movie, in which case, it's definitely worth watching. The real-time format of the show is a gimmick that works very well, but even without it, \\"24\\" would still be a gem."},{"rating":"1","title":"flashy but not smart, and a HORRIBLE ending","review":"I'm sorry to all the big fans out there, but this show insulted me on so many levels. Unreality seems to be the rule, just force ridiculous plot points along with no regard to how people would really behave or react. And the ending is absolutely dreadful, very little resolution, extremely dark and unhappy, makes you wonder what it was all for. TWO THUMBS DOWN."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally getting its due...","review":"24 is hands-down the finest dramatic television series that has been around in a VERY long time. The plot is thick and suspenseful, the format is enthralling and revolutionary, and the acting is top-notch. However, despite critical praise and strong fan loyalty, the ratings were mediocre and the general public never caught on. But the true fans knew this was something special, and maybe with this release, the rest of the world will catch up and make season two a success. Please...BUY THIS DVD AND SUPPORT 24. You will not regret it in the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing overall","review":"While this series started out with much promise, I can't help but think it would have been more enjoyable if watched once a week instead of over a couple of days. Then perhaps the plot holes and continuity errors wouldn't have been so blatantly obvious. As it was, by the end of the series my husband and I were laughing hysterically over the utter improbability of the whole thing. God help us all if those who are actually tasked with fighting terrorism were so easy to infiltrate, so incompetent over all and utterly dependent on one man (who was fooled through the entire season by a mole in his own department), to save the day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Season","review":"24 is about Jack Bauer works for CTU he's has an assignment to protect Palmer. The show gets better and better with twists + turns keeps you wanting more. I cant wait to see Season 2 of 24!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart, Funny, Sad, and all the rest....","review":"A very dark series has hit FOX but one of the best acting that I have ever seen for a TV show.

Was hooked from the first show. When the second season ended, needed to go back to see season one. Ordered the DVD and watched all 24 shows within a week! (all my spare time) After watching it, thought, How did the Sopranos get so boring the last couple of years? This is ACTION!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack Bauer for President!","review":"Since my wife and I never watch network television, 24 was new to us until we picked up the first season. We watched all five seasons of Alias last year over Christmas break and thought we would check out 24 this year. Although the series is very different than Alias, it is just as good and just as exciting. Jack is a true hero. I've heard say that Jack Bauer's tears can cure cancer - too bad he's never cried!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NonStop Action and Suspense At A Snails Pace","review":"I realize this isn't a movie where you introduce characters, develop the plot, and wrap everything up in 2 hours, but after watching 8 episodes, I don't believe \\"snails pace\\"adequately describes the slow moving plot.Did the writers really need a whole season to cover 24 hours?One episode/show for each 24 hours would have made it more watchable.I made it through 12 episodes. I can't take any more.One problem with reviews for TV series is the vast majority of reviewerspurchase the DVDs after watching episodes aired on TV. Who wouldspend money on DVDs if they didn't like the series when it aired on TV?Most TV Series are rated 4 and 5 stars on Amazon.Yes...Even the \\"Flying Nun\\" (Sally Field) and Beverly Hillbillies are rated 4 and 5 stars.I bought \\"The Shield\\" and \\"The Sopranos\\" without seeing them aired on TV.Both excellent series (with sub-plots). I would recommend watching some\\"24\\" episodes on TV before purchasing. Its not for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK Drama with some worthless filler","review":"The drama is ok, but as with the typical television drama series of late I find the \\"filler\\" storyline threads worthless and at times irritating. The primary thread has some very interesting twists and turns, enough to actually keep you interested, however they keep sidelining to the lead actors personal life and the trials and tribulations of raising a teenage daughter...that just blew it for me. I won't bother with a second episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"See what the fuss was all about","review":"Like a lot of people, I didn't get into 24 until Season 4. I waited until January 2011, when the next season would have started, to begin watching the first season. It's making me miss Jack bauer less, watching him once a week looking so....refreshed ( I won't say \\"young\\"), not playing by the rules, taking out the bad guys. Plot twists abound in this highly original series. I am enjoying it immensely."},{"rating":"2","title":"And you thought you had a bad day?","review":"The idea of a season of 24 episodes each of which cover one hour in real time was very creative, but would not have been successful without an amazing story to go with it. Season 1 has such a story where a counter-terrorism agent has to deal with an assassination attempt on a presidential candidate, one or more moles in his agency, and his family in danger. What a day!I am glad I did not watch this when it originally aired or the week between episodes would have been painful to endure. Even with the series in a box, I suggest viewing this in two sittings (there's a non-cliff-hanger break between episodes 13 and 14)."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome entertainment","review":"This series is the most entertaining thing tv has to offer. If you are already a fan then ad the dvd's to your library, if you are not then start with season one and catch up with the rest of us. You won't be disapointed !!! Entertaining and action packed, you feel as though you live through the events rather then just watch them."},{"rating":"2","title":"See how it all began for Jack!","review":"My wife and I had not gotten into \\"24\\" until it had run about three years. We purchased the season one package ... oh, my goodness. We purchased it just before leaving for a vacation trip. We took it with us and lucked out ... the motel room had a DVD player.When it was time to go home, it was like pulling kids out of a candy store. We were not finished with the series. Would you believe, we stopped at the first Walmart we could find and purchased our first, portable DVD player? Yep! Plugged it into the 12-volt cigarette lighter ... and the time passed on the road as the episodes of 24, season one, unfolded.It gave us an appreciation for how it all got started. We also bought seasons two and three ... and have not missed a new episode since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Program. Now you can see how it all began.","review":"The problem with a program like 24 is you can't watch it out of sequence. Each episode represents one hour on a certain day and one season represents one day. I believe the current season is Day 6. I had seen some episodes in reruns but the network broadcasting them didn't show them in order so, needless to say, they were confusing. This is an exciting and entertaining series. You better have plenty of room on your hardrive and a high speed connection because the download is 24 episodes close to one Gig each. You will need at least 24 gigabytes available to store these. You might be better off with the set in DVD form just for practical reasons. Whatever form you get I think you will enjoy the series. When I finish season one, I plan to get season 2. But I will be looking at the dvd sets rather than the download."},{"rating":"2","title":"A TV Series That Knows How To Entertain!","review":"Everything you have heard about this TV series is correct, it is one of the most action packed series on television that will leave wanting more. The story is very addictive and easy to relate to since it deals with Jack Bauer having his family kidnapped and doing everything he can to get them back. There are many scenes that leave me speachless and the entire season plays like a high-priced action film written by brilliant writers and performed by great actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"La mejor serie","review":"En estos últimos tiempos me eh dedicado a ver variedades de series y ninguna me llamaba la atención, y no es para mentirles lo que digo pero esta serie 24 es extraordinaria, te mantiene en suspenso desde su comienzo hasta el final de la misma, estoy por comprar todas las temporadas que existen de ella... se las recomiendo psssss... en la temporada uno desconfíen de Nina..., jajajajaja.."},{"rating":"2","title":"One word: addictive!","review":"The first season of 24 had us hooked after a few minutes into the first show. In spite of a few weak spots here and there, and a handful of inconsistencies that are easier to pick up when you watch all 24 episodes in a sequence, the series is highly addictive.The proposal is quite attractive: each episode (one hour, minus commercials time=roughly 45 minutes) equates to one hour of real time in the story. At the end of all 24 episodes, you're left with a day's worth of action (and how much action it is), revolving the life of Jack Bauer, a Federal agent who is fighting to save the life of a Senator who is in danger, while he keeps his own family safe.As long as you have the time, nothing prevents you from having a \\"24-Marathon\\" during a weekend, and watch the entire first season from end to end, much like my mom was able to do. If you're like us, and you have young children, then it may take you longer (one to two months, approximately). In any case, it is highly recommendable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Season 1","review":"By the time we hit noon I hated that show. I know the plan was to do everything in real time (reel time?), but for God sake the girl gets kidnapped 3 times in 24 hours? We had lesbian lover assasins, drug selling teen kidnappers, Eastern Europopean terrorist, a manipulating presidential candidates wife (not to mention his killer son.) and a half dozen secret goverment agencies.And did we really need the male prostitute in the alley scene? Oh yeah, it was Fox. The 24 hour gimmick just didn't work for me. Not a terrible idea, but not well executed. The thing that bothers me most was the DVD is referred to as \\"24 Season 1\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Theres a Bomb in Los Angeles","review":"Hey People watch comedies if you want to see a real lame and predictable show(that every one is doing) start out with this show.Crime Dramas and this crap have ruined TV if I want to see Drama I will watch the Real World if I want to see some real action I will watch the re-runs of Walker:Texas Ranger and if I want to watch a Sutherland movie it will be the dad.Because his son is a no talent loser.Do not support this at all cost we have to have all these Crappy shows.I want to see a Crime DramaI will watch Matlock-The closest thing to real.This show as I said before is very predictable. and shut up with that Friends and Frasier stuff is predictable its not.This is stupid"},{"rating":"1","title":"To much bull","review":"How many times can his wife/daughter be kidnapped by the same people.

Between having absolutely NO likeable characters at all, whinny teens and adults who just want to \\"get back\\" at everyone who has looked cross eyed at them and just plain stupid dialogue, what am I missing?I'll return the set to my friends and find something that at least has a script writer....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated series","review":"The series looses at the end, seems a lot but It's nothing special. I's all hype, hype and more hype, nothing more. It's a very overrated series like everything FOX does."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Trouble with 24","review":"24 represents some of the best story telling and acting that has ever been on television. But that does not mean that it's without serious faults. The most dominant of which is the grotesque liberal writing, especially in Season 2. The most obvious problem with the writing is the utter lack of concern to writing stories that are polarizing. You will either love or hate the story agenda.What we have here are writers that are pushing a liberal notion of saving the world that one will either choose to believe or find offensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Expensive Soap Opera","review":"24 is, plain and simple, an expensive soap opera. The producers have managed to outfit the stuff of middling daytime television in the garb of Clancy and Bruckheimer--a feat which must certainly be a delight to studio executives and marketers, but a disappointment to those looking for the rare gem that has made its way from broadcast television to DVD. The inventive chronological premise, high production quality, documentary-style handheld camera work, and Sutherland in the lead, can't conceal the mishmash of cliches and stereotypes that form the \\"substance\\" of this over-hyped melodrama. How far Fox has fallen since the X-Files."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only made it to 7am","review":"I'll admit it: the plethora of great HBO box set releases, as well as the occasional classic show like The Prisoner, brainwashed me a bit. If they're releasing the entire season on DVD, there's no way I can miss it! Kinda silly of me. 24 is interesting as a TV show, but it is still at its core a garden-variety TV show and nothing but. The narrative gimmick is indeed interesting, but beyond that, the show doesn't take any risks. The acting often becomes... unnecessarily operatic... and the story quickly becomes obsessed with surprising the viewer. He's good! No, he's bad! She's in trouble! No, she's not, because she's badder than he is! After awhile, I just stopped caring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant...

I believe I was hiding under a rock or something when 24 first aired on TV. I only bothered to watch it on TV in Season 8 (the last one) when me and my wife got married and moved in together. I simply can't complain about this particular DVD package. Yes I got sold with the fancy tin can with the timer (with already dead batteries) on it but what really matters most is that all the DVDs inside work and were in good condition. We're currently in season 4 and surely we will be purchasing the rest of the seasons as we go..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend","review":"This is not a review of the show - which is outstanding of course! - but of the product itself.When I first received this set I inspected the discs and found one of them had fallen out of the sleeve and was very scratched. I returned it but when I received the replacement set saw that the aluminum box was badly dented. I opened box to inspect the discs and found that on 4 of them there dark particle contaminents on the surface of the disks.I promptly returned that set for a refund and ordered the the older 24 Season One set instead.I want to make it clear that I do not believe this was a problem with Amazon, but a packaging issue from the manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stylistically superior","review":"This show started with a bang, kept me enthralled throughout all the episodes, and showed that experimentation with style can be extremely rewarding. My only real complaint stylistically is that it seemed to take itself too seriously and yet not seriously enough at times. There are surprises all throughout, yet many felt forced and would have been better if they had been planned out further ahead of time in the writing.Yet do not be fooled, this is one of the best action shows that have hit television in recent memory. Fine acting as well.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME SHOW!","review":"I didn't get a chance to watch any of this show when it was on TV last fall. I am now very glad that I didn't. This show is sooo suspenseful that I don't think I could have lasted the week (or sometimes 2) in between episodes. This box set DVD is the perfect way to watch this show. I am only half way through the episodes so far, but can not wait until I finish the show. Now they've got a second season coming on TV soon, but I think I'll wait until it comes out on DVD next fall to get it. This DVD set is great. So/so video quality but it's tv so it's not that you care. a 5.1 soundtrack would have rocked but as it is for only around 40 bucks you sure get your moneys worth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very good show","review":"The first season was very good. The acting is fantastic, and I don't know why some people here say it's bad. It is very realistic. But the continuing kidnapping and rescuing became a little too far fetched and got a little boring. The 2nd season is a lot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best show on television!","review":"I started watching 24 during the 2nd Season and even after 5 minutes, I was completely hooked. I even got my mom and my aunt watching it! My aunt bought Season 1, which I just finished borrowing from her. It's just as intense as the 2nd season (which, btw, I ordered before today's release date!) Just beware of watching 24... once you watch, you'll never want it to end! Whenever they show the clock ticking, I yell at the tv that it can't be over! Silly, but true! Now I'm just counting down for the premier of season 3"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon's shipping department will screw up the metal case/package!","review":"Don't buy this from Amazon! Note that this special edition DVD set is packaged in a metal case, and for shipment Amazon will pack it into a simple bubble-wrap lined envelope instead of a cardboard box. When it arrives, it will be dented. Ours had several large dents in it from shipping. The case was also bent so when you open the case it doesn't close right. This isn't UPS's fault, it's Amazon's. They should know better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show, Not A Great DVD","review":"This was by far the best show of the season.With its original storyline, great characters (except for Kim, she's as dumb as a box of rocks), and even greater actors (again except for Elisha Cuthbert),this show will keep you on the edge of your seat and aghast at some of the plot twists.Starts off slow but quickly works its way up by the end of the 1st episode.The DVD only gets 4 stars because there are no special features, but easily gets 2 stars for being released WIDESCREEN as it was originally shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"off the hook","review":"if you liked watching this show while it was on tv, you'll love being able to watch episode after episode, without commercials and without the need to wait a cringing week to see what happens next. when i first got the set i watched six episodes non-stop, and would probably have gone further but for work early next morning. it's definitely worth the forty-fifty bucks that you'll pay for it, and if you're a fan, it's a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Thrilling!","review":"I missed out on Season 1 -- when all the hype started about how great the show was, it was already halfway through the \\"day\\" and I didn't want to come into the middle. So when Season 2 started, I watched from day 1 and was instantly hooked. My husband and I received Season 1 DVD set for Christmas and WE CANNOT STOP WATCHING. It's like a good book that you can't put down! And since the current Season 2 shows are postponed until after the holidays, it makes the \\"withdrawal\\" more bearable. I highly recommend this set--the show is gripping and intense and no commercials makes it 100 times more exciting to watch! You will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A show that never stopped gripping my heart and squeezing it","review":"24 is a work of television brilliance.

Don't miss this one!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Day of Hell is Heaven for the Viewer","review":"24 is the most imaginative concept to come along in a drama category in many a year. Each episode reflects one hour of one day in the life of Jack Bauer, CTU Manager. The writing is first class with plots and subplots aplenty. The story lines all tie together and keep you on the edge of your seat - much like the old Saturday matinee cliff hangars. The acting is very controlled ie. very good. There isn't anything on the small screen to compare with 24 - both Season 1 and 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Longest Wait Of My Life","review":"This is one of the best shows I've seen since the early seasons of Buffy The Vampire Slayer. The day is full of plot twists and great chracters that will keep you guessing. The real time format, characters and storylines are what make 24 different. There are some flaws like instant amnesia, Yelena and some plot holes, but they are they are made up in the quality of the rest of 24. The supporting chracters are also what make 24 great such as Kim, Teri, Sherry, Palmer, Mandy, Nina, Gaines, Mason and the Drazens. The best part is the end where the climax does not disappoint anyone. 24 defies Hollywood and most television shows by NOT having a happy ending. I suggest you get this DVD and watch the second \\"day\\" or season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best TV show ever!","review":"This is by far the best television series I have ever seen. I was completely hooked each week; a herd of wild buffalo could not have dragged my from the couch when 24 was on each week. I would highly recommend this series to anyone.

A riveting, complex, terribly satisfying show, 24 nevertheless became frustrating in later episodes when it relied too heavily on amnesia and easily scapegoated villains when it had for so long forced us as viewers to question our own expections, our own sense of security, even our television watching patterns themselves. But perhaps most disappointing, the show built up a series of interesting, developed female characters only to ultimately have each of them either be manipulative, villainous, whiny, or self-punishing. The feelings of male triumph at the end of this are really troubling. Aside from this misogyny, though, the show brilliantly manipulates the entire viewing experience, and for that reason alone I watched every week without fail. A good example of what compelling television can be like."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE Best Show EVER","review":"This is THE best show ever. It was incredible. Every episode was fantastic and on the edge of my seat. Twists and turns everywhere!

Trust me and everyone...it's a great deal and it's the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of 24 Hours","review":"Having heard so many good things about this series, I decided to give it a chance.What a waste of time it ended up being. Sure, each episode ends with a cliffhanger, but the whole story is so far fetched, and so over the top, that I quickly grew quite bored by it. In fact, I was surprised at how much I dislked this series.I haven't given any of the other seasons a chance, but after seeing this first season, I doubt that I will. However, based on the reviews here and elsewhere, my opinion is obviously very much in the minority.For a far more engaging series that also deals with counter terrorism, check out the BBC's \\"MI-5\\" (a.k.a. \\"Spooks\\") - also available on DVD from Amazon.com."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only show that actually deserves to be on TV","review":"24 is the best show I (and my family) have come across.

(spoilers below)This is the lamest show I've ever watched. It's all appearance, no substance.First of all, we have a lead character that's hardly even likeable; it's a selfish, mean and paranoid guy.Then, we have plot holes larger than anything I've ever witnessed. Check that bad guy Gaines, for example: to obtain the ID card, he pays one million dollars to a highly professional female killer. To kiddnap the annoying girl Kim, also a substantian part of the bad guy's plan, he hires two stupid and intoxicatd teenage boys! How clever!!Also, we have characters that simply dissapear. One George Mason was clearly designed to be a pain the ...s of Jack Bauer, then he simply vanishes.It's a show to watch just once, and never again, so I recommend to rent the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reality gets left behind in 24","review":"Okay, after getting hooked on \\"The Shield\\" DVD seasons, I gave \\"24\\" a try because I think that Sutherland is a good actor. Unfortunately, he is the only saving grace in this otherwise worthless show. There's more BS DRAMA shoved into every scene, every conversation, than is ever plausable. The characters are COMPLETELY unrealistic, constantly trying to insult and out do each other. Cars explode like they were made of nitro glycerine, people are killed left and right, guns never run out of ammo, and more Hollywood drool worthy of Jerry Bruckheimer himself. DON'T BUY THIS DVD SET, if you're interested, find somewhere you can rent it instead, and by disc 3 you'll be begging for the bad guys to win and kill off the rest of the cast!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good, Too broadcasty though, too PC","review":"I have a biased against the broadcast shows I guess, but a lot of the time I could guess where this plot was going, too predictable and abounding with cliches. It would scare me as a Cali resident that an antiterrorist unit officer would use all of this tech to outright break the law by using his supposedly above the law units capabilities to solve his personal family problems, like the rest of us could do that. The high tech sophisticated stuff get's pretentious and old quickly. It's a good show, but I won't be watching anymore of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a joke!","review":"This series showed so much promise in the begining. There was so much suspense and intrigue, and the show seemed so original, but soon it all fell apart. Not only were many of the plot lines ridiculous, they were also full of holes! For example, when Kim and Terri are being chased after the attack on the safe house, Terri makes a turn to lose their pursuers. She then stops the car and gets out saying she's going to see if they are still being chased. If their is a chance that you are being chased, why would you get out of your car? I don't think you would. I can name many more as well, like when Jack is bugged, how come the transmitter isn't detected when he walks through CTU. It would have to be quite some bug.I have no idea how this show was nominated for emmies. The acting isn't even that great.Alias is a much better show. It also has rather farfetched stories but you can probably dismiss them since the show is more along the lines of science fiction and fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"24 Season 1","review":"It totally sucked!

For him, federal agent Jack Bauer is the role of a lifetime. It's hard to imagine a better match between actor and character. Season One is outstanding. One of the best moments occurs in the first meeting between Bauer and Senator David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert). The two characters nearly come to blows over a misunderstanding of the situation. It's intense. Sutherland looked like he really wanted to deck Haysbert in that scene, that's how angry he appeared. Sit back, watch this program, avoid nitpicking, and find yourself shocked and awed. The storytellers in Hollywood hit the bullseye with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Show Ever","review":"24 is one of the greatest shows ever made. Season one starts the series, and, compared to the later seasons, it's a little slow; this doesn't detract from the overall entertainment value, however. Definitely a great buy. The only problem is, it's hard to watch just one episode at a time! You'll find yourself taking up 2, 3, 4 hours a day watching episodes if you're not careful."},{"rating":"2","title":"The finest show on TV","review":"I had several friends recommend 24 during the regular TV season as, \\"The show to watch.\\" I, of course, did not. A year later I was loaned the complete first season on DVD from another friend. The DVD set just gathered dust on the entertainment center and I forgot about them for quite some time. It was on a Friday evening while I had tons of work to do (I am a consultant) that my eyes caught the 24 box set on the counter. I decided to put one disk in the DVD and play one episode. Big mistake...huge!All I can say is, I could not stop watching this series the entire weekend. I am not exaggerating one bit. I have never seen a more brilliant series, movie, show, or whatever you want to call it. I purchased the first two seasons and can't wait for the third season. I highly recommend watching the show from the DVD set. This show would be way too intense to have commercials or to wait for the next week's episode. Great purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"plot holes and unrealistic","review":"Okay, I admit I watched the whole 24 episodes, but I won't try season two. By the 20th episode it was so full of plot holes I almost stopped but I had to finish the story. Action scenes and music were good, but that's about it. Spoilers--- Why would they have to blow up a whole plane when they could have just killed the one person before they got on board?- for gratuitious overblown drama, an example that describes this whole show. For people with so many resources and so much training, they sure screw up a lot. On the plus side, Dennis Haysbert and others give good performances, though it's sad what hackneyed writing Dennis Hopper had to bear. I'm willing to give some license to an action show, but the plot holes were far, far too many to forgive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get ready to be on the edge of your chair! Overall: 4.5","review":"Pros: Starts well, ends decently, the middle, though, is a big mess, Kiefer Sutherland, Penny Johnson, Dennis Haysbert, Sarah Clarke, and maybe Elisha Cuthbert, Amazing show, Beautiful Audio/Video transfer, Highly suspenseful, intelligent, and engrossing show. The acting and writing are both terrific. Novel idea, suspenseful plot with interesting and realistic characters, beautiful transfer, sound.Cons: Loses focus, badly cast supporting roles, not enough ideas to go around, Plot holes and side tracks! I want Alberta Green BACK in this series, Could have had more extra's, A few stumbles, complete lack of extras is frustrating, no chapter searches within episodes, the time laps seems impossible such as jack and many characters doing many things in 1 hour, which is impossible in our real society today.Overall, I would give it a 4.5!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why has this show garnered good press?","review":"OK, the first two discs are incredibly entertaining, but after that I kept rooting for the people who were in danger to be shot. The self-righteous presidential candidate and Bauer's wife and daughter (ESPECIALLY the wife and daughter) quickly became tedious. It's difficult to know where to begin but let's say that after a teenage girl is abducted, hit, a witness to multiple murders, and threatened with death every half hour, the logical thing to do when freed is to return to her kidnapper for help and then kiss him??!! Good grief. Actually, except for Nina, most of the women on the show are actively stupid. (See presidential aide with her letter opener for further evidence.) A good premise with a solid performance from Sutherland, but can we silence the writers after we take care of many of the characters? Check out the first two seasons of \\"Alias\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Amazing!","review":"This show is absolutely amazing. It's can be best described as a action movie thats long. It'll keep you at the edge of your seat. Since is this is product review the only thing that keeps it from getting 5 stars is the fact that it does not have chapters. You can view only hour by hour (4 hours on a DVD), that was one thing I didn't like. Overall if you like action shows, renegade agents trying to do the right thing. This tv show is for you. Season 1 is probably my favorite season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"I watched season 1 of 24 and I have to say I could breathe for the last 3 episodes especially. There are so many twists and turns and the end leaves you shocked and wanting more. I can't wait to get my hands on season 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bauer Power","review":"I am a big fan of this show and Season One just brings you back to where it all began. I have to say, the newer seasons are somewhat disappointing sometimes, a real letdown in suspense and twists, but season one is completely fresh and interesting, what the entire series was built on. Dramatic and intuitive, it's great for the guys and the girls. I give it a YES. But I suppose I'm sort of biased... :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked to the show? Then this is a MUST HAVE!","review":"I'm sorry, but I have never experienced the suspense, excitment, and anxiety that I did while watching this show. The second season is proving to be even better than the first and i cannot wait till Season 2 comes out on DVD. Amazon also has the cheapest price for this (I checked all over). Get this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!","review":"Do not buy this edition; your discs will probably be damaged. The packaging is cheap and horrible. The discs slip out of the rough \\"cardboard\\" holders and move about the inside of the container, scratching them. I bought this set brand new, in the original packaging/wrapper and three of the discs had slipped out of their slots during transit. The edges of the discs were scuffed up, as there is an uneven \\"raised\\" cardboard surface right underneath where the disc is housed. The disc will rub up and down over that surface, damaging it. There is nothing (like a hub) to keep the disc in place; they slide out of their slots and roll all over the place."},{"rating":"2","title":"The longest day of his life....","review":"I rented 24 from my video store not knowing what to expect. I heard that it was a good show, but I never bothered to tune in. I already watched Alias, and one crazy spy show was enough for me.How wrong I was.As soon as I watched the first episode, I was hooked. If my schedule had permitted it, I would have watched the entire series in 16 straight hours. It is hands down the best television drama I have ever watched. It is brilliantly directed and pieced together, to keep viewers guessing until the end's VERY SHOCKING twist. I only wish I would have bought it at the beginning.It is wonderfully acted, in my opinion, especially by Kiefer Sutherland, David Haysbert, and Sarah Clarke. Okay, and Penny Johnson Jerald, whom I loved to hate.Take my advice: buy this DVD set. You will not be disappointed. Just remember to expect the unexpected. Because I know you'll be caught off guard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy Into All the Hype","review":"Basically, what you have here is a conventional terrorist thriller with the 24-hour gimmick.It features heaping mounds of mindless exposition, lots of running around (the purest form of dramatic filler), laughable plot contrivances (Jack's daughter being kidnapped 5 TIMES over the course of ONE DAY, his wife a PREGNANT AMNESIAC), and a villain that is the live-action equivalent of Boris Badenov.Rent it if you're curious, but trust me...this is not the sort of entertainment that holds up to repeat viewings. It's virtually all surface flash with no deeper meaning or genuine artistic merit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better in small doses?","review":"This stuff isn't meant to be watched straight through. Watch one hour per week and use the other 167 hours to forget all the details so that you wont be bothered by the inconsistencies, stupid plot shifts, continuity problems, etc. Think about it: whose life is really interesting 24 hours a day? It would be better if we had 6 hours of Kiefer sleeping. At least we could fast forward through that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste 24 hours with this","review":"Has anyone wondered that in \\"24 Hours\\" characters don't eat, sleep or go to the bathroom?Is it possible to happen so many horrible things in someone's life in one day? And in the same day everything gets solved!!So stupid.. how can people watch this crap??"},{"rating":"1","title":"24 - First Season","review":"I ordered 24 - the first season from Amazon. Evidently, Amazon farmed this out to a third party. I received the DVD set and my DVD player immediately read \\"region error\\" and put a message on the TV that this DVD was encoded with a region code and could not be played. I do not know where it came from but it had some outfit in China on the cover. I have never seen or heard of this before. The set was totally useless. On the good side, my money was refunded. I am renting the DVD locally. Amazingly, it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired of all this re-releasing.","review":"24 is a great show. Among the best of all. And season 1 was its best, but this set is another example of the lame tendency Fox has to release everything 7 or 8 times in different editions. If there really was useful bonuses to include on a new edition, why not have done it last year on the slim case edition. The packaging is not that bad, the features are interesting and the show itself is exelent, but the fact that this is actually the third time that this season is released on DVD is just another lame excuse for Fox to suck money out of dedicated fans. There is no need to buy this edition if you have one of the previous ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"new and extended???","review":"Not sure just how this works, but if you look at the total run time on the NEW Special Edition with extended scenes and alternate ending it's listed as 1019 minutes... but wait!!! The ORIGINAL Season one is 1152 minutes long! What's up with that? Think I'll keep my original and save $$$"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing series!","review":"I absoulutely LOVE this series -- Unfortunitly I didn't get to see the first half of the series, but after I watched it once through (The 11:00 AM to Noon episode) I was hooked. Every Monday I would be so excited for the next day, and on Tuesday's I could barely think. I can't wait for the DVD! I am very looking forward to seeing the first half. One of the goals (Well the only one) on my \\"TO DO Before I Die\\" list is watch the series, from midnight to midnight!! (Unless it's less because of no commercials, or whatever you'll do. Just from midnight to whenever, hehe!) Great series!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT A RIDE!","review":"I've heard about this show, but had never watched it on TV.I rented the First Season, and I'm hooked. I didn't think it started slow at all. I just finished the last DVD and love this show. After watching the ending, I felt like starting from the beginning and watching it all over again. It is just that good. When I brought the last DVD back to the video store, I rented Season 2. I hope all of the Seasons of 24 are as good as the first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Show","review":"24 is without a doubt my favorite show, and Season 1 may be the best season. However I was a bit dissapointed in the lack of extra features in it, especially compared to seasons 2-4 of 24. That is why I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5. As far as the condition it came in, well there were no problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jump in with both feet.","review":"Like many people, I missed the first few episodes of the first season. Afraid I'd missed the story set-up, I avoided watching the rest of this season. Then, on Labor Day, FX ran a marathon. I sat down to watch for awhile, and managed to pull myself away about ten hours later. Two weeks later I bought the DVD set.This is top notch television at it's finest. Kiefer Sutherland has brought his career back from near death with his portrayal of Jack Bauer. Bauer, a counter terrorist agent, is so single-minded in his drive and devotion to the job, that he doesn't seem to allow anything to stand in his way.The personal mission in this first season was two fold, save his family from kidnappers, and save the life of a presidential candidate from a hired assasin.This series proves two things... writing and acting are the single most important elements of any production. A lesson that should be learned by many more television shows and movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply awesome","review":"This show is incredible. I absolutely love it. I first started watching 24 in the middle of season 2, and have become addicted (both my husband and I). We bought Season 1 recently, and couldn't stop watching it. It was fun watching 24 episodes in a short period of time. The show is like no other, and that is what makes it so great. Expect the unexpected. Enjoy! I can't wait for season 2 to be available. (PS It is cheaper to just buy the DVD set than to rent each DVD at Blockbuster)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lock up your weekend","review":"The most amazing thriller ive ever seen,all you need to so is get started on a friday evening and rest is history rather the weekend .18 hours of sinnful entertainment.Go Get It."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show, DVD not great","review":"I loved this show, heard about it from a friend so I just bought it on DVD without seeing it first. Summary:- The show is amazing. My wife and I watched about 3 episodesa night.- Some of the plotdevices are too farfetched but you willget over it.- The DVD set lacks extras (introduction by Kiefer on DVD 6??,alternate ending, that's it)- No chapters????

The sound is cinema quality. You don't get that on television much3) Great and refreshing writing. The protagonist is hardly the do everything by the book guy. He is as close to super hero as it comes. He does what it takes to win. But more to the point, you don't know what will happen next. The twists and turns are rocky and entertaining.4) Realtime aspect. Though at points you'd wonder how someone can travel LA so easily, overall, the 24 hour concept in realtime is great.The best television as far as thrillers and suspense go."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great way to pass a weekend","review":"I started watching this complex thriller which involves events occurring in a 24 hour period and just finished, today, Monday.

He shows that many people in the Middle East have a big problem with Truth. And he gives some examples. Unfortunately, he also gives Untruth equal respect.

I logged on that day looking to buy a supply of Grip-Stics, which I LOVE for sealing food products right in the bag - prepackaged salads, chocolate chips, pancake mix, pretzels, and many more items. These tiny things function somewhat similarly to Grip-Stics, but they are designed for very small bags or packets. I've already used them for soy and duck sauce packets, sauce packets from frozen foods that come with dipping sauces, spice packets, and even the flavoring packet from ramen noodles (we think using the whole packet makes the broth too salty!). They are also useful for non-food items, like small bags of seed beads, jewelry findings, or other craft items.

Bought this for my daughter, who is beginning band this year, and we wanted to go with something that wouldn't break the bank, just in case she decides clarinet isn't for her. If she does stick with it, I'm sure we'll go with something a little more expensive, but for now, this will work quite nicely. I recommend it for any beginner who doesn't want to spend too much to begin with. I will say, however, be prepared to buy extra reeds and cork grease. There is only one reed provided and the grease is merely a very small container (not the tube pictured). Both are relatively cheap and a necessary purchase down the road, anyhow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth The Price!","review":"Bought this for my sixth grade daughter for second year of playing the clarinet. We rented from school last year & this one is much nicer & plays just as well. Not to mention cleaner & prettier. It is perfect for beginners to 2-4 year students. Probably not for advanced players or someone who is very sure they will be playing for years to come.....but...like I said.....Well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"CJackson","review":"This order arrived in a very timely manner, and has been all that I expected and more.

So far so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This!","review":"I am a band director and wanted to warn you against buying this product. It may play well at first, but almost all of these instruments do not make it through a year without a problem. Most music stores will not repair them as they do not have the parts. You are way better off buying a used instrument from a time-tested brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barcelona Squeaks - Selmar Rental Warm/Pleasant","review":"I so hated to return this. The Barcelona held out such promise based upon reviews, and I was swayed to it by the negative reviews of the other low-end competitor. My grandson played warm notes on a rented Selmar. That motivated me to buy him a clarinet outright. He could only get AWFUL squeaks out the Barcelona. He really tried. Based on the reviews, I had him use his own reeds as a test. Also took it to the instructor who confirmed it was assembled fine. The clarinet itself looks nice. Finally, had no choice but to return it. We rented a different Selmar (at a higher price, sigh) but at least now back to pleasant warm sounds that a clarinet is supposed to make. Maybe, we got the one bum unit in the lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this","review":"I bought this clarinet for myself to play for fun.When I got it instead of it being plastic it was wood.At first I thought it was cool but when I played it it sqeaked on every note.I couldn't get anything from middle E or lower,middle C to F,and all the notes inbetween were sharp.I've had mine for 2 months and I already have to get it fixed.The pads are falling off and one of the keys are jamed.I rented a differnt clarinet for 2 years and I have never had a pad fall off.This one was brand new and the pads fell off easily.Also the zippers on the case must of been cheap because I pulled one of them open and the zipper broke off.I was not happy at all and I wish that someone had told me about it before I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"squeaking","review":"This clarinet does a lot of squeaking.

It came quickly, but what came was a Simba brand model CL-200 Clarinet. I admit that my daughter knows more about these things than I do becuse she has been taking clarinet for two years in school, but it looks to be a pretty cheaply made piece of plastic. Little more than a toy. My daughter says it is certainly useable, but not near the quality the school provided to her in 4th and 5th grade.I don't know what planet this thing would be worth what the ad claims to be the list price, the Amazon price (about 40% of list) is more reasonable.In the end; I guess you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of long time fun","review":"Man I love Diablo. When my granddaughter lost the cd I was ticked. I got another copy and now from time to time I just sit back and kill off some hours and characters getting lost in the dungeons again. I can't remember how many times I have beaten the game or it has beaten me, but it is fun to try something new and see how a new character stacks up against the old ones. Playability of the newer games just doesn't stack up in my opinion. But that's me. I want games that make me think, and always I want games that can be played again and again to see if you can beat your own scores. Diablo is fun to drag out from time to time and try again."},{"rating":"1","title":"shareware","review":"This game was a disappointment, after reading reviews online I decided to try it.

Looks good, solidly made, etc. But unfortunately, does not cut the tape. I don't want to rant too much because maybe this one is defective (I might contact 3M).

It's painfully difficult to keep clean --you need to use real cleaner every day to keep it looking nice, not just a quick dust off. It's of cheaper quality than I'd hoped. Make sure you also buy some coasters because drinks/cans/bottles will leave a permanent ring on the finish of this table.

I thought this really was a French phenomenon. I wouldn't like you to think this stands for french current pop music (at least for good one). I don't like the concept - those young people think they are singers and sing famous songs made by others. It is pretty much a crime in my opinion - most of these young boys and girls are not in voice yet (and most of them will never be, I tell you). What's more, I do not even enjoy the songs in themselves - they really sound like mainstream stuff and are not unforgettable.

I have been so busy that I haven't had time to sit down and read it again yet, but I have the book now and when I can find some time, sitting down to read it is exactly what I plan to do.

Anyone interested in the Revolutionary War from a woman's prospective will love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend. I really liked it. It has good historical background during the time period of the American revolution. It's interesting to see how the fight continued on for years after the declaration was signed.

While it is engaging for the young reader, it is also story rich to hold an adult's interest.Celia Garth is a young orphan making a living as a seamstress during the break out of the Revolutionary War. Spirited and accomplished, Celia's life is on the rise. Just when the world seems the brightest, tragedy strikes and Celia must rely on her personal strength and strong will to pull through. A wealth of friends and foes make her life anything but boring, and spunky Celia navigates through the American Revolution in a mix of romance and sorrow.A well written and history rich book, Celia is so engaging that she leaps of the page and stays with the reader long after the book is done."},{"rating":"1","title":"GO TO VEGAS, SEE HUEY NEWTON","review":"The movie oozes with adolescent immaturity from the opening scenes until the final credits. A successful film that degrades to the inane starts out with something realistic and takes the descent in steps. This one starts with a guy taking a nude blowup doll (while inflated) on a plane. While the film idea was great, especially the ending, the execution was awful. Poor direction and script. Worth avoiding if you are over 18.F-bomb, lap dancing and groping, less nudity than expected, crude humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aviod this waste of time","review":"This is not a good movie.

Not worth the shipping cost much less the inflated price."},{"rating":"1","title":"2.5 stars","review":"Most of the main characters in this are unknowns. The \\"stars\\" that are 2 of the main characters are Kal Penn and Donald Faison. The rest of the stars in this are more like cameo appearances mainly because this is one of those mass havok, the characters are always running from one extreme situation to another that are so far fetched that it takes the fun out of the movie. If the movie had more direction and wasn't so random, it would have been much better.There are some good actors in this but it's like they had no desire to be there.Chuck Liddell should not be acting. It is very clear in this. Stick to fighting.It has a few funny moments but not many. The out-takes are funnier than most of the movie. It is free to view on Crackle right now so I say preview it there and if you like it, buy it. It is a must have for a very select crowd.I love good, funny movies but this one really missed the mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"My One And Only On CD","review":"This CD is terrific the Gershwin music was wonderful.

I figured we'd get sick of it quickly and sell it at a garage sale, but every time I see it on the wall I am very pleased with the purchase. It is - of course - better as a source of humor than time, but it fulfills its purpose elegantly: to mock the clock and make us smile! I don't believe we'll be getting rid of it for a while.

However, I don't know many people who even use faxes anymore (I scan and email pdf of documents instead).Software is included that converts scanned documents to pdf. Nice.My primary complaint would be that the printer will not printer on the thicker (higher quality) photo paper. Jams with anything 10 mil or thicker, such as the Kodak Ultima (gold) picture paper. However, works o.k. with the 8 mil photo paper, such as the Kodak Premium (silver) picture paper. O.k./acceptable print quality for pictures, though the print quality was actually better on my much cheaper HP DeskJet 932C.Overall, good bang for your buck for an all in one machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Performer for Home Office","review":"Good all-around printer-scanner-fax for home office use. I could only find one flaw, and that was its ability to recognize different ring-tones from Embarq. I cannot use the auto-answer feature because I have three ring patterns, and it confuses two of them. Beyond that, it is a great product. I don't get that many faxes anymore, so it is really a small point in today's technology world. Printing and scanning is fast and accurate, especially on draft modes. Good value for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliable all-in-one printer","review":"I've owned this printer / copier/ fax / scanner for a number of years, now and have had good luck with it. No break-downs of any sort. It just works. I've enjoyed the paper feeder for multiple page faxes; I don't need to stand there and feed sheet after sheet. I can stack, start the fax, and walk away. Same for multiple page copies. I'd recommend it for low volume use. I don't use the color photo printing feature, so can't comment on color photo quality. I'd assume it's not very good, however.

Setup was easy except in the attempt to dummy-proof the installaiton wizard, you have no idea how to tell it not to answer calls coming into the fax line. After installation, even though I set the default printing preference to \\"fast draft\\", it would randomly print in normal mode. Ink cartridges are tiny. So, they don't last very long. After the Vista driver was available, I connected it to my Vista machine. Print speed was terrible. It takes 2-4 minutes to print 1 page.

One reason is so I can get cheap ink with a good amount that will last a while. First problem is that even if you buy 58 hp photo ink it won't print color unless you buy 22 hp color in cartridge. 22 does not have as much ink in the cartridge and is almost $20 for only 5 ml of ink! I decided to play it safe and buy the 1 year protection thing. The gadget was working fine until one day my computer claimed there was not a scanner connected. I thought perhaps I needed to install the software again. Then I put new ink in and it needs to scan the alignment page to align everything. The scanner will not work at all and I have no idea why. I've had this printer for not even 2 years and it won't scan anymore.

Since it was the second one I had bought (the first one at the recommendation of HP, which I had to return for the same reason) I decided to bite the bullet and upgrade to xp. So after an additional $100, I finally got the thing to work. Sort of. It will not scan an image to the computer from paper while online. The fax hangs up when it feels like it.

However, the last 2 HP laptops I purchased were bad experiences...maybe user, maybe not. Please bear with me since this is not a printer tale so much as an HP tale. The first HP laptop was refurbished and started encountering problems from the start. When the 2nd started out much the same and was brand new, I went round and round with tech support. First with HP, then Kodak and Microsoft. The recurring theme was 'this is a known compatibility issue with HP'. I immediately traded the laptop for a Sony Vaio and have never looked back. I was considering buying an HP printer because of familiarity and they seem to easily match up with other brands. The previous review has changed my mind.

It kept uninstalling itself, and needed to be reinstalled about once a week. Not a huge process to do, but still a hassle when you need to print in a hurry and must stop to re-install. I learned later that the driver that came with the printer was not compatible with Microsoft Vista operating system. Tech support had me download an updated driver and install it, but that didn't fix the problem. Ultimately, someone in tech support who really understood the problem had me change a system setting which corrected the problem, but then the printer would no longer scan. I'm still working on fixing that. But all in all, it's just not worth all this time to get the printer to do what it is supposed to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"good deal","review":"This is the first color printer I've ever had, so I'm excited! Setup was super-easy, software hung on the first attempt but went smoothly second try (be sure to close other programs, especially antivirus/antispyware programs), and I have XP Pro, so I was nervous. Not designed as a photo printer, but when I scanned a pic of my mom, the copy came out better than the original (could have been the paper too). So far, I'm very pleased that I was able to get this for $105 with free shipping! I think it's worth at least twice that much. I am keeping my old LaserJet printer for longer B&W docs to save ink....I haven't tried to fax anything yet but I'm assuming that will work since everything passed the fax wizard fine. Also, I noticed it's very light and easy to move--much lighter than my old printer. It's definitely not top-of-the-line but it's good enough for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like it","review":"I've had this machine for about six months and find it very difficult to load the paper, plus it jams on a regular basis. Another annoyance is that you must remove the output tray to load the input tray. Even if you just want to insert one sheet of paper to say for instance print on the back of it you have to take out the output tray and then it takes too much time trying to insert that one sheet just right. Most of all I hate that I can not for all the world cancel a print project. Bring up the printer software and try to cancel that print job and it simply will not go away. Even after turning off the printer and the computer the next day when I turn them back on that sucker will go right ahead printing and wasting ink on the unwanted print job. For once I'm glad these things never last more than a few years because I won't be sorry to see this one die. I dread having to print anything because of the fact that only one in three jobs go well. The more I use it the more I hate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"I have had this 4in1 for a week now and have spent over 16 hours on line with HP and still can't get everything to work .

After 3 months of this very light load, the unit no longer feeds off the top tray without complaining of a paper jam. So we started to revert to using the flatbed for scanning outbound faxes. About a month later the unit has started complaining that is has the wrong paper size loaded, no amount of panel configuration or resetting the device seems to be able to change its mind. As a result it will not print anything.The frustration is not worth it, no matter how \\"cheap\\" the unit is.8/2009Just an update on my review.

I initially had the printer functionality working, but now I can't even get the printer to work. The last set of instructions were so convoluted that I am sure most folks including myself will screw them up somewhere and will eventually have to reload their operating system because of the ineptitude of the HP tech support.If you can get the printer and software up and running you may have a great printer.

This time HP offered to send me another 'all in one', charging me only for the difference to get to the next-up model - but guess what - they admit the next best model won't work with IE 7 either. Their suggestion - reinstall IE 6.0 and my previous version of Microsoft Office. What a joke. I will not be puchasing any additional HP products.

The accidents multiply in frequency and horror as Colin idly pokes about the Gothic quads, and the tightly modulated suspense ripens with a generous foretaste of Hilton's later acclaimed talent: finely perceived, individual characters, overwhelming atmosphere, and full complement of adventure and romance.From reviewer: I must admit it has been many years since I read this, picking it up because \\"Random Harvest\\" and \\"Lost Horizon\\" are favorites, and I enjoy mysteries.

Their efforts to provide a humane way to rid neighboring gardens of pesty (and hungry!) rabbits is a nice contrast to all the violent solutions to problems that pervade most films. Wallace even has a love interest this time around, and the twist at the end is very funny. This is great entertainment for all ages!

A must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy Of Best Animated Film Of The Year","review":"With Pixat on hiatus this year Dreamworks has the shot at the Academy Award for Best Animated Film of the Year. Only one movie stands in the way that can take the award and that is Tim Burton's Corpse Bride another stop-motion film(better known as claymation animation) Wallace and Gromit is based on two claymation figures who have appeared in various shorts.The Curse of the Were Rabbit is the first full length filmfeaturing Wallace and Gromit. The film has a nice story and a very surprising twist which I will not ruin for you. If you want a family film that everyone can watch I reccomend this one. It is easily one of the Best Family films of the year. I really enjhoy the stop-motion animation films they are better then cgi in my opinion. Or give me a good 2-D film. I know you will enjoy this movie and it is worth a purchase rather it is for you or your kids it does not matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointlessly Anti Christian","review":"The movie has several none-too-subtle very anti-Christian elements, particularly in the typical Hollywierd portrayal of a clergymen (in this case, an Anglican cleric) as a bumbling, moronic old coot who insists on purveying medieval superstitions and utter nonsense as Truth. -- Whatever happened to family movies that portray both the Faith and clergy in a positive light?!I am sick of Hollywood rubbish like this!

They use all the rabbits they've caught for Rabbit Rehabilitation so they won't like vegetables. It gets messed up and one of these rabbits {named Hutch} mutates and gets bigger, but this has also somehow affected Wallace.

Am using additive to reduce or prevent calcification of the pad, we'll see how that goes. It says can be installed in a place without a drain but ... I wouldn't do that. I does have a built-in overflow drain in the pan so they've clearly planned on overflow. Comes with hose to get between that and the drain. Whacky press-fit drain cup feature.

Actually more a 3/6 than a 2/5 I guess, but the movie at its' best is ok. And I'm a big fan of fantasy-movies, and of Eddie Murphy. But even for a childrens' movie the story and plot is very thin, not to mention used as in \\"old\\" and \\"seen it before\\".The haunted mansion looks good though, the place has potential - and perhaps that is what makes the movie watchable.Eddie Murphy has never tried to cover up for making some of his later movies only for the profit, his heart isn't in it anymore it seems. The best \\"resent\\" movies are Nutty Professor 1 & 2 in my opinion, other than that (and Shrek 1 & 2 of course) he has wasted a lot of his talent making B-movies far below his league, a shame really.Hoping for a comeback soon!Rent first, do not risk your money buying here..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eddie Murphy great, story lacking.","review":"Eddie was prefect for the film!

They couldn't even make it through the entire movie before asking to turn it off. We bought the DVD and opened it so now we can't return it. Parts I thought were a little frightening. There is one part where Eddie Murphy and the daughter in the movie are being chased by several skeletons (reminded me of Michael Jackson's Thriller video) while being trapped in a large tomb. I wish we had never purchased it. My kids don't even like to look at the DVD cover. Funny part is my kids have watched The Lord of the Rings and were not scared by that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Entertainment!","review":"After seeing The Haunted Mansion, my husband and I thought it was a lot of fun. The Disney magic came through very well in its special effects in this movie. We were totally entertained through its entirety and would gladly pay to see it again. Eddie Murphy was good, but limited by the family nature of the film. We liked it because it was funny, serious, scary and entertaining. As big Disney fans, we feel the movie followed the Disneyland ride pretty good in part and we were not disappointed in the entertainment that the Disney company provided in this film. We recommend it simply for the fun of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Haunted Mansion (Full Screen Edition)","review":"Realtor workaholic Jim Evers and his wife and business partner Sara gets a call late one night from mansion owner Edward Gracey, who is looking to sell his property.

A torrential thunderstorm of mysterious origin strands the Evers family in the old mansion with the brooding, eccentric Gracey, his mysterious butler, Ramsley, and a variety of residents both seen and unseen. At first Jim scoffs at Gracey's stories about ghosts and hauntings, until he unearths the mystery of the mansion and finds that his wife Sara has unexpected connections to its haunted past.

I thought that this movie messed up the entire concept of The Haunted Mansion. This Movie in my oppinion was only made because Pirates of the Caribbean was a hit film and people wanted their eyes on The Haunted Mansion.This movie was funny, but still, it was very stupid in the way that it was made. I wish they would have made more out of this movie, like making it more like the ride. I went to disneyland and the first thing I did was go on the haunted mansion ride. This movie makes me never want to ride that ride ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A failed attempt.","review":"This film was a little like The Cat in the Hat, too scary or crude for kids, too bland for teens, and too dorky for adults. This film should have done more like its predecessor The Pirates of the Caribbean, and been set not in modern times but in maybe the 1600s. The acting wasn't that great, and in my opinion Eddie Murphey should've stick to the PG-13 and up films. The story was way too predictable and didn't live up to the ride. In my opinion, you will get more laughs and satisfaction by going to a Disney Theme Park and ride the 2 minute ride, instead of trying to sit through this hour and a half flop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Walt would be sick","review":"This was a bad movie mostly because the plot wasn't clearly thought out too well. If Walt Disney was still living today, he would be sick to his stomach due to the zombies, the suicide scene, the master wanting to get \\"jiggy\\" with Eddie Murphy's wife, etc. The jokes were also dumb. The rating was also wrong (it should have been PG-13, not PG due to the violence, thematic material, some sexual references and language). The worst part was that at the end, all 999 happy haunts left the mansion. That was stupid because now there can't be a second movie. This would have been better as a TV movie. I hope they make a remake very soon with a better plot. So if you're looking for a better movie, stick with pirates of the Caribbean. Also, skip the movie and go straight to the ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"It arrived in good time but i was unable to watch the video because it wasn't in my area.

I gave the movie 2 out of 5 stars because there <i>are</i> a few cool effects and Eddie Murphy is able to salvage almost anything.If you have young children who have been pestering you to be allowed to watch a \\"scary\\" movie, but you're worried about turning them loose on Stephen King, then this might be an okay compromise.

But, whereas elements of the \\"Pirates\\" ride were implemented into the plotline of its movie with seamless credibility, references to the ghostly attraction in this movie were somewhat gratuitous.Add to that an endless parade of low-brow humor, poor writing and cheesy acting, and you have really ticked me off, Disney.

I have not been this disappointed in a Disney movie in a long time, there was no plot and the casting selections were weak with special effects throw in for filler. The ending was certainly beyond the PG rating, more like PG13 with the things shown definitely above a childs level but presented in a very scary way.

Honestly, the best part of this movie is the opening credits sequence--a pleasantly Victorian and abstract couple of minutes peppered with T.S.Eliot-esque tarot cards, red wine poisonings and tragic suicides. The credits promised me a movie that would not suck. A curse upon those credits and their misleading level of quality, for the movie that followed them made me weep for the Eddie Murphy I knew in Beverly Hills Cop."},{"rating":"1","title":"best left for network airing...","review":"I'd been eager to see this movie. Finally my son (who is 15) and I rented it. To me, it was a yawner. The movie did not keep my interest, I was bored. The acting was mediocre, the humor was weak or nonexistent, the story didn't move me (though I did jump a couple of times and that was funny). The entertainment value for me was lackluster. It left me unsatisfied and I truly wish that I had spent my money on something more entertaining. I have no desire to see the movie again-it will go back to the rental store early. My son was similarly unenthusiastic. I'm glad that I did not waste my money on the DVD-as I had often been tempted as I see it at several places that I shop. The movie might make you want to see the Disney attraction (and that probably is the point of it). My suggestion-wait for the network premiere - commercial breaks may make it more entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tame, but fun","review":"Haunted Mansion was pretty much what we expected.

It shipped quickly and was in good condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghastly!","review":"This is one of the worst movies in YEARS! A total disappointment for anyone who ever thought there was haunting magic in the theme park attraction(s). This was a perfect opportunity for a truly haunting and spooky tale. What the new Disney delivered is a campy, lackluster, brainless romp through a series of not so special effects. Come on, a seatbelt on the Madam Leota crystal ball? With each passing frame of film the insults are compiled on it's viewer in an unbearably terrible film. The Haunted Mansion is a ghastly movie for all the wrong reasons! (I would have given this a no star rating if given the option.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"A total waste of time.

Anything more than one star is wasted on this poor adaption of the myriad of horror/comedies that have preceded it. And I'm really reaching when I refer to this as a comedy. The acting, special effects, plot and cinematography fell well short of my expectations. Sure, there were some decent special effects but the film lacked consistency overall. Scene transitions seemed forced or disjointed, which made it difficult to follow the acting/action. I couldn't help but wonder if Eddie Murphy really wanted to do this film, or not. I half-heartedly agree with some of the other reviewers who noted that youngsters might find this film entertaining -- my 11 and 13 year olds found it mostly predictable and boring. Give this one a pass unless you're a true Eddie Murphy fan, and you don't mind throwing away your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good","review":"It was interesting to see the stars.

It is cute enough and notable for the appearances - however brief - of so many stars in one film including Laurel & Hardy, Buster Keaton, Edward G. Robinson, Wallace Beery, and of course, Norma Shearer, whose jewelry has been stolen. It is also included onComedy Classics 50 Movie Pack Collectionfor just a little more than is being charged for this one so-so short film. Plus you get a total of 50 films including a bunch of Buster Keaton short silent films, an Ernst Lubitsch - \\"That Uncertain Feeling\\", and an odd little comedy starring James Cagney entitled \\"Something to Sing About\\", which was made when Cagney was having one of his feuds with Jack Warner over his contract. That is a much better buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"no more dirty rollers","review":"I used to have to clean the rollers weekly with my old mouse. Not anymore with this laser mouse.

Works amazing on all-thread, toilet anchors, etc. My only complaint it comes with an adapter to go to 1/4 inch standard sockets but I wish that came with a reverse adapter so you could use a standard extension and go back to these sockets. The way this is I have to carry another set of sockets for times when I need a long extension and that is just extra weight I have to carry on every call."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shouldve gotten this sooner....","review":"I have always been very aggravated by not being able to use a socket with nuts on overly long bolts. Problem solved, only the set is much smaller than it appears on screen. The wrench is pocket-sized, which is not a problem in itself, and there is a standard 1/4\\" socket adapter if you want to use standard sockets. The ratcheting mechanism is top notch and feels very high quality. I will probably get the larger set also, although there is a single set that contains both as well.

Also, the tracks that Ted sings lead vocals on are not the best tracks on this record which is a little unusual for Ted to let that happen. Tied Up In Love is freakin' awesome ! Too bad he didn't write it or else it might have ended up on a greatest hits package one day. I love that song and I remember that there was a really cheesy but cool video for it way back when. Overall, I think this a weak effort from Ted as evidenced by his earlier work as well as his more recent recordings such as Spirit of the Wild and Craveman which are both proof of the rock & roll greatness that Ted is now and has always been capable of when he takes his time in the studio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Large Disappointment","review":"Ordered this Book to be used in a Public Childrens Program.

Daltrey is a great singer, but he's only as good as his material. And the material here is mostly dreadful. Its no accident that the only decent song on the album, \\"After The Fire,\\" was written by Pete Townshend. Its a good tibute to the late Keith Moon, though its appearance some seven years after Moon's death makes you wonder what took so long.If you have to indulge in Daltrey's solo career, I would recommend his self-titled first album. It may be silly at times, but at least the songwriting isn't a total waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another collection of great music...","review":"See my review on Mississippi Sheiks Complete Recorded Works Vol 1 to see my total review for the entire series.

The one here starts when the main characters are alreay married with kids and running their boat. The whole chunk about Deli's arrival to Australia and childhood, as well as how she met Brenton was in the first part, not included here. Plus, the VHS-version reviews state that the American edition (as well as Australian DVD) was heavily edited from the original broadcast.I guess, I wasted $18+SH on something which will stand on my shelf.

No help with hose diagrams or information about how to disconnect or reconnect anything. Also, the carburetor won't just lift out---it is necessary to loosen the manifold to get the thing out.

Even Kubric could not accurately capture the story of 2001 completely, but he at least captured the eerie, helpless feeling that the reader sensed in Bowman's struggle with the paradox of nihilistic and life-preserving powers of the universe. This movie hardly captures any of those feelings. I only watched the first hour of the movie, then turned it off, I felt that it would completely ruin my interpretation of the book.

Where 2001 was essentially a montage of beautiful images with little plot, 2010 has a rich plot and doesn't slow down. 2010 is probably more accessible to modern audiences. However, it's by no means a perfect film. Where 2001 was hard to understand, 2010 sometimes hits you over the head a bit too much with plot points (particularly bad is the voice over narration from Dr. Floyd's character telling viewers that he's scared). The camera focuses a bit too much on Dr. Floyd who comes across as a pretty plain character.

But what makes Shakespeare so great, or the Bible such a literary masterpiece? Much of it is multiple interpretations readers can form in their own mind, which also carries over to film. In 2001, I was perfectly content believing that HAL really did have a problem and covered it up by killing crew members.

I agree with the viewer from Moscow that the re-casting of HAL subtracts substantially from the \\"horrific\\" elements of his character in \\"2001.\\" It also negates the original film's cautionary speculations about man and technology.

It doesn't tell why there were thousands of black slabs congregating on Jupiter, or where the message about Europa and universal brotherhood came from, etc. etc. So there are still a lot of questions at the end, but the vehicle for imparting this ambiguity is a film that incorporates a bucketful of cliched movie motifs, e.g. lots of fake \\"countdown\\" suspense (will the spaceman reach the spaceship/will Hal agree with the new program, all resolved just in the nick of time), outdated Cold War stuff, and lots of things \\"get blown up real good\\" as John Candy used to say.If I'm going to watch a movie that leaves me scratching my head, I'd rather it be something with some creativity and originality--like 2001--instead of something that's 100% formula like 2010."},{"rating":"1","title":"2010 - The Day we made contact","review":"I love this movie but - the video quality is not even close to being Blu-Ray quality.

In the view of most sci-fi fans, the Arthur C. Clarke books ran swiftly out of steam after the first one. Kubrick can be credited with making 2001 a feast for the senses.Given no Kubrick and the inferior plot of the second book, the movie was going to be difficult to put next to the first. It does however fail on its own merits. The endless exposition in Scheider's monotone carries you deep into space. He really is very boring in this slow, slow movie. And check out Helen Mirren's Russian Commander! The add-on plot-thickener mid-80's Cold War Revival doesn't help either.A non-anamorphic transfer makes it complete, so that the few nice parts aren't all that nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"2010 is an enjoyable sci-fi film","review":"The sequel to 2001: A Space Odyssey. 2010 is an enjoyable sci-fi film and has pretty good special effects considering it was made in the early 80's.

What I mean by what I say is that the aspect ratio of this movie is so bad you have to watch it with black bars on the top and bottom of your TV screen. This movie needs to be digitally remastered in order so that if anyone owns a new HD Digital TV, you will be able to zoom the picture out so you do not watch it with black bars on the top and bottom of your TV screen. It's like I always say, \\"If you don't watch a movie in a theater with black bars on the theater screen, why should you have to watch it any other way when you buy a regular DVD for home viewing?

Very different to 2001."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the first","review":"It's more straight forward, it's more commercial, more understandable, it's better than the first. 2001 should be considered an introduction or a prequel, it's two hours of, well, see my 2001 review for that. But this is much better, yes you still have to think like the first one, but at least with 2010 you know what your thinking about.

Thanks for nothing Kubrick, except this superior sequel (by Peter Hyams)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb follow-up to the first","review":"I found 2010 much easier to follow, largely due to the fact it had a conventional story line rather than seemingly random scenes that made little sense like its predecessor (a movie I appreciate, but still find somewhat confusing). The acting is superb and the plot makes complete sense. In the end, one actually feels attached and sympathetic to Discovery. If you liked the first, this will probably seem less stellar; but if you found the first thought-provoking, albeit confusing, then this movie will help you understand its predecessor substantially."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very dissaponting sequel to a true classic","review":"Well, 2001 was the premier science fiction film and without doubt one of the most ambitious movies ever made.

Better plot wouldn't harm..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-ray is very, very grainy","review":"If you buy the Blu-ray of 2010 hoping for a stunning transfer, you will be disappointed. The image is very grainy most of the time ... you could grate cheese on the image quality. And the special effects look awful in this tranfer ... you can see stars through Helen Mirren's head and big boxes around the spacewalk characters.

Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"good movie bad bluray","review":"I received a Bluray player for Christmas and had a list of movies in mind for immediate purchase. I really like 2010 the movie and wanted to see it in closest quality to the original release.The blue ray remastering of this movie is one of the worst I have ever seen. Grainy, blurry.

The transfer is a bit grainy at times but nothing terrible. All of the space sequences looked amazing. This is a definite upgrade from any previous video release. The audio was okay but nothing exceptional. The disc is light on extras with only a short documentary and a theatrical trailer (both in standard def). For the price Amazon is selling it for, it is a bargain.

However, despite the fact that the DVD is labeled as \\"Anamorphic\\" *and* the box says \\"Enhanced for Widescreen\\", the DVD I received (the October 2000 release) is a rather poor letter-box transfer with a lot of noticeable artifacts. Overall, a very poor showing.Given the extremely poor DVD transfer on 2001, it is a shame that 2001 and 2010 are now the two worst quality DVDs in my collection.

In fact, I liked it more than the original, which, judging by the huge acclaim \\"2001\\" has generated over the years, probably puts me in the minority.

Clark's 2001 left us with many unanswered questions. From the epic proportions of the mysterious black monolith to the disturbance in the patterns of evolution; 2010 is adhering to more sci-fi than its predecessor. The movie adaptation, while keeping the plot bobbling trims out much of the stuff from this amazing book. A must read for all sci-fi fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clarke makes a cameo!","review":"Cinematically, '2001' has no peers and continues to be a perspective shift in viewing movies. '2001' is akin to listening to an atonal symphony while '2010' compares to listening to Verdi's Aida. '2001' quite simply is a Kubrick masterpiece whereas '2010' ranks way above 'Independence Day' and other more schlocky B-grade sci-fi genre movies like '2012'. If you are a fan of Arthur C. Clarke, '2012' is truer to the narrative as depicted in the Clarke novel. If you also happen to be a fan of Stanley Kubrick, I recommend watching 2001 first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably as good as it will get...","review":"I've always loved this film, but let's face it, it's never gotten much love from WB. The standard DVD is non-anamorphic and just doesn't look very good, especially on a large screen. The Blu-Ray is a big improvement in this regard. However, I doubt much (if any) work was done in the way of restorative work to the master, and there are no extras beyond those found on the standard DVD.All that said, it's been priced very fairly, and I DON'T see Warner re-releasing it in two years with a sparkling new transfer and a boatload of new extras. So, if you like this film, don't fear the \\"double dip\\" - just scoop it up, because this is probably as good as it will ever get, at least until the NEXT video format rolls around!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood Shlock Attack","review":"Who thought it would be a good idea to superimpose \\"Close Encounters\\" on top of \\"2001\\"? What a dumbed-down exercise in movie-making stupidity. Even Hal the Computer is dull-witted and smarmy, with a Richard Dreyfus look-alike as his programmer buddy. \\"2001\\" raised questions, left them unanswered, figured the audience was intelligent enough to chew them over; \\"2010\\" barges into the room like a loud, unloved In-law with ham-fisted, moronic answers to all those questions, tries its best to kill off any of the mystery or poetry in \\"2001\\" (how did they ever get the rights to use replicas of the original sets?), then stomps on the broken pieces with a bunch of New Age, Talk-To-You-From-The-Other-Side garbage.

Well,I was wrong. The sequel is actually much more thoughtful and true to the spirit of the original,but lacks the true majesty of the cinematography and musical score. For those left numb by the mysteries of the original(myself among them), we get some answers to the fates of Dave Bowman, Hal, and the human race.Now the Cons: This is a technical disaster as far as transfer quality, and most of the reviews here will go into great detail about the technical shortcomings.

Because if this I was expecting quite a lot of 2010. I was sorely disappointed. It was extremely slow, had a quite boring USA vs Russia theme throughout and nothing truly great happened until the end. This movie does not make you think - unlike the original. I then read the book of 2010 and found that it was excellent. What went wrong with the film? Around a third of the plot was cut and the Russia vs USA theme was added for no apparent reason. The characters were destroyed and all of the humour and suspense was forgotten. It is sad that what could have been am excellent movie was let down due to sloppy script and directing. The ironic thing is that 2001 has aged less than this movie! I think I will just try to forget that a movie was made of this excellent book - it lets me read the rest of the series in peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE!

It looks like they used unfinished elements (?). Color is WAY off in many composite shots (and full of pulsating digital artifacts). There are also a number of painfully obvious traveling mats. Jupiter looks too gaudy, like a big jaw breaker (instead of soft and mysterious, as in 2001), but that may be the way it looked theatrically.

She married within a week of the death of her \\"one true love\\", and to his selfish nephew. She was in his bed the very night of his death.The romantic scenes left a lot to be desired.

It really was an amazing movie and experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not Epic","review":"The new muppets movie was very good clean fun---however the hype that was built up around it was too much for it to reach.

Realizing the heart of The Muppets is truly gone. I understand why Frank Oz would have nothing to do with this poorly written film.-minus the famous \\"Rainbow Connect\\", all the songs was dull and forgettable-too many scenes of people dancing, just people with no Muppets and rather bland dance numbers-yes, it's a \\"family\\" movie, but the plot too, too thin-some cameos felt forced, like someone at Disney demanded their tween stars appear, utterly painful-oddly dark Kermit at times... not Henson humor, like blowing things up or monsters eating people, just creepy unappealing dark-so much of the attempt at humor feel flat, at times, I felt embarrassed for the Muppets.Don't buy this film, skip renting it, wait for Netflix/Amazon OnDemand and fast forward the majority of the film.R.I.P.

It was sad to see the franchise decline. So when I heard that there was an effort to revive the Muppets, I was looking forward to seeing the results. I was not disappointed. The movie was well-written, well acted, and entertained my wife and I (mid-40's), our 13-year old, and our 8 y.o."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly sweet family film","review":"While never as artful as, say the best of the Pixar films, this has a sweet heart, and a goofy sense of self-deprecating humor.Definitely aimed at kids first. But with enough clever twists on old movie clichés, jabs at 1980's culture, great little celebrity cameosand kidding of standard Hollywood storytelling that there is plenty to keep a grown up smiling and entertained. Alan Arkin has a pricelesscouple of minutes, and Jack Black proves himself a good sport indeed.A tip of the hat to the lead human performers Jason Segel and Amy Adams who catch just the right note of real emotion, mixed with a friendlywink at the audience so that we care, but it never feels sappy.Segel was a co-writer as well, and created a story where we can actually be touched by his over-dependent relationship with hisinexplicably Muppet brother Walter. A really 'nice' fun family movie, where 'nice' is not a backhanded compliment, but as an honest one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Disappointing DVD","review":"You have to buy the DVD/Blu-Ray combo to get commentary and deleted scenes.

Instead, it takes a dark and rather depressing turn, doing for the Muppets what \\"Babe: Pig in the City\\" did for that franchise.Jason Segel and Amy Adams are very likable as the main actors, and the new \\"whistling\\" Muppet is great, but it would have been good to see some of the funnier character like Ratzo, Peppe the Prawn, and Gonzo doing some funny bits.There are so many great characters to work with here, they really missed a golden opportunity to bring back a winning franchise.Next time, maybe Disney will let their Pixar team tell the story..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific!!!

I mean come on the muppets haven't been relevant in years. I loved them as a kid but never thought this remake would be worth the time. I was totally wrong. I sat and watch it with my two sons, ages 7 and 3, and was blown away. The actors really looked like they were enjoying themselves and the story line was very entertaining.

Then came George of the jungle, both of them, and Underdog. Now it sounds like they are making another flop with the Lone Ranger.All this movie did was make a sick fun of the other muppet movies. They had to put the rainbow song in it to have at least one good song in the whole movie. I wish they didn't put so much importence on the movie if miss piggy wasn't there. I wish they would do a good muppet movie without that character in it at all.

It didn't have the spark of a True Muppet Movie. Muppet Movies are supposed to have a mix between Kid & Adult Humor, this had None! Not to mention... the Voice Actor's have changed, but there's no control over that :( but still. Also! NO RIZZO! You CAN NOT have a Muppet Movie without Rizzo!

As soon as it came out on video, my wife and I grabbed it for our collection, which is saved for only the best movies that we see. The musical numbers are fun and catchy, and you will love that they are stuck in your head all day. Furthermore, the movie reminds you of what we have lost since Jim Henson passed away. This movie is a must if you have kids and want something fun and wholesome that does not rely on fart jokes to make kids laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had rented","review":"Wish I had rented this movie instead of buying it...

Based on the outside packaging, it appears that CD soundtrack is included. However, a code is given for a download from the Disney website. You have to become a Disney Rewards member if not already, and then you can download a Zip file of the soundtrack. For us the, we had to try 3 different programs to find one that would actually open the file. We have still been unable to burn a CD of the soundtrack, and currently can only listen to it from our computer. It's a pretty disappointing purchase for us, and I wish we had just bought the regular movie version only."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as it gets!","review":"I'll make this short and sweet. I fondly remember the Muppets from my own childhood, and after reading some of the many stellar reviews for this new version, I brought my 6 year old daughter to see it. Not that she wanted to...seeing as how she had no clue who this motley collection of puppets were, I wasn't surprised. In line to get tickets, I overheard other kids, with a familiar sounding whine, \\"But i dont wanna see the Muppets! I wanna see the Chipmunks...\\"My daughter is one of those who HATES admitting when she was wrong about something, anything. But after this film ended, she had a new love. And as the days passed, the memories of the film grew stronger. I purchased the soundtrack on CD, and she was addicted. It was highly gratifying to see her demonstrate such wonderful taste! This is one of those rare 'childrens' films that plays just as well to adults, without talking down to kids. It's a fantastic film, and one of the year's best, kids or adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"I was a big fan of \\"The Muppets.\\" I am a Jason Segal fan. To say that I was disappointed in this movie is an understatement. The concept may have been okay, but the writing and execution just plain miss the mark.

It does not capture the fun/funny essence of the original TV series or movies.If you enjoyed the originals, don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"My wife and I really enjoyed this movie and are looking forward to buying it in the future. Great movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good!","review":"Unless you've seen this movie before, it's way better than you expect! It's well produced, well photographed, well written and, most of all, very entertaining. Trouble is, the Muppets haven't been in the news lately and this movie didn't generate the public acclaim it deserved when it was released. But this is as good as the classic Muppets ever got--Kermit, Piggy and all that gang. The story picks up on that situation--that the Muppets have been off the front page for a while--and weaves it into a captivating story. You'll see all your favorite Muppet characters, even a new leading Muppet, and you'll enjoy a fresh new set of voices on the leads (Kermit, Piggy and others) that sounds just like the originals, maybe better. Wherever Muppet creator Jim Henson is now, he must be smiling!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"I really enjoyed this. I saw all the movies as a child and this both taps into what we loved about it then and is clever for us as adults.

Maybe I'm \\"too high to go to sleep\\" (Tom Lennon). It's one of the funniest things I've ever heard. Most commentaries make you want to turn it off after 8 minutes.This commentary is basically Jason Lee, Julia Stiles, Selma Blair, Tom Lennon and Chris Koch sitting in a room, watching the movie and saying whatever comes to mind.

We tried twice make it through the whole movie and couldn't make it either time. It was that bad. No it was worse. The lead actor is so over the top and stupid that he rendered the movie unwatchable all by himself. I can't imagine what James Brolin had to say to Barbara when he screened this one for her.

So rent it don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't laugh once, though Julia Stiles is pretty.","review":"I hate Jason Lee.I don't think he works as an Everyman Schlub, though someone in Hollywood must think people behave like this. I don't think he works as an effective Best Friend character, which he's frequently cast as in Hollywood. He's not a romantic leading man.The situations in A GUY THING are implausible from the outset. The crabs scene is tacky, implausible and incredibly dumb. Who thinks a guy scratching his crotch is funny? Who finds underwear jokes original?Selma Blair deserves much better. (Why is she never cast as a romantic lead? Why is she always The Pill or Sidekick Girl in these kinds of movies? She's pretty and conveys intelligence. Why is she doing this sort of movie?)Julia Stiles has done much better.

I don't care what you \`My Name Is Earl' fans have to say about it, this film forever killed Jason Lee for me. It made me hate him. To be fair, I remember nothing about this film. It was that bad. The plot is forgettable and predictable and full of clichés. I love Julia Stiles. Yes, she has absolutely no career at the moment, but she deserved one. She had such fire and spunk and undeniable charm. I seriously was in love with her at one point. I would welcome her back to cinema with open arms. She is the only favorable memory of have of this film (that, and Selma Blair's backside, which is always favorable).

And I'm not really sure why two guys would gang up on one girl, strip down to their matching underwear, begin a threesome, and then eat her. Why not save time and eat her with their clothes still on? The best part was when all the wolves were killed with a single ball point pen. Oh Lord how I laughed. The acting was bad and the direction was horrible. They used the same shots over and over again and it got really boring. If this movie wasn't so corny I wouldn't have skimmed through to the end. I have seen worse movies though.

However, I was very disappointed. Everything that made the previous films so campy and great are completely gone. This film takes itself way to seriously. It's about a young man who gets a job on Wall Street and then is turned into a werewolf, but we never get to see any werewolves. They all remain in human form acting like werewolves. Theres no blood, no scares, nothing. There's only one scene with guys in their underwear which David has made his trademark in all of his previous films. The only thing that it has going for it is the acting. The acting is by far the best of his films, thanks in part to Elisa Donavan from Clueless and Sabrina and Eric Roberts, an acadmey award nominated actor."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie had one good concept","review":"I liked the concept about a pack of wolves being money hungry on Wall Street.that's about where my enjoyment for this movie begins and ends.Other than that, there were no real werewolves in this film. The acting was bad enough. Eric Roberts didn't do too bad, but that's about it. The plot could have been better and it had a stupid ending... really stupid ending.And the homoerotica was just lame. I've seen just about all of David Decoteau's films and in all honesty, I'm never expecting much, except a bunch of pretty boys prancing around in their undies. But I will say this, if you're going to continue to make movies with homoerotic undertones, then be bold for once and actually have gay characters in your movies!

I thought I might find such a long book daunting, but it wasn't that way at all. I'm no English scholar or critic, but I can't say enough good things about these books.

The message gets lost in all the pratfalls that Jim Carrey is famous for.The movie is about an upwardly mobile couple that think their star is rising and find themselves unemployed and in debt. After trying to get work unsuccessfully, even as a day laborer. They are in desperate need of money so turn to robbery. I would have to say the part I liked the best is when the lawn gets reposed.

Dick and Jane are reduced to selling househould items. Then they begin to steal from convenience stores and banks, traumatizing innocent employees to pay the mortgage on their $600,000 house. It's all about Dick and Jane's problems!Carrey, as usual, plays a monkey-faced buffoon, and Baldwin, as usual plays the sleazy villain. Does anyone else get tired of this?In the end, the dog is left out with no explanation. And they never pay back all the money they stole. The message is \\"Get whatever you can take.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"See Dick Run","review":"This movie is what I have come to expect from Jim Carrey. A laugh out loud until your stomach hurts, great movie. Carrey is at it again in a classic Carrey style. This movie had scenes where I was laughing so hard tears came to my eyes. It also came to a surprising ending where Tea Leoni and Carrey actually have some heart felt scenes. This movie is exactly what needed to be released. After years of unfunny and pointless comedies about nothing, Hollywood finally decided to release a classical funny movie. Carrey is a master of comedy and shows us exactly why he is the star he is. This movie is exactly what it was meant to be FUN!Also a surprising fact about the movie is that Tea Leoni actually can be funny also. I loved every second of the movie and it made me wont to go home and watch other classic Carry movies such as Ace Ventura and Cable Guy. If you want to laugh you'll want to watch this movie. Unless you used to work for companies such as Enron then I feel your pain.Thank You."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun with Dick and Jane (remake with Jim Carrey)","review":"Very funny movie and as good as the original movie with Jane Fonda and George Segal!

It's most certainly Carrey's worst film to date. It was like one of those bad \\"In Living Color\\" skits that just didn't work. This movie didn't work. Don't get me wrong. It's not a complete abomination. There are definitely some semi-funny moments. But the movie as a whole was completely non-realistic, not overly funny, and just kept me reaching for something to grab onto.I suppose a massive Carrey fan would want to see this movie, but any casual movie fan who isn't huge on Carrey doesn't need to bother seeing this.

Why did they have to remake it at all?The new version stars Jim Carrey as Dick and Tea Leoni as Jane. There are many similarities between the two versions but with different plot twists and situations. Instead of Dick getting fired from his top paying job, here he is laid off when his company falls broke. The ending also changes, the original had an excellent heist conclusion, here the ending bares no power at all and is comparably weak.Another big difference is that the original had many laughs, smart ones that is. The new version contains silly jokes, dull that is.My expectations of the movie were pretty high walking in, but I must say that since the original is one of my favorite comedies, I was disappointed with the outcome. Jim Carrey better follow this one up with an original comedy.Not really recommendedC-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored with Dick and Jane","review":"I don't know anything about the original. I just know that this movie failed to amuse me. Carey being Carey and Baldwin being Baldwin. And Leoni just plain ole annoys me. The whole third act makes no sense to me and seemed to be made up each day they came to work. By the time Baldwin makes this huge transfer-I'm thinking this man would have done all of this months ago.

I wanted something that would last a long time with even heat but didn't have any odor or danger of burning my skin. This one fits the bill, the heat is penetrating but doesn't bother your skin -- I think the flannel cover is very helpful in protecting it from that. The only thing is that the actual heated part is in a plastic \\"wrapper,\\" and it is not only crinkly and rather bothersome but looks like it might tear/break...? Also, the flannel cover closes with Velcro and it's already starting to fuzz and weaken.

Shuggie Otis is one of the few out there that can really pull off the one-man-band concept. The end product is 70'sish, soulful, laid-back, and upbeat. There's generous use of early drum machine tech, but unlike many people who have experimented with such devices he figured out how to incorporate it properly into his overall sound. I think where most people fail is they try to use it like a real drummer instead of treating it according to its own sonic characteristics. His guitar playing is just tasty and never too brash or overblown. In many ways this album is a masterpiece of understatement. Most musicians seem to try and kick your doors down to get their point across. Shuggie just lays it down and lets it soak in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Fair","review":"Concepts are there, songwriting is not. The guy's got his groove going, but that's about it.

Some hidden nuggets deserve obscurity!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-Sly Pseudo Psychedelic Soul","review":"Paul Weller was recently quoted in Mojo magazine claiming that Sly Stone's \\"Runnin' Away\\" reminded him of Shuggie Otis. Next, he'll claim Kashmir is reminiscent of early Detective! Granted, this is a buried treasure of sorts, but for every studio musician who ever wanted to star on their very own album, thankfully very few ever get the privilege.

I think you all are getting a bit confused here...I bought Shuggie's record because people like Sean O'Hagan and David Byrne are on the sleeve giving it praise (last time I do that) and because all the cool people are talking about it...lost treasure time I thought. Wrong! This pedestrian lp could have been by just about any forgotten 70s musician...I don't hear anything but some decent guitar and simple lyrics.

I can't imagine why such an extraordinary talent went unnoticed for so long. It certainly sounds romantic, and if it empowers you as a music listener to feel that you've discovered something that the majors couldn't swallow because they're just not with it, then my friend, consider yourself with it. Stick it to those fat cats! You're in the company of every hip happening musician from Stereolab to The High Llamas. Is this CD any good? Heavens, no. Pedestrian at best. But let not this petty reality stand in the way of a great legend like Shuggie Otis. A career retrospective is certainly in order. I'll file it near my Bohannon and Con Funk Shun box sets. Shuggie's CD will look great in your CD collection.

Shuggis Otis' original sounds a bit like a demo. Out of all the cuts on this CD, the one song that I think is brilliant and stands out over the rest is, Aht Uh Mi Hed. It sounds like a lost soul classic. If you like jam sessions, this may be the CD for you. But if you want polished songs this much heralded recording may just be too jammy and free form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting Music","review":"I bought this CD 3 days ago and haven't been able to stop playing it.

Greg put Sparkle City on a mix tape he was making and that sent me running off to find the album. This was before the Luaka Bop reissue and it took me a few weeks to find it. I searched ever day because I needed to have this album in my life. Now I take pleasure turning other people on to Shuggie's genius. It's great to have this reissued and seriously promoted because this album needs to be heard by a large audience. We can only hope that Epic will put out Freedom Flight and Here Comes Shuggie Otis. And how good are those bonus tracks?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deepness","review":"Amazing...sounds not unlike Sly's 'There a Riot Goin' On' (on which Shuggie played guitar,) by way of--I dunno. The Beach Boys? (I swear there's a track here, \\"Rainy Day,\\" which sounds uncannily like the title track to \\"Pet Sounds.) Funkadelic, kinda...\\"Freedom Flight\\" is like a sun-stoked, jazzier 'Maggot Brain'...but it's loping, sweeter, kinder than that. Truly excellent, and truly original.

He loves to read, and loves the fact he gets to make choices in the book.In any event, this particular book was one that I had in my original collection. I agree with the reviewer above - for the most part, Edward Packard's books were better ... but that's not to say RA Montgomery's aren't worth a purchase.

The scenarios in which you are searching the ocean for the lost city are well detailed with a good sense of atmosphere, but when you do reach Atlantis (via that metal lid in the rocks), the story becomes so vague and sped up, it loses most of it's appeal. Some of the events loop into eachother and it's easy to face that attacking squid over and over again. There is not that much character development when it comes to the people of Atlantis. They are described as 'people who look just like you, only they wear greek clothing' and that's it. There is also an event in which you lead a revolt against the King of Atlantis in what seems like 2 sentences. This is not Montgomery's better books. I would say he fared alot better with 'Space and Beyond'. One of the very few things that are appealing about this book are the cool illustrations from Granger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere","review":"In one word: BOO!. The cover and editor/publisher description are very misleading. If the phrase in detail means look in the man pages then it the descriptions would be correct. This book professes to cover in detail much but delivers little. For instance, it claims to describe configuring window managers such as kde and fvwm. It shows a screen shot and says refer to the info/man pages for how to configure them. This style of coverage is consistent throughout the book. Instead of showing page after page of output from the make command when compiling packages the space could have been put to use providing the details promised. I would have returned this book had I not been so stupid as to remove the cd for safekeeping. Where the book does give some details it is often incorrect. An example is stating the swap partition limit is 64M when it is 127. Terms are frequently misused such as stating multithreading is accomplished with the fork call.

The only positive thing I could say about these stories is that they were well written. However, the subject matter was totally surprising and repulsive to me. The characters in Heavenly Dates were NOT the wholesome, decent, honest, and likeable characters encountered in the Detective Agency books. Unfortunately, sleaze, seduction of teenage children, violence, and malice seem to be the norm in these stories. This volume is in the trash (I certainly could not recommend it to my friends!) and I will not purchase any more A.M.Smith books. I am very disappointed because I had been looking forward to Smith's next series."},{"rating":"1","title":"hugely disappointing","review":"I fell in love with McCall Smith's luminously written Botswana series so I raced out to buy this book the moment I heard he had written it. How disappointed I was after reading it. This is a collection of short stories based on \\"love\\", yet these are largely dark stories where disappointment hangs palpably in the air in many (and unforgivably, in the reader) and the endings seem to end without being planned. There is no feeling evoked for the characters either positive or negative, and despite being well written, these stories do not capture the reader and often end without point. This is quite a departure for readers who have come to know McCall Smith through the Bostwana books.

I found myself getting more and more depressed with each successive story. \\"A Nice Little Date\\" was absorbing but shocking; \\"Bulawayo\\" was relentlessly painful. The stories over all are well-written enough, but it isn't always clear what really happened or what the point is. \\"Intimate Accounts,\\" for example, I gather is really more about the psyche of the psychiatrist than of the three clients whose accounts he relates, but it isn't developed enough and I waited in vain for the payoff.The overall view of relations between the sexes, as well as the human psyche, is dark, despairing, disturbing, unbalanced. I don't recommend this collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worthy of McCall-Smith","review":"\\"Nice Little Date\\" - I'm disappointed by anyone who writes about a pedophile and his victim that does not expose pedophilia for what it truly is - an evil and vile addiction that brutally exploits the innocent child. Instead we have a story about a nervous Doctor who travels to a part of the city known for trafficking in little children and who \\"hires\\" a young girl for the night only to be disappointed to find out she is really a boy.

I adore the NO. 1 LADIES DETECTIVE books. Those stories are not only interesting , uplifting reads but are set in the wonderful world of Botswana, Southern Africa. I lived in Southern Africa for 2 years so I especially enjoyed his tales of life there and was pleased to see that Southern Africa was revisited in this collection. THAT is where the pleasure ended. Unsatisfying endings combined with the seeming glorification of adultery, prostitution, child exploitation, etc. made for a book SO unsavory that I could only make myself read about half of them before totally giving up in disgust.If you enjoy gentle, endearing stories that embrace the best in life, then this book is NOT for you!

If I could have found one that was at all uplifting, or even seemed to be written with a kindly-though-damning POV on the menacing labyrinth of courtship and marriage, or of the whole dating scenario, I would have deemed the book a good one; but after reading it through to the end, I wondered why I had bothered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark and depressing","review":"Child pornography without the pictures. This is NOTHING like McCall Smith's other books. One wonders if the editorial reviewers who found it so light and touching actually read it.

In another, a woman tricks her date into entering a crocodile's lair in a zoo and he dies. It's a disturbing book that I regret buying and can not bring myself to even finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"After falling in love with The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series, I have been wanting to read other books by AMS. The first chapter/story was so cute and I got really excited to continue reading. But after that, I was disappointed with the stories, plots, and themes. If you happen to pick up this book, just read the first chapter & \\"Fat Date.\\" The rest is a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Alexander McCall Smith's Botswana series is so delightful; I had expected more of the same in his short stories. Not so. Perhaps some may enjoy the disturbing accounts of romantic flings which he has carefully crafted, but for anyone hoping to find the down-to-earth, straightforward, sympathetic sorts of figures which people his other novels, Heavenly Date will be an unpleasant shock. I threw it out--not worth keeping on my shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the light of humor","review":"If the only thing you have ever read and loved by Alexander McCall Smith is his #1 Ladies' Detective Agency series, then I would caution you about buying this book. The stories are wonderfully written, as is everything that he writes. But these stories are not light and cute, some of them are actually very dark. Even the ones that are funny are comedic like a Chekhov play. If you really want to branch out from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, then try reading the Portuguese Irregular Verbs trilogy first. They are a little more satirical, a little drier, and sometimes ever-so-slightly darker, but not anywhere near as dark as Heavenly Date can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should have been titled Hellish dates...","review":"Dr. Smith writes on the topic of dating with darkish angle that took me by surprise having read his Ladies series.Most of the stories are set in Australia except the ones in Swiss and Africa.The stories have a common thread of morose and sad twist that is not apparent in a literal read. For example, the story of a housewife that cannot consume her marriage, deciding to run away with a 18-year old boy is not apparent till you realize that she has no choice.A dark-ish side of Dr. Smith I never thought he had. Read this book on one of those wintery days up north. Not a summer read <g>"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavely Date and Other Flirtations","review":"It was pure, wise, uplifting McCall Smith until The Nice Little Date[the second chapter] then it turned dark, lustful, upsetting, disturbing because you don't expect it. Stick to Precious and Isabel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother watching it","review":"First of, I completely agree with the other reviews for this movie.My five year old insisted on renting this movie, because he was hoping to see those \\"scary sea creatures\\". He was totally disappointed, as was I with the movie quality. Most computer-generated special effects were too much like a video game clips, Movie plot was silly. The worst thing was the sound quality. Music was way too loud comparing to the dialogs' sound. Actors mumbled a lot, when I tried turning the \\"subtitles\\" on to understand what they were saying, I found out that there was no option for it. Basically I missed half of the conversations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definition of Sucks","review":"Deep shock is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. Hardly ever do you actually 'WANT' to turn a movie off. This one made the list. Not worth renting! If you are considering buying this release for somebody, you are a bad person. If you happen to see it on cable, don't watch it, go out and enjoy the day. Avoid this movie at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEEP DOO DOO","review":"Since when did eels have heads like dragons? Since when did David Keith resort to such mindless dribble to jump start his career? This can be answered in this laughably enjoyable \\"thriller.\\" The plot focuses on age old eels who have come out of a trench in order to lay their eggs. Of course, the government once again wants to mess with nature. Seems these eels have hastened the global warming threat and unless they are destroyed, the earth will enter a new ice age in about fifty years. In comes the noble scientist who wants to examine them first. Of course, this is where the movie relies on its feeble plot, which is so muddled and meandering, the viewer can only ask who cares? Keith is wasted and the rest of the cast, especially villain Mark Sheppard, need to return to acting class. The special effects are amateurish and the whole movie seems long, even though it's relatively short.Rent it, but don't buy it; if you buy it, sell it on e-bay!"},{"rating":"1","title":"'Tis Brief.","review":"This is an exceedingly BRIEF overview (2 pages?).

Pretty sure I would not have bought it had that been disclosed in the description. Seems like a fairly material thing to omit, but because they are DVDs there is a problem with returning them. Buyer beware. Shame on Amazon for an inaccurate description!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Marilyn Monroe 10 disc Collection","review":"DO NOT BUY this Marilyn Monroe 10 disc Collection from 101 DISTRIBUTION unless you are crazy about huge, distracting Korean Subtitles. They have made it impossible to disable the subtitle feature, and, the large white text takes up a lot of the screen. If you thought the price was too good to be true, you'd be right. Too bad, because the quality of reproduction is really done well. Fix this problem, and you have a winner here."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!","review":"I purchased this collection because I'm an old movie fan, and I have never before had any problems with Amazon. This collection has HUGE Korean subtitles on all of the DVD's that I could not turn off with either the disc menu or the subtitle button on my remote. I was so disappointed I sent it back, but because the package was opened Amazon only refunded half of the cost. So I ended up losing $20 on this collection all because AMAZON DID NOT MENTION THIS PRODUCT HAS KOREAN SUBTITLES in the description. Had they mentioned it, I definitely would not have purchased it. I'm so mad that they did not adequately describe their product and they won't even give a full refund. I'm going elsewhere for my DVD's from now on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No English Subtitles??

If these are new and unused as described, I cannot understand the poor quality of this product. When I opened the wrapping and observed the discs, I found every disc was badly scratched. I have not tried all the discs, but I have doubts they will run without a problem. I would have returned them, however I read another customer comment that he only received half of his purchase price because the package was opened. I will probably not purchase any future DVD's from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Initial Opinion concerning subtitles","review":"I received this movie set as a Christmas present. My initial opinion about this product is that I think the packaging could have been better. I loved the fact that it had a place for each disc, and it wasn't bulky; but I was disappointed upon opening it that most of the discs were moving around because the little things that were suppose to keep them in place were broken. The dvds have scratches on them too. I wiped them, hoping they aren't damaged. I will check them out soon to make sure they play, and see if indeed you can turn off the korean subtitles. When I find these two things out, I will come back for another review. I had to continue my review here since they don't allow more than 1 review per product, per person. I watched one movie yesterday, I was able to turn off the subtitles and it played fine. So if they all play as good as the first one, I will be completely satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"marilyn monroe 10 disc collection","review":"I JUST LOVE MARILYN MONROE...WAS SO HAPPY TO GET IT...PLAYED MOVIES ASAP.....SO I HAD TO GIVE THIS 5 STARS..IF YOU LOVE HER YOU WILL LOVE THIS..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This DVD set is NOT a girl's best friend..","review":"I was very disappointed when this box set arrived. ALL of the center disc holders had broken, so all 10 discs were just rattling around loose in the box. Also, the entire box has a weird chemical smell, so I ended up taking out all the disc and throwing away the plastic disc package completely. I was aware that I would have to change the language from Korean to English when it arrived; no big deal. However, you still get subtitles in Korean no matter what (at least I can't figure out how to have no subtitles at all). These are adequate for now, but I can see I'll want to replace these discs sooner or later in a regular English, wide-screen version."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED!","review":"NOT ONLY DID THIS ITEM SHIP DAMAGED, NOW I HAVE TO PAY TO SEND IT BACK!

I AM DEMANDING A REFUND!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"falsely advertised","review":"Upon recieving this item i was extremely excited. Unfortunately once i opened the package, like everyone else said the dvds were loose because the holders didn't fit right. Also my case was broken. Anyway, yes, the dvd's have korean subtitles but unfortuantely my player doesnt allow me to turn them off (believe me i tried). Also i've found that the movie i was most excited to see \\"Don't Bother To Knock\\" is delayed so the words do not match the flow of the speakers. I, unlike some people cannot get over that. I seriously wished that i could get this package in english but unfortunately i can't i would return it but like someone said before i would only get half back because it is opened. I will for now on read the reviews people write on products before i buy. I can say that i am VERY DISAPPOINTED!

But, nicely told story."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a classic....","review":"I liked Sharon Gless in Cagney and Lacey, but her acting in this film (like her acting in Queer as Folk) was over the top. An exaggerated character may make a strong impression, but it's the impression of a caricature rather than a sympathetic character. While I sympathize with the subject of the film, the acting and production value took away from the emotional quality leaving me unmoved."},{"rating":"1","title":"P A T H E T I C","review":"The kindest things I can say about this movie is that it is tedious, poorly written, monotonous, with dreary acting. Someone dare compare this mess to Broke Back Mountain and there is no way this dribble has anything close to the essence of that beautiful movie. Sharon put her money into this project so it is no wonder she has a small part. The characters were not likeable nor was there any real character development. I bought this DVD and suffered through it until the end hoping it would improve along the way. IT DID NOT! How pathetic this movie is. IS this really the best writers can do...........I guess it is with the dumbing down of America. All the hype over this piece of rubbish. I threw it in the trash.

Inaccessible due to format, a poorly designed book with good intentions. Yes, this is a sorely needed volume, but needs better organization, design, layout and print quality!

This book should be re-structured as a series of workbooks in the style of the excellent Jazz Piano The Complete Method (Examinations Department of The Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music).

Most adults aren't going to find it terribly exciting.I took my son to see it, and while it would not have been my first choice of movie, he loved it, and his enjoyment made it fun for me as well. If you have a child who already loves the Chipmunks, this will probaby be right up their alley. Lots of upbeat, chirpy songs, plenty of action. Alvin is his usual mischevious self, though in the course of the story he does find that he can be the responsible one when he needs to be. Silly jokes and humor, certainly.

I've read all of her books and loved them dearly. Selfless Sister, ugh, I hate this title and I know these books don't have great titles, is a great read. Shirley not only delivers a terrific romance, she adds suspense and intrigue to her books. The plot is truly exciting as we try to discover the mystery of a missing child from years gone by. Shirley does not let us down at the end, she provides the reader with a satisfying romance and resolves the mystery in a surprising manner. Her characters are well developed and you truly care what's happening to each one, including Edgarton, the villain you love to hate. This book does have a gothic flavor, yet doesn't. For any Regency fan, this is a MUST READ. I give this book my highest award, five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Colossal Disappointment","review":"I'm a huge scrapbooker, and - much to my husband's dismay - I seem to buy anything and everything that contains the word \\"Scrapbook.\\" But, I've got to tell you, Creating Keepsakes really let me down.Turns out that most of the truly good templates depicted on the box reside in something called the \\"Idea Vault.\\" That is not a happy place because it amounts to a series of PDF thumbnails that are completely uneditable and completely unusable in the software. And the templates that are available are pretty crummy.I'm sorry, but it's just not fair to include designs on the box - much less boast of the idea vault as a \\"feature\\" (gimme a break) - when they're just not available to people who buy the software. I can't recommend Creating Keepsakes. But I do own Scrapbook Factory Deluxe 2.0 (of course ... it has the word \\"Scrapbook\\" in it :-) and that I can heartily endorse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes scrapbooking incredibly easy","review":"After reading the previous reviews I almost didn't buy the product, but I decided to get it anyway since there really aren't any decent competitors to it. I am so glad I have it! I was using Microsoft Publisher before to make scrapbook pages, but the templates in Scrapbook Designer Deluxe are specifically designed for scrapbooks, so they're much nicer. I just use their templates as a step-off point, and alter them with different fonts, picture sizes and clip-art as necessary. The results look great, and it's really quick to make a new page.

The majority of these images are black and white sketches that look like rough drafts rather than a finished piece. The color images are either cartoon characters which, while some were decent, wasn't what I was looking for, or they were fuzzy and unclear images. It wasn't all bad though, there were a few images that were pretty good. The program itself isn't very user friendly either. In order to view all of the images you have to go by artist rather than category. Overall, while there were a few images that were really cool (which is why I gave it a 2 instead of a 1), it wasn't worth the bother of buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it.","review":"I just recieved this in the mail and like another lady had said, I wasen't sure about it totally...but when I saw it in person I love it.

This book has an excellent text, excellent quality paper and for me books with big size, such as this, are better than normal size. This book also has more photos, than pages.

And didn't need to read any book or internet site to understand nothing of this good book.Why I won't give five stars for this book? The photos are mainly black and white. Yes, there's more than twenty color photos in this book, but they are only in the last pages. In the text itself, I found just one very small mistake, on page 53, where the author wrote 1966, instead of 1986.I was looking for a book to read about the Antonov giant aircrafts: An-22, An-124, An-225 and An-70 and I found this good book, with an excellent text.

This movie is very funny but romantic and warm as well. It reminds me of the screwball comedies from the 1930's and 40's. I very much like the stylized look of this movie. It has a very 60's meets 80's feel to it with a touch of futuristic space age mixed in. John Malkovich is so funny, charming and warm in this movie that it's hard to believe that this is the same actor who now does \\"serious\\" work. Ann Magnuson is very comedic, pretty and good, that it makes me wonder why she did not become a bigger star like Meg Ryan. I was quite excited when this movie was released on dvd. However, I was disappointed because the dvd really does not have any extra features over the vhs edition that I already owned.

This one, the 1985 \\"Atlantic Records Remaster,\\" is the worst.I am not a snob--I really feel that the new mix detracts just that much from the songs and the overall quality of the album.1982 Original Mix: Drum-and Bass-oriented. A very heavy, punky, fast metal pop album1985 Mix: Guitar and Vocal-oriented, \\"glammy\\" mix. Now, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with a glammy mix as long as this is how an album was recorded. However, Under the Blade was a punk attitude album. With the guitar and vocals levels increased to biblical proprtions, and drums and bass whittled down in the mix, the guitar sounds crappy, the vocals weak, etc.Avoid this one and seek out the original, from 1982, either on Secret or Roadrunner records.

He is well-versed in what certainly is a much debated and complicated concept; especially when it comes to Christ's relationship with God, The Father and The Holy Spirit.

Sweet.","review":"Being a relatively new Robotech fan, I was blown away by how good this series was when I first started watching. Especially considered how I've been spoiled by more rescent anime such as Evangelion and Cowboy Bebop. The New Generation story is as simple as it gets. Big bad aliens attack and take over the Earth and humans are trying to take it back. But oh it's so much more than that. The action is still amazing even after fifteen years. It's fast, exciting and it still sets the bar for giant robot action. And I mean come on, it's got a motorcyle that turns into power armor! If any shred of childhood remains in you, you have to admit that's pretty dang awesome. Yes, I'll admit the dialoge is clunky and melodramatic, but heck, that's half the fun! In the end, Robotech is really a hyped up cross between Top Gun, Saved by the Bell, and Star Wars.

I remember taping the series daily in my youth to get the whole series on tape. Don't expect a great trasfer to the DVD format though because the first two robotech acts are about as bad as it gets as far as picture quality goes the only advantage of the dvd format for this release is that it won't suffer from degradation due to time.What makes this the best of the three Robotech acts is the great story line, character development, and the awesome mecha. Who doesn't want to hop on to a Cyclone and kick some Invid [behind]. This also features some great animation once again probably the best animated of the 3 acts. Highly recommended and its easier than buying the dvd's separate."},{"rating":"2","title":"I actually just bought it and have not received it.","review":"But, I didn't like the second generation of Robotech at all but watched this last generation several times.

Although he may seem less adventurous than virtuosos such as Tal Farlow, his experimental nature is reflected in a more precise manner: His original, \\"Walk Don't Run\\", (apparently too difficult for the Ventures to figure out correctly, and I love the Ventures), is filled with difficult and unusual fingering to effect a supernatural flow, yet restrained, in the service of the melody, never the player. The Segovia of the plectrum guitar."},{"rating":"1","title":"deadly boring","review":"Having just moved to NYC I bought this dog expecting to get a quick brush up on the fascinating story of America's Greatest City. Instead I was burdened with endless trivia about who was mayor or who ran Tammany Hall at any given moment in New York's history.Obviously this angle is part of the big picture of The City, but it comes off the page very flat and, sadly, uninteresting. There is scant attention paid to the million and one other details about New York life that one really wants to hear about: art, culture, social life, transportation, etc.The writing is intelligent enough. The author is clearly a smart person with a lot of interest in his subject. It's just that enduring this book is more like watching someone's vacation slides and less like the inspiring, terse and revealing story you hope you'd get when you bought the thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"great c.d.","review":"i don't know what that first person is rambling about, i pretty much think that phil roy's c.d. is one of the best c.d.'s i have ever owned.

Listening to Phil Roy's music reminds me to not despair over the empty, formulaic and all to familiar sounds attached to so much of the music playing on the radio these days. This record gives me hope. This record gave me colors I have not seen, stories I have never heard and music that is so refreshingly honest and emotive. My emotions surface while listening to this record...Grouchyfriendly enables the listener to feel emotions that may not have been easily accessible otherwise. Music, period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phil Roy is a mosaic of talent.","review":"I have rarely found one album that brings together so many different types of songs, moods, and voice quality... each as talented as the next. I highly recommend this album...there's something about his work (lyrics and music) that infuses one with feeling. There is also a raw creative edge to some of his work, that I think is fabulous - and welcome. It was well worth my money...!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Phil roy grouchyfriendly","review":"Terrible, awful, unsettling and unfreindly. Not a good CD, don't waste your money. If you listened to \\"melt\\" and you're buying based upon that song (which is the only redeeming quality) stop yourself immediately. The CD drags you through 14 additional songs at an absolute snails pace. A lot of incoherent babbling throughout. I only wish I would have read this review and not wrote it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it for the Art","review":"Ernest Lussier was my beloved high school art teacher and I can say with confidence that the illustrations in this book alone make it worth buying. Miss you, Mr Lussier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Editor's favorite","review":"These pencils are available in many colors, and they sharpen to a (relatively) durable needle point--much better than anything else I can find for making editorial marks in manuscripts/proofs. Marks erase as well as anything else I have found, but the attached eraser doesn't work as well as the gray erasers intended for ink. My boss has been an editor for many years, and she recommended them to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Good as Staedtler","review":"I got this set based on price as a replacement for my finished Staedtler non-photo blue pencils. These are still non-photo blue but they are almost a different shade. Enough to clash with my current work. Additionally, I find the Staedtlers smoother in application. I use these for sketching and portraiture. If you're interested in a good non-photo blue pencil look at the Staedtler 0 31901 model without eraser. Common pink eraser heads fit over them snugly and they work flawlesly. If you're looking at any non-photo blue, these Prismacolor ones aren't terrible though. Also, the Prismacolors erase easier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to work with","review":"We used this caulk in our bathrooms because it was designed for that area.I applies well and looks good when dry, but I will caution you that the fumes were strong. I would recommend opening up as many windows as you can.If you are chemically sensitive, be warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Christ-Centered Poetry","review":"\\"This is the badge of the friends of the Man of Sorrows:the mark of the cross, faint replica of His,become ubiquitous now; it spreads like a wild blossomon the mountains of time and in each of the crevices.\\"from \\"The Sign of the Cross,\\" Page 19."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal Quality","review":"I have been a fan of david castle for many years and believe this CD - Music For Your Soul - is outstanding! There are songs to appeal to everyone - new age, ballads, rock and roll - it has it all! The musical genius of castle is truly defined in these 17 productions! The music is hauntingly beautiful, the lyrics grab you, and the result leaves you wanting more. The magic of castle lives on!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book arrived exactly as it was described & is more than I expected. This dealer advertised it perfectly.
