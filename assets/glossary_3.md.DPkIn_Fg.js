I'm a big fan of cKy and Treephort, but I found this CD to be actually quite good. My sister has it and listens to it 24/7, so thats how I got my listen. After hearing \\"Justified\\" from Justin Timberlake, I was not in the mood to hear another boy band member gone solo, but once I got my first full listen to the CD, I was pretty impressed. Good one, Nick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nick Carter should not go solo...","review":"This album is not nearly as good as the Backstreet Boys, but as a true fan i decided to give Nick's solo album a try. This is the older of the two that he made, and it's not that impressive. Of course i will continue to listen to it in hopes of it growing on me."},{"rating":"2","title":"MMMMM...NICK CARTER","review":"Nick Carter is a very talented young man, he has great taste in music and he can be his own man even without the backstreet boys. His new cd \\"Now or Never\\" could be a little better, but is great for a guy who has just gone solo. His song \\"Help Me\\" melts my heart he sings so great in that song. He is a great singer and probably will continue to go further into his singing career."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD Rocks!","review":"\\"Now or Never\\" is the best CD I have purchased in a long time.I love all of the songs on it. They were all well written andNick sang each one with heart and a lot of feeling. I thinkeveryone should own a copy of this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think this is it for Backstreet!!","review":"Nick Carter has done it!!! He infused pop, rock and a lotta bit of heart into his debut. The tracks that should be checked out are \\"Miss America\\" and \\"I Stand for You\\". The whole album though is worthy of a listen. Nick has definitely grown up and shows that there is a lot more behind him then almost 10 years as a Backstreet Boy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A totally AMAZING Debut....","review":"He can write, sing and dance.... And this CD prove 2 of those (lol) And here we thought that Aaron was the AMAZING Carter solo star. I don't think that there is anyother way of describing Nick's CD. It's nothing less than the best. With tracks like \\"Blow Your Mind\\" \\"I Stand For You\\" and \\"Girls In The USA\\" you can't deny to rock factor of the disc. And on top of that you get a DVD with some discs which is a real PLUS! And Nick will \\"Blow your mind\\" on songs such as \\"Do I Have To Cry For You\\" \\"Who Needs The World\\" and \\"Heart Without A Home (I'll Be Yours)\\" And any artist whos able to pin tracks on their CD with their writing ability has got to be a definite plus. But as said before NOW OR NEVER is really an amazing solo DEBUT from Nick Carter. If you haven't gotten it yet WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? All the songs are great and deserve NOTHING less than FIVE STARS!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now or Never is definitely now!","review":"Backstreet Boys member Nick Carter recently released his first solo album titled \\"Now or Never\\". Sure enough, this album is a small step to the right of what the BSB fans are use to hearing. However, it is definitely worth listening to. With the first single \\"Help Me\\" already in heavy rotation on the radio, this album is just a sample of what we can expect to see from Carter in the future. Edgy songs like \\"I Stand For You\\", \\"Blow Your Mind\\" and \\"Girls In The U.S.A\\", kind of remind me of Bon Jovi in the 80's. While the guitar-ish ballads allows the fans to fall in love all over again with the blue-eyed blonde we all have come to know and love lol. Personally, my favorite song has to be \\"I Got You\\" because it is the one of many songs on the album that I can really relate to in my own life. For it being Nick's first time, he is definitely a convincing frontman. Overall, in my opinion this is a great album and has a little something for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately something different","review":"This album will definately suprise you. In place of the pure pop tunes of the Backstreet Boys comes the raspy, rock voice of Nick Carter, youngest member of the Backstreet boys. With a lot of the songs co-written by Nick it is definately an impressive step towards a great solo career. This album ranges from some up-beat rock songs like 'Girls in the USA' to soulful ballads like 'Do I have to cry for you'. You just won't be able to stop listening to it! I know I can't!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now or Never it's worth to buy","review":"it's really amazing which different sides Nick Carter has to offer.you can feel his passion and love for music while listening to his songs whether it's a ballad or a rock song.it's a must for every music freak.if you are quick enough you'll get the DVD too.

NOW!","review":"Nick did it NOW! And he did it GOOD! His new and first album, Now or Never is a big succes. There's all kinda songs on the album, for every mood a different song. He made slow songs, fast songs and mid~tempo songs. Some of the songs have a little bit of the Backstreet~sound, most of the songs have a completely new sound.Why is de CD such a succes? Nick co~wrote a lot of the songs, which makes it really HIS album, the songs come from HIS heart.People who aren't convinced yet, should just buy the album, they'll be surprised! It's not for Backstreet Boys fans only, it's even for people who don't like the BSB at all, because it's not BSB, it's Nick. It's different. It's good."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's About Time.","review":"After anxiously awaiting the debut solo CD of Nick Carter's NOW OR NEVER, I was totally pleased with each and every song that I listened to! It is about time that Nick had the chance to show his real & also unique talent without four other band members to pick up the pieces! Once I heard the first single, HELP ME, I was already hooked, and had the lyrics memorized in an hour! Other favorite songs on the CD for me include: \\"Miss America\\", \\"Do I Have To Cry For You?\\", and \\"My Confessional\\"Whether or not you're a fan of BSB music, I totally urge you to add this CD to your collection. YOU GO NICK. Thanks for the entertainment & bringing a smile to my face when I play your songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nick Carter's Help ME is a sure hit!","review":"This cd should definetly show everyone that Nick can make it on his own or with Backstreet Boys.This is a great cd!!!There are songs on this album for everyone to enjoy ,from smooth ballads to some more rock based songs.You can definetly see a growth in Nick's talent both vocal and writng.Everyone needs to check this cd out ,you will not be sorry! Angela"},{"rating":"1","title":"Conspiracy!","review":"I think Nick's people must have paid all these reviewers to rave about his album; I've never before seen an album that performed so poorly on the charts have not only so many reviews (almost 1,000!) but so many positive reviews - only 7 (including this one) out of almost 1000 reviews gave this disc 1 star! I've only heard one song from this disc (Help Me) and his voice is vastly underdeveloped and raspy, so that leads me to the conclusion that these rave reviews are all bogus; there probably aren't even 1,000 people who own this album! If you're going to purchase this album, first find an actual veritable source (if there actually is one) who can confirm whether or not that would be a wise decision - don't take these Amazon reviews to heart!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best solo effort in years!!","review":"22yr old Backstreet Boy, Nick Carter has released his first solo effort. It is the best all around cd to date. This has something for everyone. Every song on the cd is wonderful. This isn't one of those albums where you only like a few tracks, you're going to love them all and play it over and over. There is passion, fun, and even pure sillyness. Some of these songs touch your heart and soul and others make you want to jump around and rock it out with him. This is going to be the best album of the year, so get and you'll never stop listening to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now or Never....","review":"Do you think Nick Carter can make it solo? Well, buy the cd and then tell me. Like Nick states \\"Sometimes I wonder what it looks like through someone else's eyes. To see the grass change colors while the seasons change. To watch as the sun slowly drifts across the blue sky until it vanishes beneath the crest of the earth. Or maybe live in another world.\\"Well this cd is your chance to \\"live in another world\\" and see the world through someone else's eyes. And besides if you've taken the time to read this review then you obviously want the cd. Go ahead, buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy NOW OR NEVER...NOW!","review":"Nick's solo CD has been on his mind for years...and lucky for us it's out now! This CD is awesome, even if you are NOT a fan of BSB. Nick's CD is full of rock-out songs and ballads. This is one of those CD's where you actually like every song. There is a song for every mood and it sounds amazing. Be sure to check out \\"I Got You\\" and \\"I stand for you\\"...amazingly catchy tracks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now or Never HOT HOT HOT!","review":"After being the heart-throb of one of the most popular groups in the world, the Backstreet Boys, Nick Carter has the chance to say what he's been holding inside most of his life. Keeping with him his pop sound in ballads like \\"Do I Have To Cry For You\\" and \\"Who Needs The World\\" he also has a chance to rock out his rackin' brain! In songs like \\"I Got You\\" and \\"My Confession,\\" Nick still has a bit of pop mixed with rock to make his own edgy sound. What more is there to ask? Well, in his Bon Jovi and Bryan Adams type rockin' songs, \\"Girls in the USA\\" and \\"I Just Wanna Take You Home,\\" the once-boyband, now-rockstar artist has the chance to bust out some drums and go crazy! In song like \\"Miss America\\" and \\"Do I Have To Cry For You,\\" you can practically hear the pain in Nick's voice! I'd say Nick's album is a HUGE success you're gonna help him make happen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The time has arrived!!","review":"The time has come for the youngest BSB to break off and start on his own. Nick Carter's new album \\"Now or Never\\" hit stores today. With his new take on the world, Nick is taking the music to the next level. His songs about love are not the usual Backstreet tunes we are use to. It is safe to say, Nick Carter does a great job of telling the fans how much he loves and cares for each one of them. His songs are the kind when you hear the upbeat sounds, you want to dance all night. And when you hear the melodies, you feel he singing them right to you. This is the best new album out there and I can definetly say it is worth 5 stars, more if it is possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't be more impressed!","review":"When I bought this cd, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. Sure I've heard Help Me on the radio, but I wanted a surprise what the rest of the cd as going to be like. I have to say I love it. Nick has proved himself, to fans of BSB, and new fans that he wants to try something different. And by all means he did so! His rock/pop mix is awesome. I think he proved that he can make it as a solo artist not just a member in a group. With songs like Blow Your Mind, this cd has a different vibe for each song. And the fun loving Girls in the U.S.A., you cant help but smile when you hear him mention your town. I recommend this cd to anyone who wants to hear good, fun, different music. Buy it today, you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"nick carter rocks","review":"this cd is one of my faves...i'm a huge bsb fan and really proud of this album....i've always loved nick's voice, and i feel this album shows another side of nick. he can really rock..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nick Carter's Now or Never is going GOLD!!!!!!","review":"After listening to Nick Carter's new album Now or Never I believe that anyone can see that Nick is not just another \\"no talent boyband clone.\\" He is a true musician with real talent! His songs capture you and send you into a trance (especially \\"Miss America\\" my personal favorite). I believe that this album will go gold! And that Nick Carter will be one of the few ex-boyband members to make a name for himself and achieve a successful solo career!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot hot hot!","review":"This CD is the best thing I have heard in a long time!

He wrote some amazing songs and his voice is very touching. I love \\" Do I have to cry for you\\", it's really breathtaking. No matter how the album will do in the chats, it's already a success"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest cd of the year!","review":"i knew that this cd was going to be great,but when i got it it blew my mind away i loved it! i think that it's cool that he's writing his own music and he songs really had meaning to them when u listen to the words! it's a great cd!Anyone who's a fan of rock/pop should get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now Or Never Is The Best Album In The World!!!","review":"I LOVE this album! I've been a huge fan of BSB since I first heard \\"Quit Playin Games With My Heart\\" and Nick was always my favorite! I was happy when I found out that Nick was doing his own album. I got the cd the first day it came out..its a amazing cd. I haven't been able to stop listening to it! I love the song \\"I Stand For You\\" its just in your face and fun, the whole album is saying how Nick feels and it gives the fans a closer look into who Nick is, if you haven't gotten the cd yet you need to NOW! Its definetly worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now or Never is the best cd ever","review":"Nick Carter's first solo cd is excellent! I am a huge BSB fan, and for a while I was dreading Nick's cd because I thought it would be completely different from the group's music- and it is. But this music is the best stuff I've ever heard! Now or Never is full of fun, from \\"It Saturday Yet?\\" to the make-you-feel-good song \\"I Stand For You.\\" Surprises on the album include the headbanging heavy tune of \\"Blow Your Mind\\" to the sensual, modernized version of \\"Let's Get It On\\"- \\"Miss America.\\" This album is a must have for any lover of music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now or Never","review":"This CD has shown a major growth by the youngest member of the Backstreet Boys, Nick Carter. He has written and helped produce a number of the tracks and has shown that he has expanded and grown as an artist. You can tell by this album that he has been influenced by classic rock music and it shows throughout the cd. All the songs are sung with an intensity that prevails throughout the album and I believe will carry through to his performances. His potential for growth is enormous as he has a great voice and an even greater heart to sing and perform. He has shown alot of courage in pursuing his dream of a solo cd"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now or Never","review":"Nick Carter. When i think of Nick Carter i think of how far he has come and how he has made his dream come true. Hearing him sing in his new album Now or Never, i can hear how much passion he's putting towards his songs. This CD is nothing like Backstreet Boys like everyone suspects it to be. In the ballads you can hear just a little bit of the Backstreet Boy in him coming out, but mostly rock. His CD rocks! Buy it! You'll love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Joke","review":"The only good song is \\"Help Me\\" the rest of the album is a big joke. I love Nick Carter but I don't love this cd. He should just stick with the group and not go solo"},{"rating":"1","title":"you've got to be kidding me...","review":"People actually like this disc? Props to Nick Carter for going solo, but come on, have you heard it? It's bland, boring, and his prepubescent sounding rasp of a voice has no edge at all. He wants to take his music more to the rock spectrum, but he just doesn't pull it off. Don't buy this disc. Unless you are a raging Backstreet Boys fan who'll love anything any of them put out, you'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rockin' with Nick","review":"I bought this album, not really sure what to expect.. I concluded my money was definitely well spent! Nick's cd is full of a variety of songs, different styles, and his voice adjusts well to the different beats. I got to say, I'm loving his new pop-rock sound! I love the Backstreet Boys, and I love Nick Carter, but I've got to admit, I thought things would have one sound to it; of course he proved me wrong, and each track has its own style, and own sound, that keeps ya rocking your head and playing it over and over again! I think it's great, that he was able to adjust from being a 5th member in a group, to going solo, and doing things on his own, so well. Things are just clicking for him, the songs flow together real smoothly. There's a little bit of rapping, a little bit of jammin, and a little bit of sing-your-heart-out-and-cry tracks. I'm sure there will be another follow up to this album; or at least I'm hoping so! :)*Dedicated fan and music luver*Mandy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Nick's new album is so good. The songs are so sincere and seem like they have a lot of meaning to them. You can tell a lot of work was put into the album and the outcome was great. I'm really excited about his next solo projects because I think they are going to improve."},{"rating":"2","title":"not baby backstreet anymore","review":"Nick Carter's new cd \\"Now or Never\\" has got to be one of the best CD's I've bought in a long time. It has a very diverse range of songs, such as a more rock tone, to a slower tone, and even a little mix of the 70's type beat. It's very un-bsb like, which is good. It's letting Nick do his thing, which is very awesome. Even people who dislike the boy band theme will enjoy some part of this song. Its a very grown up- yet fun album. IT's not a typical pop cd. I think that even if i wasn't a fan, or if I hadn't known anything about Nick (ya know, living under a rock...) and I had gotten this cd, I'd be very stunned that THIS guy IS in a BOY BAND. I'm loving this cd 100% and I'd reccommend it to anyone who likes anytype of pop or poppy rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great buy!!!","review":"This CD really shows the amazing talent Nick has. He is no longer the blond teenager who became famous with the Backstreet Boys, he has grown and this CD really shows that his growing has been a great step for him. Not only did he contribute to most of the songs, but they aren't the typical \\"boy band/pop\\" song about \\"oh baby girl I love you blah, blah, blah\\"Many have deeper meanings that reflect life and problems.So if you want a cd that you will listen to over and over and not skip every second song I highly recommend you buy \\"Now or Never.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Nick Carter Now or Never","review":"This album is the best ablum ever!!!! nick said he wants to write feel good music and he did. i love the song 'i got you' when ever i hear it i get in the best mood. This ablum is the best ive ever heard. at first when i thought nick was gonna put out a solo ablum i was like he gonna sould weird without the boys but he dont he soulds so so good. The name Now or Never means so much to me cuz its true. You should do something that you wanna odo before you dont want to do it anymore!!!! NOW OR NEVER!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you don't have it, buy it!","review":"This CD is by far the BEST CD that I've heard in a long time. Nick did an amazing job with every single track.

I recommend everyone to buy it as soon as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nick Carter Now or NEVER","review":"I gave this record a chance but I am sorry this is just awful music. If i wanted to listen to a mix of Hanson and the Spice Girls I could just go through my old trash and pop it in! I used to be a fan until i heard this record. What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bringing the 80s back to life","review":"Just when I thought the music business had forgotten about the great rock classics from the 80s here comes Nick Carter and brings it back to life. Now or Never has tracks that are impressively rockish such as Blow Your Mind and Girls in the USA and ballads that remind me of Bon Jovi and Bryan Adams - that can only be good!In My Confession we see a mix of rock and electronic sounds that make it quite unique. Who Needs The World impressed me for its simplicity and sincerity.A great album whole way round. Kind of CD that makes it hard to pick a favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best album ever!!!!","review":"I'm the lukiest girl in the world,because I have this album since the 25th of october at home and I LOVE IT. The album completely rocks!! The album is just everything you need to have fun. It's a mix from real cool rock songs to very romantic lovesongs. My favorite songs are: I've got you,miss America,do I have to cry for you,my confession,I just wanna take you home, help me, I stand for you, girls in the USA,is it saturday yet?,blow you mind,heart without a home, who needs the world and of course scandalicious or with other words: I love the whole album.

I really have to say that when I hear about Nick's solo stuff I was really mad at him!But now that I have my own copy, I would like to thank Nick for doing this great album!His voice is just something that touches ur soul and the songs are very well picked! The highlight of this album is \\"Heart without a home (I'll be yours)\\" His voice is something the world music was expecting! Just buy it and u'll see!Ps: I would pay twice the price if I have to buy it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The next generation of music starts here...","review":"One might be expecting the sweet, seductive sounds or the up-tempo, hip pop songs of the Backstreet Boys from their youngest member, but Nick Carter has outdone himself in a way that is going to open the eyes of more than just BSB fans. His new style is a mix of pop and rock, and comparisons against the likes of Bryan Adams and Bruce Springsteen are this time justified."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solo vs. BSB","review":"First of all I want to say Congratulations to Nick! This CD is fantastic! It really shows his great vocal talent while expressing some of his emotions. Whether solo or with the Backstreet Boys, Nick will always be my favorite musical artist. The album is a combination of fast dance songs and some slow songs. I can honestly say that out of the 12 songs, I love all of them. I would definatly recommend buying this CD!. Some songs are cowritten by Nick himself which is another great accomplishment of his."},{"rating":"2","title":"it blew my mind!","review":"insipite of being the youngest backstreetboy... Nick has proven himself on this album.. it was a truly persnal album that would describe the way he feels.. he has a variety of songs like from a balld \\" do i have to cry for you\\" to a mid tempo 80'ish song like \\" is it saturday yet... and a rock infulence.. .. i recommend this album to everyone who likes variety!Nick did a great job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wow","review":"I cant believe how many boy band artist there were, now that I look at it. This solo debut by Nick Carter was just as bad as Justin Timberlake's debut. Normally I give every album a fair chance but this was just horrible, I couldnt finish the CD, that a first for me, since even the bad CD's I finish. There is nothing redemable about this album, and showed on the charts when it debuted at 17 and quickly fell, at least Justin Timberlake debuted at one and has sold 4 million copies so far. Skip this, if you want to listen to teen type music, go to Justin Timberlake or Christina Aguilera."},{"rating":"2","title":"NEVER BETTER","review":"The only thing better than the always upbeat personality of Backstreet Boy Nick Carter is his solo album, Now or Never. Giving a guy's persepective on romance, and sharing his personal thoughts on several of the the songs he wrote for the album, Nick Carter shines. His songs have a more rock-edged sound and a fun, carefree style that make fans new and old want to sing at the top of their lungs. No matter what age, you'll lose yourself in the free-spirited tone of the album. Although Nick Carter has been a Backstreet Boy for a decade, Now or Never proves that he is just getting started."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD Will \\"Blow Your Mind\\"","review":"Now Or Never, has been in my CD player for the last few days, ever since i got the CD, even when i'm not listenin to it the songs are still playing in my head, from the slow ballads, such as \\"Heart Without A Home\\" to the faster paced \\"Girls In The USA\\" This CD with have u speechless, whether from Nick's raspy low voice or his ballads that wanna make u cry i recomend this CD to everyone"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now or Never-Go for the Now","review":"If you don't know the real Nick Carter before you buy the album, you most definitely once you listen to the CD. Every track is so different from the next, but the whole album has a rock vibe that is sort of cifferent from what Nick has usually done with the Backstreet Boys, but in a good way. You can tell that he used this album as his way of getting some things out that he's been holding in for awhile just by listening to the lyrics and hearing the fervor in his voice with every word he sings. For his first solo attempt, I think Nick did an outstanding job and anyone who buys this album will not be disappointed. If you were looking for a CD that you could listen to from start to finish without skipping songs, you've definitely found it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breakthrough solo disc!","review":"This first attempt at a solo career from Nick Carter might just be a prediction of what is to come for him. His cd \\"Now or Never\\" is a departure from the Backstreet Boys. On his solo disc, Nick breaks out with more of a rock edge. Songs like \\"Blow Your Mind\\" will do just that because they are completely different from anything you've ever heard from this Backstreet Boy. Beautiful ballads like \\"Who Needs The World\\" and \\"Heart Without A Home(I'll Be Yours)\\" are perfect for those who are romantic at heart. Nick co-wrote many of the tracks on the cd and in my opinion, this album is reminiscent of a young Bryan Adams. All in all, this album has something for everyone...great lyrics, hard-rocking tracks and slow, romantic ballads! I highly recommend it to anyone out there! It's a must-have for any Nick fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rock It's Not","review":"Another boy-band member who thinks that just because he's the \\"cute one\\" he should release his own solo album.Nick Carter goes on and on that his music is different than the Backstreet Boys music and I will have to agree, because at least the Backstreet Boys music was good and I was able to listen to it. This is not rock music and if anyone try's to say it is they're wrong.Once again it proves that just because you write a song doesn't mean you are a good song writer. Nick's lyrics sound like they belong on his even less talented brother Aaron Carter's CD.If you want to witness Nick Carter's true talent buy a BSB CD and hear how good his voice can sound when it's in harmony with his band mates. When he was a BSB his voice had true passion and now it's just trying to be something it's not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...

Do not buy this worthless crap, buy Pearl Jam or Guns N Roses instead, then you'll know what real ROCK music is. God this is horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, Nick Carter, your career is gone and no one likes you","review":"Jesus Christ, people! Nick Carter? To listen to a song called \\"Girls in the USA\\" (sung by a 25 year old) is so, so, SO stupid. Buy Justified instead...at least Justin Timberlake acts his age! Nick Carter just sells out to the prepubescent girls, just like his little brother. They both disgust me. You have to have absolutely zero brain cells to listen to this CD---I was hoping America would be a little smarter than this. Obviously, we aren't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solo Album Sure To Amaze You!","review":"As a great music lover, I highly recommend this album. Nick's talent shines brightly through each and every song and note sung on this album. His venture into the rock-pop side of music is truly a fantastic move on his part - he sounds absolutely amazing. I really believe this man will continue with a bright bright career ahead of him, no matter what he ventures into. In one word, this album is amazing! Way to go Nick, I knew you could do it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"He is the best!","review":"This albuum is really awesome and I love it. Nick Carter is great with the Backstreet Boys but is even better without them. So i would highly recommend if you are a BSB fan to go and buy this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the album","review":"This album just shows how much Nick has grown musically. It has a rock/pop vibe. It's hard to come up with a favorite song but I love \\"I Stand For You,\\" \\"I Got You,\\" and \\"Miss America.\\" Must have for any Nick/Backstreet Boys fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"NIck Carter speads his wing!","review":"With a voice that soars and attitude to match Nick Carter hits the mark dead on. This album shows talent, maturity and growth for Nick Carter in his first effort as a solo artist. We all knew he could do harmony, now we can all hear him strut his stuff with his own style. It's fun, it's hip and it's great music. I recommend this CD to anyone with ears!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta get it now!","review":"This cd is awesome! Parts of it have a BSB sound, but some of the songs are completely diff, and give you an idea of what Nick is all about! The songs are fun, entergetic and romantic! I recommend it to EVERYONE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this CD, it's awesome!","review":"I really loved this whole entire CD, and I feel that Nick did a very good job of branching out from The Backstreet Boys. There were a few songs that were too Backstreetish for my liking, but the other material was great. \\"Miss America\\" is one of the best songs in my opinion due to the fact that it's mellow, but has some good lyrics. \\"Do I Have To Cry For You\\" is a nice song, but it seems too much like \\"I Need You Tonight\\" from Backstreet Boys CD, Millenium. The first single off of it, \\"Help Me\\" is the best song on this disc. It's a upbeat song, but some of the lyrics in this song are kind of nonsense, and don't make a lot of logical sense. Any fan of Nick's will love this disc. I give it five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome 1st CD","review":"It's been 3 years and my family and I still love this. Great job- Nick did not the get the credit he deserved on this one. He has much potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's either NOW OR NEVER!!!!!!!","review":"First off, I'd like to say congratulations to Nick Carter for accomplishing an amazing ability to not only be with a band for over ten years, but also to the fact that he sings well going solo! I mainly bought this CD because Nick is one of my favourite Backstreet Boys, along with Brian Littrell (even though he's unfortunately married!). Nick, continue on making hit solo albums as well as carrying on with the Backstreet Boys for many years to come! Oh, PLEASE come come back to Edmonton, Alberta on your NEXT Canadian Tour, along with your brother Aaron. I've some CD's for him to sign. You're better than Justin Timberlake!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nick Carter","review":"I am so glad that Nick Carter came out with a solo album! It is everything that I've expected and more. I love the rock/pop beat. I can not stop listening to it. \\"Do I Have To Cry For You\\" is so beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nick Carter solo CD Amazing!!","review":"Help Me was just the tip of the iceburg when it comes to Nick Carter's solo debut Now or Never. The songs get better as you go. Miss America is slow and sentual. Is It Saturday Yet? a possible anthem for our generation. The music is more rock influenced but suits Nick very well. You won't be disappointed in this CD. The added DVD is a must for a BSB fan! Congrats to Nick! I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD From a VERY Talented guy!","review":"This album surprised me as well. When I bought it, I figured it would sound R&B-ish or a bit boy-bandish-lollipop pop music and it turned out to be a rock album with Bryan Adams sounds and the lyrics weren't bad at all. It's a fun album to listen to with your sunroof and windows of your car open and blasting the sounds of Nick Carter's Now or Never. Two thumbs WAYYYYY UP!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"This album is awesome. All of his songs are so sweet especially \\"DO I Have To Cry For You\\" it is recommended to everyone there is no one out there that would be disappointed if they buy it"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars For Nick","review":"Backstreet Boy Nick Carter begins his solo career with a fantastic album. The first single, \\"Help Me\\", is catchy and has a great rock beat to it. The whole album itself has its own sound and cannot be compared to any of Backstreet Boys albums. His vocals accompany the new pop rock sound terrific. They sound great together because his voice has a rock tone to it. \\"I Stand For You\\" is another great rock example. Nick Carter has done well with first solo album."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOW OR NEVER is the bEST!!!!","review":"Hey to all you bsb/nick carter fans!! I just want to say that this album rocks, and to those of you that don't have it go and by it in stores today!! My favorite song is \\"Is It Saturday Yet\\"!! But All of the songs in this album rock!! These songs will shock you a little bit cuz it's not the nick carter that we're used to, but i guarenty you this will be a GOOD shock! The songs are sooo funny and they rock!! GO AND BUY THE ALBUM NOW OR NEVER!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now or Never - Nick Carter","review":"If you think this is going to be anything like the prior work of BSB then think again! Nick did what he set out to do and that was perform the music that \\"he\\" wanted to perform and performs he does! All 12 songs are orginal - no two sound the same nor do they have the same beat or tempo that some artists tend to do. You've got the ballads - which Nick excels at but you also have some rock, dance and just fun songs. If you want something different, something new, something fresh - then Now or Never is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"INCREDIBLE!","review":"This cd was alot more than I expected...I knew he had talent but, I'm so blown away as to his talent and the broad range of musical taste! I will enjoy this for years to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now or Never","review":"Nick's new CD is great. I got my copy yesterday, and I love it so much. The songs are really catchy and have great lyrics. Yay Nick! I totally reccomend buying this CD, regardless of whether you're a Backstreet Boys fan or not, it's totally worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"His dreams are coming true...","review":"Nick has made many of my dreams come true, from meeting him to being able to express my feelings through his music. I am so happy for him that he is doing something that he's always wanted to do. The CD is amazing, and I think that its great that he help write some of the songs. \\"Do I Have to Cry for You\\" and \\"My Confession\\" are my favorite songs, they reach something inside of you, something that's beyond music. Its amazing what his music can do and help you get through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD of 2002","review":"Nick Carter's new CD Now or Never isn't another Boy Band CD.This CD Rocks with a variety of sounds. From Aerosmith toBrian McKnight. It is a CD for all types of listeners. From softrock to pop, hip hop and a little rock. Nobody should be without this absolutely incredible CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nick Carter Review","review":"Other group members have tired to make a solo career, and they have failed. but Nick Carter is not one of them. his new album \`Now Or Never' is rocking. the songs on it have that rockish feel. but he still has that Backstreet Boy pop feel too. the way he uses his voice on \`Do I Have To Cry For You' is so moving. you can tell hes singing his heart out on that song. on the song \`Who Needs The World' is a great song. you can really hear his voice, its a nice easy going song to listen to. its a great acoustic song. his first single off his CD \`Help Me'. is a great song. its a song where young adults can relate to. on his CD, he wrote, co-wrote, and produced half thie songs on his album. he has a great talent for singing. and we hope to see if he has a second solo album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Album Since Black & Blue","review":"I'm prob. one of the biggest Backstreet Boys fans there is, so I was extremely excited when I heard about 'Now or Never.' From the first time I heard 'Help Me,' I knew this album would be great, and I was right. It has basically every type of music there is on it. With the ballads of 'Do I Have to Cry for You' and 'Heart Without a Home,' the mid-tempo sounds of 'I Got You' and 'My Confession,' and the upbeat sounds of 'I Stand For You' and 'Is it Saturday Yet,' who wouldn't love this album?! He shows his writing skills on every song he wrote and this album proves that with or without the Backstreet Boys, Nick's not going anywhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Help Me: Now Or Never","review":"Nick Carter has blown all the other songs out there to peices!! I mean \\"I Got You\\" is a great song and the best thing is he wrote it!! He also helped write \\"My Confession\\", \\"I Stand For You\\", \\"Do I Have To Cry For You\\", \\"Girls In The USA\\", and \\"Is It Saturady Yet?\\" I hope he keeps up with his solo thing hes got goin on! His music video \\"Help Me\\" is a GREAT Video! It shows him playing the guitar. My favorite song on the album is \\"Blow Your Mind\\" that song rocks! I hope everyone out there goes out and buys this CD! The weird thing about the CD is it has a ROCK beat and POP lyrics but thats a good thang! And Mr Vegas sings with Nick on \\"Girls In The USA\\" but thats all the guests thats on the album the rest is just Nick Carter...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mission accomplished!!!","review":"In a recent interview, Nick Carter said that he wanted to make music that would make people happy. He has very successfully accomplished that mission! This in an absolutely wonderful album. The songs are very fresh and original. I feel like I can see into Nick's soul as I listen to him sing. The bonus DVD is wonderful, too. It is about 30 minutes long, and includes candid interviews with Nick and a photo gallers, as well as the video for \\"Help Me\\". My favorite songs on the album are \\"Help Me\\" and \\"I Got You\\". If you are a Nick Carter fan, this is the album for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Holy mess what a joke! seriously the highest rated album on amazon is this piece of trash. Absolute junk, miserable. How did this get rated so high?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just for fans","review":"it is not really good...But there are one great song: \\"miss America\\". You have listen to it"},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"i loved his cd i was sad it didn't do better on the music charts and that he never released another cd. i saw him live and he was amazing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected","review":"I have never liked Nicks voice much but it's been 4 years and I'm still listening to NOW OR NEVER and liking it. Too bad Nick didn't get the recognition he deserved, guess you need rap producers to make it in this buisness now-a-days."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CD!!","review":"This is a wonderful CD.....I was kinda surprised that his voice was so raspy and sexy......he really sounds good singing rock type music.....anyway this is a wonderful CD and you should go get it....in fact while you are on Amazon got get.. NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW...or never.....lol....sorry I couldn't resist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Wow, what an absolute stunner! I can honestly say that there isn't a single track on the album that I don't like. There is something for everyone here and I have to say it is probably the most diverse album released in ages. Romping its way through melodic AOR with \\"Help me\\" and \\"I stand for You\\" et al.The place slows to a smooth bluesy feel with \\"Miss America\\" and turns slightly retro with the fantastic \\"Blow your Mind\\". Of course we have the obligatory rock ballads \\"Do I have to cry\\" and \\"Heart without a home\\" done with real feeling. \\"Is it Saturday yet?\\" will have you bouncing like an idiot!! Well Done Nick. I hope there is plenty more to come!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanna be Def Leppard???","review":"Girls In The USA = Pour Some Sugar on Me. Home you asked Leppard for permission.

You guys have to check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Get CD for any BSB Fan","review":"Nick Carter's first ever solo album is a huge success. It's songs are expertly written by Nick himself and a team of others. If You are a Backstreet Boys fan I would recomend you go straight out and pick up this Cd as soon as possible. You have your choice of the limited edition or just the normal cd. Either of them are geat. Enjoy such songs as Do I Have To Cry For You, Girls of The USA, and many others. Nick Carter is back big time in this new album. IF you enjoy Rock or Pop music I would say you need to get this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now Or Never","review":"I could describe this album easily with one word and that would be 'WOW'. The whole album has SUCH a unique vibe to it that I've found it impossible to put down! It's truly infectious and Nick Carter's vocals are outstanding!Here's my review of some of the songs on Now or Never (UK version):Help Me:The first single from the album and it's easy to see why! This song has awesome verses and a catchy chorus. You'll be humming it all day long!My Confession:This is one of the most unique songs out there in the music world today. Very, very good. One of my favourites!Do I Have To Cry For You:The second single from the album. This track shows Nick in a new light, his 'rocky' voice is beautifully showcased here and the song is full of passion.Who Needs The World:This is my favourite track out of all of them. It's just so beautiful and sweet and all that good stuff! Absolutely adorable! and the guitar that plays throughout is awsome!I love Now Or Never and I'm sure everyone else will too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent first solo cd...","review":"I'm not saying that everybody would like this cd, but if you enjoy the catchy rock-edged songs of Bryan Adams and Bon Jovi, as well as their infamous sappy love-songs, you'll most likely enjoy Nick's CD. You'll find yourself bouncing your head to songs like \\"I Stand for You\\" and \\"Blow Your Mind,\\" as well as letting out a little \\"aww\\" at the slower songs. \\"I Got You\\" is another one of my favorites - not a fast song, but not quite so slow to be considered a ballad. Bonus - the CD works otu great as an excercise CD :-P"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nick Carter NOW!!!","review":"Nick Carter's, Now or Never, expresses his amazing talent. Everysong is amazing. It is a definite must have! Each song expresses love and a little bit of edge. Since the Backstreet Boys he as matured and grown up and his music proves it. He's no longer a little boy, he's an amazing and talented guy with a great solo career in front of him. Now or Never is a ***** star success!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great solo debut","review":"Nick Carter's new solo debut \\"Now or Never\\" will let you know that it indeed is his time to shine NOW. The youngest member of the widely popular and successful group 'The Backstreet Boys' tests his writing skills with surprisingly rocking hits like \\"My Confession\\" and \\"I Stand For You.\\"The beautiful tracks \\"Do I have to cry for you\\" and \\"Heart Without a Home\\" definitely have a Bryan Adams feel to it that I'm sure you will enjoy. Nick's love of early 80's rock show best on \\"Blow Your Mind\\" and \\"Girls in the USA\\"Overall it's a great CD it has a little bit of everything so you can enjoy it whether you're into pop, rock, or punk. Nick proves to us he can stand on his own and I definitely recommend that you go pick up your copy today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nick Rocks Out","review":"Nick's new album is incredible and although it doesn't stray too far from the Backstreet sound, it's still got it's own flavor. Nick's branched out into the type of music he loves; rock and it sounds like a mix between Bryan Adams, Journey and the song \\"Blow Your Mind\\" even sounds like Orgy's remake of \\"Blue Monday\\". The cd is a little bit more personal sounding, and even though you may not be a hardcore Nick fan, Now or Never has a little something for everybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now or Never id NOW!","review":"When thinking of a Backstreet Boys without his boys everyone had thoughts of how good this Cd was going to be. His confidents was there to take the step from a band into the solo light, but this light is a bright spot light now put on Nick Carter! Now or Never his first solo album is a great mix of rock with a bit of pop flavor! Helping write lots of the songs brings his own sound to this album! what can you expect if for some reason you have not already picked up this hit CD? You can expect a brand new sound to the music world! The Cd might remind some of Bryan Adam's but better! This is the first of hopefully many more to come from Nick Carter! Its a great Cd and he did a great job making it! only love and respect to him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Carter's Debut is exactly what we expected","review":"The long waited Nick Carter debut carried no suprises. Many of the tracks, such as \\"Is it Saturday Yet\\" and \\"I Stand for You\\", echoed the inspirational band Journey while his ballads, such as \\"Do I have to Cry for You\\", were made up of the same emotion as a Bryan Adam's album. It is obvious through his lyrics that Carter has used many real life incidents in his music. He clearly has let off a lot of steam about girls and life in general. However, the album is not full of negative thoughts. He happens to leave a couple of mushy love songs to balance it all out. Carter, who has admitted in the past to looking to rock for inspiration, did an excellent job in demonstrating it. Although there doesn't seem to be a possibile \\"booty-shaking\\" dance routine in his up-coming tour (if a tour is scheduled), the album is a sure flight to a successful concert based on it's music and rock edge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hotter than Ever","review":"This is the best Cd ever forget about any solo artist it's all about NICK this cd is so hot that it makes me melt his voice is so awsome. This cd should be voted the best.... of the year. I think that this better than Elvis. I hope everyone gets a chance to listend to it before it runs out of the shelves. If anyone wants advise buy the CD now....yOu wont regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now or Never is an amazing start for Carter","review":"Nick Carter, the youngest member of the Backstreet Boys has proven himself in an amazing way on his new album Now or Never. He has taken the pop people are used to him singing and transformed it into a more rock type vibe that is very impressive. He mixes Bryan Adams sounding ballads with Bonjovi like rock songs which make every song a song worth listening to. Do I have to Cry for You , Nick wrote himself and is surely a ballad that brings out the talent he is capable of. It also is a song I am sure everybody can relate to in one way or another. The song American Girl definitely brings out the sexy side of Carter that we have been waiting to hear. All in all Nick has alot to be proud of. Anybody that hears this album will know that he has grown into a very, creative, talented musician that is sure to be around for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nick Carter's Debut!!!","review":"The first member to begin a solo career from the Backstreet Boys. With hard, electrified Rock beats and amazing vocals, He pulled this one off. My favorites include: The beautiful Power Ballad \\"Do I Have To Cry For You,\\" The hot Rock track \\"Girls In The USA,\\" and the first single \\"Help Me.\\" This album has some of the greatest songs on earth and some of my dislikes."},{"rating":"2","title":"NICK CARTER voice will blow you away!","review":"I bought the cd the very first day and had my cd player ready to go. I rapidly skimmed through the songs but as I got home i listened to them all completely. I was blown away at the style on the cd and how different it is from BSB. I am a huge bsb fan wbut was amazed it was so different. There are dance songs,beautiful ballads, even alternative sounding sounds. This cd will appeal to so many different people. And whatever you might think about BSB this guy can sing powerfully and blow your mind with the passion he puts in his voice in every sound. Buy the cd its worth the money and much more!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow Nick","review":"I bought this CD just because I'm a pop music fan and I figured it would be an \\"ok\\" buy. But whoa! This is a whole lot better than I anticipated. Truthfully, though, I have not heard every song on the album because Just listening through on the first listen, a few songs really popped out that I continuously play over and over again. \\"Help Me\\", \\"My Confession\\", \\"Miss America\\", \\"Heart Without A Home\\", and \\"I Just Wanna Take You Home\\" will have you hooked for months (or at least until Timberlake's album comes out)! Especially Miss America. There's hints of rock on the songs Nick cowrote and the songs by others are more pop-ish. So there's lots of influence on this album. Overall, a Top 10 of 2002, at least until the pop scene erupts which started last week with Nick and Christina and will be going on for a few weeks now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I think that Nick Carter has a great voice in the Backstreet Boys. But now he has brought his own flavor and talent to the music industry and i think it is awesome. I love all the songs on there and i love the rock flavor.I can't wait for him to do a tour because i will surely go and see him on tour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Variety of songs on \\"Now Or Never\\"","review":"\\"Now Or Never\\" by Nick Carter is a MUST buy. The album is absolutely incredible. This isn't your normal Backstreet Boys sound, it has a definite rock feel. There are some awesome upbeat songs like \\"I Stand For You\\" and \\"Blow Your Mind\\" and beautiful ballads like \\"Do I Have To Cry For You\\". I recommend this album for everyone to buy, you won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great solo debut!","review":"I was impressed by Nick's solo debut. It is well written, well produced and the he is most definitly moving towards a different sound. Nick Carter's vocals on the CD are amazing, however, at times, his voice does not seem to be a fit for the rock-driven songs. Overall, the CD is most definitly a successful debut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Album","review":"The solo album \\"Now or Never\\" by Nick Carter is in a word amazing. I was not prepared for what I heard as I listened to the cd in the car for the first time this afternoon. As the first few lines of \\"Help Me\\" played, I got ready to enter into Nick's world and learn about what he loves and his style. I was estatic with his honesty in \\"My Confession\\" and the free sprit in \\"I Stand For You\\" where Nick proclaims \\"I'm gonna have an attitude.\\" I sighed during \\"Do I Have To Cry For You\\" and rocked out during \\"Girls In The USA.\\" I felt like I was back in the 80's with \\"I Got You\\" and thought of the weekend during \\"Is It Saturday Yet\\". The contrasting sounds on \\"Blow Your Mind\\" and \\"Miss America\\" astounded me. As I got to the end of the cd with \\"I Just Wanna Take You Home\\" and \\"Heart Without A Home (I'll Be Yours)\\" I smiled at the fun, playful and sweet side of Nick and wanted more as the end of \\"Who Needs The World\\" played. All in all a great debut solo cd from Nick and deserves five stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nick Carter - Flying High With Solo CD","review":"As the first member of the most recognized boyband in the world to relase a solo CD, Nick Carter (Backstreet Boy extraordinaire) has just released an amazing sample of recent to-good-to be true tracks. Not only has he lent his own hand at writing the tracks but he's also put a little bit of himself and his own personal experiences within every song. From the first single 'Help Me' to the beautiful 'Who Needs the World' Nick shows fans how much he has developed as a singer and all around person. One notable track is 'Blow Your Mind', a song that would make even Journey jealous. For all the disbelievers out there...the day of reckoning has arrived and Nick has proved triumphant. For those of you who haven't bought this great album yet...I advise you to do so immediately!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now or Never","review":"I love this album. It takes you on a rollar coster of emotions. From the start with \\"Help Me.\\" and \\"My Confession.\\" you get to hear the awesome quality of his comanding voice. Next comes the fun part.....\\"I Stand For You.\\" and \\"Girls in USA\\" are so fun. You just want to play them as load as you can and sing along...like the rest of the album. But Nick also shows of his ballad voice with \\"Do i have to cry for you.\\" which my family think he sounds like Bryan Adams whenever i play it.This is an album that I will be listining to for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Album","review":"I was incredibly disappointed with Nick Carter's Now or Never. After hearing \\"Help Me\\", I was sure the whole thing would be brilliant. Especially with Max Martin being in on some of the music. But nope. I bought the album without previewing and it [is bad]. Justin Timberlake had praised Nick saying, \\"The world needs another Bryan Adams.\\" Okay, this is nothing like Bryan Adams. I was expecting heart felt, rock driven love ballads. There is only one like that: Do I Have to Cry for You. The rest is all loud guitar, voice shouting garbage. Nick, please have your head examined before you record anything else. Or go back to the Backstreet Boys. Ya know, stick to what you're good at."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"I'M SORRY BUT THIS ALBUM [is bad]!!!

As i sat in class waiting til the last bell rang so i could run out and get Nick Carter Solo Album CD i really began to wonder how the album was gunna sound! is it alot of pop? rock? some hip-hop ? of course being as Nick is a backstreet boy i defintley expected some pop it just wouldnt be nick without it but when i finally got my hands on Nick Carter Now Or Never i couldnt have been more thrilled ! i got at home and put it in my stereo faster then you could imagine. I sat there listening to the cd over and over again in tears ! WOW has nick grown up this album is absoutley amazing ! not only do many of the songs have that pop edge to them but theres ROCK too ! Seriously what more could you ask for? This Album is out of this world ! GO BUY IT TODAY !"},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected alot more...","review":"I REALLY wanted to like this CD...but I don't. I bought it for \\"Help Me\\" and the rest of the songs on it aren't at all like it. I agree that some of them sound like his little brother's. Nick was cute when he was younger before the weight gain, etc.But I love \\"Help Me\\"..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different and Refreshing","review":"This is a side of Nick Carter, formally of the Backstreet Boys, that changes what I first thought of him. The album is total 180 from his original pop status. And now he wants to be a ROCK star. He does have the voice for it. Even though he still has the soft ballads like \\"Do I Have to Cry For You\\" and a up-beat tune \\"Help Me\\", no one can blame him. Songs like that helped launch his singing career. The album really does make you think of him as an adult. If Nick Carter keeps this up, he just might get a new following.

It's a fresh and fun album that strays away from all the overproduced stuff you hear these days. A bit of good ol' 80s rock sound. Plus the DVD is fun too - I like the part in Stockholm (you finally get to see what Max Martin looks like, too!!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nick Rocks","review":"Always known as Nick Carter of the Backstreet Boys with this CD Nick will be making a name for himself. With a touch of pop and alot of good rock this CD is very good. I have listened to every song and still can't decide which is my favorite. His voice and the guitar make the rock sound very good. I would recommend this to people of all ages who like all kinds of music. Nick has definately grown not only as a man but as a performer. I hope to hear more from him in the future not only with BSB but also in his solo career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Singer","review":"I think all Justin Timberlake fans must listen this album.. so maybe they can learn what a REAL SINGER means"},{"rating":"2","title":"WoW!!","review":"Oh My God! This album is awsome! I think that this is the best album Nick ever made! It is so good that even guys get into it. Most of the time girls only listen to Nick Carter, Backstreet Boy, ect. basicaly boy bands, but this album changed it. Even my 18 year-old brother likes it. Nick's voice is amazing! By having Nick Carter do a solo album it brought out his vocie more because he is the only one singing (except his backup singers of course) and when he was in the Backstreet Boys there where 4 other voices. Most of the time when he was with the Backstreet Boys he didnt get that many parts to sing either. Here's a perfect example, in the song \\"The perfect Fan\\" Nick only had like 3 words he sang by himself. I can't wait for WBLI Winter Jam...so I get to see Nick sing songs from this album in concert!"},{"rating":"2","title":"now or never (nick carter)","review":"I thought the c.d. was wonderful and had a lot of nice beats and track #5 was one of my favorites even though all the songs rocked. it's the best c.d. ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those interested....","review":"This is available for download at Leonard & John's company website Alien VoicesIncredible to listen to, very reasonably priced MP3 version"},{"rating":"2","title":"DOYLE RULES!","review":"Arthur Conan Doyle is my favorite author and the 4 Star Trek series are my favorite television shows, so you can imagine my excitement when they combined the two in the Alien Voices version of The Lost World.

It is excellent. Tomas's lyrics have to be the best lyrics in any ska album, maybe even in any album. The instrumentation cannot be matched.

I saw Catch-22 a couple of monthes ago and I realized that their album Keasbey Nights was possibly the greatest ska CD out there. Their new stuff is ok, but nothing special. Basically, if you like Keasbey Catch-22, BUY THIS ALBUM. The lead singer of old Catch brings the old style back to the catchy ska rhythms. I love Streetlight and so will you, trust me. The song Point/Counterpoint is my favorite on the disc and it will remind you of the song Keasbey Nights from Catch-22, and I'm pretty sure is an add-on to that song (there are several things that make comments on the disc to old catch-22 songs).

I just recently purchased this camera after researching for several months. We were on a tight budget, so cost was important.

However, I was a medical photographer for a number of years, also a newspaper photographer and worked in hospital public relations. Have taken thousands of photos of all different kinds. The camera takes some time to get to know, but like any tool, once you know how to work your system, you can get amazing results. In other words, if you know what you are doing, you can get this camera to do just about anything with remarkable results.

The author clearly identifies the crossroads where we're standing these days, as the belief systems of our primitive past bump up against the future and its demands for a more generous, aware, and evolved species of human being. Wouldn't it be great if everybody woke up tomorrow morning with the understanding that all we've got is this one, beautiful planet, and it's up to us - not some government, pope, God or extraterrestrial delegation - to figure out how to live on it harmoniously?

The plots are well done with just enough twists to keep your interest. The acting is solid in both but I actually liked Wesley Snipes better than Harrison Fords version. Robert Downey is solid in US Marshals and makes it better because of his acting. Tommy Lee is his usual scene chewing character but always fun to watch. As a 2 film set this is a real bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love thse movies","review":"It was nice to find this as an inexpensive double movie set.

His face is suited for drama. He makes you believe.Having two movies on one disk is very convenient. Good thinking.Also, Harrison Ford is a darn good actor, although in real life he has the personality of a tomato.

I was anxious to see this watch in operation, as it looks good in photos (I liked the direct simplicity) but which also had reviews which gave a mixed impression. Disappointed! Like another reviewer noted, the second hand lines up between marks, which is inexcusable in a watch of this price. This watch came without a manual (which I needed to figure out the 24-hour hand), although I was able to find it online. This is a watch which will go into rotation with an original Victorinox Swiss Army watch and a Casio atomic-time G-Shock, a watch which remains my reference watch, and still the preferred choice. After leaving the watch overnight, I awoke to find that the 24-hour hand had lost half an hour. This watch is undependable, and frankly, a piece of garbage.

Of the many truck books for young boys, this one is especially appealing for a few reasons:-Simple, bold illustrations are easy to look at.-Just one sentence per page makes the book great for short attention spans.-In very simple language, the book introduces different kinds of trucks and their purpose.

Put it down and read some of his later works. Then, if you think you'd like more of Dr. Jessica Coran, give it a go. Mr. Walker has put together a book that was painful to read at times. I say this as an individual who grew up in Hawaii. It's obvious that he's intoxicated with the magic of the islands, but, yikes!, leave the local pidgin, culture and language to the Convention & Visitors Bureau. The whole series of \\"Instinct\\" books are somewhat formulaic: young, gorgeous (but) brilliant foresenic medicine expert/FBI agent must confront and overcome monstrous perps. Male counterparts learn to appreciate and treasure this jewel of a woman, and when they do, they betray, they worry, they love, etc., etc.If you are a fan of Dr. Scarpetta or \\"good ole\\" V.I. and need some kind of fix in between novels, this'll do in a pinch."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Interesting book","review":"I had ever read some Walker's book yet, but i've got a bit impressed.

The first two were good enough to keep my interest until I finished the book. This book however, I could put down several times. I thought it was quite boring. The writing had more to do with Hawaii than the killer or Jessica Coran. I found the killer to be quite boring and not that interesting. The ending of this book also was a dissapointment.

Some things are identicle, but it's all new material and jokes. It is a great laugh and well worth listning to over and over and over again. I do recoend the London show over this one, but thats not to say I don't recomend this album. It is P*** funny... but definitly not for the faint of heart. There is a lot of naughty words and jokes, and your great grandmother would be rollin gin her grave if she heard this album.. and thats why I love Kev's comedy so much.Also check out Rodney Rude & John Valby if you like KBW."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautifully written and emotionally powerful book","review":"Mildred Walker is a suburb writter who can span the entire emotional spectrum of humanity.

The colors that vary in the landscape that changes from season to season and even time of day she does not capture as fully as my family and I did, but then one of my daughters is a painter and sees things like an artiest that see then gets you to see.

Winter Wheat was written in 1944 and is set in about 1941, I think. It's enjoyable to see how a 1940's author writes on ageless human topics tactfully and compare how a similar topic would be presented today.On another note, being involved in wheat production on the high plains, it was touching to see how some things stay the same (weather & chaff in my sandwich) and how farming differs today.The ending didn't jazz me up much, but then this is a literary novel I suppose and quite short on vampires, zombies & princesses.

It really lacks the energy and the coherence of the previous album. The tracks in general are a little slower. The production quality is overall about the same, but it is just not as \\"listenable\\" as Believe was. The exception I find on the album is the \\"Club Mix\\" of \\"Turn It Around.\\"But if we think about that for a second, aren't we talking about \\"club music\\" here afterall? Are we under any pretenses that this is elevator or lobby music? I should think not. What we expect from this band, and from a second album is an equal or better effort at club music. House-ish, trance-ish, and anthemic.

Unfortunately, it failed to deliver much for me. If I had to put my finger on it, I'd say the band was trying too hard this time to play it safe. A couple of the tracks drift well into pop, and very soft pop at that. Two of the tracks start brilliantly, only to lumber along with minimal development, or worse, be destroyed by lyrics (\\"when dolphins cry\\"? yikes...).

I was also displeased with the lack of Vanessa's vocals which shine from beginning to end on their debut \\"Believe\\", so where is she now?the vocalists on this album excluding Vanessa are off key and flat at times.

The Supremes selection are good although only a handful of the classics included. The more gritty soul tracks are left out here like \\"Love Child\\", \\"Someday We'll Be Together\\" and \\"I'm Living In Shame\\" which represents Ross' diversity as an artist.

Her recollection during her years with the Supremes such as Baby love, Where did our love go and You cant's huryy love are also here. It is interesting to see her singing along with the likes of Mariah Carey in Baby love and Stop in the name of love.All I can say is that, she has been an inspriration for many new artist around.My all time favourite will always be Endless Love, her duet with Lionel Richie.

OK, I am on a roll now ... where is \\"Last Time I Saw Him\\" or \\"The Wiz\\" or the UK and Aussie No. 1 \\"My Old Piano\\" (from 1980)?I can assure you, even Ms Ross wouldn't be happy with this pitiful effort. After seeing her in concert in Sydney in 1991, I realised how fantastic her treasure trove of songs is. And yes, all the ones I mentioned above were part of her concert ... but not part of this joke of a CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable Aerobed","review":"Compact travel bagPuncture resistantQuick to set upFits standard size beddingRapid deflationEasy to re-packWe enjoyed being able to carry an extra bed on long trips.

At least two tracks go to silence right in the middle of the song.Second, the bass isn't that fat. The sound cuts you hear above are the best parts of the songs.

I was sadly mistaken. From now on I will preview cd's before buying them. Well now I cant cause they took out Napster. The guy who said that this album sounds like Enigma and Deep Forest is mostly correct. Except that Enigma and Deep Forest sound better cause they have more concentrated beats. The 1st two tracks sound like something from the game \\"Wipeout\\". After that it just get's repetitive and boring. Also, in one of later tracks there is a long silence in the middle of the song. The Cd wasnt even manufactured correctly. My advice, steer clear of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your Money, This is JUNK!","review":"This CD is nothing but re-blended Enigma beats with Deep Forest passages and cheesy-demonic vocals half spoken.

Written by two Spanish-speaking dudes who definitely didn't get any help on the grammar side of things, and anyone who buys this at a brick-and-mortar store has no excuse for not knowing what they're getting into. A quote from the back cover: \\"One day you realize that god and devil are the same soul playing our lives...\\" Not \\"the devil\\", not \\"Devil\\"... just \\"devil\\". Exactly.The music is just as hilarious as the lyrics, second only to the photography and artwork as the funniest aspect of the album. The main composer puts himself in poses that harken back to Thriller-era Michael Jackson, and the other dude is in every case shown only in low-resolution shots, placed in random places for no reason I can fathom.I would suggest downloading it, but I can't for the life of me think of who would support such a torrent.

I saw very little life in their dancing or their facial expressions. Their dances may have been historically and technically accurate, but they lacked the spark and vibrancy that I expect to see in a Middle Eastern Dancer.

I don't have a clue why reviewers here thought it was so good. I should have known better and bought the O'Reilly book to start.Most of the text consists of dry run throughs of various configuration settings - much of which probably came right from the online Apache manual. There were many errors. And, contrary to reviewers who claimed the author was open for questions, when I sent email asking about possible errata, the email was returned with an invalid address. The author's web site is also gone.I also was unhappy that there was next to nothing about Java servlets and Apache.The O'Reilly book got so-so reviews, but I can't imagine how it can be worse than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find something better","review":"This is a 600-page tome that gives you just enough information to make you very dangerous, and a bunch of non-sensical dialog that could have been left out. The book is also full of embarrassing errors and glaring contradictions. My favorite, in the mod_perl section is, \\"...when using mod_perl to run CGI scripts you cannot use ScriptAlias\\" followed very shortly by \\"You should also have a ScriptAlias directive...\\" The author probably knows a lot about Apache, but unfortunately is ineffective at teaching, a drawback particularly for novices reading his book.

The Macintosh version is not mentioned at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"We were almost bowled over.","review":"This is another book review from Wolfie and Kansas, the boonie dogs from Toto, Guam. The narrator of Tibor Fischer's novel \\"The Collector Collector\\" is a 5,000-year old ceramic bowl. (Since the bowl never divulges its name, we'll refer to it below as Mr. Bowl.) Mr. Bowl relates both its present-day adventures with Rosa, a London art appraiser, and numerous tales about other humans it has known in the past several millenia.This book is very clever, and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny. The modern human characters and the situations they get themselves into are consistently amusing. Some of Mr. Bowl's flashbacks are fascinating. There is only one thing missing here. In 5,000 years of existence, Mr. Bowl apparently never served as a dog food bowl. At least he does not recount any tales of memorable canines. Don't Mr. Bowl and Mr. Fischer know that the two most famous bowls or bowl-like objects in the history of literature are a Grecian urn--and Snoopy's supper dish"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait 'Till It Comes Out In Cliff's Notes","review":"I can't make up my mind whether this book was written in the tradition of Pynchon and Barth to be taught in college English classes rather than read, or whether it's a Martin Amis-style wink-and-a prayer pot boiler with pretensions. The idea of having the narrator be a thousands-of-years-old bowl who comments on the action by relating stories of previous owners is rich in narrative possibility, which Fischer eschews in favor of semi-clever word play. The near total reliance on scenes of sexual activity and drug use to advance the narrative is a major fault. A better writer might have been able to pull it off but Fischer never gets beyond the banality of hipness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, if not especially compelling","review":"Who wouldn't love a talking bowl? Tibor Fischer's offbeat plot and attractive prose easily carry this breezy book through a series of not-too-adventurous adventures. It's fun to read, but there isn't a lot of meat."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is no \\"X\\" in espresso.","review":"In a world where I am constantly amazed and sometimes irritated by the inability of the average writer to obtain a firm grasp on the English language, this book is a refreshing reminder of its power to prod the imagination. The Collector Collector is amusing and penetrating in the observations it makes on the human condition throughout time. All this by way of a multi-faceted bowl. Absolutely lovely bit of prose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satirical Imagination","review":"\\"The Collector Collector\\" is a veritable, dark comic medley about life, love, success, failure, etc... Fischer, like Tom Robbins (and a semi-obscure writer named J. Joyce) before him, uses unbridled structural imagination and hybridization as the central vehicles to express his protagonist's vaguely normal existence in a sea of eccentricity. This book deserves considerable attention, if nothing else, for the author's choice of narrator; the wise and discerning urn. For all it's whimsical satire, this novel presents deep sobering insight into contemporary society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky!","review":"The beginning of this story wasn't as interesting as I had expected, but as you read on and get engrossed in the story, it becomes a truly enjoyable experience.

This was Miss Ross' third album for RCA, after her departure from Motown 3 years earlier. The album contains two singles, \\"Pieces of Ice\\", which barely made the top 30, and \\"Let's Go Up\\". Although this was Diana's least successful and most overlooked album she released during her RCA era, it is said to be one of her best by most fans. The entire album is excellent! Not to mention the dance track \\"That's How You Start Over\\". This 2005 EMI Japan reissue of Ross (1983) contains all 8 tracks from the original album, with original artwork inserts and lyrics, both in English and Japanese. I give the original album 5 stars, although I give the 2005 CD reissue 4 stars, as the sound quality could be a little better, especially since Japanese CD's are known for their outstanding sound quality, but it's still good!

The Jason 6-in-1 Beard & Skin Therapy, After Shave, is a very pleasant after shave, natural and organic, alcohol-free, which soothes redness and irritation.

It really wasn't worth the money for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ineffective and smelly","review":"I tried the Jason shaving lotion because I've been looking for an effective, hypoallergenic shaving lotion that doesn't squirt out of an aerosol can. This product smells strongly of chamomile and an incense-like smell. That may be okay for a hand soap, but I don't want that smell on my face. Most shaving creams and even natural hand soaps lubricate better than this product. The lotion doesn't rinse off as easily as most shaving creams or liquid soaps.

From the first-hand accounts I have heard from my friends, I believe Lost Names accurately describes conditions for the common Korean citizen during the Occupation period.Through the entire book, I believed I was reading the author's autobiography. I didn't realize that was not the case until I read the Author's Note on the last page. I kept wondering why, since these were his memoirs, the author didn't write in the past tense.For me personally, the book would have been easier to read if it had been written in the past tense.

The very last moment when Abbado finishes and pauses, was very touching. Now I'm a crazy fan of Mahler thanks to them and this quality blu-ray.

WHEW! I was blown away. This is one trippy movie! Imagine H.R. Giger & \\"Dark Crystal\\" era Jim Henson working together on a CGI fantasy / adventure & you'll get an idea of what this is. One of my biggest surprises was how great Kirsten Dunst's voice acting is in this film. She's required to say some pretty crazy sci-fi dialogue & she manages to make it all seem quite natural & believable. Perhaps Kirsten should overdub Natalie Portman's dialogue in the Star Wars prequel special editions. Anyway, the story for Kaena-The Prophecy is actually interesting & requires an attention span to follow. (A very rare thing for modern animation) Essentially, this is everything the Final Fantasy movie from a few years ago should have been. If you love animation & sci-fi / fantasy, check it out as soon as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story","review":"I first saw this on a pay-per-view channel on cable.

Well written and the facts seem to strongly support the author's theories. It is my belief that if Atlantis did indeed exist, that James Mavor's book provides the most compelling argment for it's whereabouts.The premise that Plato's dates are off by multiplication of 10 is very interesting, and the author shows several examples of this discrepancy. This is the foundation of a theory that puts Atlantis in the Agean Sea on the volcanic island of Thera.It seems that this IS the answer everyone is looking for, but all of the proof is not complete. It's unfortunate that the Greek government will not allow massive underwater exploration of this area. Hopefully someday someone will get the chance to further explore Mavor's theory and the legend of Atlantis will be solved."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS IRON","review":"I have been a fan of the Black & Decker Irons. When my last one quit on me I decided to branch out and see what was out there. After reading the reviews I settled on the T-Fal 18301. The most positive thing about this iron was that it provided lots of steam; there are no more positive recommendations. Negatives: 1)There is no off/on button. This irons decides when it will come on and when it will shut off. At the end I could not even hang up a shirt without it shuting down on me. Then it was plug and un-plug to get it back started. 2) The water tank needed constant refilling. One shirt/pants only before refill. 3) At the end it would not even cut itself on. I purchased this iron 12/29/2002. I placed it in the garbage can 08/24/2003. It was a waste of money and time. DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT buy this iron.

This is the first in a trilogy and I plan to read the other two in 2010. Although written a few years ago it stands up perfectly well today. Moore paints pictures you might have seen before but with brush strokes beyond the pale of most people's imagination. The characters are well constructed and may remind you of people you know, if not yourself.

It reads like a PR job. It has none of the style or character of Defoe. Some will find it fun but it is no good for a Defoe book.Ironically the excellent American Defoe scholar John Robert Moore attributed the book A General History of the Pyrates to Defoe, but later scholars dismissed this on the grounds that its style did not resemble that of the King of Pirates! The style of A General History of the Pyrates (Volume One at least) seems definitely Defoe's and that is the book to recommend to Defoe fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-preservation being the supreme law of nature","review":"This book has very few substance.

For instance, in the Crater, you can morph a Tonberry into a Ribbon. This is extremely useful and it's not mentioned in the guide.

I spoke directly with the company and the moisturizer does in fact contain a by-product of horse meat. They are currently formulating a vegan alternative. Personally, I don't want to support a company that uses dead horses in any of it's products and it's very clear the only reason they are coming out with a vegan alternative is that they are motivated by economic gain, not because they genuinely care about animal welfare."},{"rating":"1","title":"dead horse in a bottle","review":"First, I love Dr. Ohhira's probiotics and have taken them for years.

There are many duets in this book which coincide with the pieces learned in Violin Book 1, \\"The ABCs of Violin for the Absolute Beginner.\\" I recommend getting both books.To sum it up, this duet book brings great happiness to violin players who play this lovely music together.

If you are looking for a collection with a particular feel you might want to single out one of thier albums. However, if you're looking for a hits collection with a broad range of 311's music style over the years look no further. Good stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"I've been an off and on 311 fan since Grassroots and I just found out they released a Greatest Hits CD. Wow. They must be desperate for cash. I'm trying to understand why bands release their so-called greatest hits when they're still active. It's a similar move we saw from the Red Hot Chili Peppers not too long ago - grab a dozen of your most popular songs and attach a single (to attract those of us who already own every one of their albums) and call it a greatest hits album. There are so many great 311 hits left off this album. They failed to include anything prior to their self-titled break-through to mainstream album. How can you leave off tracks from Grassroots and Music? I have to force myself to believe this is the record label trying to squeeze cash from the ill-advised consumer. I will never buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it ZERO stars if I could...","review":"Lord, this band sucks so bad! They make me cringe so hard when I hear them. A bunch of stupid white boys who think they're black/and or Jamaican. I hate when white boys talk with a Jamaican accent, how ridic is that?? And when they try to rap I wanna jump outta window. Anyways, 311 is, was, and always will be a terrible band; a band that has never quite \\"gotten it\\". They are absolutely NOT \\"one of the greatest alternative bands ever\\". Please! That lofty position is reserved for bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam, etc. *NOT* 311. If you have to be stoned to think they're great, then they suck. Get over it."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST BAND EVER!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"There are probably some bands out there who suck worse on a song to song basis, but 311 have been terrorizing the airwaves for years, sucking longer than anyone else dared dream. They have an amazing three pronged attack, combining the the most annoying singer ever with the most annoying rapper ever, and utterly uninspired instrumentation. No other band I've heard can write choruses that are as consistently grating as 311 do. And they're incedibly repetitive, as most of the choruses they do sound exactly the same, and EVERY rap passage they do sounds completely indentical. Also, that Cure cover that they did is THE MOST BORING SONG EVER, yet it is arguably the best song of there's I've heard. Merely being boring is about as much as 311 can hope for. Thank God I never, ever listen to the radio anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Band","review":"I really dont know how to define 311, as there style of music seems to be combitnations of different generes. This are however, a pretty solid band, and one that has managed to be around 10+ years, giving us some pretty cool tunes. Yes, they are a bit poppy, but they are so much better then Good Charolee, Blink 182, and Green Day, which most people seem to compare them with. I howerver disagree, because they really dont have much \\"Punk\\" in them, its almost like a funk with some hip-hop flavor, then combine with some Reagee and ROCKnROLL. This happens to be the best of the bunch of their songs, and one of my personal favorites, \\"Amber\\" If you arent familer with the band, I think you will really dig this, no matter what kind of music you like.>ENJOY"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't take them so seriously, they're just a fun band","review":"311 takes the best ingredients from a variety of different genres, makes it their own, writes some terrifically catchy songs and then laughs all the way to the bank.They have the crunch of hard rock and grunge, the dueling vocalists (a singer and rapper) ala Linkin Park that invokes hip hop, the virtuostic bass ( I love their bassist P -Nut) eliciting a dub feel, and the melody of a pop group. Their singer has matinee good looks and is an entertaining front man (explaining why they are a powerful concert draw). Put it all together and it should be a no surprise why this group is so successful.Anybody that is a hard core fan of rock will think of them a sell out, of hip hop thinking theoir posers and of reggae thinking they don't measure up to par.

Why ask for guidance from ur dead drunk father, he is still a drunk. Meaning his level of thinking is still the same.

For the Tibetans the natural reincarnation process is too random. So, to make sure that Dali Lama upbringing would not be wasted on an ignorant peasants family they went and got him.

Lennon, we are told, was also Robert Browning as well as Mozart in previous lives which certainly seems like a bit of overkill fame-wise. The dialogue is terribly corny, and the constructed experiences seem to often come out the author's children's book imagination.

The universal theme of someone trying to change their bad habits should have wide appeal although some women may not enjoy watching Zack's womanizing. What really counts is that he changes.

His intoduction to alcohol is a significant experience that led to years of constant drinking and eventually his death. It is great background for a Bukowski fan or even a first time reader. I would recommend reading this novel first and Women soon after. They both explain his life well. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ham on Rye","review":"It\`s a very good novel with a very distinctive style which makes the story much more interesting.It also reflects the society at that time with realism and meaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite; Bukowski widsom","review":"This is a great book. It outlines young age in a way seldom seen in film and literature. It is dark, true, and a vivid read, depicting youth in all its colors-- or the ones Chinaski, A.K. Bukowski, \\"Laureate of Skid Row\\", it seems breathed.It tells young Chinaski's tale from birth to about 20, whereupon, from battling daily a \\"sadistic\\" father, or just living an isolated or pensive, vulgar childhood, he hit the US roads, entering into a sort of Kerouaic, boozy and starved depression-era existence.The meaning, Ham on Rye, stands for-- that I got from, from [his] friend/editor John Martin, in the film biography on the author Born Into This,-- either the economy-style sandwich, or a ham or showboat-type fellow on rye whiskey. It sums up the tale in a small way.Overall great read, I read it 3 or 4 times; one of Bukowski's best novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pattie P","review":"I give this book one star (only because my review could not go through without giving it at least one star). I found this book to be very unworthy of any stars, which is surprising, as I feel all books have a value - but not this one. I read about one-fourth of the book while on a trip and turned off my Kindle, as I found the \\"story\\" content to be anything but enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the calories!","review":"Ham on Rye was such a disappointment.

Wouldn't recommend this as an investment in time."},{"rating":"1","title":"one lousy sandwich","review":"this was my first charles bukowski book and it is unlikely i will go back for seconds. the writing is unimaginative and there is no character developement whatsoever. the main character, henry chinaski, has no redeeming qualities. his childhood is not that much different from most except for the severity of his acne problem. his response to that childhood is chronic violence and alchoholism. he literally becomes what he detests and is even worse. if this is supposed to be a coming of age novel like catcher in the rye, it falls miserably short. holden caulfield is searching for something and has positive intentions. chinaski has none of this...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close to a \\"good read\\".","review":"I read it all, hoping to find a paragraph or two worth reading. No luck. The dialogue, and the attitudes of the characters, certainly were not representative of the era.( BTW I was reared during the Depression and responded to the call for Service).A bio? I suggest there is much fiction here , especially in the college episodes and the dialogue. On second thought, an overwhelming amount of fiction, written for shock value, in which it failed.In fairness, I have not read the author\`s other works. I may, but I am not in a great hurry to do so.They may be worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cruel Juvenile Realism","review":"What I liked about this novel is it's representation of cruel juvenile realism. For children this kind of cruelty seems real. Adults hate you. Your parents hate you. Your peers hate you. You are ugly and stupid. Women don't want you unless you can give them a nice illusion of the future. All these realities are things we all experienced. In childhood you are controlled by your fears. Then your fears become your reality. There is so much drama growing up. Then there is the horrible boredom when you reach adulthood. These trapped feelings leave a sour taste in your mouth. The economy beats you up. The stupid wars beat you up. Your job beats you up. Your family and friends beat you up. OMG! That's what I got from this novel. That feeling of OMG like I had as a kid. Life really is a vile thing when you strip out the hope. But individuals have more control over their happiness than they realize. It seems to take a whole lifetime to figure that out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dirt-filth-horror-salvation","review":"Yeah, I probably understood the idea of the \\"noble drunk\\" before I read this. I may have even been one; in a manner of speaking. I was definitely drunk. Buckowski likes to read and drink and tell what's on his mind. These qualities make him a clear-cut role model for the aspiring drunken hipster, as he sets a template for behavior that is amoral, yet ethical. He doesn't stand for phony-baloney golden rulism, just honesty and willfullness. In a way, he can be read as a sort of Buddhist in the way he recognizes his own id as well as the ids of others. This book is simply one of the best chapters in what is really one gigantic work that spanned his lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"I never knew that ugly could be so beautiful.","review":"What can I say, this book is brilliant. I would recommend this as a starting point for anyone getting into Bukowski. I read Betting On The Muse first, and I couldn't quite appreciate his poetry until after I'd read this. Hank Chinaski is the embodiment of everyman's underbelly. Sometimes raunchy and inappropriate, other times excruciating and vulnerable, but always completely honest. This one should be required reading for all of mankind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing text in Kindle edition","review":"Wonderful and essential book for any Bukowski fan. The kindle edition has missing text on Location 4558 (page 298).The sentence reads: Both his hands gripped the sides of the machine, as he tried to guide the ball with body-English.I have no idea how much content has been omitted. I wrote a complaint to tech support. I'll update this review if I get a notice that it's been corrected.Update: I got an email from tech support that they acknowledge the problem and that the editor is going to fill in the missing content. I will be notified when that will be complete, upon which time I'll write an update again."},{"rating":"2","title":"So funny.","review":"Obviously the guy who said \\"real real real real horrendously unspeakably bad\\" doesn't know Bukowski.I thought the book was hilarious and sometimes it was the only thing that could make me laugh all day.It was the first book I've ever read by Bukowski but it instantly made me a fan.Since then I've read many of his other books and this one is still my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"brutally honest","review":"My buddy said \\"here, read this book\\" so I did. I loved it ,I read the whole book in one day. This was the first book in a long time that actualy made me laugh out loud.I've read a lot of his other books since and felt the same way. Charles was a total lush, and it all started in this book, when he told of his first glass of wine.Be careful, reading his books makes you wanna drink(a lot more if you already do)a lot. Charles bukowski was heavily influenced by Celine,and if you have ever read DEATH ON THE INSTALLMENT PLAN by Celine, you will notice some huge similarities in the way they were constructed,the short and abrupt sentencing, and tastful vulgarity and shameless self criticism. Read this book, then read WOMEN, then watch the movie BARFLY,(which is about Bukowski's life) then read HOLLYWOOD(which is about the making of the movie). Then read everything else. Bye, I,ll be home soon"},{"rating":"2","title":"so great!!","review":"this was the first bukowski novel i every read. i haven't read a book so quickly since 3rd grade. i swear. this book is sooo fabulous i love it. i have referred it to so many of my friends and i have continued with Chinaski's life. it's so great to follow him ( beginning with this book, moving on to \\"Post Office\\" then \\"Women\\"). you can really learn alot about Bukowski through his writings. i have fallen in love with this most bizarre and unique writer. if you are interested in bukowski but don't know where to start, i suggest this one!!

When this happens, Ham on Rye will be justly hailed as one of the greatest novels of the 20th century. Until that happens, those of us in the know will just have to keep the faith, keep telling people of Buk's genius, keep praying for those poor, misguided Ph.Ds with their dry-as-death, dead-weight tomes and their sorry, miserable theories of literature.Bukowski is so real that he scares the phonies shitless.The king is dead!

The movie fell apart for me midway through when two of the main characters get into an argument following an unconsummated adult encounter in a hotel room. Their argument is bitter, nearly endless, and makes you dislike the more spiteful of the two characters intensely.The first half of the movie balances entertainment and realism well. The second half of the movie loses the balance and is a chore to watch, primarily as one of the main characters, a college instructor, becomes whining, depressive, and intolerable."},{"rating":"1","title":"But there's one saving grace!","review":"I'll level with you...this is a lame movie with mediocre acting & totally uninteresting characters. It starts out strong & shows some promise but, just give it another 10 minutes....your thumb will find the eject button. HOWEVER, there is one saving grace....her name is Lacey Chabert! Trust me, guys (and girls who like other girls), you should really rent this flick just to see the delicious Lacey in rare form! This adorable morsel (who was age 23 at the time of filming in 2005), absolutely has one of THE Best figures I've ever seen!! Unfortunately, we don't get to see all of her (which is seriously weak for an unrated film!) but, our girl does juuuust fine. Skip to chapters 9 & 10, and see if you agree. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lacey Chabert is Dirty Dirty Dirty in this Movie!","review":"This movie is off the planet! I watched it twice the first time I saw it. Lacey Chabert is sooo dirty in this movie. She snorts coke in a car and screams \\"I'm so wet! I'm so wet!\\" as she prepares to golden shower the seat. And that's before she starts getting really raunchy at the Big Cock Inn, complete with giant plaster rooster. Lacey Chabert was the best thing in Mean Girls and this is her best movie yet. This movie has lesbians, cults, lesbians, drugs, lesbians with guns, Meatloaf with drugs and a gas station where the clerks are Debbie Downer and Jay from Clerks.

The happy ending with Doc and the hooker is totally implausible if you take into account the way this man was portrayed in Steinbeck's other works. \\"Sweet Thursday\\" does not detract from the qualities of \\"Cannery Row\\" - but it certainly left me wondering just what possessed Steinbeck to ignore the truism that certain books (this is one of them) are best left unwritten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very detailed and informitive.","review":"Great book if you want to know every minute detail about Dien Bien Phu.

I thought the best reading of the entire book was the last two chapters where the author threw off the formalities and gave a good overall picture of the French defeat. It seemed to take forever to get there though. The Finale, detailing the journeys of those that escaped was also fascinating. As well as the Postface, \\"Where are they now\\".

The product has a solid, substantial feel to it and appears to be well made.

The most interesting thing about this book, has to be the insight into Spock's father, Sarek. You read about motivations, and actions that shaped Spock.

Nevertheless, nowhere else you will find a book more powerful and more profound on this theme.

The media consistently choose to identify them with a small handful of violent, isolated sociopaths with no connection to the mainstream pro-life movement. I know on a certain level that a program in which the doting dad is Satan isn't exactly meant to be taken entirely seriously, but that makes the distortions all the more insidious and difficult to address. Can you imagine the series portraying, say, feminists, environmental activists, Jews or Moslems in the same sickly distorted light? For that matter, can you imagine them being told afterward to lighten up because its just a horror series?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty sad...........","review":"This episode was okay, at least it didn't have sucky endings like all the others. They' could've at least shown what happened to the brother and the girl's dad. Good plot, a girl being pregnant by a Devil from Hell, now shes in a hospital and the Devil broke in from underground.

They have clips of early Genesis performances, but they are usually only shown for about 30 seconds and then they cut off. However, there is one redeeming thing about this DVD: The entire 30-minute Belgian television concert from March 1972 is included as a bonus feature. This concert is a must-see for any lover of early Genesis. Unless you have access to bootleg material, you probably have never seen this show in its entirety. It's worth checking out.

And I find it well-written, and honestly thought provoking.But it has a tone - a certain tone, that troubled me from the beginning. I was unable to name it, until near three-fourths of the way through the book, when the author distilled my discomfort for me. Reciting her journal, she says:\\"It will never be possible for me to answer the question, 'What is the greater tragedy? Douglas Miller Jr.'s murder or Jason Kent's life without parole sentence?\\"This troubles me greatly, as I have no difficulty discerning the relative societal gravity of those two events.But it was bold of her to write of her painful experiences, and though I may disagree with the perspective, it is worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting book but not for me","review":"I certainly could sympathize for these parents but one thing I found disturbing was that they could not seem to put themselves in the position of the victim's family.

I kept waiting for them to make some kind of a gesture to the victim's family but none seem to be made. While I feel for their grief for something their son did that was not their fault, I would have felt more sympathy for them had they made any kind of a step to help the victim's family.

To be honest, I started the book and became quite impatient and skipped page after page after page trying to get to the actual story and found it somewhere toward the end. I never did read the entire book, I couldn't wade through it.

I estimate that about 85-90% of this book talks about how to find faith and keep going, or about OTHER people's tragedies. Very little of this book actually focuses on Jason Kent or how his mother handled the events as they happened. In the end, I just felt that slightly deceive.

I think Winston has created a splash - I am waiting for the sequel or at least the movie to go with this. Based on the book, I'd put the author into the leagues of the Tomm Clancy's and Michael Crichton's. A must read for anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Classic Cover and 1 Good Song.......","review":"I've heard this CD in another copy that I sold. I bought a brand new copy for saving as a collectible. The only good song is \\"Muscles.\\" The cover and having this CD for its rarity value is better than the music. I luv Miss Ross to death, but I just don't like most of her RCA recordings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland and boring","review":"Silk Electric is Diana Ross' 2nd most boring album from her RCA days (the most boring album being the Red Hot album). Muscles is a great song and I'm probably one of the few fans that LOVES Fool For Your Love, a song where Diana tries heavy metal and surprisingly it works (should have been the second single IMO). Still in Love is an OK ballad, but the rest of the album is just a snoozer. The track Turn Me Over is just a stupid interlude telling the listener to turn the record over (from the days you had to flip vinyl and cassettes). So I would say skip this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"Silk Electric is more or less a forgotten Ross album and most of what I've read about it has not been positive. It seems to be considered boring and mediocre and while the material is not brillant there are lots of great 80's type ballads on here. Not really on a par with her previous Why Do Fools Fall in Love album, or with her Motown work, but not as bad as it has been made out to be either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, horrible product","review":"My son received this for Christmas. It plays a sound when you put a piece in the puzzle, but the sounds sound nothing like the instruments that are pictured. I think there's only one sound that it plays, and it just adds different distortions for each instrument instead of having a real recording for each one.But even if you don't care what the sounds are, they're annoying, and you don't want your child playing with this while you're around.DO NOT BUY THIS."},{"rating":"1","title":"cute, but inaccurate","review":"This puzzle looks great and would be wonderful without the batteries. The pictures of instruments are nice but the sounds are awful They pretty much all sound the same, tinny and annoying. My sons love music and I love that they can identify different instruments but this does nothing to help that. In fact, since it makes it seem like a harmonica and a tuba sound the same, it could actually hurt their musical education. I plan on taking the batteries out of this puzzle soon so they can enjoy the pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you care about music, do not buy this puzzle!","review":"I usually read the reviews before making a purchase and I cannot express how much I wish I had done so this time. I have been very pleased with other M&D toys and was excited to find the musical sound puzzle. The physical puzzle is fine but, as other reviewers have stated, the sound is flat-out terrible. With the exception of the drums and xylophone, all of the instruments sound the same. And all of the instruments, including drums and xylophone, are cheap synthesized tones. My child can learn more about the different instruments through my amateur impressions of them than through this puzzle. If it can't be returned, it's going to quietly and quickly disappear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected more from Melissa & Doug","review":"I had expected each instrument piece to sound like the instrument they showed, but many sound exactly the same. The magnetic piece that causes the sound to start is not always well placed but is rather off so it won't always make sound when it should. Every piece plays a few notes of \\"Old McDonald,\\" and even after just a few days, I'm sick of it. The melody must finish before a new one can start, so if my older son is too fast with placing piece number two, it won't play for him. I really had expected more from this well-known brand, and I'm very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"great product if only there was sound","review":"it's a sound puzzle but there was no sound. I gave this as a gift to my 2yo niece. There was no sound because the battery was dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Sound","review":"I've seen and heard a few of their other sound puzzles, pet and farm, and they sounded great. I was so excited about this one when I purchased it for Christmas for my niece. What I got was poor sound quality. I should have tested it before hand as it was mocked by the rest of my family for its sound. Next time I'll read the reviews and get a different one. Their other puzzles are amazing, though! This one setback will not keep me from buying their stuff again."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves this puzzle!","review":"I bought this for my son's 3rd birthday and for some reason it would randomly play the instruments, like it was haunted. Any who, I called M & D customer service and they very happily put a replacement puzzle, for free, in the mail that day. I will continue to buy these toys as long as they make them."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kid loves it","review":"My kid loves this puzzle. I know the sounds arent very accurate and quite annoying if left out at night. But after every piece he dances or pretends to play whatever instrument it is! Its a lot of fun to do with him and he will often do the puzzle multiple times before moving on to another quieter puzzle."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"For a Melissa and Doug product, this one is disappointing. I would not recommend it to a friend. The sounds do not accurately represent the instruments and all it plays is a small part of Old MacDonald."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please take away the sound....","review":"Without batteries, this is a great toy, but that's not what we paid for. They are all the same song and, except for the drum, don't sound realistic. Not only that, if all the pieces aren't in place then just the turning on of a light sets the sound off.Take my advise. Either by one that doesn't make noise or take out the batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"As a stand alone puzzle it's great; as a musical instrument puzzle it's time to go back to the drawing board!","review":"Length:: 3:28 MinsBecause this is an audio product I decided to do a video review. It's my first one so please bear with me. The sound isn't as good as I would like it to be but I feel I can still be understood. This should help you decide whether or not you should purchase this item for your child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds are not accurate and really quite annoying","review":"I am hesitant to give this toy a bad review because I absolutely LOVE Melissa and SOug puzzles and my 2 year old just can't get enough of them. However, this one is just plain annoying. All the instruments play Old MacDonald and they are all done electronically and unfortunately do not sound very much like the instrument they represent. I am a music tecaher and I was overjoyed when I saw this puzzle to help teach my son the sounds of different instruments but it really doesn't accomplish that. Plus it's very loud (well they all are) and my husband and I are about to take the batteries out. AFTER I ordered my friend said she had the same puzzle and found it also to be the most annoying that she hides it from her toddler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Detrimental to a child's music education!","review":"First, the physical puzzle is fine. Just don't put the batteries in. Unless you want your child to learn to distinguish between bland, non-descript synth patches from a cheap Casio keyboard.How hard could it have been to use an actual recording of the instrument for each piece? This company could easily use a public domain wave file, or better yet, ask some musicians or music educators to contribute a short melody. You wouldn't need access to an expensive recording studio, either. Today a cheap $300 handheld record would do the trick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy if you value your child's musical education!","review":"This is another failing sound puzzle by M&D. Their products are normally of good quality and this one like the farm animals is a disgrace. I am not trying to trash them, I just do not want you to be as upset as I was. All sounds were recorded using an organ of sorts and most sound nothing like the pictured instrument. The puzzle itself works out fine without batteries, just be aware that it is indeed a beginners' level puzzle (marked 2+). To their credit, M&D customer service were gracious and offered to send a non-sound playing replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can find something better!","review":"Do not buy this puzzle! There are so many better ones out there and this is just awful. First of all, as the other reviewers have stated, the instruments do not sound like actual instruments (i would be unable to identify them and I played in an orchestra for years). But the absolute worst thing about it is that it continually goes off at night(unless you keep the battery out) (there is no on-off switch)! I spent over a half an hour in the middle of the night once trying to get it stop going off (and you know, to take the battery out you need a tiny phillips head, which i did not want to get in the middle of the night!) so i stuffed it under the cushions of the sofa! Seriously, don't buy this puzzle!!! (i love wooden puzzles and would never knock one but this is just ridiculous!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource","review":"I just recieved this book today and spent some quality time looking through it. As with most WROX books, the examples are useful, real-world presentations and I was pleasantly surprised to see some screenshots that used Mozilla as well as Internet Explorer, illustrating the truly cross-platform, cross-browser compatibility of the language.

I think it is the ideal book for someone to start learning PHP. Really worths a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs a Second Edition","review":"It's sad to say that this book is getting a bit out of date. So many of the examples use coding conventions which just don't apply any more. I also found it to have a fairly counter-intuitive approach. Why must we wait until halfway through the book before we see anything about databases? Surely databases are what server-side scripting is about?I came to this book, having been led into PHP by other titles I had read, but I felt - not so much dissapointed - but maybe just a bit dissatisfied. It seems there is no title out there which is sufficiently up to date to show me my next step. Perhaps this publisher is hanging fire until PHP5 comes along, but if they are I must say it's a frustrating wait for the rest of us who have to earn our living doing this stuff. Maybe I should try their Professional title?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This is a great book for anyone who doesn't know anything about the PHP language. The book has good background information which leads into the meat of the PHP language. If you've seen php before, this book will help you along and makes an excellent reference book. I highly recommend this book, it's well written and easy to understand and includes illustrations of the code. It's a great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointingly inconsistent book","review":"The book is out of date as it covers PHP4 before security changes were made. It is also very inconsistant later on, as the various authors seem to believe in very different conventions, for example early on they claim type casting is unnecessary, then in Ch. 10 they use it loads - without any explanation, also in Ch. 10 they start introducing new functions without any explanation of how they work or even what they do (they explain some but not others) and the examples are really tedious due to similarity in some parts. The different authors also type the same commands differently (e.g echo \\"\\"; and echo(\\"\\"); - again without explanation, and they obviously didn't collaborate enough to ensure consistency.Otherwise an ok introduction to PHP4, but I'm sure there are better guides out these that will be more consistent."},{"rating":"2","title":"<?php echo $howToLearnPhp; ?>","review":"The title of this review says it all... if you are new to PHP, this is the first book you should get.

I'd highly recommend it to anyone wanting to get a fast, no nonsense tutorial and a great reference for PHP.This book is probably not for someone creating their first Web site. It assumes that the reader can code and publish HTML. I also think it would be a good idea for prospective buyers to visit some PHP sites ... before jumping into \\"Begining\\" PHP 4.Beginning PHP 4 teaches by example so the reader learns functions and techniques VERY quickly as they build working projects. Plus, the layout of the book is such that the reader can drop into any chapter and get a brush-up tutorial and sample code.So... get a basic feel for PHP, write a few simple PHP enhanced pages on your own and you'll REALLY enjoy this book.

Little real world examples. Do yourself a favor and get PHP Essentials, or at least a book that concentrates on making Web Shopping Sites.

I love the legs that keep it from sitting on the sink bottom. My sink is stainless and I didn't want to set a metal strainer right down on it and the little legs on this are perfect.

The characters were lifeless, the plot was laborious, and the subtle undertones went well below subtle to nonexistent. Hopefully I'm missing the massive psychological symbolism that so many other reviews and well know authors have mentioned, or else I wasted more time than I care to admit.

The first time I ever heard him I was hooked,way back in 79. So I guess all us hard core fans are a bit more critical. I am too dissapointed with this CD. It could have been made with a lot better song selection in mind. Too many songs repeated from other Live releases. But thats the same with George's concerts also. His set list has varied very little over the past decade. One good thing about this release though, definitley pick up the video of this CD. It fully captures a Thorogood concert experience, and makes the repetiveness of the selections bearable. Yes, Im a fan George, but time to bury \\"Who Do You Love\\", \\"Nighttime\\", \\"I Drink Alone\\", \\"GearJammer (Ugh)\\", etc. Its not really the guitar playing, or singing, (which George himself admits is not the tops), but the ATTITUDE he brings.

Well, to put it bluntly, the label he's with (CMC International) is a classic rock graveyard, whose modus operandi is to sign past-their-peak acts and milk them for endless \\"Greatest Hits Live\\"-type albums, occasionally letting them make a new record (with little or no support).

As a faithful version of THE American Classic, this telling takes jarring liberities (such as changing the ending!) and leaves loose ends (Huck posing as Tom at the aunt's home is suddenly just Huck again without explanation). As a good audio narrative, forget it: Garrison's sonorous delivery doesn't make it. Very frustrating listening while driving - every word is a moan or whisper with consonants that crack and pop, so no volume is comfortable. His character voices meld together in places, making it difficult to follow the give and take between the Duke and the King. And in one spot on the river, it sounds like Guy Noir quizzing Huck! Yuck.

It's just a story about a stupid kid that runs away and that uses the \\"n\\" word one too many times.I addition to this i think that the book shows a lot of racism. The \\"n\\" word was used more than 200 times and it's just stupid that the author had to include all this racism in the book just to get the point across to his audience.Some people that have written reviews here might not be offeded by the racism that this book shows and I am surprised about this.

Mark Twain wrote a stupid story about a boy and a slave floating down the mississsippi. THAT SOUNDS REALLY INTERESTING!! Yea right. This book is a big waste of time, it should be out-lawed from our schools, because Twain likes to use the \\"N\\" word a lot.

One of the most positive things about the book would be that the reading level is not very advanced and that it shows us a glimpse of the past. Along with the reading level not being very advanced, the book itself is extremely well thought out, and brings the stories, characters, and imagery to life. One of the negatives is the amount of cursing that takes place throughout the book. This is a negative because it is at a children's reading level and it does not add any literary value to the book as a piece of history. The ugly but I believe necessary part of the book is the use of the n-word. This is a necessary part of the book because it shows to our children and everyone the meaning behind the word. If anything it makes the reader more understanding of the troubles that the slaves when though and understand the meaning of the word a little more deeply."},{"rating":"2","title":"What was I thinking for so long?!","review":"Can't believe it took me so long to get around to reading this book, because it's fantastic, and one of the best summer reads. It's very deep - exploring the old American west (now known as the American south, along the Mississipi River valley), and the people, places, and goings-ons, through the brave eyes of a young (essentially) innocent - while being just plain fun. It is dated, but that's part of its charm - the language is rustic, the children are freer, the people more trustworthy, and the river was a little wider, the heat a little hotter.

Twain masterfully creates an interesting story line while staying true to the times, setting, and language. Huck's tale of his adventure down the Mississippi will keep you turning the pages. It is very interesting because things happen when you least expect it. This is an amazing story full of adventure and fun.But of course, you will find the character's speech to be either annoying or downright confusing. But remember, this takes place in the past! It was normal for people to talk like that. So try your best to translate the character's speech. All in all, this book is an unforgettable and amazingly adventurous. When I read this book,(I thought)it should be in the top 5-50 best classic of all time.by Pra"},{"rating":"2","title":"The race card.","review":"It seems that everybody's initial reaction after reading Huck Finn is to debate if Twain was a racist or not. It's a pity because such a debate takes away from the greatness of the book. Was he a racist? I don't know, I never met the man. History and his own writing would seem to support that he was. Do I think any less of him, despite my opinion that he might have been racist? Not in the least. His racism was born out of a time when racism was the norm and rooted more in fear and culture rather than hate. Perhaps ignorance would be a better term, but I dare not call this man ignorant. I really don't think he was a mean hearted man, but being nice doesn't exclude one for being a racist. Read the book, you may form a different opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"your eyes get stuck","review":"For my junior year in High School we had to read Huckleberry Finn over the thanksgiving vacation. This book is wonderful despite the confusing language, which only makes it better. Granted that I had read it many years before and knew it was good but I couldn't put it down. I read every chance I got and finished it realy early. It is a riviting story about Huck and his adventures just trying to get away from civilization and in whick he constantly runs up against it. It's loads of fun for everyone"},{"rating":"2","title":"Audiobook last 1/3 is re-written","review":"I am a very big fan of Mark Twain and Garrison Keillor but was suprised to learn that the last 1/3 of this American Classic was re=written.

And it was not Tom\`s friend Joe that they found dead in the cave,it was Injun Joe \\"that murderin\` half breed\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"John's opinion","review":"Mark Twain's tale is timless. As a friend remarked, Huckleberry Finn is all things good. Tom Sawyer could grow up to be Donald Trump. John Seelye's introduction is insufferable. If Twain had been exposed to it, Seelye would have joined his hate list. Without the introduction, The book would have received the five stars it deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"I know why this book is a classic...","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a GREAT novel by Mark Twain. It's about a boy, \\"Huck\\" living in the deep south in the 1800's during the time of slavery. Huck does not fit into the life that is aunt or father or anyone else imagines for him. Instead, he lives a life based upon his everyday adventures. During some parts of this book, I was so excited, I couldn't put it down. During some other parts, I just wanted to fall asleep. The slow parts do pass by quickly and the book is worth your time. This book does contain some politically-incorrect language, but I still highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still havent recieved","review":"I still have not recieved the book after waiting over a month, i needed it for school and so i am already supposed to be 1/2 way done reading it, but i dont have a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The adventures of Huck Finn was difficult to follow.","review":"This book had many subplots within it, and really did not make much sense.

The book just kept on going... the text was confusing and dull. Huck's character was just unbelievable in the extent of knowledge he had at what appeared to be a pre-teen age. I am failing to see how all American Literature stemmed from this great masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mark Twain this is not","review":"It's hard to imagine how anyone could read Mark Twains hillarious satire and social commentary, and so completely miss the point. Kerry Shale will have you absolutely spleeping through passages that would have you in a belly laugh if you were reading it yourself. And his interpretation of Mark Twain's characters is only adds to the boredom. Just because they talk in local dialect, and have predjudices and superstitions, does not mean that they are all ignorant buffoons. Mark Twain is hillarious and some narrators will have you peeing in your pants listening to his books. Pass this one by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent book back 2 wks. ago and still have not received a credit. Poor customer service!","review":"After receiving the book, I was astounded by the size.

As of today 12/21, I have not been credited back to my account. I'll never do business with that company again.

It was dragged on and on until you got sick of Huck and Jim always escaping and crap. Man, it is a waste of time. I didn't enjoy it.

This is my first Mark Twain book, and it's surely to be my last, as I was sorely disappointed. While the grammar and dialect are supposed to be written realistically, I found it cumbersome. The adventures changed constantly, and if Twain had written with one adventure in mind, then my attention span would not have diminished. When Tom Sawyer entered the book permanently, I became irritated, because when he arrived, the story became prolonged and trivial. I feel I wasted my time reading this book. I do not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragged out and boring!","review":"I really didn't like this book. Maybe it's because you need an imagination to read it, and mine isn't always there.

Pick up this sad excuse for an adventure novel and you'll be out in 15 minutes tops. Now don't be fooled by my one star rating... I would have given this 0 stars if that was an option. I'm not even going to fully review this book out of fear that I will pass out on my keyboard. Sure, the idea of this book was good, but it's not as though we never knew slavery in the south existed 150 years ago and the book was an amazing eye-opener. Teachers have been drilling that fact into our heads since fifth grade. Ultimately, this book was a massive waste of my time and brain cells."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huck fin","review":"This book is boring!!!!!! I am three chapters into the book.

Samuel Clemens should be smacked, and every copy of this stupid book should be burned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Classic","review":"This is a great book and deserves the place it has as a literary classic. The audio version was very good with the narrator using very different voices for the various characters so there is no confusion about who is speaking - a weakness with less talented narrators. The reason that I gave this product 4 and not 5 stars was the packaging - which I found to be inadequate - the case is cardboard and each CD comes in a paper envelope - not good for storage over the years, especially if it is used on a consistent basis by multiple persons. But the actual narration was first class and brought the well known book to life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost good","review":"The book is well laid out and organized, but there are around 3 pages missing from Chapter 21. There are a few other occurrences throughout the book where paragraphs are excluded.

We actually experience Huck's activities through his eyes, with his thoughts and the reasoning behind his actions. Twain captures perfectly the thought process of a (13 year old?) young man. Yes, it takes place during slavery period, and, though some of the language may be objectionable by today's standards, it is a story worth reading and enjoying. There is a lot more than what is ever shown in any of the movies made from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An American Classic","review":"To everyone who said this book was simply a children's story--you obviously don't understand this book. It is a brilliant satire about slavery and about the conventions of society. When I first read this book I didn't quite understand it either and just blew it off as another tedious book we had to read for school. But after reading it and discussing it in AP English, I discovered just how brilliant it was. Huck is caught in an eternal struggle between doing what society tells him is right and doing what he feels in his heart. It's a classic Pikaresque type novel, and a funny one at that. A lot of it's humor is in it's irony. And it pokes fun at religion, war (mobs), slavery, and society in general. I suggest those of you who disliked it should read it again. It is a truly great novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Censorship is un American","review":"It is horrible that some people want to redo great works out of fear they may be offensive.

This book was hard to read even for a seasoned bibliophile like me. I understand Mark Twain wanted to write it in authentic dialects, but it was just too much. \\"To Kill a Mockinbird\\" is written in authentic dialect but still remains readable. If I hadn't been reading it with my husband who HAD to read it for class, I would have quickly put it down. I did like the issues the author dealt with (Jim's freedom, Huck's loyalty), but it was basically drowned out by the overly descriptive rants and hard to read communication between the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trouble maker Finn","review":"The story of Huck Finn starts with him living with a widow as a foster parent becuase his dad is gone and his mom is dead.The widow is raising him as a respectable boy but his dad shows up one day and kidnaps him.

So one night Huck fakes his own death and hides on an island in the mississippi river. While he's there he meets a runaway black man... and heads down the river. About half way down the river they meet 2 men or con artists.

Overall, I found that characters I wanted to stay died and characters that I wanted dead stayed, making for a tedious and dull read."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Lousy Escapade","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, by Mark Twain, is a dull book that is kept alive only by its strong moral lesson that contradicts the rights of slavery. Jim, an African-American runaway slave, is on the search for his own freedom by escaping to the south. Shortly into his journey, he phenomenally runs into and befriends Huck, a rambunctious wild child who is also coincidentally running away from home! Although the lesson is important, I found that it clouded Twain in his ability to entertain me as a reader. Insignificant chapters and random characters slowly drag along as Huck defeats all odds in his unrealistic encounters that take place on the Mississippi River. Repeated character personalities and storyline ideas created confusion for me as I was also perplexed by Jim's heavy dialect. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who is actually looking for an actual action plot as it is a huge disappointment as a sequel to the thrilling Tom Sawyer novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most boring book.","review":"I can understand why this book is considered one of the greatest piece of literature in America. Huck Finn dealed with a lot of sensitive and humanity issues, in which society at the time was not aware of. I admired Twain for his audacity of bringing such faults of society. HOWEVER, I found this book the most boring and monotonous book I've ever read. Twain did not capture my attention with his coloquilism, which I thought was extremely overused. His descriptive passages were painfully verbose, I literally had to slap myself a couple of times to stay awake and read this darn book. I just found this book disgusting boring, but that's just my opnion."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Retold by\\"","review":"Even though the title of the book says \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" and the author is listed as Mark Twain on the cover, this is a rewrite by an author lacking the wry wit and humor of Mark Twain. Why the Dalmatian press decided to take a book that is so wonderful and have it rewritten in such a dry and unexciting way is a travesty. Could someone have actually thought that Mark Twain didn't do a good enough job? I bought 4 of these Dalmation Press Classics books thinking that my children would love them. All four are rewritten in the same dry, unexciting and uninteresting way. I'm disgusted, disappointed, and feel cheated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This Kindle version of Huckleberry Finn is great.

They run into a lot of trouble along the way which makes the book very exciting and suspenseful. Like one time they run into a bunch of pirates. That part kept me turning the pages.

I'm sure it'll be great!\\" Boy, was I wrong! Historically speaking, the book was accurate with its use of racial slurs, societal views, etc. Twain's colorful use of dialect was interesting, albeit difficult to sift through at times. Also, Twain's vivid descriptions absorbed me into the book and made my feel as if I were sitting next to Huck and Jim on their raft. However, those factors definitely did not make up for the boredom experienced as I read the book. The characters were bland and unappealing, the plot was absurd and dull, and the hefty symbolism was annoying.Sure, \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" is a literary classic. That doesn't mean that it's great. For the modern readers of today, this is boredom-inducing material."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Great American Novel\\" my arse...","review":"Well, if this was ever the biggest disappointment.

I thought the novel was boring, strung-out, and relatively meaningless. The plot was muffled, tiring, and nothing but go here, flee there. The only character I enjoyed was Jim. He had the \\"you gotta love him\\"-esque sort of aura. Anyway, my two cents...BTC\\"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is essential to the understanding of the American soul\\" said in the brief amazon.com review. That's a crock. This book was tremendously boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even if its a classic that doesn't make it good.","review":"I had to read this book for summer reading and it was complete torture. It was the first story in America to be done in venecular which made it a classic and hard to read. some how his adventures are nothing but dull are semi-stupid. Huck is not a perfect character and all his flaws seem to be over looked. Jim is merely in the story because he needs to be and although he is not a brilliant person mark twain has not given the slave fair credit by making an unschooled boy half his age seem twice as smart. His story also implied that southerns are stupid just by the way they talk amoung other things. The story ends leaving you unsatisfied with what you that the main character should have learned.

However, I hadn't read much of it before I realized that it was going to be something to suffer through, not enjoy.The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was an extremely plotless, racist book relating the adventures of the rather tedious, annoying character of Huck Finn. Huck had recently left his hometown and went rafting down the MIssissippi with a slave, Jim. Huck is forever lying to and leaving Jim, in a fashion that made me wonder if he had ADD. The end of the novel, which had potential to make it better, made me hurl the book across the room, in a way certian to make any librarian weep.I also found the dialects that Clemmins used extremely annoying. I had to sound out the words to myself to see what he was trying to relate.If you want to read a book, any book, pick something, anything, else. Trust me on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blast from the past","review":"I read this book a long time ago and forgot most of it.

There are a couple of instances throughout the text where I've questioned the narrator's ability to know/not know certain things (such as the exact time in the middle of the night at one point while traveling down the river, to his inability to do the same later in the book), but regardless...it's a classic!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Everyone Must Read","review":"I can still vividly remember my mom reading it to my brother and I.

This novel includes many morals which the main character, Huck, comes across. He is an adventurous boy who has to make many adult decisions and had many pressures. Huck is being forced to be civilized by the Widow Douglas while his best friend Tom Sawyer encourages him to rebel and have a good time. All the while, Huck's drunk, abusive father stumbles back into the picture trying to use his son. The novel can be related to many different issues seen in society today such as individualism and racial problems. Narrated through Huck's eyes and literally in his own words, the book is written in a way to be enjoyed by a variety of readers. It was interesting to see a young boy escape on his own and befriend a runaway slave, defying the social norms. His attitude and freewill make him a very relatable character. This book would come highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The advenger of Huckleberry Finn","review":"Huckleberry Finn was a story about a boy who was an orfan.

He likes this remote better than any other (and we're tried quite a few) because it doesn't have too many buttons, the buttons are big and the controls for volume and channel up and down are very easy to work by touch. Very intuitively designed. And it's not overly large and unwieldly like some of the other big button remotes. As with most universal remotes, when the batteries occasionally do run out (battery life on this remote is good), the unit needs to be reprogrammed for the TV. Because my dad can't reprogram by himself, he keeps two of this model of remote -- one loaded up as a spare in case batteries run out on the other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good choice","review":"the quality of the image and the sound is poor but we are not here because of tht, the competition is good enough and you can see an amazing display of ground game, good purchase if you are into the sport"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet sounds","review":"At this point in time, I doubt that there are many people on the planet who don't know at least one song by this guy...There's not much to say -- it's a CD.

Squeezing your cooked dinner between paper towels to eliminate all vestiges of fat?!? Really?!? Every recipe with dairy uses non-fat yogurt and fat free half and half instead of whatever dairy product would ordinarily be used, and EVERY recipe lectures on all the ways you can take out every last smidge of fat. The author comes across as having an eating disorder, and the recipes are weird as a result. Some of them I can't even imagine working (for example, making split pea soup with split peas that you grind to a powder in your blender and bake with no liquid at all for an hour!). I bought this book because I'm currently without an oven and am committed to cooking fresh, from scratch food, and was looking for some ideas to stretch out from what I've been making in my toaster oven so far.

It would be a better idea to find the tokyopop manga somewhere and read that instead of watching the rest of the anime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging Introduction to Saints and Blesseds","review":"I would actually rate this book 4.5 stars if Amazon had that option. The reason I can't give it 5 stars is that the author does not use proper capitalization when using pronouns referring to God (i.e. \\"his\\" when it should be \\"His\\"). Also, there is some other ungrammatical language that is clearly a deliberate attempt to appeal to modern kids but that really bothers me. I know Ms. Welborn can write proper English, and as a home educator that's what I expect in the books aimed at impressionable young minds.The stories are very engaging, and there is a good mix of familiar and unfamiliar saints and blesseds from throughout the ages. I like the organization by theme- \\"saints are people who...(love children, teach us new ways to pray, help the poor and sick, change their lives for God, etc.)\\" The author does a good job presenting the stories in an age-appropriate manner, which is always a concern given the violence many of the saints had to endure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for children and adults","review":"This is my 8 year old son's favorite book! I have learned a lot from it as well! The book is chalk-full of 3-4 page stories about saints from all times. The stories are framed with an introduction that kids can relate to from their own lives and concluded with a short question to expand discussion between children and parents about how the saint's virtues can relate to the child's life. The saint stories are engaging, insightful, and well written with children in mind.

Sure, lots of the facts are spot on. But too many of them are based on conjecture. For example, \\"even a swordfish almost always loses a fight with a great white shark.\\" I have never heard of a white shark being observed consuming a swordfish. That is not to say that it doesn't happen, but I don't think there is enough evidence for the author to make such a statement. If you find this a bit nitpicky, fine, I am a nitpicker. But consider the final sentence of this book: \\"As long as there are oceans, there will be sharks.\\" This God-like prediction is irresponsible (even for a book written in 1986) given that many shark species may be moving toward extinction. The best lesson your kids can get from this book is that you can't believe everything you read.

Yes, they do.\\" For crying out loud, nothing like scaring the daylights out of kids and making them hate sharks! There's a lot of inaccurate information to boot.

Georgia herself is extremely realistic, completely self-centered, but also marvelously lovable. Much appreciated is the British slang glossary at the end, which Georgia has written herself, in her own unique style.

Martin Foreman skillfully develops two very unique and distinctive voices, detailing the day to day lives of the main characters. It is his eye for the little touches that really makes this book work.

He wrote this personal memoir, recounting 3 years of his childhood in Hong Kong in the early 1950s, just before he recently died of brain cancer. He dedicated the book to his own children, as a way to pass on the story of his life to them. It reads like a novel - one incredible adventure after the next of a boy of 7 let loose on the streets of Hong Kong in the wild years after WWII. It also details the breakdown of the marriage of his mother and father. This is a real treasure trove, a look at the world through the new eyes of a child, but guided by the wise older hand of an older author. I feel like I have traveled and lived in Hong Kong - the sites, sounds, smells - the culture, food, weather, animals, people - all brilliantly alive and real. I also have a better sense of the Chinese and what it means to be Chinese, and a desire to learn more.

It's obvious that the author did extensive research on the subject and he does a very good job explaining how some of the cultural traits developed. However, the country has gone under a great deal of changes recently and so I though it was a little outdated. Also, the reading can get boring, as the chapters are long and too detailed sometimes.

The only thing is that the latter does not come with audio files. But then again it makes it very clear how letters are pronounced, and this book and watching an online Maltese TV channel does it.

Not realizing the lid was in the \\"locked\\" position, I forced a few of them open and over time those ones cracked. It was my own fault. But the magnets on the back are very strong and these are very durable as long as you don't break them like I did. I give it 4 stars because i do think $4-5 a piece is too expensive.

It was like indie-folky singer-songwriter stuff. This new album totally sucks. The title track is barely even a song. It's like a kinda electroclash dance track, very percussively oriented and there's only 2 lines of lyrics, repeated incessantly. It really sucks. Lullaby For Scout In Ten Years is also more rhythmmic than melodic, and harmony isn't even considered. Most of the song is a simple bass melody, which the vocal melody follows along with note by note. It's sparse and monotonous. This song at least has lyrics though. The vocals remind me a bit of Cat Power. Then there are a couple of bursts of powerchord rock towards the end, which also follow the bass melody exactly. I guess her mission for this album was to get in touch with her primal rock self of something. It was a bad idea. The songs suck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for gym","review":"I bought these as gym shorts for my daughter.

In true adventure fashion he leaves no detail ignored, from the building of the raft, to the opposition he encountered to the myriad of marine life he encountered on the way to the polynesian islands.The reading can be a bit dry at times, but in the end it's worth it.

This book contains a great deal of information of interest to scientists. These include the appearance of previously little-known fish, the scope of marine bioluminescense, the deployment of ocean currents, etc. It is interesting to note that the Polynesians realized that the Earth was round. A re-examination of the common belief that prescientific peoples invariably believed in a flat Earth is clearly warranted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting Trans-Pacific Adventure!","review":"This is one of the few books I could not put down.How did people populate the polynesian islands way out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean?

Can they recreate the ancient navigation techniques? Can they crash land on a reef while blazing in the equatorial current?This book takes you though the whole great adventure.

Nobody does it better than Heyerdahl, who makes science and nature instantly relatable and intriguing...exciting and relevant. This is a classic story, vividly told, of the monumental task of building a raft, assembling a crew, and setting out for the great unknown in dangerous, shark-infested waters.

Not that I need loss of life or violent hurricanes for excitement, but a \\"major event\\" was the daily circling of dolphins, which Heyerdahl calls to our attention at least ten times. This alone attests to the opinion that the book is not organized or written well. It is a loosely conected batch of ramblings. Perhaps some of the power was lost in the translation, but in general, the story rates right up there with my 3rd grade narrative on my summer vacation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Adventure","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Kon-Tiki by Thor Heyerdahl.

Truthfully, there is not much about Ian Van Dahl to seperate them from other bands/artists in the genre. It seems as though most of the female vocal-laden trance music these days sounds very much the same. Just listen to the Trance Party compilations and you will see what I mean. But hey...if it sounds good, listen to it. Aside from sounding a little generic, Ian Van Dahl's Ace is an worthy entry for the ears of any electronic music listener. The extra CD is nothing to get excited about (it's just one slightly different version of Castles In The Sky and the video for Will I?), but it's a welcome bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ian Van Dahl - A young version of Cher","review":"The band Ian Van Dahl shows in \\"ACE\\" that they have the ability to create very powerful and flowing music. I first heard their song \\"Castles in the Sky\\" on Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix. I immediately got hooked and bought this CD. I noticed that their lead singer has a deep voice similar to that of Cher. \\"Will I?reminded me of \\"Believe\\", and \\"Reason\\" reminded me of \\"Turn Back Time\\". But the one difference is Cher cannot hold a candle to these performers. This CD is filled with both instrumental and vocal tracks which are easy to dance to. The \\"Will I\\" video was eye candy, and overall I loved this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ace Shoots Down My Low Expectations","review":"What I expected from Ian Van Dahl's \\"Ace\\" and what I received were entirely different. I bought Ace because of the groups hit \\"Will I?\\" However, I was pleasantly surprised by the high quality of the entire album. The group is consistent in style; no track seemed out of place in either quality or style. The flow of the tracks, from one to another, seemed well orchestrated. Ace would make a great party album; pop in the CD and forget about it! The bonus CD was gravy, featuring a remix of Castles in the Sky and the Music Video to \\"Will I?\\" I did see one weakness in Ace that I would like to address. Seeing as they had already made a second CD, why didn't they include more remixes? The music video only takes up 40 megs of space, its not like they ran out of room. Aside from this minor issue, I would recommend Ace to anyone interested in Euro Dance/Trance. It is a solid album with more than enough hits to make it well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Trance","review":"This CD is extremely dry and boring.

I was expecting greatness, especially after reading the reviews for this CD. This CD is mediocre at best, a poor example of a trance/ dance CD with vocals.The singer gets very annoying by the 3rd or 4th track. Each track is started with a question that is intended to be though provoking, but ends up being comical.The beats are also mediocre, you get the feeling that you are listening to the same couple of tracks over and over again.It comes with a bonus CD which feels more like a bonus coaster than a bonus music CDThis CD is very boring. I would not recommend buying this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vitashell not just for turtles!","review":"I have been using Vitashell as a cuticle cream (finger and toe nails), hand cream, and facial night cream (just a thin layer does it).

I liked the fact that it is a good size and it is easy to read. However, it only worked for a year. The unit continuously malfunctioned even after installing new batteries figuring that would have been the problem. Unfortunately it wasn't. It kept saying it was over 100 degrees in the tank. My fish would have been like scrambled eggs in my tank if that were true. Luckily I had a portable PH/thermometer handy to double check for accuracy. I had to order a completely different thermometer. I don't normally write bad reviews on products, but I wanted to let you know so you don't make the same mistake. If you are looking at a digital thermometer, then I would recommend one made by Coralife. It is small, but works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after 2+ years","review":"The thermometer worked fine for about 2 years, but now the in-tank temperature reads about 8-10 degrees F too high.

I also liked the fact it displayed both the room temp. and the aquarium temp. (in/out temps) I liked my 1st one so much, I bought another for my 2nd aquarium. But like the other reviews, both thermometers began reading high and/or low. Cleaning the sensor helped a bit but only for a day or so. As for my use: 2 freshwater tanks, prefered temp. is 78F to 80F, heaters are 1.5x the size needed to regulate a tank the size it is used in to minimize heating time, room temps are kept around 71F in winter, 76F in summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"meditation for true believers","review":"About the only good thing in this book on meditation is the accurate delineation of the stages on the path to transcendence. Otherwise it is badly dated, verbose and written in the absurd over-earnest manner that makes a great deal of esoteric literature hard to tolerate.The prescribed method is a prayer-mantra, the effectiveness of which depends on the intensity of one's religious convictions. In short, meditation works best for the true believer. Mrs Bailey seems blissfully unaware that people without any religious faith whatsoever can attain - via an entirely secular mantra - exactly the same inner freedom.The most serious flaw is Bailey's proselytising in the final chapters. She dishonestly uses quotes from the great mystics (that she has used appropriately in the book to this point) to suggest they agree with her own eccentric cosmological and theological views.Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"calebs curse","review":"I think that after one reads this book they will be tempted to visit the Conway area and lowlands.

The Eagles reverted to U.S. Army Air Force control in the spring of 1942, and this book takes up their story from that point.Many of the pilots transferred out of the unit, voluntarily or otherwise, some even stayed with the RAF for the rest of the war. This book covers the 4th Fighter Group, the Eagle's U.S.A.A.F. sucessor, and the stories of those pilots who moved on to other units.

Maybe the best as far as quality story and actors. More than that it was so meaningful to the viewer it has to be called what it is: ART. David Milch should be freely allowed to make any show he wants to...for the good of society. Cancelling this show was a crime against society, and we are all the poorer for it. Gee, I wonder how this (and Deadwood's cancellation -plus the DW movies being axed) will affect Milch's muse.... will it make him create something SAFER? Something the network will actually allow to be created and shown? Thanks for leading, HBO, thanks for crushing the artist. At least give him two seasons!

He had spoken no sentences more than 5 words for the entire first two episodes and when he did speak it was like a jr. high acting student in a first lesson. The plot script and dialogue in this movie is so hideously poor, it seems almost certain that it was intentionally made to flop. Who could possibly think this was even slightly good??? And , to top it off, there really isn't any great or prolonged surf footage to at least partially redeem it . Terrible, terrible, terrible.

Most characters are not very well fleshed out and the episodes meander meaninglessly. Without a storyline or reveal, it becomes even more obscure. I watched the special where the writer attempts to explain a long monologue; the explanation of which was even more incomprehensible.

I have loved all the shows so with the ending of some of them I couldn't wait for the next big one. John from Cincinnati was well strange. Maybe I just missed it but I really tried to like it. I watched several episodes and each one was painful. The character development was crap. I didn't care for any of them and the plain weird factor didn't make it a good show.

Quirky, intelligent, and well written, it was too cerebral to appeal to just the mundane viewer, which accounts for its lack of a huge following. It was also one of the best shows on TV in a very long time. Had HBO had the guts to keep in on the air, as they should have done, it would have developed the proper audience which it obviously needed for the powers that be to keep it on. Too bad it was so far out of the mainstream that the average Joe couldn't see it for the truly wonderful and uniquely appealing show that it was.HBO needs to rethink its decision to take it off the air and put it back onto its schedule where it belongs. This show deserves every chance to develop an audience.

Any great classical musician and/or teacher likes to use this kind of playing as something to avoid falling into.

Until a couple of days ago. The whisper turned into a rattling hum on the left side. Adjusting the airflow made no difference. I had to disconnect the tube. That did the trick, until today when the right side started going south. So I unplugged it and now have two separate pumps (a whisper 40 and some other tiny one I got at Walmart) running the two tubes.

Yet there are tremendous rewards here for the patient reader. First of all, Adams' gift for language is as deft as ever. Second, the story itself is absolutely compelling.But in the end, \\"Shardik\\" emerges as a canny exploration of myth and an examination of our hunger for sacred meaning in life.

It is a gripping, imaginative work that sucked me into the bizarre Beklan Empire. His characters are amazingly deep and developed, each with a history and motivation of his own. Adams raises critical questions of the nature of faith and belief, authority and corruption. Overall, he fails to answer these questions and has essentially written himself into a corner. Still, his words are thought-provoking and a noble effort to uncover the power of corruption and the corruption of power. I heartily reccomend Shardik to readers, both as an exciting story and an intellectual exercise."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good reading...","review":"Being in Iraq for so long now I picked up one of Richard Adams books. This was the second one that I read. I have quickly become one of his biggest fans. This book, deals with faith, power and evils that fall upon man. The hero, what you may can one, rises to become a great man but his heart begins to stray. He loses what made his such a pure being. There are many acts of faith that Mr. Adams brings to live with makes it all the more beliveible. A very wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless and thought provoking, May just open your mind a bit more than you planned!","review":"The first time I read this book I was no more than 14 and I liked it,I found it interesting and different. I also knew that I was missing something. The next time I read it a year or so later I was blown away by the lesson's of the power of myth and belief. This book opened the door to the likes of Joseph Campbell and the hold that myth and religion have on mankind. Read it on both levels for great story telling and a powerful message,you will not be disappointed. Other fine reviews here will tell you the plot,Watership Down it is not. Richard Adams stake's a claim for one of the finest novelists of our time and books like this got him there. Strongly suggested for everyone age 15 (and sharp) to 112(and sharper)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a great book","review":"This book was amazing, with the use of rich description and detail.

Together they find themselves going for 3 am walks on weeknights through deserted streets and plazas. The plot thickens from here on in as they get themselves into trouble.

Sad to say I had to stop watching because I was feeling a little sick from the constant jumpy walking motion of the camera, so I never got to hear those sounds others mentioned in their reviews.If you are someone who gets motion sickness, you may want to pass on this film...but if you don't, then maybe it is the movie for you.

I felt that it was too contrived, too obscure, and characters one could not relate to. There was too much psychic distance from the characters to know what they were thinking.

The book was very boring and repetative. The authors talk to you as if you are a teenager."},{"rating":"2","title":"come along for the trip home","review":"This is a book that would suck you in within just the first paragraph. Houlden Caufield is a character that's sure to remain with you days after you are done reading the book. Throughout his journey home from being kicked out of school Houlden takes you on a trip around New York city visiting some of the places the city is infamous for and on the way you see him work out his frustration and rebellion. By the timeHoulden gets home he realizes that he can't run away from life anymore but rather live it as best as he can with what he is given.Salinger's use of profanity and his laid back and easy going tone appeals greatly to teenagers. While reading you are sure to forget that you are reading and as Houlden makes his way home you in turn leave feeling a little bit more accepting of your own life. I truly think teenagers will appreciate this book and will also gain from it immensely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coming-of-age story","review":"A very well-written book. It took Mr. Salinger 10 years to complete it. It is probably hard to think and write like a teenager when you are not one.It is a first-person narration by Holden Caulfield, a 16-year old boy, who was kicked out of prep school. He spends 2-3 days in New York city on his own rather than going home to face his parents. The book describes Holden's view of the adult world, his likes and serious dislike of 'phoniness' in a very distinctive language. This coming-of-age story is a must read for everyone, especially yougsters who are in the teenage years. I wish I had read it when I was in my teens. I would have found someone I could identify with at that time (well, why deny it, even now): the way Holden's thoughts go every which way as he gets distracted and his overactive imagination about the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"read it","review":"I read this in high school so i wanted to re-read it on my own. I liked the story but thought that at times it was a bit slow paced. it doesn't matter though because there are close to 3000 reviews and everyone knows about this book already. read it, its good for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is not that good.","review":"I had read that this was a great classic book, instead I only found a book that was very slow and mostly boring. By reading some of the other reviews I can tell that I am not the only one that thinks this way, honestly, I only kept reading because I took this book on a trip and really did not have anything else to do at night.It is a story about a teenager that rebels against school and parents (what else is new?), he runs away and spend several days hanging around not really doing anything interesting and always complaining.Maybe you would still like to read this book, that is your decision, my personal opinion, I would not bother, there are much better options out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book but lacked...","review":"Don't get me Wrong, I loved this book, it's probabley one of the few I'd read a second time. I spent have to half the book waiting to see what come of the girl he mentioned likeing so much, just to be disapointed in the end with no real resolution to the novel. some call this book a classic, or the best book they've ever read. I wouldn't go that far only because of the above points that left me staring at the book with antisaption that some more words or pages explaining the things I wanted to find out would suddenly show up or something. If your interested in reading it, it's no doubt a great book, but if you looking for substance in plot, story, and true feeling, I recomend reading Richard Wright's \\"The Outsider\\" or \\"Native Son\\" two of truely the best pieces of American Liturture I've ever read. This would follow a Close third or fourth only being bumped by something like Ray Bradbarry, Anthony Burgess."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best book i ever read","review":"I think that th catche in the rye was a good book because even though there was alot of bad cussing it's still very entertaining.I would recommend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must read","review":"There is nothing more that I can say than, read this book.

Catcher in the Rye may have been groundbreaking when first published almost five decades ago but today whatever edge it once held is now lost. Teachers who rember this book as a life changing event and assign it to their students would be better off remembering sometimes that what is eyeopening to them may be an eye closer to others. If you want to see true literary greatness read Hugo, the word phonies isn't mentioned once and doesn't need to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not live up to the hype","review":"Catcher in the Rye is supposed to be the book of the times. We read it in school to get a feel about universal issues present to both the world and the person during the sixtys. I personally thought the book was terrible. Mainly becaue I had trouble getting off to a good start. The book has no real story at all. All it is about is some kid and the emotional impact that different people and situation have on him. I mean, this is not even a book. All it is is a reevaluation of someone's life in terms of emotion. Besides needing to read this for school, if I had known the book was like this, I never would have read it, and would have relied on CliffNotes for symbolism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda boring.","review":"All I can say is that if a school makes you read this book, it's not that good. Also I have been told by my fellow classmates that they agree. Read the other posts to see what I mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if you're paranoid","review":"The author does so well in making the main character Holden Caulfield seem neurotic or psycho that the only way to follow this book is actually to be paranoid or one of the above. His constant thought processes are lifelike, but they become obnoxious very quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"End equal Middle","review":"Would have rather read something else. I really didn't like the book. To me the ending just stoped and it left many questions unanswered. Holdens constant whining and complaining really bugged me, and it drove me nuts how he would always repeat himself over and over again. One part that I liked is when he is at home with Phoebe, and they are in her room dancing to the music. Other then that part, the book didn't interest me that much."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the big deal about this book!?","review":"I'm sorry but this book is completely overrated! I kept reading hoping it would eventually get better but it never did. It was boring and even though I could vaguely relate to the \\"teenage angst\\" aspect, it certainly didn't enlighten me or change my life in any way. I can't believe anyone would make such a big deal about this dull and uninspiring book. I had to force myself to finish it just to say I'd read \\"the classic\\" Catcher in the Rye!"},{"rating":"2","title":"His Honesty...Raw...Real...Brutal...","review":"I read this book when I was at the core of my teenage years. I remember reading the last page and immediately turning to the first one to read it all over again. I remember feeling as if I had just had a conversation with someone close to me who was experiencing the same things as me. This is how this book made feel, like I wasn't the only one out there suffering from the illness I like to call \\"The Teenage Years\\". Even though the tone of the book is lonely in itself, and many worn me about it, I felt accompanied.His honesty is raw...real...brutal...and one that many should posses, but chose not to. It teaches you that your life is what it is and even if you don't like it, well you might as well have to deal with it, because is the only one you have..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the best","review":"I never thought I would actually have to review this book; I sort of assumed that everyone knew it was great. If some people deem it worthy of less than a five-star review, though, I have to come to its defense.Since it was written, no one has been able to achieve this level of complete absorbtion. It's every bit as relatable today as it was then. It's sacred.Some people claim to have outgrown it. These are the sort of people you don't want to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Maybe I'm in the minority, but I really didn't care for this book. It's very depressing all around and I left me with no closure.

I stuck through this sorry mess to the bitter end in the hopes that there might be some redeeming factor to it but, alas, there was none to be found. This book was obviously an attempt to speak to the feelings of loneliness and alienation often felt by adolescents but the protagonist's self-pitying, stream of consciousness torrent of complaints against all of existance left me wanting to scream \\"Shut the @#?! up\\". Truly one of the worst books I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"Every page of this book is the same. It has no building up of events. Or... any events for that matter. It goes from him getting kicked out of school to waiting around in the city to going home and doing nothing. Not saying he will do better in school...no relationships...no action. You learn about what this 17 year old thinks about the people around him, his brothers, his sister , and what he does in the city for a few days. Nothing more exciting or different than your life. So if you take a few minutes of your life and self reflect about a time you were bored...you'll save a few bucks and some time that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"give me a break","review":"I've read lots of literature; more than you might imagine.I read this thinking that I had missed a classic.This book does NOT \\"capture the rawness, is so enthralling, blah, blah, blah.\\"It IS outdated and whiny.

Barnum said about people, numbers and fooling."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull, pedantic, trite","review":"A dull, pendantic book about a dull, pedantic hypocrite.Maybe this was groundbreaking when it came out, but it's dull as dishwater today.The main character is irritated by every tiny miniscule event that happens in his life, and has to tell you about every single one as if it's momentous. That's pretty much the sum total of this book, a kid griping about inconsequential nothings the entire book.The only thing that kept me going till the end were the teasing hints that he was about to become seriously ill and/or die. No such luck, just had a bad cold."},{"rating":"1","title":"nopointtothisbook","review":"This was the worst book that I have ever read in my life.

I would rather read the dictionary than read that book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beating my head with a rock would have been more fun","review":"I had to read this for english. I'm a cynical 16 year. If any thing this shows your the complete illogic in cynicism. This is the only book that ever frustrated me to the point of throwing it across my room.

I really thought that the auther did a very good job of telling in great detales about every person he sees, but at the some time at some point he sounded very gay when he would keep talking about how good some of the guys looked in the book and he just kept going and going about it for a page or two. But all together the book was very good because the way he kept the book in teresting with putting different emotions through out the book, he would talk in a way that he would be sad and then he would put in the mad parts in there even sad parts and i really loves the way he ended the book that was probably the greatest ending with out really ending the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Read","review":"I read this book when I was 17 and it absolutely blew me away. Holden's sad desperate angst and terrific need for answers to this phony world is exactly what hooked me. His gradual breakdown is terrible to watch but, like a traffic accident, you can't turn away. Yes, It has pretty raw language in it but this only enhances the book's realism and makes it that much more real and true."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like the commentary on our world","review":"I never really liked this book (probably because I was forced to read it when I was young).

Most present day teenagers can definitely relate to some aspect of this book. In fact, older adults can also relate back to difficult times during their teenage years. There were many times, as I was reading, that I paused and thought to myself, \\"this same thing has happened to me or I have often felt the same way about that.\\" Holden's \\"confession\\" in his quest to find true understanding and compassion is an odyssey that should be shared with others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Found this book to be slow and a little boring.

I have read it again, some 10+ years later and my conviction remains the same. As a point of reference, I also thought \\"On the Road\\" was overrated, maybe these 1950\\"s era efforts were simply unique in their time and have simply been romanticized through the years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be called 'Much Ado About Nothing II'","review":"Another good title for the book could be 'The Dopey, Immature Kid with a Lousy Attitude'. I read this book twice, once as an immature teenager and the second time as an immature adult. The reason I read the book again as an adult was to find the so-called 'great meaning and powerful ideas' that are supposedly contained in the novel. I found absolutely nothing of significance and meaning that would qualify this novel as a classic or masterpiece.Basically, this novel is simply about an immature, screwed up, mentally disturbed, brat with a terrible attitude. The only thing the kid needs is a good, hard kick in his butt. Don't get me wrong. It's an interesting read and somewhat enjoyable, but that's all there is to it. If you want to read a great novel with real significance and superb insight about our world then read '1984' by George Orwell, the greatest novel I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Catcher In The Rye","review":"Although everyone seems to think it's a must read book, I tend to differ. I read this book at age 18 because I was sure I was missing out on something great, but it turned out that I wasn't missing much. Holden Caulfield, the main character, is cynical, selfish, and an all around jerk if you ask me. Also, J.D. Salinger's writing technique didn't impress me. He was very repeditive, and instead of getting his point across, it only succeeded in running his point into the ground. I was very let down by this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"uau...","review":"HOulden should have stayed home.

Don't. I realize that if you've got a mind to read it you're going to do so. This is for the person who has a mind a to read 'a classic' but isn't sure which one they want to read. I hated this book. I can't possibly stress my disgust in it via this review. But know this. I read it during a three-week exercise in the Arizona dessert during my tour of service in the Marine Corps. Being that I was in the dessert my options were a) continue reading this book or b) play with dirt. Thirteen pages from the end I chose option b. And I am not a dirt enthusiast.

I don't now why but I have a preference for books who use still other words than Phoney, \\"old\\" and \\"goddamned\\". It is also perfect to ruin your day. Once you start reading this depressing novel from a boy who can't say a singular positive thing about his live, you can say goodbye to your happy feeling. There was only one positive thing about all this. I thought he put himself in a very strange position as a writer. He doesn't regard himself as being the all-knowing novelist, he puts himself kind of aside. You don't see that often. But than again, I think he's just trying to be the underdog, someone eccentric.

Salinger's unique style allows you to feel as if he is speaking to you directly throughout the novel. I could definitly relate and identify with the book as well. Being a seventeen year old girl, I face bouts with depression and so on,too. I would definitely reccommend this to anyone, especially young adults.Don't think of it as just another stupid book you have to read for school.Even the slackers who hate reading love this one!

Just as the movie, \\"Rebel Without a Cause\\" was one of the first movies to take adolescents and their viewpoints seriously, so was \\"Catcher\\" one of the first books to do so. Regarding the language, it's natural and fits the situation. The 3 (only) times that the \\"F\\" word is used (but who's counting), Holden is objecting to its use and trying to protect his sister from the word. People who want and wanted to ban this book either hadn't read it or didn't understand it. Books should be read and not banned, anyway. Most of us have felt out of place and disillusioned at one time or another. Salinger wrote about that type of experience from a young person's point of view instead of following the custom of the time and pretending that everything in life is wonderful. Life is varied, and it's sicker to ignore that fact than to address it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Growing Up","review":"\\" Catcher in the Rye \\" is about Holden Caulfield and Anti-heroic teenage American boy suffering from the symptoms of a mental breakdown.

It's one dull page after another as Holden explores the woes of life. No teenager is this seriously depressed. Everything makes him feel lonely and sad. He swears every other word. Everyone is a phony. I had no patience for his lameness. I only got through it to pass the section on it.They say he grieves for Allie.

A story about a spoiled preppy can only appeal to preppies and wannabe-preppies.People overlook Bukowski because they refuse to acknowledge their working-class similarities to the Bukster. Rather, they pretend that they too are preppy types.Caulfield's problems are self-inflicted. He's a whiny moron who deserves nothing but contempt.

All I got from this book was a look into the world of a typical teenage boy with a big annoyance with the world. I thought this book was disgusting and horribly written.

When I first read this book in high school I was surprised to see that someone understood me and what I was feeling and then incredulous that everyone else around me had the same kinds of feelings.

The story is about an adult male named Holden Cualfield. He is about to drop out of high school. The time he is traveling home because he left earlier than the school lets out for vacation. He wanders through New York City. There he meets with a girl friend that he met a while ago. Also during this book you begin to realize that Holden is very depressed in a complicated way. He isn't very suicidal, but throughout the book he constantly mentions that he is very depressed. Although many people say that, and don't really mean it, he could be doing something very fun like seeing a movie or on a date, but still isn't really happy, he thinks that there's something wrong all the time. I would recommend this book to anybody who is interested, or studying psychology. The reason why is that his depressed mind will interest and find out what his actual problem is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Varying Opinions Shouldn't Be Surprising","review":"I see how some of my fellow teenagers found The Catcher in the Rye to be a boring or frustrating or pointless book. After I got over my initial shock, I realized that while this book was extremely special to me, it could just as easily be seen as trash by someone else. It is a highly subjective piece of literature, unlike, say, The Odyssey, which can be dissected as easily and unpleasantly as a frog. For certain types of people (myself included), books like this and Catch-22 provide characters to identify with. Other people with valid opinions might scoff at Holden and Yossarian and look to Beowulf-type heroes for proper role models. Quite simply, the anti-hero isn't everybody's cup of tea. I don't recommend this book to everyone--just to those that have ever felt alone and misunderstood because of different beliefs or paradigms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should read this book!","review":"The Catcher In The Rye is definitely one of those books that I think everyone should read at least once in their lives. It really takes an in-depth look at human nature. This book is very powerful and thought-provoking. It explores the idea that everyone around us is a phony, including ourselves. At first this may seem like a shocking and scary statement, but as you read on you realize that unfortunately, this idea is very true. Everyone, whether it is intentional or not, is or has been at one point in his or her life, a phony. We all have a bit of Holden Caulfield inside of us.

Aside from all the notoriety it receives as the cause of some unfortunate incidences, the book is written flawlessly. The language Salinger chooses to use is easy enough to read that most all readers will find the words easy to comprehend. Yet therein lies Salinger's genius. Salinger depicts the mind of an adolescent male to perfection. Using fluid and basic diction, Salinger creates a mood and way of thinking that is so close to reality, its scary. Although not all young men have felt exactly the same as Holden, all have at one point felt certain aspects of Holden's disillusionment and pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stimulating plot, abrupt ending","review":"I had to read this book for my 11th grade English class.

CATCHER doesn't really have a plot or a meaning to me. Holden Caulfield is a boring, predictable, spoiled-brat prep school kid. Salinger's other characters (the Glass family) are much more multi-faceted and interesting. Do yourself a service and read Franny & Zooey or Raise the Roof Beam High, Carpenters & Seymour.His other books appeal to anyone on a spiritual search or who just want intelligently written books, not just teenagers who need to be coaxed with a mindless plot including lots of swearing, smoking, and sex to read a book.

I did some research about the book and such and what I found was that supposeably this book encouraged Mark Chappman to kill the beloved singer and song writer John Lennon a former band member of The Beatles.I personally thought the overall book was good.

And I'm still looking desperately for a plot. It's amazing that a two hundred plus page book can be so popular when there is no plot that I can see. The entire thing, as far as I can see, is about this messed up kid that isn't happy unless he swears twice a sentence. He's obsessed with getting laid and that dumb duck thing. My English teacher says it has some metaphorical meaning, but I don't see it. I only give it two stars because it is well written, there's great voice in the book, it sounds like a real person is there narrating it orally.

He stayed mired in this self-pity and couldn't see why nothing went his way. I didn't care for this book at all. I beleive that the only reason that it caught fire was because it was so \\"bad\\" when it was published that it was banned. This being banned added a little mystique to it.

I'm not exactly sure what the point of this book was unless it's describing how not to raise a kid or else he will end up this way.

The phonies tend to be those in a position of power and those with money. Very young kids are almost always genuine and nice.

At the time, I thought it was just about some whiny kid who hated absolutely EVERYTHING.It took five years, but I FINALLY get it. Holden's favorite thing to think was that people are phony. Well, guess what? People ARE phony. The book may not be about society moving away from spiritualism, but it is about society, and how hypocritical it is.

Holden experienced the same troubles and feelings that teenagers today have, so the book really is timeless. The feeling of wanting to save the world and be \\"the catcher\\" is felt by so many, yet those who don't feel it will never understand it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book grows on you","review":"I first read this book my freshman year in high school and hated it. I thought it was boring, overly pessimistic, and stupid. However, I decided to give it another shot this year. This time, I loved it. It is one of the most interesting and original books that I have ever read. It reminds me a lot of Huck Finn, not in its writing style, but in the underlying message. This is what I got out of both the books: You cannot escape from society through idealism, the only thing you can do is go with the flow and pretend to enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest ever.","review":"No doubt that this book has had a tremendous effect on me. It was the first book I ever read that wasn't either a mindless bestseller or a boring victorian novel. It is as brilliant now as it ever was. A masterpiece in every sense of the word."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed My View on a Lot of Things","review":"An important aspect of \\"the Catcher in the Rye\\" was that I was able to identify with the main character, Haulden. \\"Indentify\\", I feel is not strong enough a word, I was able to \\"get inside\\" his head, to plan his next move, to consider what he was considering. I fell in love with the style of writing of Sallinger's; an author doesn't do that too often now, they never take a chance such as that. The book made me cry at points, and made me think about life, and priorities. Simply put, this is an amazing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our First Ever Review","review":"One of the most depressingly honest books I've ever read. You can read it any time at any age and still feel emotionally involved in Holden's adolescent decline. Salinger is a really human writer whose writing style is crystal clear. Everything that is pure in humanity is in this book. In a world that becomes more and more alienating and stifling as you grow older, Holden seems to be a real symbol of why growing up is not such a great idea. If you want a desperately funny book this is the one for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming of age in another time","review":"Coming of age novels abound--there's one on every corner. And they take any and every form known to man. Huckleberry Finn, Of Human Bondage, To Kill a Mockingbird, and The Bark of the Dogwood are just a few. But the classic one has to be CATCHER IN THE RYE with its simplicity, its straightforward writing, its humor, and ultimately its loss of innocence. Yes, the book is touching and sad in places too--there's a sense that Holden might not come out of things (past the point where the books ends) all in one piece, emotionally speaking. Yet Salinger also gives us hope for the future. That's the brilliance of this book; it's so perfect in its form and weight that it feels like the classic that it is.CATCHER IN THE RYE is one of those books that MUST be read. If you haven't yet, you're really missing an unusual experience. If you have already read it, another shot at this great American classic wouldn't hurt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow Story But an Interesting Insight Into Human Nature","review":"Sallinger?s book, Catcher in the Rye is a well known book made famous by the movie Conspiracy Theory and the assassin of John Lennon. The book is a must read because of its historical significance, but don?t expect an interesting story. The book is almost exclusively about the main character, Holden Caulfield who is dealing with life between childhood and adulthood. I think Holden is a great representation of humanity in general- never being satisfied with anything, and being unable to deal with life. While reading of Holden, I found myself despising him and the immaturity that he displays in life. But really, much of what I despised in Holden are things that I hold in my own life.How about a sequel? Holden meets the 21st century. That would be interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still relevant, still hilarious","review":"I always passed over this book because I thought it would be dry - one of those old classics they force kids to read in school. It turned out to be one of the best books I've read this year. Laugh-out-loud funny in several places. It was written sixty years ago but the quality of the observations and satire hasn't faded. It's a quick read but it's so full of endearing characters, amusing situations and snarky comments that it's a shame when it ends. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teenage Pitfall","review":"Holden Caulfield is a 16-year-old boy gone a little too far over the edge. He is obviously seemingly normal (or at least relatively so) to those around him, but his thoughts can be so twisted that they disturb the mind. Ironically, Holden is the always trying to analyze other people, when he is the one who truly needs the help.There is an eerie sort of symbolism in Holden's words and actions. The red hat, the baseball mitt, and the turtleneck sweater, all have a certain significance. He focuses on these things because of their importance in his relationship with others.While Holden often claims to feel sorry for others, his depression creates even more sympathy for him. In time he sinks to such a low level that no one understands him anymore. He is isolated from his family and friends, first mentally, and then physically."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Overrated","review":"This is a horrid \\"novel,\\" and I have no idea why it's acclaimed as a great piece of work. Although the idea of \\"coming of age\\" can be treated with skill and grace, this book fails to do so. I'll tell you why: the writing is awful. This isn't skillful writing, this is ranting. Reading the book was absolutely painful. It was cliche after cliche, and I wanted to run screaming away from the book and into the arms of Shakespeare, Pope, Dryden - just to feel like the English language hasn't entirely deteriorated. In the scope of things, this novel does not deserve to be taught in schools.If you would like to read a WELL-WRITTEN, worthwhile, complex, poignant piece of writing about \\"coming of age,\\" please read \\"The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\\" by James Joyce. Please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is the world really this bad?","review":"Are people really as fake, dishonest, and downright nasty as Holden seems to think they are? I suppose the answer lies in the eye of the beholder, but Holden sure uses a lot of cuss words in telling you his opinion! Basically, the book is a long diatribe of an angst-filled teenager against the perceived woes of the world, and I actually agree with a good deal of what Holden has to say. Holden is an especially insightful and perceptive teenager as well, adding to the story and making it relevant to readers of all ages. An obvious point is that the book is most likely autobiographical in many ways, as most novels are. Many people are indeed phonies, Holden, especially through your eyes.

Then read \\"The Rules of Attraction\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holden is very abnormal","review":"This book was pathetic and very unreasonable. Not every teenager is like Holden so I really can't relate to the book. A seventeen year old student generally does not wonder off to the city especially in 1945."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book was a complete waste of time.","review":"I had so many high expectations for a book that had caused so much slander in American Society. Why would the people care about the book unless it contained revolutionary ideas. Instead, the only apparent reason they did care was that it was filled with profanity, sex, and filth. If I want to know all of that about the world we live in, I'll just watch the news. I try to read a book so that it may give me a new perspective on life rather than just telling me what I already know about it. This book is not worth the time or the money. Anybody can just walk around town and hear the same foul language."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this book","review":"I don't know why everyone tells you to read this book, IT SUCKED HUGE. The whole story was pointless, it should definatley not be listed as a classic anywhere. Holden is a spoiled brat who doesn't know a good thing when he has it. He reminds me of my little bratty sister, that just deserves a big slap in the face"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Overall Letdown","review":"My summer assignment for school was reading this book. Not only did I not enjoy the book, I thought its overall meaning was ridiculous.First of all, I can read sad stories. But the book constantly depresses you. I found the \\"vernacular\\" in the book annoying and nothing ever happened right.I highly disagree with the \\"beauty\\" and \\"heartbreaking imagery\\" in the book. The book was phony. I don't believe the story is universal at all. Not many people I know walked around New York city with symptoms of schizophrenia at the age of seventeen. It sure does not define my life. I do not think that is a great way to be initiated into adulthood. It sure does not tell the coming of age story for people I would like to know or meet in my lifetime.There are many great and fantastic American literary masterpieces out there.Read one of those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated boring garbage","review":"I think the only reason this book ever got acclaim is that it used the eff-word in 1951. The hypocritical main character is a rich spoiled brat who could care less for anyone he meets, then is appalled to be alone. I read the Cliff Notes in high school to get by this book and should have read them again instead of actually wasting time and energy reading this drivel. If you want to read classic American literature PLEASE avoid this garbage, try Stienbeck, Faulkner, Hemingway, hell even Stephen King is better than this over-rated crap.

I was assigned to read this book in high school and everyone in my class hated this book. I've read most of the classics and loved them all but this was just a horribly pointless book. Holden is basically a rich emo kid stuck in 1945. All he did was roam around New York city, talking to stupid people, tried and horribly failed at picking up chicks, got drunk, smoked and then crashed at a closeted homosexual's apartment, because he was too afraid to tell Mommy and Daddy he had been expelled for the 3rd or 4th time. I seriously wanted to rip this book up and throw it in the trash, if it hadn't been a school assigned book. What was with his constant crying? I half expected him to be cutting his wrists and writing a suicide note. He should be on Gossip Girl, not making teens read about his poor rich life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"I don't understand why people enjoyed this book.

The biggest 'phony' in the book is Holden Caulfield. This book's popularity is due to it's protagonist's foul language, which is less pungent than mine was in High School."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Only Book I Have Ever Enjoyed","review":"The great thing about \\"The Catcher In The Rye\\" is it's total lack of metaphors, boring literary device, and hidden meanings. Salinger leaves nothing to interperation, and presents his story of an aggrevated teenager, melancholy and cynical, in a black and white, analylitical fashion. By far the best book I have ever read, it's the only book I ever enjoyed. It's neither too long nor too short, hard to follow or monotonous, serious or comical. Instead, it is a portrait of the perfect novel, cutting through the sugar-coating and \\"beauty of literature\\" and getting right to the story and the point: that everything is nothing, and NOTHING is not worth wasting your life on."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is great but does have a few boring parts","review":"The Catcher and the rye is a really good book it's very interesting at first but then it starts getting boring. Then it gets better. This is a great book to read it makes you feel what Holden is feeling because it describes his fellings so well. I will warn you that some parts our pretty dull because it stresses the point to far quite a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"the catcher in the rye","review":"Awesome book.

Both times I was disappointed. Don't understand why a kid with a bad attitude makes for such a popular book. By page 50, he had me mad at everything. Maybe I'm shallow, but I don't understand the world's love affair with Holden Caulifield, nor anything he represents. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some people just miss the point...","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is much more than a disillusioned youth complaining about life in general. This, at its core, is a very sad story about a boy who lost his childlike innocence too early and recognizes that fact. Holden doesn't want the same thing to happen to all the other \\"little kids\\" in the world. I read this book for the first time when I was 14 and loved it. Every time I reread it I get more out of it. Holden's motives and perceptions become clearer to me the older I get. He is not a \\"spoiled preppie,\\" as some have purported. He grew up in a rarified environment and that is partly to blame for his view of the world. He mentions several times that he wants to move away to the mountains and live as a deaf mute. This isn't intended to show him as cynical. This shows his reaction to the environment he was lived in all his life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great none the less","review":"The Catcher In The Rye was a great book and it keept me intrested the whole time I was reading it. The only problem I have with it is that there seems to be no point to the story. I know it is supposted to show the difficulties of being a teen and all, but the story dosent go anywhere. Other then that the book was very good and involving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twice now.","review":"Twice now I've read \\"The Catcher in the Rye.\\" As a high school freshman, I found it difficult show sympathy towards Holden; I wasn't impressed, engaged, provoked or amused. A year and a half later I could relate much more to his sentiments, though I still don't see any quality in regards to Salinger's writing, execution or characterization. It's either a book you'll love or one you'll hate. And he hyped Pheobe up; she wasn't that interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"like this phoney reviewing system means anything..","review":"I hate this kind of thing, I really do. I mean, trying to review this thing when 1249 other people who are smarter than me are phoney and arrogant enough to write some corny review, like it means anything anyway. and all these people identifying with Holden. It kills me. It really does. I mean, who cares? They flash this book title up and tell you there is going to be a catcher...but there isn't a baseball mitt in sight, just some corny story about some illiterate kid with problems. and so what? Don't you hate when someone writes a novel that is timeless, that strikes a chord in the world still in fifty years. it's so corny you could cry, you really could. I think I\\"m going to give a copy of it to my sister, because you'd like her. and you'll like this book, you really will. even though this review will make no sense if you haven't read the book, you'll probably say it was useful to you.

Niether could I relate to the character, Caulfield nor did he seem like a very likable person. It was just interesting to see the world through a cynical teenager's eye. Sometimes he does make sense when he wonders at the pretense in our society, but mostly he just comes across as a self -centered, spoilt teen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly overrated","review":"I must say that this is one of the most pointless books I have ever read.

Aside from having no real plot or character development, this was probably the WORST book I have ever read. The story is completely repetitive, it goes like this: Holden Caulfield goes out and does something stupid, complains about it, then goes out and does some other stupid thing. I never once sympathized with Holden because all his failures were HIS OWN FAULT!! I am a 16 year old male, and this was the worst book I ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Easy Read","review":"I am a teen, and I mostly appreciated this book for its easy-to-read style. It flows smoothly and doesn't have sophisticated language that teens have to dig through. Also, it's about problems and stuff that teens can relate to so many appreciate this novel.

Salinger's A CATCHER IN THE RYE is remarkable yet painful tale of the angst of a young, disillusioned youth named Holden Caulfield. Salinger's use of imagery and few words adds to the confusion and passionate yearning of Holden. In the end you are compassionate towards him, yet the reader has no problem identifying with Holden. You unwillingly leave A CATCHER IN THE RYE breathless and forever changed, having been inside Holden's head far too long, yet not long enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything is a phony","review":"This book is one of the most enjoyable books that I have ever read. It is about a seventeen-year-old boy named Holden Caufield that is expelled from Pencey Prep. He doesn't want to tell his parents that he was kicked out of school and goes to New York City to spend a couple of days. Here he has a lot of adventures. Holden is a boy that thinks that everything is phony, he seems to hate everything, sometimes gets depressed, and is a terrible compulsive lyer. This book is mostly for teenagers, and talks about a lot of real issues that many people face in the world; it is also very easy to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Catcher in the Rye","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is one of those books that can easily be over analyzed, but is never understood. Some see that as part of its intrigue, but I simply find it ridiculous. The Catcher in the Rye, while not a horrible book by any means, does not live up to its widespread fame and appeal. It is a staple on school reading lists and is considered to be a \\"must-read\\" for all educated people. Why? Good question.I've come across many people who claim to love The Catcher in the Rye, who say that it is full of deeper meaning and symbolism. Unfortunetly, when I ask them to elaborate and explain what it means, there is silence. I think that a lot of people say that they like the Catcher in the Rye because that's what you are supposed to say - you're supposed to like it. I just don't see what its appeal is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Birthday Catcher in the rye.","review":"50 years young today! Still as fresh as ever. \\"She was skinny, Rollerskate skinny\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Catcher in the Rye","review":"J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye portrays Holden Caulfield as a sixteen-year old, white, upper class, New Yorker in the 1950s. The book shows Holden's unwillingness to grow up and his struggle with loneliness. Salinger does a good job of describing how Holden feels about people and things. For example, when he is talking about a young man he met that went to a good college, he says \\"The jerk had one of those very phony, Ivy League voices, one of those very tired, snobby voices. He sounded just like a girl.\\" This helps you understand that Holden doesn't like phony people. He uses language that convinces readers that Holden is a young man from New York in the mid-twentieth century. This book is easy for teenagers to relate to because they can associate with his stupid actions and propensity for deception, along with his adolescent silliness and his genuine care for innocence. I think the book is provocative and well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remains amazingly applicable 40 years later","review":"The mouthy Holden Caulfield is about to be expelled from yet another boarding school. He decides to return to New York early, and encounters all sorts of darkly comic adventures. Caulfield is the quintessential anti-hero; he tries to be angry and alienated, but still wants to catch people, to save them. He is not angry, but weary and jaded. His wild dreams of escape are shattered by reality, rendering this story a true tragedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The story of a tedious nobody doing nothing","review":"The story of a haughty, aimless, irresponsible teenager wandering around for a couple days, doing nothing of importance: thoroughly uninteresting. I don't see why people like this book -- it's just \\"Hey, look at the antics of this stupid kid!\\" I suppose the traditional answer is that it reminds many people of themselves (it didn't for me -- I was always quite down to earth, perhaps too much sometimes), but what would make such reminiscing about ephemeral, meaningless, and unimportant stupidity enjoyable to someone? I don't get it. Alternately, maybe they empathize with Holden Caulfield, but I could muster up no such empathy when I read this at 16 or 17.This book was obviously successful, so it must have done something for lots of people. It did nothing for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmmm.......","review":"WEll, I sure wouldn't want to argue with so many favorable opinions, but I just finished reading this book for the first time and I just thought...hmmmm..o.k.

The relationship Holden had with his sister was a bit strange too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toss it in the rye","review":"This over-hyped collection of words drags the reader through the mind of a confused adolescent with tapestry generally reserved for a low brow detective story featuring the obligatory out-of-luck private investigator. The narrative presentation is as phony as the opining of the central character. No doubt the only reason this book became a popular classic is because of society's willingness to proclaim the wares of Art and Literature to be avant-garde simply for being outrageous or gross without consideration of intrinsic beauty or meaning. Escape the herd and shun the elitist dupes."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book that spawned a stereotype","review":"How ironic that a book that was once hailed for boldly exposing the stereotypes of our world has now become one itself. The moody, rebellious teenager, bored with the world after a decade and a half of living, stops going to school and wanders the urban wasteland in search of himself. Catcher might have been the original, but it's now one of millions of copycat teen-angst novels. The writing may be a little better than the modern hollywoodized versions, but the subject matter is old hat today. For a typically rebellious teenager, it might be a refuge; for me, it was kind of depressing. I expected more than a whiny kid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why It Deserves 1/5 Stars","review":"If you've ever witnessed a small animal being run over by a car you have some idea of what this book is about.

I'm not a high schooler by any means and i've had a lot of time to reflect over this book. I find it as pointless as the day i read it. You would be much better off reading a nice Grisham, actually and algerbra textbook would be more interesting than this book. Unless you like things repeated three times by a mentally disturbed main character i would suggest you disregaurd all the good reviews. I'll give you a quote that pretty much sums up the main characters speach pattern \\"I don't like her she's phoney. she really is. honestly.. she so phoney in every way....I know I've only looked at her luggage and know nothing about her.\\" Thanks for reading my review, take my advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Considering the praise this book has gotten I was suprised to find myself struggling not to toss this book in my fireplace.

I cannot believe anyone would rate this book low (1 star! come on!), but I know . . . to each his (or her) own. It's a classic, and I'm a little ashamed of myself that, while I've had it sitting on my bookshelf for years, I haven't discovered it first-hand until now.I would highly recommend this book for teens and pre-teens.

But I had to wade through a lot of slag to find that gem. The problem is that Holden is such an unsympathetic character. He's a rich, East coast WASP who has been given several opportunities for a free education. How does he respond? Well, he can't apply himself because everyone is too phony. Hell, Holden could find phoniness lurking in a fruit bowl. What passes for tragedy in Holden's life? Losing his fencing team's foils on the subway or discovering that a seedy hotel also has seedy clientele. How can you care what happens to a character like this?Perhaps, if Holden was freed from his parent's economic bondage he could finally toss off those golden manacles; become homeless and head downtown for the free eats; stand in a soup line three times a day and finally get hit with some Freakin Real!

Recent novels like MOTHER OF PEARL, or MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA, or THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY are far more to my taste. Obviously, \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" has proven to be of immense value to many people. I'm just not one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is one of the best drama books I've read.","review":"\\"Catcher in the Rye\\" is one of the best dramatic books there is. It's about a boy named Holden Caufield and personal troubles. He is very disturbed and decides to drop out of school without telling his parents and go on his own. Holden goes through a lot of particular situations that are very surprising for the help contribute to what he does with his life in the end. This book will keep you very interested and might make you even think about your life. You'll just have to read it yourself to understand my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gawdawful Book...","review":"What can I say? I just finished reading this book, which had been hyped up beyond all belief. Anitclimax does not begin to cover what I feel. I think Salinger himself would be dismayed by all the Phonies, who say they like this book, just like they admired Lunts... Damn Phonies.. the lot of them"},{"rating":"2","title":"Catcher in the Rye shows one man can survive by themselves","review":"This novel shows that one person can survive the hardships that the earth can give you on their own. It has a uniques way of doing this. It shows it by telling the story od Holden as he travles from one school to another. Another idea that the author, J. D. Salinger, wants you to get out of this novel is the innocence of kids. They have their innocence for only a little of their life, and Salinger wants them to hold on to it as long as they can. He shows this by the way he feels when he sees the F word in the school, and when he diescribes his dream. These factors come into play all throughout this great and exciting novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting book","review":"I have come to the conclusion that, no matter how good the book, when i am forced to read something for an english assignment, i never can never enjoy the author's writings. I am a sophomore and i was assigned Cather in the Rye earlier this year. I found the language whiny and aggrevating. However, when i reread the novel, i realized that my original opinion was incorrect. While Holden can become aggrevating with his over use of the word \\"phoney\\", he is a character that i think any teenager can relate with at some point in their life. As a teenager, i do relate with Holden and i can understand his resentment of change. I have come to realize that my first analysis of the book, was completley incorrect and i can now read cather in the rye and enjoy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Old Maybe?","review":"The entire time I was reading this book I was expecting the next page to become \\"The Great Book\\". It however failed me. I guess I may be too old or distant from my teenage years to fully understand Holden. (Wait, I am only 23.)I can however say it may have taught people lessons about life, especially young adults or it wouldn't of become this \\"GREAT MASTERPIECE\\" everyone has been talking about for fifty years.To me it was like phantom of the opera, although I really didn't want to read the book, I did, because it was supposed to be a great Literature Masterpiece. Maybe I should stop being a follower. I am wasting too much time.Two Stars because 1. I liked some of the dialouge and 2. It only took me three hours to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"the essence of a lost youth&#65533;s plight","review":"Holden Caulfield carried around a lot of emotionalbaggage for one so young ( sixteen ). His growing painswere overwhelming at times as he was entering manhood;his rite of passage, if you will. He saw his older brotherJ B the writer as a total sellout for becoming a hack writerin Hollywood. Holden loved his younger sister Phoebe. Hethought she was wicked smart. He still mourned his littlebrother Allie who had died of leukemia. Holden had a hardtime handling Allie's death. Somehow he just didn't seemto fit in anywhere. He had a problem dating girls his ownage. He fought with his roommate. His grades were failingat his second prep school of which he was asked to leave.Holden Caulfield didn't seem to really belong anywhere!I think that Salinger has nailed it in this novel. He hascaptured the essence of a lost youth's plight. A great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I gave it 5 stars because 6 wasn't an option!","review":"I read this book a few months before my sixteenth birthday - and I've never found a character I liked more than Holden Caulfield. The monologue is heartfelt, realistic, and funny. The things he goes through in this novel are timelessly relevant to a teenager's thoughts and feelings, yet the writing is so good, the character development so thorough, that it can appeal to any reader. I can't put into words my love for this novel, because it struck a chord deep within me; I read it at just the right time in my life (and I've read it many times since). I definitely recommend this.. it's a must-read for ANYONE. A million stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece...Read This Book!!!","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. I am amazed at the ability of Salinger to peer into the minds of his characters and pull out an illusion that anyone can witness and feel. His short stories do the same, inviting you on a psychological endeavor into the minds of fictional characters. These are thoughts and actions we all can relate to and it makes the characters much more interesting when this can be done. All of Salinger's work is very unique and very special, but this story in it's entirety is on another, a higher, level of greatness. In my opinion, Catcher in the Rye is one of the greatest books ever written. Read it. The paperback is cheaper, but you might want to spend the extra money to place this one on your display shelf for multiple readings and admiration."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed the book very much and highly recommend it.","review":"The novel was fantastic.

I sort of read it in grade school, but at that age the story line didn't have much meaning to me, and I didn't understand what was going on.This book may be controversial for it's time but I really don't see the big deal now. Sure he says \\"Goddamn\\" a lot and there's a bit of sex talk going on, but that's about it. PG 13 at the most.Holden gets kicked out of high school and our story begins with him telling us his last days of school and returning home. The time frame of the book is only 2 or 3 days. Holden believes everyone is \\"phony\\" with the exception of a few people he actually likes.I enjoy this theme of finding ways to cope with the \\"phonies\\" of the world. I'm a big Kurt Vonnegut fan and this theme is often covered in his books. \\"and so it goes\\"Anyways, I don't know if I would consider this a classic, but it's a good book for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it a chance","review":"This is a great book. I am captivated and can't put it down. For those who reviewed it and called it boring, they need to understand that it is strictly a view of a character, not an actual story with a plot. they're true, but that's one of the reasons you'll love it, because it's so unique. Give it a chance, you won't be dissappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not like this book at all","review":"For work over the summer fror an AP course i was taking, i was instructed to read this book. Everything that i found within the covers, i disagreed with.First, it lacked a plot. if someone found one, please email me and tell me what it is.Second of all, Holden Caulfield is totally unrealistic. I am 15, turning 16 soon and have NONE of the feelings that Holden does, except a profound love for golf. I have never desired to drink, get a whore or anything. Holden is a character that represents a bout .01% of this population, much like the Kids who attacked Columbine. It was just something about them.My suggestion to anyone looking for a book to readis this: stay away from catcher in the rye."},{"rating":"1","title":"If -5 stars was an option, I would have picked it.","review":"I don't know, maybe it's just me, maybe I missed something, but I thought this was the most pointless, boring, and redundant book I ever read.

It's full of complaints and Holden doing stupid things. Reading it a waste of time. It will put you in a nasty mood and make you feel like there's less to life than you originally thought. It was reccommended to me by a teacher and I was ready to slap her when I finished the book. I can't find justification for it being called a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read...","review":"I am sorry if I offend anybody by my review of this book, but I think it was soooooo stupid! I am a pretty big reader of books and this one just made me mad because it never got anywhere and just rambled on about nothing. I could've written a better book than this and I am only 16 years old!

Well, I have to be honest, I don't like this book. I mean, I think the plot is powerful and the point of view is, but it's not only confusing, but it gets on your nerves. Holden Caufeild is the most irritating character I've ever read in a book! Every word he says is like hearing nails being scratched against a blackboard.

One third into the book, it hits you that nothing is changing, it is basically not going anywhere, and the situation keeps on repeating itself. The interesting personalities disappear, and it turns to be just a normal story not really headed to any conclusion...The last third is just continuing the New York adventure, just in detail how the night develops, and wondering would this night ever ends...Anyway, some situations could be funny reading the book in the right mood, but if you have time to read, I would seriously re-consider."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is pure crap!

Absoltuely nowhere. It involved characters that I could have cared less about and nobody was doing anything remotely interesting. It was almost like reading somebody's journal, a bunch of pointless entries. Somehow, this thing became a classic and I think everyone has jumped on the bandwagon and agrees that it is one just so that they can say that they have read a classic. If a mess like this can get published, there is hope for aspiring writers everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want to vomit","review":"If you're fascinated by the ruminations of some whiny rich kid who thinks the world owes him a living as he ponders Central Park ducks and goes whore-chasing, then maybe you might like this book.

I wanted to like the book; really, I did. But I couldn't.J.D Salinger begins his novel from the perspective of Holden Caulfield, a teenage boy who talks of how he ends up in his current position in a rest home for therapy. Holden speaks to readers directly as he recounts the events that lead up to his being sent away. I expected the tale of some horrific event to unfold, instead I was informed of Holden's expulsion from school, his dilemma of having to tell his parents, and some things that happen in between. Nothing really happens.The book is written like a drab, repetitive rant and gets annoying fast. Upon completing the novel, I felt as if I had read an entirely different novel from the Catcher in the Rye that everyone seems to rave on and on about. Maybe it's just lost some of its flair with age; or perhaps, it's just gotten too overrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"If a body catch a body...","review":"As one of the \\"great books\\", and one that a former consumer I worked with listed as her favorite, I felt a certain obligation to read <em>Catcher</em>, at least once.Alienation?

Somewhat.I didn't particularly enjoy reading Catcher, nor did I see, at the time, what the \\"greatness\\" that was supposed to be mined from the pages. Reflecting on it now I can begin to see a little of it. Perhaps this is one of those books that was meant to be read and discussed as a group, rather than consumed in a solitary mode."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get all the fuss!","review":"This book has been referred to as a great American novel by well respected reviewers. What, slow day in Literary Land? I really, really didn't like this book. I really, really didn't like Holden. I really, really don't get all the fuss about the coming of age message, the teen angst, etc. Glad I got through it so I can read a GOOD book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"First World Problems","review":"When Catcher in the Rye came out it was something of revolution. Never before had anyone took time to explore the mind or problems of the over-privileged, white, American teenager. It is an esoteric novel, a low brow piece of literature that sells to its particular crowd: people who haven't read much, or experienced actual life beyond the age of twenty. Now, it's not necessarily the worst thing I've read, but the acclamations people have given it are beyond absurd. Only a fool could identify with Holden Caulfield. This book is basically the 'Twilight' of its day. The only reason it's regarded as a classic is because enough time has passed. Somehow the imagery of an era gone by is enough to cement itself as something of a must read. But you don't need to read it. The story is very simple. It's about an angry white kid, who travels across the city, and finds out that there's more to life than his incessant, introspective whining...and of course there is."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing description","review":"The description lead me to believe it was with some disruption.

I love Holden, he is so nice, smart, and so sensible with everything. I love the way he thinks and the way he expresses himself. I think everybody should read this book at least once.

The story has no plot, and centers around the first-person whining of Holden- a college-aged rich kid so obnoxious, he made me want to jump into the story and slap him silly!To each their own!

(It is, perhaps, a \\"classic\\" in the sense that Britney Spears is a \\"star.\\") Having recently read the book for the first time, I discovered (regrettably, too late) that I had been misinformed. It is not at all about a young man coming of age, beset by archetypical teenage angst and alienation; it is about mental illness. I also suspect it is autobiographical, and so do not blame Mr. Salinger for the book's lamentable lack of any literary merit.

Also when he fought with Stradlater-his roommate-, if he was stronger, and he knew he was going to kick his butt, why did he fight with him?.

True, the book is about a couple of days in a sixteen-year-old's life, but there is a point, a reason in which Holden Caulfield explains about those particular days of his life. There is a process of alienation which occurs throughout the book and finally comes to a hidden conclusion at the end of the book, which results in having to read the last chapter very carefully to find out about Holden's whereabouts at that point. I had to read the last chapter three times before I finally understood where he really was and why he didn't give details in that chapter. All in all, this is a fantastic book about alienation and adaptation only for those who truly understand it, and for those who don't understand the meaning, it is a funny story about a cynical teenager's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is insane!","review":"Okay.

Throughout the book, Holden, the main character, wanders purposelessly in thought and action, indifferent and cynical to the world around him -- the typical \\"anti-hero.\\" The reader is given a negative look at humanity, not for the purpose of correcting the worst in people, but for reveling in it.For an uplifting view of man, I suggest the masterpiece novel by Ayn Rand, Atlas Shrugged. Miss Rand presents man as a heroic being who is capable of dealing with reality. Although one may look at Atlas Shrugged and cringe (it is 1100 pages), one will be wishing for more by the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Boring Book","review":"I was hoping this was going to be the genre fitting my type: teenage rebellion and socialism, etc., but it didn't at all.

I strongly suggest something more like \\"The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys,\\" which is like \\"Catcher in the Rye,\\" but is much more humorous and has a plot, even though their main focus is teenage rebellion and socialism, life, troubles, sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll.

As I started reading this book, after about 25 pages I thought it would get better once the story started, but lo and behold... there is no story.Ok, heres a summary, for all potential readers. A troubled teen fails out of school-complaining-, goes into New York city-complains. Thinks about calling a few people-complains. Gets a prostatute, talks to her for a couple of minutes-complains. She leaves-complains some more. Gets in a fight-complains a little. Goes to a bar-complains. Goes on a date with an old friend-complains.

It was one of the hardest books to choke down! It felt like a sad attempt at being an annoying teenager.I tried to read this book again a couple of months ago. This critically acclaimed book could not be that bad. No, sorry still whiny and pointless. It's full of characters I don't care to know or even get to if I did. I understand if drivel was a reason to be banned then I could see why this would be a challenged book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good style, but over-rated","review":"I'll admit, I enjoyed the style in which this story was written. He talks with slang, cuss words, uses street talk, and his prose is a good representation of the way people spoke in the late '40s and early '50s.However, what was the point to this book? Throughout the book, Caufield complains, whines, and tells the reader how much he hates life, the adult world, and everything else. He's very negative, very pessimistic, and is always cynical of society. He can't cope with his environment, can't adapt to the real world, and thus isolates himself and pretends he is above everybody else.The book has no conclusion either. .. No conclusion, little hope, and an abrupt end to a pointless book. If Holden Caufield hated life so much, why didn't he shoot himself and save my time, and the time of millions of other people?Kevin"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for anyone with real angst","review":"Catcher in the Rye is the most overrated book I have ever read (and I have read many). Holden Caulfield is 100% unoriginal and phony and symbolizes the concept known as the \\"White Man's Burden\\". Holden is the origin of all of his 'suffering'. He also symbolizes the hypocrisy of priviledged people (perhaps Salinger's intent). I give this book 2 stars for the simple fact that it could fool so many people for so many years. If you are interested in reading this book because it is 'the voice of your generation', then think again. Anyone, especially teenagers, who are suffering from actual anguish and emotional pain shouldn't waste your time reading this book because it will only annoy you."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book stinks. Or something. I don't know.","review":"I picked up this book because I grew up hearing it's title, which always intrigued me. It is written in the style of a wishy-washy 16-year old, this is the ONLY reason I give this book two stars. Salinger caught the wishy-washiness of a teenager's viewpoint on life PERFECTLY, but this perfect portrayal of a mind without goals is exactly what makes this book a TEDIOUS READ. Caulfield, the main character, cannont commit to one sentence throughout the entire book without backing out of it a sentence later, with a \\"or something,\\" or a, \\"if you want to know the truth,\\" or another dated late 1940's cliche'. I dropped this book, and picked up Les Liaisons Dangereuses, which was written 220 years ago, and IT seemed less dated. Don't read this unless you are a student of 1940's America, and you like terms like \\"I get a bang out of this,\\" and, of course \\"That crumby person is a real phoney.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel","review":"Sheer drivel, drivel, drivel, drivel, drivel, drivel.

Holden didn't end up going."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Book","review":"I checked this book out at the library the other day and finished it that very same day. I believe it is now my new favorite book. Holden Caulfield is such a great character who narrates the book with a mix of humor, cynicism, and nostalgia. Holden has trouble making the transistion from childhood to adulthood due to the phoniness of it all. Longing to be a \\"catcher in the rye\\", he wishes he could save children from \\"falling\\" of a cliff into adulthood. This book should be read and reread by everyone. A true masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmm...","review":"The Catcher in the Rye was a very funny book to me. It centers around a young man (I forget his name as I read this book two years ago, but plan to read it again soon) and his crazy life style, with girls, a little too much swearing, smoking, and \\"Interesting\\" friends from school. He has a little sister named Phoebe (isn't it amazing, I remember HER name) who is not mentioned often but who sort of is an influence, and this book just made me happy, sad, and full of mirth all at once. Great book to read out of or in school (in my case, I read it out of school)...The story of 'his' interesting life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"J.D. Salinger is commended for his world-acclaimed \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\", which is so beautiful, both young and older audiences may enjoy it.The main character is Holden, who is a teenage boy that the majority of an audience will understand; Holden is a character who outwardly seems tough, but the reader will discover that he is struggling with himself inside.J.D. Salinger does an impressive job by using subtle symbolism. The plot is well-developed and aided by the right amount of description of characters and settings. Holden speaks in first-person as the narrator and tends to ramble on, making the format and style of this book highly original - and thus, enjoyable.A book that must be read, for it is emotional, touching, and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"My absolute favorite-- it changed my life!","review":"I don't know how many times I've read it since my first time in high school, but seeing this anniversary occasion makes me know it's time to read it again.

I still had notes I had written in it when I was in high school almost 20 years ago. The book became my journal as my own thoughts were written on the side pages of the book. This book remains influential because it is a timeless story for the confused, disgruntled, and frustrated youth. Holden Caulfield is a literary icon, the best friend any 16-year-old could have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Piece of Literature","review":"I first read this book in 9th Grade English (to be fair, I still AM in 9th grade English). All i do is keep reading it over and over and over again waiting until my birthday when I'll get the rest of the J.D. Sailinger books. Including of course the memoirs about him by Margret Sailinger. Until then I relate almost every to something from Catcher in the Rye to my everyday life. Like, that annoying book who sits next to me in Math to Holden's classmate at Pencey Prep, Ackley. All in the is by far the best piece of literature anyone over the age of 12 could read. I Loved it! Read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everybody's a critic","review":"I've read some of the reviews and it's mostly from 2 opposite extremes of love or hate. No wonder Salinger feel compeled to retreat from society, the venom sometimes is too bitter a pill. I always thought Catcher in the Rye is about family or specifically relationship between siblings. The ending where the sister is pleading Holden to stay is one of the most poignant moment that I've ever read. It's not the world that he's angry about, it's the disconnection from his family and it took a display of love from his sister to finally pull him back. I've always felt a quiet introspection everytime I read the book and a greater appreciation for my family and especially my sisters. I think what Mr. Salinger is trying to say is that nothing is more important than family, nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Catcher in the Rye 3-ACE orange","review":"The Catcher in the Rye, by J.D. Salinger was a surprisingly interesting book! As a group we all agreed that it seemed unappealing at first, but in the end we found it to be the best book on the summer reading list. It described the experiences of a young man named Holden Caulfield after he was expelled from Pencey Prep School, a boarding school for boys. The author places Holden on a captivating journey through New York City and vividly describes every detail of it. These thoughts, adventures, and reactions are what make the book so easy for a teenager to relate to. J.D. Salinger created a story of excitement and intrigue that captured our attention and will do the same for you. We strongly recommend this book to people of all ages, especially young adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressed Young Man","review":"In the novel The Catcher in the Rye the author J.D. Salinger writes of a teenage boy who has once again been kicked out of school and leaves a few days before the start of break. He leaves to New York city where he goes through many hardships and we find that he has had a nervous breakdown. I find this story to be boring and repetitive, and I find the amount of bad words disturbing though possibly correct for a boy of his age.Holden Caulfield is a sad, depressed young man but I never feel sorry or bad for him. He never seems to be very important to me and I do not care for the character, though there is much that I would wish to change about him."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATED this book","review":"I will try to keep myself composed here, but I absolutely HATED this book. It was slow, had a terrible plot (or lack thereof), and bored the hell out of me.Holden Caulfield does NOT embody anything (like despair, cynicism, and realism as many people say), except for annoyance, and perhaps whininess. Seriously. Not only am I not sympathetic (or empathetic) with him, but I feel the urge to reach into the pages and slap the stuffing out of him.I think perhaps the worst part about the book is that its not even like Holden DOES anything. Hell, things dont even really happen TO him, either. He just drifts around, which would be fine if interesting things happened to him... but they dont. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book ever!","review":"I'm not much of a reader, but this is probably the best book I've ever read! It's so well-written and the story is very realistic! I can't explain how good this is, so just buy the book and read it, and I GUARANTEE you that you will NOT be disappointed in any way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite","review":"I first read this book in 8th grade. I was still slightly ignorant in the \\"ways of the world\\" you might say and, while I understood what Holden was saying, I didn't want to believe it. I read it again in 10th grade and then again this year, my senior year. This year is the year I finally clicked with the book. It's sad that some reviewers disliked this book because it \\"had no plot.\\" It's not about what Holden is doing, it's about Holden's reactions to the world around him. After reading some of these brilliant reviews I feel like reading the book again.If anyone feels like intelligently discussing the book feel free to e-mail me at cgmjthom@ismi.net."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my thing","review":"I was browsing around amazon for some of the top most rated books and this book was among them so I decided to give it a read. Towards the beginning the book seemed pointless but I carried on anyway, hoping that soon it would turn interesting but that never truly happened. I am a teenager and I didn't really enjoy this book. Maybe I am too young to understand the \\"retaining child-like innocence\\" message in this book. I wasn't very fond of the slangy language either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am not the smartest person, but I have to say that Catcher in the Rye is totally overated. The whole thing is about a teenager who is a total loser who can't have any type of relationship because he is too selfish. He is kicked out of boarding schools. He can't go home. He can't do anything right simply because that would be an admission to following a basic social rule. Total crap, don't waste your time, unless you like being mad at a fictional character.I was mad at myself for reading this book, but after the realization of taking the bad with the good, it was sort of a consolation. I still recomend skiping this one though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this considered a classic?!?","review":"A rambling accounting of about 3 to 4 days in the life of a teenager named Holden Caulfield. Holden is mentally unstable, and a bit distraught over being expelled from another expensive boarding school. There is absolutley no plot. It is exactly like reading the mind of a teenager with no personal motivation, or ambition. Mildly amusing, mildly depressing, rampant profanity.This is the worst book I've read in a long time. Yes, that includes the House of Night series, and the Cirque Du Freak! I was very disappointed. I would recommend this to anybody who likes to slow down at the scene of a vehicle accident for the sake of curiosity. It offers no literary value or edification whatsoever.When I started reading it, I kept expecting it to get better, or make some kind of point. When I realized it wasn't going to improve, I felt far enough invested in it, that I decided to finish it reguardless of my low opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"The Catcher in the Rye has been touted as one of the greatest literary works of the 20th century. I had always meant to read it and finally got around to it just recently. I must say I do not see the \\"masterpiece\\" quality to the writing nor was it much of a story, quite frankly. I would bet that if this were floated to publishers today it would never see the light of day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely over rated","review":"I believe that works of art, be it sculpture, painting, music or literature are a product of their time. Those that are destined for greatness are rediscovered by sucessive generations with Michagelo, Van Gogh, Mozart, and Shakespeare as examples. Salinger's works in contrast, seems dated and aimed squarely at the angst of pampered American Baby-Boomers.Although I enjoyed this book as an adolescent, a recent re-reading of it made it seem self important and irrelevant. I actually wanted the main charecter to shut up and get over himself.I imagine Holden as a current day overweight, balding, middle manager working in MidTown, with and ex wife, drinking problem, large pharmacy bill, and chip on his shoulder caused by the world doing him wrong.To me, this novel has not stood that test of time that some other great works from the era such as Slaughter House 5, and Lord of the Flies have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to read","review":"A recent magazine article on J.D.

In 7th grade I read this book, and I am currently in 8th Grade, I was always considered Intellectual and I read at a College Level. But enough banter about myself. Getting to the most awseome book of all time, Holden Claufield undergoes a struggle in his life. He dropped out of high school, and Lives in new york, his younger brother died when he was 10, and he always remembered the words of his brother \\"The catcher in the rye, the Catcher in the rye, I want to be a catcher in the rye\\" and Is aghast when corrected to find out it is \\"Catcher in the Rough\\" The book is summarized by basically saying, read this.. You'll understand why.

If I could, I would go on and on but I think it would be too long. It has had a major impact on American Literature and culture, and it is extremely well-written and heart-felt. It is a masterpiece of American Literature, and should be read."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of few timeless works","review":"I don't understand when people label Holden as a bad seed or an awful person. Did you not read the part where he explains his 'catcher in the Rye' theory? If more people had a heart like that-a true beneath the surface kindness- as does Holden then i believe we would all be thatnkful. Of course there are 'catchers' in all our lives. Be it a caring friend a confidant, our mother or father, whomever was there to help us through a rough time. to keep us from falling off the cliff. Unbeknownst to him, holden did live out his dream. i think his character saved many adolescents 'playing in the field'. Also, jane is so symbolic! it's amazing. I truly recomend this book. Glorious job J.D. Salinger!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changes lives...","review":"'A Catcher in the Rye' isn't about being a perfect person.

Holden Caulfield is just a rich little kid that takes everything for granted and thinks everything and everyone in this world is \\"phony\\". I think the only phony in this novel is Holden Caulfield himself. There's really not much else to say about The Catcher in the Rye... it's not as good as everyone makes it out ot be, and Holden Caulfield is a little twerp!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better the second time around...","review":"One of those classics that I read as a teenager. I don't remember my reaction then (except for the nagging feeling that it was something I was supposed to appreciate because it was a classic and because I was right around Holden's age). So here I am 40 years old, reading it again. And I think it's magnificent. As a teenager, I probably thought Salinger was a lot like me because of the voice he has created for Holden. As an adult, I think Salinger is a brilliant stylist because he obviously \\"captured\\" the voice of an angst-ridden (and for good reason!) teenager. There is so much complicated stuff to consider amidst a seemingly uncomplicated tale. And it's always fascinating to consider what literature sticks around and what doesn't. Just for grins, I checked out the Pulitzer site and discovered that Conrad Richter's The Town won in the same year that Catcher in the Rye was eligible. Makes you wonder which 2005 titles will still be around 55 years hence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"When I picked up this book, I was looking forward to it immensely. I knew it was a classic, and a classic, by definition, is a book that has stood time. I found during and after reading it, that it's just a boy, telling you his thoughts. The swearing gets to be tired and completely unnecessary. The things that this boy does are repeatedly stupid and leads me to wonder why I would ever want to know his every thought. Don't expect a novel that you'll love to read/have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holden Caulfield is the embodiment of teenage rebellion.","review":"Teenage rebellion is a part of every American's life, whether in thought, idea, or action. J.D. Salinger's character of Holden Caulfield has managed to embody the spirit of the teen rebel. Many of us have withheld personal information from others for fear of our parents. Many people have been disgusted with all the phonies of the world, of people who are not true to themselves. And many of us are, like Holden, guilty of being a phony ourselves. Holden Caulfield is the conflicted and confused person we all are or were at one time of another. The person who acts like nothing bothers them or that they know the ways of the world, when really we've only just began to explore the world. I read this book when I was sixteen and related to every word written. Four years later, I still relate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"Good book....good for people who like to get into someones life.

I really can't think of any other book that I can say the same thing about it. I was just entering college when I read Catcher in the Rye the first time. It took me only two nights to finish it. I thnk the reason I enjoyed it so much is I could really relate to the struggles of Holden Caufield, the protagonist. I went through all these same crazy emotions when I was still finding myself at that age. Now that I finally know what I am doing with my life, it's kind of like recapturing my youth every time I read this book. So, if you haven't read this book yet, please add it to your list.

He sees the world in a childish, cynical way more suited for a spoiled ten-year-old. He refers to everyone as phonies and bastards and uses a limited vocabulary to repeatedly rehash subjects that weren't interesting the first time around. I have nothing against J. D.

After I finished the book I wasn't enlightened, happy, sad, or anything on the spectrum of emotions that lie on either side of average. I probably yawned and said, \\"well, done with that one.\\"Holden is one of those characters who represent people that I have never particularly cared for in life. In fact, people like him annoy me something fierce. But, as these reviews and history shows, there are a great number of people who can relate and who love this book.

I have read many of the comments on this page, and although I am glad to see so many 5 stars, I must say I am quite disappointed in some of the book's reviewers. Simply put, no, not everyone could relate to Holden, and it is not a necessity that one should even like him, but this cannot be ignored: Salinger has created a timeless work of art that very few artists ever achieve in their lives. Salinger has accomplished a very rare feat - he has, unwillingly, become the spokesperson for a generation. When one looks back, how many artists, whether writers, musicians, or painters have accomplished this feat? These \\"special\\" artists come along perhaps once every decade or so. In the 90's, this \\"special\\" artist has probably been Kurt Cobain - and no one else. That is how rare these accomplishments come about, and so whether you like it or not, Salinger's The Catcher must be treated ! in this regard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite what I thought.","review":"With all the good reviews, I thought this would be an excellent book to enjoy.I should have read the more mature reviews. Teens will probably enjoy thisbook as Holden, the main Character is very immature. People closer to his agewould probably be able to relate to him much more.So unfortunately I did not enjoy the book much.. I think the main problem is relating toHolden. I didn't find much within his character to relate to. Nothing he said ordid had any merit. He did not do anything in the book... just wandering aroundquite aimlessly. Causing heartbreak, annoyance and stress to people who love him and/orwant to help him.Overall though I thought it to be a disappointment... I'm glad I only paid $7 dollars for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Groundbreaking","review":"A Catcher in the Rye, written by J.D. salinger, is my one of my all time favorite books. I first read it in 8th grade, and i read it all in one day. i really couldnt put it down. some people say it drags on, but i think it builds up more and more.With each page Salinger take you more and more into the world of Holden Caulfield. and In almost every way you can relate to this young man, or feel a sense or empathy because we have all been in similar situations to him. In no other time as anyone in literature fully described what its like to be filled with teenage angst. so check out this book if youve ever been a teenager."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I have ever read","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is my favorite book. I'm fourteen years old, and I first read this book about 2 months ago. I really connected with Holden Caulfield more than any other character I've read about in a story. At the time I read this novel, I had basically dropped out of school; I hadn't gone in over a month (I have since returned), and I was feeling really depressed, just like Holden was in many parts of the book. Reading this book made me feel better because it made me realize that there are many other kids just like me; There are lots kids who don't like school and don't have the best relationship with their parents. Many kids don't agree with all of society's rules and values. I realized that other teenagers also felt that the people around them were phonies. It was very interesting to read about Holden's adventures in Manhattan as well. Holden Caulfield is an amazing character. This truly is an excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"a life of our own","review":"Catcher in the Rye is the type of book that few people will understand. You will either love it or hate it, and it all depends on your state of mind. If you can identify with a character who feels out of place from society, who doesn't really have plans for the future, and who sometimes finds himself to be his own best friend, you will love this book. If you can't set your mind to think this way, you will either hate it, or respect the author's point of view, but not connect with it. Holden is more than a prep school drop-out, Holden is a generation. A generation that looks at society and says, \\"Why can't it be different? Why do I have to follow these rules, or standards?\\" Holden is ultimately a character who strives to gain a life much more simple than his own, a life that is much more of his liking, a life that many of us wish to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was a 3 hour headache two thumbs down","review":"This book was filled with non stop nothing. The most exciting part of the book was the end. I burned it the night I read it. They should have called this book catcher in the fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is VERY overrated","review":"I picked up this book expecting an insight into the adolescent mind (actually it wasn't that long ago since I WAS an adolescent and I wanted to see if the book jibed). It was an insight, all right, insight into the head of the biggest whiner I've ever read (or met, for that matter). All the dopey protagonist did was wander around calling everyone phonies. I just wanted to smack him about the head and tell him to SHUT UP and pull himself up by his bootstraps (actually jockstrap would have been a better course of action). What would be an insightful book is one written about the weirdo/stalkers who have had copies of this overrated tome with them (John Lennon's killer had one so did the guy who killed the actress from tv's \\"My Sister Sam\\", etc.) I find it very hard to believe that people wanted this book banned. If anything, it should carry a warning label saying, \\"WARNING: Extremely insipid book\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Im not the type to read for pleasure","review":"I bought the book just for something to do after my car accident. Me being 16 and all I didnt have much life after I lost the car. I love the way I could fly though it. All the \\"old slang\\" I understood pretty well without grabbing for Mr. Dictionary. . Holden was in a situation that I know I could relate to. (Well not the prostitute part but..same feeling running through my blood though.) I agree that the world is full of phonies and it just surprized me that J.D. wasnt trying to shove some typical hog slog story down my neck. (Like all the other \\"Great Writers\\") Just read the book. If you want to know what kids have to put up with (from parents, society, school cheeses, and the pain of loosing someone that just made your day when you'd do nothing but childish things) then read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a [...]!!!","review":"I was curious to see what all the hoopla was about, but was sadly disappointed after reading this novel. Salinger excelled in certain areas of the novel, bringing to life a post-war adolescent, catching the themes, settings, etc. of the day. Not bad writing, just not a classic, a la Hemingway, Steinbeck, etc. I will admit, I couldn't put it down: I was waiting to discover where all the \\"classic\\" was, but never found it, much like Holden never finds what he's looking for (at least as far as I could tell in one read)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Immortal Teenage Novel","review":"This is a great tale of the alienation of youth and it examines that which we hold dear in society. Holden Caulfield is the protagonist, a sixteen year-old expelled from school for apathy, but he is intelligent, and picks up on many inconsistencies and hypocracies in society. This is two days from his life, and it is edgy and entertaining after all these years. Brilliant writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say?","review":"Pretty good. Interesting idea of writing a whole book based on a few days. Holden's character is quite interesting. He seems like a pretty lonely guy. It seems a bit contradictory for him to call everyone a phoney when he lies all the time. He is also quite judgemental. But he percieves the world quite interestingly. I can really relate to him. The things he talks about i can instantly understand (except for the bit about him practising on a hooker)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for teenagers","review":"I Have read this book and I think that it is a great book for teenagers. It is well written, it describes Holden Caulfield's life in great detail, and it is extremely funny. It is written to show the slang that Holden uses in his writing, but does not make you think that the author too is using slang. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Mastepiece!","review":"This is one of the finest books I have ever read. Salinger writes well on Holden's thoughts and feelings. We know exactly what he feels about people, aka phonies, and society. I would recommend this book to anyone despite its controversies. In fact read every single banned books for they are banned because they raise clever yet, rebellious questions. This book enforces that we shouldn't be controlled by phonies in this cynical world."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did'nt like the end of this book.","review":"The book was a good one in the whole, but the ending was not fulfilling. The ending leaves many questions unanswered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly \\"great\\", this is a boring, cynical diatribe","review":"Judging from most of the other reviews listed here, the legions of hopelessly disaffected and jaded among us found this to be a most engrossing novel. I fear that those few who have managed to mature out of their self-righteous and idealistic teenage years will find this to be a monotonous, uneventful narrative that is wanting in meaning or purpose. While the book may serve as a reasonably good study of the cynical adolescent mind, that is its limit. With each page I expected some gleam of insight--or at least a plot twist--to emerge out of the confused, miserable rant, but instead I was dragged reluctantly through to the end of the novel without being offered even a shred of intellectual interest. If you're seeking great American literature, stick to Hemingway or Fitzgerald."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"I have heard about this 'brilliant\\" work of literture for many years. But until now have never read it. After reading it, I never missed anything. This is nothing but a priviledge wuss trying to be something that he never will be--a mature useful part of society. He constantly whines, projects his uselessness on others and has little to no ability to see that the phoniness his so hates in others is nothing but his own personality reflecting back to him. if he had to actually be responably for one second of his life and didn't live of the wealth of his parents, maybe just maybe he might amount to something. I wish I had the time i spent on reading this dreck back."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete let down!","review":"I had to read this book last year for my AP English class.After hearing all the hype about how it was a great American classic I was excited to read it. Ufoetunately, I was waiting for the plotline that never came. This book goes absolutely no where. It drags on and onwhile Holden complains about virtually everything and then th story just ends. Nothing extremely interesting or, as far as I'm concerned important, happened in this book at all. Just the abnoxiously cynical thoughts of a brooding teenager who's P.O.ed at the world for no good reason. Just another teenager and that's all. This book was a complete let down in my opinon and I wish I hadn't wasted my time with it. I really don't understand why people think it's amazing, it's terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh","review":"I find this book iritating to the core. The main character wastes away his young life complaining about how crapy society is and how phonie everything is asnd does this for ever an ever and ever. I honestly do not know why this is a \\"Classic.\\" It has none of wonderfu; messages you find in other classic books, such as For whom the bell tolls and to kill a mocking bird. It was a torment to read, only heightened when I found out that the author is just like his character...a reclusive, winey, utterly self absorbed man who refuses to actaully try to change the world, instead just hiding away from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"john lennon died because of this f..ker reading this book chapman","review":"NEVER EVER READ THIS BOOK !!!!

Although I understand that this book was monumental in the era in which it was first published, it doesn't really relate to the world today. For one thing the main character (Holden Caulfield) is very different from the teenagers we have today. In instances we find that he swears incessantly and has and incredibly pessimistic view of the world. This is something that most teenagers experiance but Holden carries it to another level. His consistant tounge slashings and bad talk of those around him make him a character to hate, yet strangely many identify with him and find him quite interesting. In my opinion the few days wespend with him over the 2-hundred something pages are incredibly hard to go through and I had to force myself to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catcher in the Rye","review":"I think someone forced to read this book [for school] is not going to enjoy it as well as if you read it on your own. I haven't been asked to read the book for school, but I read it in my own time and enjoyed it. Reading it for a class, I think, would have ruined it for me. Holden is easy to relate with. He's a thinker. You share his thoughts throughout the book and I found myself agreeing with the majority of them. Though it was a fantastic book, I don't think it deserved as much acclaim as it did. I don't think it was a work of genius or a hard book to write. In my opinion, it read almost like a journal, almost. A journal where you are revealed every detail and every thought. If you were to reach into your mind and dig out your inner thoughts, I'd almost garantee you that they would match up easily with Holden's."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Read!!","review":"After reading this book, I wouldn't go so far as to say that there is a Holden Caulfield in all of us. I will say that no matter how contentiously worded they are, Holden's complaints about society are warranted. The basis of his cynicism -which is, in short, the cruelties and shortcomings of human nature- is no less a substantial basis today than it was decades ago, when the book was written. Holden's psychological state magnetizes the analytical reader, and is a queerly nagging force that makes it almost uncomfortable to admit when som off-the-wall comment he spouts makes sense. There are no answers to life's questions in this book, but I recommend it to all who know better than to expect answers from a depressed and lonely teenaged boy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic my *&^","review":"This book was so horrible, I had to force myself to finish it. Holden was such a brat and had such a foul mouth. If I had a dollar for every GD that he uttered, I would be a millionaire. There was no rhyme or reason to this book.

Maybe in it's time it was revolutionary, exciting and shocking for the main character in a book to point out that most people in society are fake and to question everything but today it's been done so much it's tedious and depression. Who wants to hear an adolescent whine on and on page after page about how other people suck?He doesn't try to see the beauty or goodness in anything and in the fifties this may have been an interesting and new perspective but in today's very cynical world it's just dull. And I don't believe half the people giving this book great reviews really like it.If you want to read about adolescant angst try a book with a character who actually has some self awareness. All Caufeild does is whine.Read The Bell Jar or Prozac Nation or The Luckiest Girl in the World if you want a fascinating picture of adolesant angst instead of just a tedious whine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Classic for Me","review":"I bought this book because I had heard it was a classic, and my children were required to read it in high school.This is a well-written book about a self-centered boy who considered most other people (especially adults) to be idiots. His sister was the only person he respected. He was a loser, having been ejected from several private schools. It could be assumed that he represented the disenchanted generation of the sixties and seventies, but I did not find them this negative.

The insight into an adolescent boy's thought and emotion is interesting. Parts of it are pretty humorous. Unfortunately almost every paragraph of the first 5 chapters is rife with unnecessary cursing and swearing. (Yes, I know some kids do talk that way, but the story would have been just as potent without the bad language.) I stuck it out through the ninth chapter, and gave up.

As a \\"coming of age\\" story it fails miserably. The lack of plot could be overlooked if like Fitzgeralds 'This Side of Paradise' the main character were simply a deeply flawed narcicist wondering about aimlessly, were it not for the lackluster writing of the author.In reading 'Catcher in the Rye' I found myself yearning for the end; waiting, hoping for a \\"point\\". The ending came, the point of the story never did. It read like the juvenile ramblings of a lost teenager and not an intelligent one at that.I view the time I spent reading this book as well as the money I spent on it as a complete waste.

I absolutely love it. It's so TRUE. That's the only word I can think of that sums up the book. It's TRUE. The book is about Holden, who was just expelled from school, and how he wanders around New York City for three days before finally deciding to go home. Holden is angry at how the world is, and at how people are. I felt that Holden was seeing the world through the eyes of someone going through the transition from childhood to adulthood, and is angry at the insincerity of the world. He doesn't want to be a part of it, but at the same time, he lies a lot and sometimes tries to be something he's not. He's a teenager. At any rate, just read it for yourself. People will try to tell you what to think of this book. They analyze it to pieces.

This book, though it gave an interesting interpretation of the world through a \\"brats\\" eyes, was not beautifully written or delievered by the main character. Many my think that i was turned off by the books raw language, believe me, that was one of the ups of the book. I also thought the the story and the other characters could have been more developed and more 3 demsional, as a result of this it would help the reader feel a much more personal relationship with the main character. Also who the heck wants to read a story about a kid who complains about everything, just send me back to highschool.

I suppose the confusion is purposeful, but that's all I feel when I read this book...and this is considered one of the greatest books written by an American?!? All I can say to that is thank God there are other countries and other types of authors out there, or I would never have been able to pursue Literature in school.

Holden seeks to find his way out of confusing darkness following his expulsion from school. Captures the growing pains out of childhood and the doubts and fears of moving forward into adulthood in a most stunning way.

I recommend this book to anyone who wants to live and suffer Holden's life. I recommend it to the person who being open minded is ready to enter a world full of conflict. This book really deserves all the praise, it is a must read for any person, not just teenagers. As I said before, in one way or another you can easily feel in his shoes.

I think that seeing Holden experiment all this situations that he causes to himself, make us think about our life. It is very easy to relate to a lot of stuff that he suffers true life, more over if you are an adolescent. Just be careful a bit, because he is constantly repeating himself, and a lot of the true things that happen to him are just cause by his own contradictions, and his negatives to everything, because he is the one that doesn't accepts other points of view. One more thing to say, is that New York is the perfect scenario for this story, because being such a big city, Holden can obtain whatever he wants, so this makes it even more interesting.

Holden Caufield whines for 200-odd pages. This is somehow supposed to be relevant or edgy, but really it is just boring. The reader is given no reason to like or care about Caufield or his story. Why people gush over this book is beyond me. All Salinger has done is to paint a stereotype of a weak, callous, angry young man.

Old","review":"the catcher in the rye is a amazing book it tells about a boy who kindof hates his life. instead of picking out the good things in his life he lokks at all the bad things that have happened to him. i like it because its a good book it tells you like it is and it's writen differently then most books i've read and thats what i like about it it unquie and different it's a wonderfully written book even if it's from the 1960s."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a complainer!","review":"I began this book expecting it to be supremely deep and completely understandable. What I found was that Holden was a pain in the rear teenage boy whose mission in life was to complain about everything except his stupid red hat. I was sorely disappointed.As I got deeper into the book, the more I wanted to just beat some sense into the boy for being such a complainer. He thinks that the world should bow down to him and it just doesn't work that way.I also don't understand why this book was banned. Holden has feelings that every teenager has and complains about everything. How is that different or bothering in any way? We have to go through it everyday, why not be allowed to read about it? Read it if you want, but please tell me if you find the point that makes this book so important."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would make a better short story","review":"Okay, we'll do the good stuff first. \\"Catcher\\" has an easy to read style that is quite unique. The reader really gets into Holden's head. And Holden is a truly believable person. However, he is not at all a typical teenager. He's a teenager on the brink of an emotional breakdown. And Salinger really convinces you of that.What's annoying about this book is the complete lack of a plot. Modern readers expect a book to have a beginning, a middle and an end. I understand that not every great book has to have a well-defined plot, but this one doesn't even have a loosely defined plot. Holden leaves school and wanders around New York for a few days, slowly getting crazier and crazier. The style of the book is wonderful, but it would have made a much better short story."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting observation","review":"I loved this book, but since over a thousand people have listed why this book is so good, I won't go into it. This book has obviously influenced a lot of the current writers out there (I almost felt like I was reading Nick Hornby or Brett Easton Ellis), but the thing that gave me the biggest kick was when I finally made the connection between the characters named 'Holden' and 'Banky' in Kevin Smith's movie Chasing Amy. Obviously taken from this book. (Remember Ed Banky, with the car?) I love little bits of trivia like that. Read this book, and re-read it if you hated it, because it is truly hilarious. I read it at thirteen, at seventeen, and now at twenty five, and it is still awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but will make you depressed","review":"I decided to try this book because many famous celebrities such as Johnny depp and Winona Ryder happened to mention it was one of their favourites. I have now come to understand why it happens to be so. JD salinger is an eye opener, for anyone who wants to see reality. Everything in the book is basically truth. Reality really does bite. The language and contents are all things that we experience in everyday life. However, warning to those who are going to buy it: I had to stop half way through the book because I was so depressed and I couldn't go on. Of course I did end up finishing the book, but it really can make you feel down. There's heaps of 'phonies' in the book and it makes you feel like dirt. Don't read it if you're on the verge of suicide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for an AP English class","review":"I chose this book as one of my contemporary literature books for my AP English class. Of the 6 books we pick we have to write \\"logs\\" on them every thirty pages or so. A portion of this log requires an insight in the section and let me tell you, even though this book was awarded as Book of the Century, it is extremely hard to find anything insightful in it.The basic premise is this:\\"I hate everything. I'm depressed. I want to kill myself by jumping out of a window or being strapped to an atomic bomb. I'm just too much of a wuss to go through with it.\\"I'm sure if I had more time to read it over I could find more things in it, but if you're trying to stick to a schedule for a class, this is not the book to choose. There is very little material to work with if you have to write a good deal about the book and I honestly think Salinger was just making up this story as he went along."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD STUFF MUM","review":"Vaccum cleaners tell you a lot about life.I like corn chips with salsa.Audio Image.Darts are not good for clothing labels.CD's are grandpa.I like it a lot even blue underline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated? But of course. Classic? Not exactly","review":"After sifting through the mountains of good reviews this book has recieved (and the intriguing title) I decided to check it out. Bad move. (Most of) The characters, particularly Holden Caulfield, are flat, boring and Holden is not, as some reviews gush, \\"identifiable with myself\\" at all. Rather, he's made out to be a lost, confused (read-annoying) teenager with no direction of where he's going, leaving a large, empty hole in the plot. Phoebe, Holden's sister, is an (rather, the only) exception.Maybe I just don't get the book. Whatever. Just let me say that this was a serious letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is what wastebaskets are for...","review":"Catcher in the Rye is possibly the weakest novel I have ever suffered through. It is a constant whine session in which only the background changes. It is even a poor example of angst literature. If you want a real classic in the field try Jack Kerouac's Maggie Cassidy. Otherwise, avoid purchasing this book. If you already wasted the money, you may join me in throwing it into the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dry depressing novel!","review":"This book was full of profanity and pointless dialogue. It didn't live up to any of my expectations or my fellow student's expectations. Catcher In the Rye should not be a classic novel. I strongly suggest looking for a different book that doesn't constantly refer to Prostitution and loneliness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea but would work better in a shorter form","review":"I loved the narrator's \\"talking style\\" as someone else here referred to it. I was amazed that a book written in that common language style of the 40s would fit in very well with the language many teens use today. Almost undated at all. Only in his outward respect to elders which today's cynical kids don't display.My problem with the novel is the humor and freshness wears thin after about 80-90 pages. I think this novel could have been half the length and would have been much more effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I read this in one day, and I'm not a speed reader. It's a great novel. Salinger submitted it to the NEW YORKER hoping they would run the whole novel in their magazine. The NEW YORKER rejected it! What morons. That Holden. He's a mad man. Swear to God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not another boring classic","review":"This is the first book assigned to me for school that I actually liked. After being forced to read dreadfully boring books like Jane Eyre, The Once and Future King, the Odyessy, and then some, I went in to this book with the mind set that it was going to just be another boring classic. It wasn't though. It was great. I laughed out loud at some of the things Holden said; I'm sure if it was supposed to be funny though. He was just so random. It was great. It was so cute how he was always putting on his red hunting hat and asking everyone where the all ducks went when the lake froze. Aside from the comic aspects of the book, Holden was clearly a depressed invidual. Even though he flunked out of Pency, the school he was going to, it was obvious that he was really smart; otherwise he wouldn't have noticed all the little things that bother him so much causing him to be depressed. I recommend this book to everyone. It's easy to read and very interesting. I loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I actually threw this book at the wall when I finally finished it","review":"I don't understand why this is such a classic, and why so many people love it. There is basically no real plot to the story, it's just a bunch of boring rambling. If Holden Caulfield were a real person, I would want to slap him in the face. He is an ungrateful hypocrite, and he says \\"phony\\" way too much. Even though it's a short book and an easy read, it still took me forever to finish it because it just dragged on and on with no point. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"A more appropriate title would have been \\"Spoiled teen in severe need of an attitude adjustment has 3 days and a hundred-odd bucks do burn, and does so by stumbling around New York City like a drunken homeless man.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Never have understood the appeal of this book","review":"The language is dated, the protagonist annoying. I was assigned this in high school decades ago and reread it recently. Its appeal is still lost on me, but I suspect its fans are readers who came of age in the 50s, a naive and long ago time now, and that young readers today, or even those of us who are not Boomer age, find it outdated and pointless, kind of like its author's disappearing act, tho I liked Salinger's other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Lost","review":"Several times I have tried to read this book and just couldn't focus. I know, I am supposed to read it and like it. But it sure missed it's mark with me.I recall nothing of my youth that even resembled this. Nor anyone I knew resembled this.To me, this book is pretty much some 60 year old lady's view of what she'd have thougth a teenage boy's life was like.Anyway, what a waste of my time forcing this down much like having to eat brussel sprouts as a kid (as a matter of fact that's closer to most kid's youth than this book)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated as Hell","review":"I can't believe so many people like this novel. It reads like Salinger sat down and wrote it in one night, making it up as he went along. It's repetitive and pointless. The language is so trite and corny, Holden comes off as unrealistically dorky. There's really nothing approaching a plot; he just wanders around ranting about nothing. I guess maybe a lot of people like it because they relate to Holden, but I don't. It has nothing to do with cynisism; it has to do with being a whiny, obnoxious ADHD head case. I give it two stars for being fairly original and innovative (for better or worse) in its day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I really recommend this book, this book is like no other. It basically about a troubled teenager who is in search for his role in life. I think a lot of people would like it because you are really able to relate to the character because many of us have gone trough some of the situations Holden goes through in the book. I will bet that even if you do not like it, you will find it quite different from other books. So if you are interested in reading a good and different book, read the Catcher and the Rye, I liked it a lot, so have many others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite what I thought","review":"With all the good reviews, I thought this would be an excellent book to enjoy.I should have read the more mature reviews. Teens will probably enjoy thisbook as Holden, the main Character is very immature. People closer to his agewould probably be able to relate to him much more.So unfortunately I did not enjoy the book much.. I think the main problem is relating toHolden. I didn't find much within his character to relate to. Nothing he said ordid had any merit. He did not accomplish anything in the book... just wandering aroundquite aimlessly. Causing heartbreak, annoyance and stress to people who love him and/orwant to help him. Overall though I thought this book to be a disappointment"},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU DONT NEED TO RELATE TO A STORY TO ENJOY IT","review":"I was surprised to see the last review. The reader did not like the writing because she was not young enough to appreciate it. If someone needs to relate to this story in order to appreciate it, they are missing the best thing about this book.This book lets you look at the world through the eyes of a lunatic. To see his warped views and the reactions of people around him from HIS standpoint. The goal of the read does not seem to earn sympathy for the guy or understand teenagers; its purpose seems to be pure entertainment.... or maybe some understanding when you meet a crazy person.If you have a good sense of humor, you can pick up this book and start reading from any paragraph and start laughing in seconds. Unless of course if simple-minded cynicism offends you... in which case you would fail to meet the former requirement anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did any of the reviewers even READ this book?","review":"I have just read several reviews posted regarding \\"The Catcher in the Rye.\\" I am amazed that none have even the slightest comprehension of the plight of the main character, Holden Caufield, or the timeless truth and lessons in this book. In 2001, can we, as a culture, only appreciate the \\"challenge\\" of coming of age if it's on a screen, has full female frontal, and moves along as quickly as its Number 1 soundtrack? Is it possible that so many Americans, supposedly appreciative of literature, are so uncultured and inept? (or never discussed this book's meaning in a high school English class?) I will always go back to this story of Holden, in rememberance of the sadness and fondness of youth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"No wonder this book is a classic. The author reveals bits of Holden's life and personality in a fashion that is a bit like a strip-tease. I couldn't put the book down and I found Holden to be a compelling, wonderful, lively character. Worth the time and effort!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Surprised Me","review":"This book surprised me by being a very entertaining read. I expected a boring book with a man droning on about his intellectual and boring life that no one would ever care about.

I found this book quite relatable and it was also very easy to get lost in the story.

It's his naiveté and innocence that will draw you in. Unlike a lot of characters you fall in love with, you'll feel for Holden and wish you could write yourself into the novel to help him. Sadly, you won't be able to. He's well written and might help you look at the 'phonies' in the world a little differently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holden Caulfield made me want to puke","review":"I consider myself fortunate to get through high school without reading about the cynical and misanthropic Holden. No doubt, many of today's angst filled teenagers will relate, as he reminds me of a few immature fellows that I knew. The only reason to read novel this is to obtain a perspective on teenage pessimism. Unfortunately, not much about the main character is really ever revealed, except for why he seems so detached. Salinger has timelessly captured behavior of the modern disenfranchised youth. Listen to an angry teenager for about a week, and you'll get the idea. In the end, Holden Caulfield made me want to puke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Controvertial (lots of bad language)","review":"Be warned, this slim book is controvertial because it contains foul language. I am not particularly sensitive to such language, having grown up around some wonderful, earthy characters, however even I found this excessive -- puerile even. Perhaps shocking for the sake of being shocking? I was turned off and just stopped reading it after a while (which is unusual for me). I did not see enough of the expected \\"artistic merit\\" to spur me on further. By all means give this book a try -- you now know what to expect, perhaps you'll have better luck. Either way, write you own review -- maybe I will be inspired to try again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it at all !","review":"After I have read this book, I may say that it was a waste of time. I hate reading books and surely when it is about a young, stupid person who thinks he's THE MAN It's full of flashbacks, repeatments.The only good thing about this book is that it's realistic in a way.When I read a book like this I'm not focused at all. I understand it when people like this book, but I don't, because I dislike Holden that much that when he would be in our class we have disputes all the time.He's depressed all the time.I hate such people as much as this book.

What's the point? It was a nice coming of age story, but nothing special. The main character was someone whom I would like to avoid had he been a real, live presence in the world.

Stolen, for the love of god, I beg you to read both books and make up your mind who is the better writer, a poor immigrant or a rich brat? I remember having catcher in the rye shoved down my throat in highschool. I couldn't believe the crap that guy flung at us. And the audacity. Fact- \\"Ask the dust\\" was published in 1939, catcher in the rye in the fifties. I'm just asking you to read both books and make up your mind. For I already know the truth.

Review","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is a book that I am still pondering after reading it. The main character is the narrorator and his name is Holden Caulfield. I would say that this story is very much a character study in that the whole book we're figuring out what Holden wants, what's going through his mind, and the reasons for the stories of all the people he encounters. He has very much growing up to do and I'm coming to the conclusion that he doesnt want to think that there is bad in anyone. That there is this continued innocence that he doesn't want to let go of. I enjoyed the style that the book was written in. It gave a sort of originality, being that it was Holdens exact thoughts and written in such a colloquial way that you felt he was just speaking to you. I would definately reccomend this book to anyone. I think that teenagers would enjoy it most though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book while the time is still right","review":"I read this book when I was 15 and it changed my life.

Salinger's masterpiece follows the misadventures of 16 year old Holden Caulfield. The book follows Holden on a three day journey through New York. He shares his cynical and often negitive views on life,family and \\"so-called\\" friends. He finds faults in almost everyone he talks about.If they aren't Phony they are boring. At one point, you realize that he's just as phony as everyone else.There are points where you feel for Holden and other times you hate him.

There are no hidden meanings in this book, nor are there any sort of points or end destination.

Both these books in my opinion are not for the typical mainstream human being.They show how life should be lead and not how someone tells you to lead it. Both, especially Catcher in the Rye, go against the grain and tell of real life situations.They talk about things like depression and drug abuse which a lot of the teens deal with today.Even though Catcher is sometimes read in school it is not the typical high school english book.it goes against all principals and morals and deals with reality, which many americans choose not to deal with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for all 16 year olds","review":"It really helps me cope with being a teenager. Holden isn't much different than me. I'm currently 16 and now read Machiavelli, Unabomber's Manifesto, etc, etc. This is one of the books that started it all. I hear if you read it after your teens, it loses all meaning. I think I'll read it again and again now while I still have the chance and savor it for the years to come, looking back upon it with awe - instead of reading it again when I'm 25 and thinking it sucks . . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"The presant through the eyes of the future","review":"Holden is a character which I personaly found that I could really relate to. He is one who tries to preserve the beauty and innocenses of the youth. He reveales to the reader all of the purities in which children have, yet unconciously lose through there becoming of greater age. Befor I read this book I never was clear exactly on what was that made children so inocent and how it all changed.

I do realize, however, that I can relate to the 16-year-old Holden Caulfield. Being only a year younger than H.C. we have many similarities. The most imortant one that continues to remind myself of Holden's emotional problems, is that I also lost a sister to cancer. Although, the one major difference between us, is that I was treated for my depression soon before Holden's was. Of course technology of such situations have improved, therefore, allowing myself to not make many of the mistakes H.C. made. Including those relating to school, friendships, family,etc. Many do not understand the emotional effect a death can have on a person, which can very often turn to depression and nervous collapses. Until one can, shall I ask, WILL you really understand The Catcher in the Rye?"},{"rating":"2","title":"why it might be banned...","review":"JD. Salinger has written the personality and language of an animal few humans try to know, the seventeen year old human male. This was reality in its greatest show, a masterpiece by all means. I hated it. I was supposed to hate it because I'm a female, middle aged woman with high propriety. Sure, the language in the book bothered me; it was supposed to. But I saw that its intent was to explain a boy with a tough facade. Later in the book, on page 157, the facade melts when the boy recalls the happy days of childhood and going to the Museum of Natural History with Phoebe. The \\"damns\\" almost disappear. As far as censorship, it would be a terrible shame if this book were to be censored. No other book that I know has ever captured the tone, vernacular, and character of the most vulnerable person of our modern society, the 17 year old boy. I would highly recommend this book to parents, educators, and young wives. It is wonderful, but awful"},{"rating":"1","title":"All That for What?","review":"Ugh, I am purely disappointed! My friends would always reference this book and I heard it was once banned and finally, I just gave in and oh my... I should never have bought it. I hated it, hated it, hated it.

There is absolutely no point. It is so monotonous and tedious I'm about to pull my hair out. Luckily, I only have about 40 more pages to go. If I wasn't so OCD about finishing books, I would've chucked this one a looooong time ago. I seriously don't get what all the hype is about with this book. Just because it was controversial (ie. language, loose sexual references) in 1945?!?! I pity any child that had to read this in school, thank goodness I didn't or I would've flunked. We read real literature like \\"Where the Red Fern Grows,\\" \\"Of Mice and Men, \\" \\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\\" etc. I'm appreciating my English teacher's judgement . Booooooo to this book!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A whine-fest of self-destruction","review":"Salinger does an excellent job of capturing the thoughts of an angsty, foul-mouthed, rebellious teenager who lets his wildly shifting, hormone-driven emotions control his life. However realistic Holden Caulfield might be, he is a thoroughly unpleasant spoiled brat who I was very tired of by the time the book petered out.Sure, some people (especially teens) might be able to identify with some of the confusion, awkwardness, fear of the future, longing for the past, and hatred of \\"phonies\\" expressed by Holden, but he is so lacking in any positive traits (other than a fondness for his siblings) that I had absolutely no sympathy for him. His way of speaking reminds me of Alex from \\"A Clockwork Orange,\\" but unlike \\"Catcher\\" that book has some interesting moral/ethical dilemmas. I think this book is just a pointless whine-fest of self-destruction no matter how well-written it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crumby Book","review":"This lousy book written by some hot shot J.D. Salinger is possibly the worst book ever written. It's one of those books people write to make them selves feel smart and whatever. You know they guy wrote it just so he could say \\"oh it's a deep reflection on the teenage alienation\\" what a joke. My school made me read this lousy book, man are they a pain in the ass. I didn't even read the entire goddamned 26 chapters. People who think this book is a classic and profound or whatever are just a bunch of phonies. It kills me to think that someone actually thinks this book means anything, it doesn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"I'm a 17 year old girl and I thought this book was great. It's written in a way that keeps you interested. I found it to be funny and a bit sarcastic. At first the book doesn't really seem to have a story line but soon you realize that there is more to the character and story than you might have first thought. some people might not see the messages behind the book but even still, its an interesting book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Put","review":"We all hate having teachers force us to read books in school. This time I am glad they did. Cather In The Rye has to be the single most expressive book I have ever read. The book is put into words that a teen can understand perfectly. Although there are some underlying webs of connections in the book, most everything is simply put into teenage thoughts and language. It deals with every problem and every situation. The book is simply a marvel to be read and enjoyed. You'll either hate it, or love it. As for it trying to be banned, like you don't hear that language anyway. It is a way of expression and without it, the teenage angst character would not have been expressed properly. Read it, you may love it or dispise it, but read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the...?","review":"What's the big fuss over this book? I was looking for \\"classics\\" and I kept hearing people rant and rave over this book, so I figured I should read it and maybe be enlightened or something. No such luck. As a matter of fact, I couldn't wait to get to the point of the book, which never seemed to come. It was so incredibly boring that I didn't even finish the book. I was bound and determined to do so, but I was losing my mind, reading this book. I had about enough of hearing Holden repeat himself on each and every topic, and hearing about \\"phonies\\". I could definitely have been better off reading something else. So, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A classic?","review":"I read this book because it is considered a classic. That was the only reason I finished it.

I really can't understand how this came to be a \\"classic.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A Classic What?","review":"I'm not sure what I expected with The Catcher in the Rye, but it was a lot more than what I received.Going into the book, I knew little to nothing about the book except that it was a classic and Holden was supposed to be an icon. Maybe it is the fact that I'm 20 years past being a teenager, maybe it is that I got lost in the lingo of the 50s and maybe I just believed the hype too much, but I was severely disappointed. I did not like Holden in any way shape or form. I thought he was a whiner and the biggest phony of the bunch. I had no trouble with the drinking, or smoking or cussing, I just did not like him and can not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An American classic?","review":"I suspect that I am going to be real unpopular with my review but here goes. I ordered this book just because it is on the list of American Classic Literature. I am 55 and had never read it. The book I received was copywrite 1951 and in great condition. I was anxious to read it and started immediately. I got through about a third of it and then put it down. I had a hard time picking it up again and acutually skipped a few pages toward the end just to get through it. I thought it was extremely boring. I suppose that at the time that it was written perhaps it was a very revealing book aout the life of a young man but I just couldn't get excited about it at all.Sorry to all of you that I have insulted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, slow and whiny","review":"I tried to trudge through this novel in the 1980s when I was twenty. People had told me it was a book any young person could relate to, so I gave it a shot. At the time, I found nothing remotely relatable or interesting about it.I picked it up again in my 40s and again found nothing engaging or redeeming in the plot, characters or writing. It's like slow torture, watching this self-pitying, self-destructive, self-involved jerk spiral out of control. Are we supposed to pity him? Are we supposed to see ourselves in him? It's hard to care what happens to Holden, other than maybe feeling a deep-seated hope that he'll shut up already.It's clear what the appeal must have been 60 years ago: The narrator's then-naturalistic language broke taboos and the book spoke frankly about things traditionally unmentionable in fiction about teenagers. A sullen teen antihero was a radical change. But on its merits as literature away from that context, it's pretty awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"The Catcher in the Rye was a hard to put down book. I loved the conversational style of writing, \\"and all\\" (a phrase often used by Salinger). I had to close my mind to some of the language. Although the choice of words may have been fitting to capture the essence of the main unstable character represented in the book, \\"and all\\".Glad I read the book and would recommend it to others.I was delighted with the speed in which I received the book, as well as the condition of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Story of the 20th Century","review":"The Catcher In The Rye is not just a story about your frustrated teenager who doesn't like anything, as his little sister Phoebe points out in the book. It's a story about the person that reflects the emotions given to us by the world. Here's a 17 year old who just got kicked out of high school straight into the streets of New York City. He doesn't seem mad about being kicked out of school, not at all. He enjoys his time as only Holden Caulfield knows how: Calls up old friends, goes to bars, pays for a prostitute (only to not have sex with her), dances with girls in clubs where the best Jazz players play, and eventually manages to get drunk out of his mind. Inside Holden, is a person who is fed up with the world though, the way things are, the way things aren't. Holden is no role model; he's a sex crazed, lying, cigarette smoker, but he's himself. He never pretends to be anything he isn't and stays true to that ever so famous title, The Catcher In The Rye."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Terrible...","review":"Surprisingly, I never was forced to read this drivel in school. Being a voracious reader though, I checked out a copy during my junior year of HS. I was expecting a classic; what I got was crap. How is this supposed to be a literary masterpiece?! I couldn't make it more than 50 pages into the book because I became so enraged at the lazy, whiny, rich-brat protaganist that my hands were shaking. No joke, I literally wished Holden was a real kid just so I could beat him to a pulp with a 2x4.Don't get me wrong here, I was a sixteen year old at the time, I hated the world, and I'm sure I was a pain in my parents' butts. But at least I had the insight to realize that, like many teenagers, most of my problems were caused by me and not 'the phonies' or the man. I simply cannot understand how anyone can sympathize with a character so self-centered and unlikeable. A terrible book then, and upon introspection, a terrible book now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catcher in the Rye","review":"I read this book because I heard that it was a classic. After reading it I can tell you that I thought it was a complete waste of time. I feel sorry for anyone who can \\"relate\\" to Holden Caulfield.

I am sure that many previous reviewers would find it convenient to attribute this to my age (17) and the fact that this book was required reading. However, I have to wonder something. Is it possible that people are reading WAY too much into this story? I find it more than likely. It's been my experience that if you put something in front of someone and say that it's a classic and has a very deep, significant meaning, they will find one no matter what. In short, I think the novel is dull and poorly written. Those of you who found some grand significance, I applaud you but feel perhaps rather than of finding a revelation in the book, you've found one in yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"not really sure","review":"i purchased this book from a yard sale and havent quite finished it yet , i'm only on page 90 or so and really dont understand what its about maybe i'm crazy or something , but i'll keep going and will come back later for a better review for you and possibly a better opinion of it, however i am glad that i only paid 50 cents for the book as it does not hold my attention for longer than about 1 or 2 chapters at a time thank you"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"I first read THE CATCHER IN THE RYE twenty years ago and I return to itevery few years because I always find it so rewarding. What makes it asuperb novel is the voice of the narrator, Holden Caulfield. He isunreliable -- we know he must have a tenderness deeper than what he tellsus. It's difficult to create an unreliable narrator, because the reader isasked both to like and dislike the main character. But when it is done wellit is wonderfully engaging.In the years since I first read it I've looked often for a good narratorthat was as likably unlikable. I finally found one in a new novel --- LOVESONGS OF THE TONE-DEAF, by Asher Brauner -- which I recommend to anyone wholiked CATCHER IN THE RYE. Both novels are about alienation -- the ways inwhich young people feel no one understands them -- and the ways in whichthat assumption is probably true.Read both these books -- you'll love them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holden Caulfield is the best character of all time...","review":"I can't believe how much this book makes you think.

After the first 20 pages of this book, I was absolutely blown away by the simpleness, yet mental complexity of this novel. I went back to school the very next day and thanked my English teacher over and over again for making me read this. He told me he knew I would like it and that I would find many similarities between Holden and myself, as every teenager will.

If the goal of the book is to teach us that we create our own problems in life, it is successful. It approaches this topic in a very vulgar, drawn out way.

First of all, all this guy does is complain. I mean sure, there is at least one thing that people hate about everyone they know. But Holden, the main character in the book, he seems to hate everyone for the wrong reasons. I mean sure, I can relate with him because I know what depression is like and I know what it's like to run away. But he hates so many people for common behavior and all he does is complain about it. Not only that, but he's also extremely shallow. He doesn't like ugly people, especially girls. He just doesn't like people for being people. And that's all there is about this book.. just some college kid who's depressed, runs away, and complains about every stupid flaw!! I just do not understand why this book is so loved, so popular. Won't ever make sense to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love it or Hate it","review":"Essentially this is a character novel, if you like the character you love the book, if you hate the character you hate the book. It's as simple as that, there are no other characters besides holden, no plot besides his narrations which are a series of complaints. I hated holden and his obnoxious bitching over everything that happens to him. The book is basically a review of the things he finds most annoying in life and his complaints on them. It gets really tiring after only one chapter, not to mention the annoyance of his comments after making an observation, such as: \\"honestly, i'm not lying, I swear i'm not this really happened\\" this phrase or something like it are once a page. The novel is a love it or hate it novel depending on whether you love or hate holden and i found him one of the most obnoxious characters in literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Catcher in the Rye","review":"i enjoyed reading the book. it was the best one that my class read the entire year. the only reason that it got a 4 instead of a 5 was because i really didn't like the ending to it. i thought that it would end differently than it did. other than that it was one of the best books that i have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Catcher And The Rye","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. The aother really hit on some teenage issues that even happen today. There was not a boring part of the book. We have read many novles in our class and this one has to be my faviort. The only thing that I didn't like was the ending because it ended so quick. I wish that the author would let somone make a movie out of the book because it would be such a good movie.

So I tricked you. One star for one terrific book. I assure you, Holden offers more insight to the average teenage lost soul than most anything out there. Granted it doesn't speak to everyone in the same way, but I assure you if you found 1 minute of your teenage years awkward, Catcher will strike a chord with you.

By the end of the book, you can't decide if you are more irritated with the character (Holden Caulfield) or yourself for wasting your time on this twaddle.

The whole family were still coming to terms with this as his mother \\"hadn't been the same since\\" his father was emotionally distant, brother geographically the same.

I could identify with so many of the feelings that Holden had--a lot of these reviews pass him off as being \\"just a jerk who likes to swear a lot\\", but I think that Holden is actually representative of all of our inner selves. We all have that cynical, hateful person somewhere inside of us. Someone who'd just love to get kicked out of school and run rampant on the streets for afew days. He does what we sub-conciously want to do, he says what we sub-conciously want to say. I think the reason a lot of people don't like this book is that it lays out all of these feelings that Holden has, and people become threatened, so to speak, when they realize that they can identify with those feelings. But it's an excellent book, really very well written. If you would like to dispute my review, or talk about this book,you can e-mail me..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book, but BAD quality","review":"As many people previously said, this book is a book that every living person should read it. I've have read already like 3-4 times on my mother language (Macedonian), but I always wanted to read it on its original language so I order it from here.What blocked my impressions was that the print is really bad, the font is bold and not sharp, some parts are ligher some havier, the paper is yellow (for christ sake - what Holden would said), it is very bad paper. the Cover is very thin and light, I espected some better quality and design here.There isn't any Author's Biography or something, some info etc, that's strange.I had bigger expectations, I am dissapointed by the quality of this edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catcher in the rye review","review":"I think that this book was very good. It showed how authors have the freedom of writing. And the fact that J.D. wrote about a kid with problems, it showed how people should see the world.

It captures almost all of the emotions that teens go through. It tells stories that most authors wouldn't usually write about. It gives you first hand experiences that the narrator goes through and tells you exactly how he is feeling. It is an easy read and very enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"An inconsequential novel","review":"Re-read \\"Catcher\\" after Salinger kicked the bucket awhile back. Disappointing to say the least. I think this novel only survived on hype--hyped by other people who are caught up in the \\"hype\\" of thinking the book is \\"profound\\" etc, sort of the way we all look at horrible artwork but are told by the \\"critics\\" that it's a masterpiece, and, not wanting to appear unsophisticated, we rush to agree, when in fact the piece is merely crap. I think the novel gained prominence in its day simply because the language, at that time, was shocking, and publishers were showing their \\"daring\\" by putting it out. It's a dumb book, quite frankly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please...a high school reader???","review":"I thought I was purchasing a regular hardback copy of the \\"Cather in the Rye\\" and the product received was less than anticipated.I received a book 7\\" X 4\\" that was a high school copy for a literature class at F.D.

I had not read it before, but it's a classic. And hey, I wanted to see what could be so bad in it to ban it.Hoo boy! Did I ever figure out. This book was obviously banned for being the single most boring book ever written. Or perhaps the incidence of boredom induced coma was so high, they felt the need to ban it. I don't know.

Absolutely not."},{"rating":"1","title":"How this became a \\"classic\\" is puzzling to me","review":"I had not read this book since I was a teen and my Son mentioned he recently read it & loved the book. I picked up a copy and figured since he generally makes good recommendations to me, it would be worth reading again. WRONG!I suppose if you like reading about someone who has some \\"issues\\" or difficulty fitting in with peers, this book could appeal to you. That being said, the story just rambles, doesn't seem to have an actual story line, just randomness. I was neither inspired nor entertained by it. The story left me wondering who determines what is an \\"American Classic\\". Half way through the book, I was hoping the story would suddenly grab me. Regretfully, that never happened. I would recommend not wasting your time (or money) on this book. When I finished the book, the only positive feeling I had was now I could begin reading another book. I truly wondered why a publisher would have agreed to publish this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow teen angst","review":"I hated Catcher in the Rye, maybe it's because I'm a teenager, and undestand what Holden is going through, but it was just whiny.

Although this book covers only a very short period of Holden's life (between 3 and 4 days), in that short time, the reader gets to know Holden very well- and like him! He may be a liar and a college flunkee, but this, along with the author's way of writing, make Holden seem to be come to life. Holden's sarcasm and frankness can be funny at times and is key to making the reader part of this story. His outlook will enlighten you and inspire you. If you haven't read this book yet, go read it.

It really is just a watered down, tame Dawson's Creek episode. Salinger doesn't know how to write dialogue or project teenager's emotions, but some of the visuals and situations would play out well in a film. I could see this starring Freddie Prinze Jr. This screwy book should be stripped from the shelves and turned into a WB show, maybe it could replace Dawson. Two thumbs down, Salinger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Profane","review":"This book is very profane.

It simply portrays a boy, not quite a man, who because he hates himself and has no redeeming qualities gets himself kicked out of various schools and then ends up in an insane assylum. he is pathetic. He has no drive or redeeming actions. He is an all talk yellow person. To use his own terms. Holden Caufeild nauseates me.

I honestly think that this book was not based on the thoughts of a regular teen. Now I am not an average 12 year old.. I take education a little to seriously, but not all teens get kicked out of school( there ALL not THAT \\"dumb\\" ), smoke(at that age and year ), etc. I don't think this is a very good reprsentation of a \\"normal teen\\". Holden Caulfield was a very peculiar character. The whole story itself was weird. The book just ended with him deciding to stay home.

The ultimate complaint of lazy readers is that a book \\"does nothing.\\" The Catcher in the Rye really does do nothing.And it uses \\"lousy\\" too much.Which is a lousy thing to do. No matter how lousy a lousy person feels, it's just plain lousy to spend all your lousy time saying lousy. It's even more lousy coming from a lousy book that is so often mentioned (by lousy critics no doubt living in lousy ivory towers) as a literary classic.Maybe the fact that Salinger became a recluse helped the book's short-term public and critical resume. Then again, if I'd written this lousy piece of trash, I'd go into hiding too.This book is lousy--don't waste your time on it.

If there were negative stars I'd go as low as I could go. I thank the teachers I had in school for not making me read this trash. I guess it's like art. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

Perhaps the author should have had Holden commit suicide somewhere in the early chapters... then he could have spared us the agony of reading about his pathetic life.I can't stand it now because the language is coarse and crude, beyond where it needs to be.I guess the author thought it was either important or fun to have us rattle around inside of Holden Caulfield's head...Really though. it could have all be summarized by that 4 line diddy on Hee Haw...\\"Gloom, despair and agony on me-e!Deep dark depression, excessive misery-y!If it weren't for bad luck I'd have no luck at all!Gloom, despair and agony on me-e-e!\\"There, now you don't even need the Cliff's Notes version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good- but not good enough to change your life","review":"I have read some of the reviews written here before, and I have to admit that I think this is a good book. I do want to point out that no matter how vulgar, \\"phony\\", or realistic you found this book to be, you should not be living by the words of Salinger. People read books for enjoyment, and this is definitely one that can be read for that purpose. Just do not think that this is some kind of a self help book... it's fiction.

A friend and I actually avoid talking about it because we disagree so much about it.I enjoyed the book for the first chapter or so before repetition of the line \\"[x] depressed me\\" began to annoy me to no end. I simply could not like Holden, and this is not a book where you can dislike the main character but still enjoy the story.Having read it for an assignment and then having to write an essay, I do appreciate the meaning behind the book. I appreciate and understand how we hate the characteristics in others that most reflect upon ourselves and how desperately one holds on to childhood.

Aside from it being written in a style that a teenager speaks, quite annoying frankly, this book was a bore. If there was symbolism, I didn't catch it.

Needless to say, I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whats all the fuss about?","review":"I was always curious about this book. I have heard of it for as long as I can remember. I have seen many referencs made to it. And I know there was a relationship with this book tied to Mark David Chapman, the assasin of John Lennon.What I don't understand is what the big deal is about it. It is well written and very discriptive but ultimately seems pointless. It follows a few days in the life of a student expelled from his school and doesn't really go anywhere or make any point.

It made me laugh and feel sorry for this troubled, truthful character who will never leave my memory. The banning of this and any other books is absurd. The author should be able to express his feelings in any way that he feels it no matter if he wants to use bad language or sex or whatever. It's his right. I am writing a book now and am taking no crap from anybody on how to write it because it's my own creation. And it shouldn't be banned from schools because kids should be able to read any book that they want even if they don't really understand. I was eleven or twelve when I first read it and found it funny and sad then. I still do. But someone please help me--what does it all really mean? Is there some hidden meaning behind everything?

His desire to be 'a catcher in the rye', is more than just wanting to stop children from falling over the cliff, It actually shows how much he desires to conserve his youth of which he is so afraid to let go.

This way I don't have the bias of teachers and/or professors etc.Perhaps it is my upbringing but Catcher in the Rye, for me, was in a word, boring. Holden Caulfield, to me, was not a \\"psychologically challenged\\" youth but a whiny teenager who needed a good kick in the pants. It was well written but I found myself continually asking \\"what's the point?\\" and when I reached the end my reaction was \\"That's it??

I do! Reading rocks!Reading this garbage however, is painful. The main character is spoiled, whiney and obnoxious. The author fails to make the reader care about the main character, Holden. Follow that with the fact that nothing happens in the book and you realize that this is 200 plus pages of crap. Seriously, the manuel to my camera is more interesting. It's overrated bunk that appeals to other spoiled, angsty teenages, and those that find said characteristics appealing.The best thing about this book is that for some odd reason, it's still ever-so-popular and one can still sell it used at a bookstore or here on amazon, and some more schmuck will actually buy it.I hated this book when I was an agnsty teen and I hate it 10 years later.

I will give it one thing...it interested me, and kept me reading, but it never really got anywhere. If Holden didn't smoke a pack a day, washed his mouth out with soap, and quit hiring prostitutes, maybe he wouldn't be so depressed! I am mainly bitter about The Catcher in the Rye because i always hear how good it is, blah blah blah, so i read it, and its basically about a 16 year old kid who needs to go to a correction facility.

There was a sort of candid and realistic feel to this book. The way that the author used language was very contemporary and conversational and the easy prose still read cool and socially acceptable even today. The 50's was a time of teen angst and revolution when American teens moved to the suburbs and began to live life through their cars. Car culture also encourage rebellion against their parents, the rebel without a cause, James Dean and others led the pack of teens carving out a new American identity.

Yes, Holden Caulfield has some universal connection because of the angst. Yes, he addresses phoniness in the world.But those things alone don't make a classic. One reviewer at this site mentioned the fact that there really is no plot, and she is right. If most of us knew Holden Caulfield and were subject to his ranting we would certainly dismiss him and not consider him a classic. I normally finish every book i read, but i got exaclty into the middle of he book and put it awaay for good.If Catcher in the Rye is a classic, then we've lost the ability to distinguish something that is truly classic, like say To Kill A Mockingbird\\", from a mediocre novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Catcher in the Rye","review":"This book was just plain stupid.

I don't have much to say about the book with all these reviews going on here. However, I will comment about the edition. First of all, it isn't a \\"first edition, first printing,\\" obviously, BUT, it has the format of the edition back then when it was first published in the 50's.

This book was fun and very, very entertaining. When reading the book, I compared the book to my own life style, in that Holden Caulfield, the main character in the book, is a teenager in High School. I can actually think and feel what Holden was thinking and feeling. That was one of the big reasons that I really enjoyed this book because it felt like I was in it. When reading, I found that Holden was feeling alot of pain and agony throughout the novel with a ton of problems. I recongnized many hurdles that Holden and I have faced as young teenagers.

It has no plot and becomes tedious to read after the first 70 some pages. I think I know why so many people rate the book highly; it does a good job of showing the thoughts of an adolescent on the verge of becoming an adult. But the lack of plot and meaning just ruined it for me. I would compare this book to an abstract painting. I liked it at first because I thought it was original, much like the way abstract painting was original at one point. But after reading the whole thing, it was like I had spent a day going through an abstract art museum."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as great as I thought it would be","review":"I did not like this book.

At an age when I found it difficult to engross myself in fiction (I simply did not read a lot as a child), I traversed through this book with interest.Unless you have issues with the course language, you should anticipate an amusing account of events as Holden is thrown out of prep school. The tale is told as Holden recites the two day episode after having been kicked out. The events are conveyed as though Holden is speaking candidly to the reader; which is a style I found enjoyable.The Catcher in the Rye flows nicely and presents an effortless journey into the mind of Holden Caulfield. As one of the more popular fictional works of the 20th century, this impression alone should be sufficient to entice any reader. While I personally would not bestow the book with quite that level of praise, I do feel it offers a worthwhile undertaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"the teenage experience personified","review":"Teenagers need parents to push up against. (Adult-mediated) conflict helps teenagers define themselves and come into their own. This classic novel embraces the unique teenage experience of alienation, rebellion and the driving desire for acceptance. Holden is the teen prototype, cynical and sympathetic, wise and self-conscious, hopeful, genuine and desperate. Salinger's prose is elegant, spare and sounds fresh, even today. The timelessness and self-conscious portrayal of this bildungsroman still resonates with students and grown-ups alike. An American literary treasure and a must read for lovers of human narrative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I have ever read.","review":"I kept waiting for it to get better. I kept waiting for there to be some reason this book has been banned. But it didn't get better. And I see no reason this is a banned book. The story was not compeling and neither are the characters. How anyone can think this is the best book ever written is beyond me. Please don't waste your time reading this. If you must read it, check it out from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistant but good","review":"The Catcher in The Rye was a very well outlined book but the auther was very inconsistant with the dialogue for different characters. For example: Holden would say \\"goddamn\\" a lot in the first part of the book but then he started saying \\"chrissake\\" and \\"hell\\". Holden wouldn't say them consistantly like anyother person would have. The book didn't fall into reality enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was horrible","review":"This was a horrible book, with no plot or any good characters. I have no idea why people continue to read it. It uses repetative and pointless language. A filthy and horrible peice of literature, if you can call it literature. The only thing that makes this a classic is that it was once banned, and maybe it still should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do we celebrate the personally weak in society?","review":"As a Gen X'er I've noticed many people my age who've grown up in the \\"self-help\\" era to become self absorbed, excuse-making adults. I found Holden Caufield to be weak of character and he reminded me of the afore mentioned people. I struggle with understanding why this particular book has been so greatly celebrated. Is it the same logic that has spawned America's fascination with society's weakest? (Dr. Phil, Jerry Springer, ect...) Are we coddling our children into becoming Holden Caufield's?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A SAD DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"This book is known as a classic for it's simplicity. It is not symbolic, beautifully worded, are even an elegant story. It is not the crude language that turned me off, I liked that because it set tone for the book. It was the fact that I do not believe this story has any artistic value, other than it's over 100 pages. What can I say, different strokes for different folks. The only reason I would suggest this book is for experience sake. Any well read individual should know this book. That doesn't mean that you have to appreciate it.I also think that this book is not as universal and does not apply to ever adolescent or teenager, I think the only person this book applies to is the author himself. It is a selfishly written , unintentional classic.This book should have a Surgeon Generals Warning or something like that reading... WARNING: This book should not be read while operating heavy machinery, for it strains all intelligent thought from your brain."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasent surprise - My new fave book!","review":"An excellent portrayal of a young male (Holden), Mr. Salinger makes this book come alive as you read it. It only took me a couple hours, and I was able to finish this book-I couldn't put it down! All through the story I found myself laughing out loud. Originally, I had to read this for class, and I figured it would be confusing and boring. However, I was delighted by the easy reading, and am now Mr. Salinger's biggest fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only a MORON would hate this book!","review":"J.D. Salinger's classic novel about the adventures of a cynical, depressed teenager is nothing short of brilliant. The dialogue, though written a while ago, speaks as human as today. The message gets across because we can all feel for the character, Holden. We were all at that stage of uncertainty and madness and it [stunk]! \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" is the most honest and thought-provoking I have had the pleasure of reading. It remains one of my all-time favorite novels. It's a must for any fan of fiction, anxious teenage boy, or anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S ONE MY FAVORITE BOOKS!","review":"It's a great book. Holden was this depressed guy with cynical thoughts on his head. It touched me. I couldn't put it down. It's easy to understand and you won't get bored of it. The only problem I see with this book is it's too short. I would've read it if it was the longest book ever written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Don't let the fact that the murderer of Lennon read this book many times stop you from reading it.I read it and absolutely loved it.Holden becomes your personal friend who tells you everything he thinks.I feel sorry for any body who hasn't read it.!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Catcher in the Rye was an unadventurous book.","review":"I believe that the novel could have been written better than what it was. The plot was boring and there was no point. Holden left school for the fourth time, but instead of going home he rents a motel. In the end, he winds up accomplishing nothing and goes home anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a good book","review":"This is one of the best books I have read. It had all the suspense, fear, and intellectualness as many other books, but this one was in a language that I use everyday. Therefore making it easier to read, but yet enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I enjoyed the book very much. It had great detail and showed how a teenagers mind thinks. It made you always wonder what was going to happen to Holden. It was easy to read and follow along. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adolescence ... just can't make sense","review":"Was I an Holden Caulfield when I was 16 or 17 years old?You bet I was, but not literally.We have all been there, being sick & bored about everything.It's hard to realize that you are not a child anymore, but you can stay one in your heart.This book should be read by every young men & women around the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Incredible CATHER IN THE RYE!!!","review":"The Catcher in the Rye is a book written by J.D Sailnger and though it has had some controversial issues about the violence, vulgarity and sexual references,I would still recommend it. But if you're under the age of 16 I wouldn't suggest reading it because of these issues. This book is about a 16 year old, Holden Caufiled and his 4 day adventures. His adventures begin when he got expelled from school because he failed all his clases except one. He then decided to leave school early and go to New York. Holden struggles to be accepted in the adult world, but thinks that its \\"phony\\". Holden Caufield represents the average teenager who has to deal with a variety of problems. I recommed this book because its straightforward, easy to understand and it is a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A near life exPErience","review":"Not everyone will relate to or understand this book (as is evident in some of the reviews...) It wasn't written to be a goddam english class reader, & it's not meant to make you friggin suicidal either. It's just honest and that's what makes it powerful. It might be 50 years old but you'll recognize people you know in it. It's damn funny too. Maybe you need to have gone through some of your own mindfu#s to fully appreciate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small Book with a Big Story","review":"This Book by J.D Salinger is one of his finest (if not shortest).It tells the tale of adolesance in its most cynical and sarcastic form... in the form of a soon to be expelled prep school boy to be exact.You watch the young character work through his emotional problems and spiritual problems in his own unique cynical matter. The story is well developed and is witty to the ending... with a slightly disturbing surprise ending that leaves you thinking for days after you've read the book.This is one of the most well developed and complicated characters to ever be presented in literature, and his story is one worth reading about.This book is recommended to anyone as a good read and good example of fine literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cynical and wonderful","review":"This, along with Catch-22 and The Blind Assassin are amoung my favorite novels right now. Salinger does a great job at creating an amusing unreliable narrator (Holden Caulfield). At the beginning, Holden is failing out of his fourth school and has yet to tell his parents. Holden doesn't want responsiblity; he just wants to be young and running around fields (Catcher in the Rye). As I myself am 16, I found this novel especially relevent and can understand what he feels. Holden is overly cynical, to the point of hilarity, of everything. He espcially hates phonies, but pretty much has something to say about everyone. There are very few people that he respects. So while you are reading this, remember that while Holden is a very intriuging character and is very amusing to read (its like reading gossip at some points), he has faults, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated, underdevolped , and trite","review":"After I read this book, I felt incredibly let down. I had repeatedly been told that this novel was the greatest ever. I found Holden to be an immature, spoiled little brat. I also found him very difficult to relate to. It didn't surprise me, however, that so many stalkers and murderers loved this book. I gave it two stars because it wasn't the worst book I have ever read. It was interesting at some points (sort of like watching a car accident)."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is the best book I have read during high school.","review":"This book was really interesting. I thought it would be boring at first, but as I continued reading it I started to enjoy it. Holden Caulfield was a very complex character. I felt that he contradicted himself a lot in the book. Sometimes he would say he didn't like a person or a thing and the next minute he would change his mind. It was a funny book too. I never laugh aloud while reading, but this book was funny in some parts. The things Holden said would make me giggle. In a way the book was depressing. It was about a confused teenager. I thought that Holden lied a lot throughout the book. He would come up with outrageous stories. Overall, I would suggest reading it sometime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most interesting, boring book ever written","review":"The Catcher In the Rye held my attention throughout the entire book, yet when I reached the end, I found myself thinking: why was this book written? This book is about how someone perceives teenagers to be clueless and finding fault in everything in his world. I do not believe that all teenager are in fact this way. The writing style of Salinger is fresh, with good wit and power, but the story line is not in-depth enough to have any substance. Holden offers few real insights into a teenage world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book you've ever read? Read some more...","review":"I think it's really funny that most of this book is devoted to examining \\"phonies\\". Holden is a \\"phony\\". This is quite useful information if you prefer to search for meaning in the book; it allows Salinger to say two things at once: e.g.-he points out the phoniness around us, while at the same time decrying the hypocracy of American culture (pointing out phoniness when we ourselves are phony). Pretty interesting, but it doesn't stack up against the more interesting, meaningful, and longer studies of culture that followed, i.e. Catch-22, The Recognitions, Gravity's Rainbow, and Infinite Jest."},{"rating":"2","title":"corrected review","review":"I mistakenly wrote a negative review earlier today. That review was for another vendor. I received this CD timely, well packaged and in perfect condition. Disregard my last review.The above was obviously concerning the business I bought the CD from. Concerning the book itself (in my case CD-it is not on Kindle), if you have not read it-read it. The writing style is unique. Although the character has a rather strange outlook on life, many of his thoughts we have all shared whether we want to admist or not. Perhaps most interesting is that although he has a very cynical outlook on life-the book makes you think how much people are judging us negatively when we speak to them. It reads rasily-full of foul language-although again whether we like to admit it or not that's how most teen age boys (for that matter men and women too) talk and think. This is must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An American Classic, but not for teens","review":"Let's start with the fact that this book is an American Classic. It deals with the coming of age of Holden Caulfied, a completely incoragable young man who is not always likeable. That's the thing that sucks you in. This kid swears, smokes, lies, gets kicked out of school, etc. etc. Not exactly the kind of book I want my teenager reading, but in the end, the story all comes together.***Possible Spoilers***Holden is quite intuitive and really sees the underbelly of human nature and the false bravado with which adults live their lives. He, of course, is full of false bravado himself (the scene with the hooker shows that). He calls them like he sees them, even at the expense of others.Is Holden a hero to teens or a rebel without a cause? The answer lies in your own interpretation of this story. Give it a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not enjoy","review":"Read this because a friend told me it was her favorite book. I did not enjoy Holden Caulfield's character at all. He was whiny, obnoxious, and extremely hypocritical (I guess that's the point?), and I just could not look past it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Powerful and Enjoyable Book I have ever read!!","review":"To be honest, I have not read that many books in my life. This book, \\"Catcher in the Rye\\", was given to me as a school assignment. At first, I thought it would be a boring book, just like all the other ones that they give in school. I ended up loving this book. I love Holden Caulfield. Holden speaks the truth about life and about adolesence. He says things that a lot of us feel but don't really admit. Many of the things that Holden speaks of really makes sense. You start to feel that you're not the only one who thinks the same things. I would tell anybody and everybody to read this book. I can totally understand why this book is a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"I'm a book critic, and this was the worst book I've ever read,and I'm a book junkie. What's with the double negatives? The plot lacked an awful lot. The whole book was a waste of my time and money. I wish someone had warned me about it before I purchased it.

Now it's one of my favorite books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible book, about a horrible person","review":"I simply do not understand how anyone can say this book is anything more than a worthless story about a worthless human being. The central character is a spoiled brat, who can not be happy with anything his privelaged position has given him, and instead seeks to spread his misery to all the people that he comes into contact with. Whether it be a hooker, or a school chum, or his own family.If it wasn't for the main characters constant whining, there would be no plot at all. This has to be, without a doubt the worse book I have ever read. The authors only real accomplishment is that he seems to be able to write complete sentences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"I'm not the kind of person who reads a lot of books and this book is a reason why. First the story is not interesting and also the way it's told is very stupid. It takes you hourst to read it and then find out you just read about some stupid 'adventure' of a young lad which i don't even believe, even if it's fiction. Just reading about a young depressed kid, makes me depressed, not just because i wasted my time reading it, but because it's just not a good story. The last thing i want to say is that the repetition in this book is terrible. Every 5 sentences the same word: Chrissake, goddam, sunnavabitch... Just read the first 5 pages and then you read the whole book."},{"rating":"2","title":"American classic","review":"This is just one of those great books that everyone should have read by now.

It has officially been placed on the top of my list for the books that were a waste of my time to read. I have never been so horribly disillusioned in a book before in my life. It's just a displaced, whineing, pathetic story of a teen with not an once of ambition or positive outlook on life in general. I only gave it a rating of one because there was not an option for zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"A HUGE disappointment","review":"Two hundred+ pages of rambling and whining with little to catch the reader's interest- a huge disappointment.

Based in New York City, where phoney, flitty people are almost everywhere, I can see myself in the same situations as Holden.

But, I recently reread this book some 25 years after high school and I'm sorry but the language is a little bit out of date. Wouldn't it be great if Salinger came out of retirement and rewrote this book to today's language standards? It is still the best novel around about the alienation of America's youth (and boy are they ever alienated now more than ever) so it is still a worthwhile read if you can get past the archaic language.

So i decided to give it a shot and see what the hell was so special about it.Well, the answer is nothing... This book just rambles on in its \\"1940's rebel style. To be frank it had virtually no redeeming qualities other than the jargon he used (swell, terrific, sexy, flitty, and grippy).

Considering this is all I have read written by him I guess i can't argue. The fact is though, this book is pointless, its like a docusoap on channel 5 (thats a UK thing!) shown at two in the morning, which noone watches anyway.

Maybe it's because I can't relate to a spoiled preppie kid. Maybe it's because I read it when I was too old to appreciate it's message. Whichever the case, Holden Caulfield is nothing more than a snot nosed crybaby. I fail to see why Salinger is such an acclaimed writer, either.

Yes, it's cynical and full of youthful angst but with no point, no moral, no closure. I don't wish to add to the time I wasted reading it to comment any further. The only reason I rated this with 1 star, is that there was no option for no starsIf you've got the time, spend it reading other required high school books, i.e. \\"1984\\", \\"Animal Farm\\", \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" or \\"Tom Sawyer\\"- time much better spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I missing something?","review":"This was one of the worst books I have ever read!

If this book is an example of what I will be getting into, I'll stop now. The Holden charactor rambled on and on about things, jumping from one subject to another and mainly focusing on his self absorbed thoughts of life and people. I felt nothing but distaste for him because he was such a whiner that wanted to blame everyone else for his laziness. At the end of the book all I wanted to do was say \\"WAAAAAAAA!\\".

Everyone is supposed to love this book. How can you be an intellectual and not love Salinger? Well I may not be an intellectual, but I certainly did not like this book. Holden Caulfield does nothing but whine about how life is not fair and moan about where the ducks have gone. I know the ducks are a metaphor, but I just did not care. Holden Caulfield is immature, even for his young age, and I found him so miserable that I couldn't enjoy the book. He does nothing but complain and stew in shallow teenage angst. This book seems to be loved by millions of people so others must enjoy something in it that I didn't. I just wanted to provide my opinion because many people just gush over this book, and it only annoyed me. I'm sure it's a classic for a reason.

Try reading \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower,\\" for instance. I can't help but wonder if \\"Catcher\\" was part of Salinger's journal at some point.

May he dance with angels."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece","review":"There is a big, big problem when one finishes reading \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\". Every other book you read after Salinger's will not have the same effect on you. Holden Caulfield is as true as your father or as true as your brother. A teenager growing up in a world of adults. A teenager who wants to be free in a world of adults, of rules. Salinger was trying to understand what was going on the earth on those days. Rock and roll, beats, drugs, No war make love, the power to a new generation. Bau he gave no definitive answers, he just showed the difficult road one has to follow if he or she wants to be free, to be free in society. It's a book, a poem of the difficut passage of a youngster who is growing up in a world of adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a good book and I enjoyed it a lot.","review":"I think that the catcher in the Rye is a good book.

I don't have any recollection of being touched by it at all. I read it again in college, and either I thought it was all about disaffection and rejecting middle class values or I was told that by my teachers.I glanced at it again over my daughter's shoulder on a long plane ride a few years ago and couldn't wait for her to finish so I could read it again. I was shocked to see that I had completely missed the point: it's about Holden's vertiginous fall into depression after the death of his little brother. His parents and his sister are all too damaged by their own grief to help him, and he's struggling to feel something while avoiding feeling anything. These are familiar demons, beautifully evoked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Years later, I still remember it.","review":"Holden Caulfield's character is unforgettable.

All it talks about is a boy, who tries to be unique and be himself. He calls everone he meets phonies, but what he does not get is that he is very phony by saying he does not care about what people say when the truth is that he really does care.For me reading this book was a hard to read (and I read a lot, Believe me!) because Salinger did not make the reading very easy.If all of Salinger's books are like the Catcher in the Rye, then I will never read Salinger again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely ridiculous","review":"I've always wondered what about this book makes it a classic so I borrowed it from a friend and got ready to be entertained. But I was sorely and thoroughly dissappointed. I can't believe this guy actually suckered a publishing house into actually printing this piece of garbage. Unles they did it as an example of just how NOT to write a book. There is no plot, no real character development and the language is instantly droll. If I hadn't borrowed this book I would have been angry at having been swindled out of good money. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The man who wrote this should be in an asylum.","review":"This book was a complete waste of paper. It had some interesting points but, it had no plot. It also turned out to be a major dissappointment because it ended so poorly. It should have been some elaborate lie that he had thought up while telling his sister. His parents should have played a bigger role in the book. The one part I did like was him talking to his brother."},{"rating":"1","title":"The What in the Where?","review":"Without meaning to be critical, cynical, nor harshly judgmental, \\"The Catcher In The Rye\\" compels me to ask: Why do schools and libraries encourage teens and young adults to read this senseless dribble about (what I perceived to be) a critical, cynical, and harshly judgmental antagonist? Frankly, and unfortunately, I was not too pleased with the book's plot (or lack thereof). Simply put: It did not make any sense, and I, as a reader, did not feel remorse nor sympathy for the principle character. His repetitiveness was viewed as immature, as well as his cussing and judgmentalism were irresponsible. Not exactly good examples I would set for any upcoming generation of young readers. I was unable to figure out the author's reason(s) for writing such a \\"critically acclaimed\\" classic, and I could not care to. My opinion of this book is that it's not worth the read. I would not recommend it to anyone, not even to a dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoroughly overrated.","review":"Teenage angst at its peak, told in a way that did not make me sympathize with the main character. The writing was just as confused as the character's mind, which was probably the intent, but did not enhance my understanding of the point of the book. Which, by the way, I never did -- unless the point was only to get a murky feel for what goes on in a teenager's mind. I do not understand the cult following this book has achieved."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like CATCHER, read BLU'S HANGING","review":"THE CATCHER IN THE RYE is the best American novel of the century.

Surely a book with this high of a rating must be very good!I was very disappointed! In short:Pros:Salinger's good writing style makes for easy reading.Cons:Poor story line. There's not much to this book. No interesting plot. As others have said, the hole story is Holden gets kicked out of school, goes to NY & gets drunk and goes home.No insight or learning. There's nothing to be learned from this book. This is not a coming of age story or anything interesting.At the end of the book I thought I wasted my time reading this book when I could be reading something more worth while."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Was Bored","review":"I finished the book, but it was tough. I didn't like the stream-of-consciousness style and I also didn't like the protagonist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreme","review":"The book describes an extreme case of confusion when a person leaves childhood. It expresses the emotions like Munch's painting, The Scream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falling short of the hype","review":"I'll admit that I read \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" because of its reputation. I have always heard that it is one of the greatest books of all time, a coming of age story that defines a generation. Upon completing the book I was left wondering what it all really was about. Maybe it was over my head and I could not appreciate its story, but from the moment I was introduced to Holden I never like him. I found his tales boring and his encounters dull. Each one was more irrelevant then the last. I just don't see how this book is on the same level as other great novels such as \\"To Kill a Mocking Bird.\\" The only redeeming quality of the book is that it moved along fast and was a quick read (shocking for such a drab book)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Habitually taking the Lord's name in vain!","review":"After hearing about how wonderful this book was, I was very disappointed when it was my turn to turn the pages. The writer, throughout the entire novel, habitually takes the Lord's name in vain. Why!? What's the point? What was he trying to prove?! I was \\"required\\" to read for class, but would rather risk a poor quiz grade then be exposed to such derogatory and offensive language. Even if the language was improved, the story is boring. I kept waiting for something exciting to happen, but each page turned proved just as dull; a complete disappointment and waste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All the hype","review":"I don't like this book, but it isn't a terrible book, and I've read a lot of terrible books. In fact it's a good book, but that's it. It's good, it's ordinary. I've re-read Catcher three times now, I get it and what it try's to convey and all I have to say is, meh. For me there was nothing new, nothing exciting, and it certainly wasn't life changing.Is it really worth all the hype?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Classic?","review":"I like to read classics that I have never read before. This one looked interesting and heard lots about it over the years for it. Not sure why it is a classic. I agree with other reviewers that maybe this had more meaning when it was first published. The constant swearing and repetitive dialogue was beyond irritating. A quarter of the way through the book I disliked the Holden so much I was hoping for a suicide, but unfortunately, he continued on and on and on. Not all books are considered timeless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Hated It","review":"This book was depressing, rambling and extrememly vague. What a waste of money! It's as if the author wrote the entire thing as stream of consciousness. The plot has holes all through it. The story jumps all over the place and is really quite boring. I have no idea why it is such a classic and revered by so many. I am absolutely gobsmacked if this book is recommended for high school reading. It is completely unsuitable. Don't even bother reading this book. I love reading classic novels but this one was very dissapointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"In a world of phonies...","review":"Holden Caulfield, a brash sixteen-year-old at Pencey Prep, decides to set out on his own a few days earlier than expected due to failing out of school, which wouldn't be the first time. After several confrontations, Holden bids a farewell to Pencey, also known as a \\"phony factory\\", hoping to avoid his parents' wrath. After leaving, Holden plummits into the depths of depression, isolating himself and creating his own sense of loneliness. In his new state of ire despair, he finds himself in even more awkward situations, and with nobody to bail him out. In a desperate attempt to salvage what little happiness he can muster, Holden goes home to see his younger sister, who convinces him to stay. It is then that he decides to face the music and start anew."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My all time Fave books","review":"God, i loved this book! the first time i read it, i was going thru a bad time myself, really low and depressed and i could really realate to holden. My favourite thing about the book is that all the characters are so REAL, they are not the flimsy shallow images you read in todays novels, Holden Caulfield is a real human being and i wouldn't be surprised to meet him one day.I loved the descriptions of the people at Pencey. Stradlater, \\"Ackley-kid\\" and his history teacher who read out his exam essay.The style of writing is beautiful too, really keeps you hooked on till the last page...So overall, i would say this was an amazing book, and if you are thinking of reading it, go ahead....you'll enjoy it for sure"},{"rating":"1","title":"I really, really tried....","review":"I just don't get the hype... Yes, I've read the whole thing (in h/s and in my adult life) but, for something that has been touted as one of the greatest novels ever written it sure is a tough read! And it's not that it was above my head, it was just plain old poorly written in my humble opinion. The grammar was beyond horrible. I think my 10 year old son could've done a better job.I wanted to like this, even love it because we've always been told about what a \\"classic\\" and \\"must read\\" it was... but, in the end, I was just miserable.Sorry, but, I know I can't be the only one to feel this way, right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Holden would have been a perfect fit for MTV Real World...","review":"...and I can't stand that show as well. Not as a teenager, and not as an adult.I read this revered classic to check off classic readings I was never exposed to in High School. I force fed this into my brain up to Chapter Four, then the nausea of reading the whiny Holden forced me to put it down.A quick summary?\\"An emo pity party\\"Holden depicts nothing I was like as a teenager, and for that matter, nothing like my peer group when I was a teenager. I had a tough life, and yes, I was filled with the typical teen angst, but my peers and I did something about it. If you are entertained by whiny people who have little drive in life and lack the motivation to be productive member of society, this book is for you.Or just turn on MTV Real World, it's pretty much the same mindless swill but in video format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"When I picked up this book, I thought it was going to have some profound meaning. All the stigma surrounding it and the fact that it was banned made me feel like it was going to be some great book. After reading it, all I can think is it was long, boring, and I felt like it lacked any sort of plot. Definitely not the page turner or gripping until the last page that I expected :/The main character just seemed like a driveling ungrateful brat... maybe I have to be a teenage boy to get it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Music of the Spheres","review":"This is an in depth spiritual documentary and a real feast of spiritual and metaphysical concepts. It is Directed by David Sereda, film maker, author and environmentalist. Scholar Robert Thurman expounds on the mystical Kingdom of Shambala. Impeccable footage of spiritual images are here including many special effects. David articulates the stages of meditation and describes his own enlightening meditation in which he perceived the sound of our Sun. This sound was also described in the Vedas, and even verified by NASA. The viewer can hear the \\"Sound of the Sun\\" courtesy of NASA! So many topics are covered, such as astrophysics, conciousness studies, science, quantum physics, the insights of Pythagoras, and what spooked Einstein. Therefore the film (Parts I & II) runs a full three hours and i suggest viewing it in separate segments of 30 or 45 minutes each for easier absorbtion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Waste Your Money on This One","review":"This dvd has no depth. It lacks expert commentary. There are nowhere in this film an authority on the subject of spirituality, metaphysics, and science as editorial claims; there was Mr Shankar but he didn't say much and you can't hear him.

This is not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun, but terribly terribly left wing biased to a nauseating point","review":"Title says most of it, not to say that the people interviewed are so blatantly, Marxist, but the creator and narrator are embarrassingly Marxist almost Communist and he keeps pushing this crap as if its real.

I wish something like this was in print when my mother was dealing with her alcohol and drug addictions. Not to discredit Dr. Babbit's field of psychology, but I am usually skeptical of psychology theories defining my behavior. The personal accounts in Dr. Babbit's fortify her method of healing and put the reader at ease. Any reader will know they are in good hands when they read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lifeline for Parents","review":"This book will provide a lifeline to parents struggling with children who they suspect, or in fact are, abusing drugs or alcohol. It provides a lot of useful information on resources and approaches for help but most importantly speaks from the author's years of experience working with youth and families involved in drug abuse. The personal stories are very helpful. This book doesn't point the finger at parents but provides instead some very practical help. If you have found out your child is abusing drugs,read this book first before any others-it will definitely get one moving in the right direction to get further help. I would recommed this book to all parents as its principles apply to other struggles parents encounter with teens and none of us are immune to our children getting in trouble with drugs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adolescent drug and alcohol abuse","review":"I have recommended this book to parents in our school system that I know need it. The problem is the kids continue to manipulate them and lie about their drug use. This book is a life saver!

It is easily readable and so much of it applied directly to our situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad production of a very good Capra movie","review":"Don't waste the $9.99 on this DVD version--there must be a better produced version.

(Don't get the wrong idea, there's nothing particularly titillating in \\"Smilla' Sense of Snow.\\")I gave this book 2 stars because I like intelligent protagonists. Other than that, I thought it was way too long and I had a hard time keeping all the bad guys straight.

As is often the case with poor storytellers, you never get a feel for where this story is going, and that alone makes for evenings of masochism with this book.

A marvelous read with a cozy throw in front of the fireplace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing story with a heroine cynics can love.","review":"This story and its unusual heroine lingered with me long after I'd read it. Smilla is a wonder: strong and resourceful, yet quirky, vengeful and darkly cynical. You see her drawn into the case of the little boy's suspicious death, almost in spite of herself, because her instinct is to fiercely protect her solitude and independence. The exotic settings (to me -- never been to Scandinavia)of Denmark and Greenland add to the inscrutable mysteries of Smilla and her story. The plot takes an X-Files-ish twist near the end, but you're so involved with the characters by then that you can forgive this. Sample of Smilla's thinking: \\"Falling in love has been greatly overrated. Falling in love consists of 45 percent fear of not being accepted and 45 manic hope that this time the fear will be put to shame, and a modest 10 percent frail awareness of the possibility of love.

The idea is good but the writing is so heavy, long-winded, boring that it was a suffering to know it was still there, waiting for me. The last part, furthermore, is a real torment. Peter Hoeg: never again."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is going on???","review":"This book was recommended to me by a co-worker--raving about the herroine in the plot and how powerful the plot is. WHAT was she talking about? Maybe the plot was lost in the transaltion, but I found the book boring and hard to follow. I kept losing track of what was going on and who was who? After a few chapters of complete confusion, I finally put it down without finishing it. I did happily hand it over to my father--a well-read and educated man. I thought maybe he would appreciate this recommendation, but he as I could not follow the events, and said goodbye to the story before the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What it Could Have Been","review":"The author weaves a complex tale and stirs some powerful images. Chock full of historical and scientific tidbits, the books falters in character development. The actions and motives of the major players are highly implausible, and glossed over too frequently. And there is no plot resolution at all. I was listening to this book on tape and I was certain there had to be more...but there isn't. A good read, albeit flawed, and entirely unfinished. Write your own ending!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!","review":"This is one of my favorite books.

I didn't want anyone else to suffer through it. Don't get me wrong, I think Peter Hoeg did a superb job of romanticizing snow, his poetic sense of the permafrost is what hooked me. But the guy needs to learn some plotting and character motivation!

I admired Smilla's independence, but in general, the book left me cold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated It","review":"I will give this book a three because it was obviously well-written. I also found the beginning interesting - who ever knew that Greenlanders are a detested minority in Denmark? Also, in the interest of disclosure, I admit that I much prefer a novel to a mystery. However, I absolutely suffered through this book. Nearly everyone in my book club hated it also. We now refer to it as the Insufferable Smilla!"},{"rating":"1","title":"First half is great, Second half is horrible","review":"Once you get used to the time shifts in the plot, the book is engrossing. Unfortunately, just around that time the plot falls apart and goes way downhill leaving you with an ending that is disappointing. Not worth the time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, more or less","review":"This book wants to be several things at once: a thriller, a political commentary, a philosophical treatise, an evocation of the aesthetics of snow. Unfortunately for the reader it succeeds in none of these genres. The book is at least two hundred pages too long; the plot is unrealistic and, for long patches, quite boring. Hoeg has succeeded in creating a compelling character, mainly because Smilla is so perpetually cranky and cynical. One also learns about the status of Greenlanders of Denmark, which mirrors that of many other immigrant populations in countries around the world. Overall, however, I found this book immensely disappointing and more or less a waste of time. I did learn that one can appreciate subtleties in the world of ice but had little enjoyment while doing so. For a _real_ novel that successfully marries politics with a stirring story and fine, evocative writing, read Charles Powers's \\"In the Memory of the Forest.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Slush","review":"The most this book has going for it is its imaginative title and its use of an Greelander that's an expert on ice and snow. The rest is boring, bogged down, self-important and silly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional writing, ridiculous ending.","review":"This book is beautifully written and translated. The most compelling aspect of \\"Smilla's Sense of Snow\\" is clearly Smilla herself - an intelligent, fascinating, but also cynical character, who is often as emotionally cold as the snow she \\"smells\\". Hoeg has done a wonderful job of creating an intriguing and believable character. As a Swede, I also appreciated the sense of melancholy, which is so very Scandinavian, and I find, an often rather depressing element in the book. As a writer, however, I was not very impressed with the plot. (Worms and meteorites, indeed!) Also, many of the love scenes - if you can call them that! - appear to be more the exercise of bodily functions (one physically impossible!) than acts of affection. This may, of course, only be a reflection of Smilla's emotional paralysis. All in all, a beautifully written book that is strong on characterization and social issues, but weak on plotting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fresh and Original","review":"I loved this book. Hoeg's style to write is very self-conscious and well-thought: at very regular intervals he attaches a line: a wisdom with which the reader can (must!) agree. There is something for everyone: the writer refers to everyday phenomena and expresses opinions that the reader fells familiar. The book is very down-to-earth and mystical at the same time: that is an honourable achievement. For a northern reader this book gives a cosy feeling. There lives a little Smilla in every northern person! I can understand it very well, how Smilla knows snow. Peter Hoeg also says some truths about communication in northern areas: silence means something different in sparsely populated areas, such as Greenland or Finland. Silence is not something unbearable, rather, it has to be interpreted in the right way, too, just the same way as words. Also, an easy book to film! (I have not seen the film, though.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Smilla's sense of snow","review":"There was a defective tape in Smilla's sense of snow I was disappointed but I will not return it the rest were ok"},{"rating":"1","title":"200 pages too long!","review":"Maybe something was lost in translation, but this story is too convoluted and long, and I could not waste another hour reading it. Bailed out half way through it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad writing; even cheesier plot","review":"I never thought I'd think an action-packed book like this was BORING--but that's exactly what it was. Hoeg was so focused on jamming in every single twist he could think of into the plot that I lost interest in the characters! I absolutely hated the second half of the book--no reflections, no insights, no interesting character moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smilla's Sense of Story","review":"The strange conglomeration of science fiction, political activism, and suspense treats the reader to a very different kind of book. I could not put it down at times; at other times passages did seem to drag on. Hoag has a gift for character development, apparent in the portrayals of Benja and the Mechanic. I found the description of setting to be fantastic, especially in the flashbacks to Greenland. Someone like myself, who did not know much about Denmark and even less about Greenland, would learn very much from this book thanks to the numerous descriptons of the people, the weather, and their societies. My one complaint is that the transition between the two halves of the novel was not smooth; it almost felt as if two different books. Overall I found this to be a very engaging and intriguing novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"snow flurries.....","review":"Thank you Peter Hoeg for the best book I've read in ten years, deeply sensitive and meaningful characters. Transportive to the point one feels a lowering of body temperature while savouring this expressive writing, every chapter a flurry of impressions that settle in snowy layers. Absolute depth perfection...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled","review":"This novel that I wanted very much to like, and which came highly recommended by readers whom I respect. However, even though I tried and tried again, I simply could not get into Smila's Sense of Snow.At first I thought I just wasn't getting it so I redoubled my efforts. The slow pacing, the symbolism, the endless philosophical musing - is there a point? Or am I just missing it? But in the end, this is a novel that tries to be everything at once but simply ends up spinning its wheels.Hoeg tries a bit of everything, from veiled psychological motives to philosophy to action scenes complete with fiery explosions, and even a bit of sci-fi - but the net effect is simple boredom. It was sheer determination that kept me turning the pages. Summary: boring, pretentious, overwritten, unbelievable. Hoeg tries to pull the wool over our eyes hoping we'll mistake the glacial pacing and opaque philoso-babble for profound thought. Thoughtful readers won't be fooled."},{"rating":"2","title":"They are crunchy","review":"I like crunchy things and they are crunchy, delicious like a butterfinger bar, and they are made with splenda."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pot o\\" Gold is Just That!","review":"James Stewart and Paulette Goddard star in this crazy, warm-hearted, music-filled package of fun!

I understand that the issue of matrimony is a complicated one, but Paul offers few specific points as to why young marriages fail and is inconclusive about what to do about the problem. She points out over and over again that her examples of starter marriages encompass all races, creeds, socioeconomic and educational backgrounds--as well as all ages up to 30. The message I took from this was that no one is safe and no union can last. I thought it was a one-sided investigation and pessimistic observation without enough proof to make me buy into the message."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Excellent Point... HORRIBLE SOLUTIONS !!!!!","review":"This book is given 1 star for one excellent point.Paul's solutions are that young people should be taught \\"what marriage can and cannot offer\\" and to have \\"realistic expectations\\" long before the engagement party. This is an EXCELLENT point. Her other points will lead to more tragic relationship mistakes and divorces. She suggests the solutions lie in celebrating delayed marriages and more people should accept cohabitation as a method of confirming couple compatibility. Are you nuts???? Delaying marriage (and not marrying at all) is ONLY wise when you are clueless about marriage reality. Hence, it we take your advice, delaying marriage is not the answer. The second suggestion has NO MERIT whatsoever. Accept cohabitation... HA! Those who co-habit are more likely to end up in divorce and with broken marriages and lives, not better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique and objective look at marriage today","review":"This compelling examination of marriage combines hard data with personal stories to provide readers with a look at a trend and the real people behind it. The book is a thought-provoking analysis of the state of marriage today and what we might expect in the future. The book also contains valuable lessons for singles and newlyweds alike. A particular strength of the book is that the author resists taking sides or promoting a social or political agenda - she simply tells it like it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed reader","review":"I was disappointed with the book. It read like a long magazine piece, something belonging in a woman's magazine. It didn't seem like the writer really interviewed 60 couples - she only mentions about 10 people throughout the book that she actually interviewed. She quotes twentysomething men and women that were quoted by other writers in other articles and books. A lot of her points are actually the points of other writers on this issue, and then she just footnotes the source of the idea or quote. Also, I felt like she was biased - just b/c she married at 27 and divorced at 28 she thinks \\"young\\" marriages are doomed, and she doesn't give us any examples of successful marriages among twentysomethings, or constructive suggestions as to how to make a marriage work. Parts of the book were interesting, but I wanted fuller portraits of the people she interviewed, and deeper analysis, because this book just seemed like one long magazine piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"WRONG!","review":"Hello All! it not compatible with my car.

Trottier is an excellent trumpet player, and to the best of my knowledge, neither Brunies nor Trottier is available anywhere else on video, although both are available on CDs and LPs.

And to be fair, most of the biographies are well-written, and many are interesting. A few are even touching. But there are two major flaws that kept me from really enjoying this book:1) To really appreciate this as a whole, you need to be familiar with all of the characters' source films. This is especially noticeable with some of the less famous films.2) A significant number of the characters have unpleasant histories, with elements that only seemed to be added for shock value. This reaches its offensive peak with the last few bios, including that of the narrator.If those two issues aren't likely to be a problem for you, then you might get something out of this. Otherwise, I'd probably pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"So-so Italo-Bosso","review":"Balanco is no Nicola Conte, but they've got a decent vibe.

It tries to keep you on the hook with their little mysteries but there never seems to be a payoff. We see pictures of Lucy in the past, so we might expect time travel to be involved but instead we get stupid stories about roots attacking or water breathing children.I have totally lost interest in this series.I say, save your money, this series isnt worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I still remember this book","review":"I don't remember reading any other of Bill Wallace's books but I read this book for the first time when I was in the fourth grade in 1987. This book was so touching and profound that I remembered it 17 years later while book shopping for my son. This was the first book that I remember reading as a child that totally transported me with its words. I was there with Ricky when his fear slowly turned to friendship and his acceptance of loss. I remember crying while reading the last two chapters but I don't think the book would have been as moving and memorable with any other ending. I remember being the most upset after reading the last line because I wanted to read more of Ricky's story. This book is the reason I am such an avid reader today. Bill Wallace took me to another place and let me experience fear, friendship, suspense, loss and acceptance. It is a definite must read for the 4th to 6th grade group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Traumatized me","review":"I read this book when I was in fourth grade. It had such a negative impact on me, I cried for days every time I looked at a dog. I can't even remember the plot, just that the dog dies and it's violent and completely meaningless, so upsetting, I would NOT recommend this for children; it should be banned from the little kids' section. Such a terrible book. 15 years later I am still traumatized by this book and tell people about how horrific it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"You've got to read this book","review":"This is a great book!! I read it as a child and never completely got over it. I laughed until I cried and then cried some more. Bill Wallace is amazing in the way he captures the emotions of a child. I loved the way he wrote in first person. Ricky was given life in a way I don't think would have been possible if you weren't inside his mind all the time.If you have never read this book - please, please - give it a try. And while your at it, combine it with another Bill Wallace story - The Christmas Spur - about a boy whose brother has cancer. Let yourself be swept away into the worlds of two young boys and the story of their first tragic losses."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book","review":"The book A Dog Called Kitty was very good.

Then he found another dog, and you'll have to read the book to find out the end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"i loved it","review":"A Dog Called Kitty was one of my all time favorites. Although i only read it a few times I loved it. Everytime i picked it up to read it brought tears to my eyes. I think it was the first book that ever did that to me.

She was so upset she did not want to finish the book nor use it for her project. She is an avid reader and I have never had this experience before. If your child is tenderhearted or has a special love for animals, please read this book for yourself before sharing it with them. You become so attached to the dog that it is just gut-wrenching to have him die at the end (kind of like a downer movie you wish you hadn't paid to see).

One day a dog appears on his farm and scares Ricky. He tries to hide on a haystack but the dog tries to jump up! Kitty comes by every day when Ricky's mother calls the cats for breakfeast. And he chases them around the farm; that's why they named him Kitty. Something happy happens at the end and something very sad it made me cry.But I will let you find that out for yourself when you read this. A very exiting, heart-warming, and love between man and dog.

He likes it and says it is fun but that it doesn't teach you anything or stretch your mind. It is kind of slow paced and therefore not super exciting but still fun. We have only played it once or twice compared to the many times we have played the other games we got for Christmas, I guess we lean towards more strategic games around here.

I go to sleep every night with the switch in my hand, raising and lowering the temp until I fall asleep. I can hardly stand to go away from home if I forget it.

Kind of a silly premise which I wasn't aware of when I bought it, and it doesn't work anyway. The heating pad gets so hot so quickly that you can't leave it on long enough to sweat. The result is no moist heat...just heat. As a safety feature you have to hold the control on at all times. OK I guess, but it's a pain.

The new pad is virtually the same as the original and works just as well. Also it is still manufactured in the USA at the same address as our original. Before buying the new Thermophore pad, we tried several other widely advertised pads, but none of them were satisfactory: some didn't get warm enough; a few didn't last more than a couple of uses before the switch malfunctioned, and some were obviously cheaply made overseas.

The safety on/off switch is somewhat inconvenient, but since I've fallen asleep more than once with the heating pad in use, I can appreciate it as a safety feature.

First off, this thing is built to last! Very solid construction and materials. And it gets HOT... FAST!! I have no qualms about the trigger-like button that you need to hold down until the desired heat is reached. It's a non-issue with me and besides, I like having control over the temperature vs having to settle for a preset temperature I'm not happy with.

It is the best moist heating pad I have ever used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective Pain Relief","review":"I cannot recommend the quality of this heat highly enough. It's a convenient way to get moist heat into the muscles, and the size of this pad (14x27) covers the entire back and hips. There is no temperature adjustment. The pad is either on or off, and is designed for short heat treatments. Therefore, it has a switch you actually hold to keep it on. The 170 degree heat is far hotter than other heating pads, however, meaning you only need the heat treatment for a short duration to receive the benefits. I use this heating pad in my massage therapy office, and I highly recommend it for home use as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great, but no replacement parts available","review":"We have used for several several years, and now the switch is broken.

Switch is simple to replace. 4 screws, clip off old clip on new, 4 screws back on cover. They are happy to have you send it in for repair, for $30, plus shipping, plus all the time you do not have the thermophore. by the time I would ship and have it repaired, it would be too close to new price.

Not automatic at all. Have to hold down button for heat!","review":"I am so disappointed in this product. It sells itself as automatic, but it is NOT. You have to manually hold down the button to get it to produce heat. Who wants to have to hold down a button to get it to work? There were versions sold as manual that described this. I purposely looked for one that was automatic to avoid having to hold down a button non-stop to get it to work. This product was sold as an automatic version (even the box says automatic). Having to hold down a button non-stop to get it to work doesn't qualify as automatic in my opinon. I feel like I have been misled. I am very disappointed. I can only imagine use of this item on a regular basis would be very uncomfortable, defeating the point of trying to releave tension.

The heat feels like it is soaking into your body rather than sitting on the surface.

Dialogue is extremely provocative and difficult events are pictured with masterful eloquence. The plot itself is very well-crafted if not neccessarily executed to the fullest. The ever-present cynicism is also very welcome and blesses the novel with a unique feel.If there is a flaw with the book, it must be said that there is a lack of consistent progression. You ca devour a hundred or more pages without having a sense of a developing plot. This factor is why I haven't recommended this book any higher. I still believe White Noise is has yet to be toppled over its lofty perch.However, despite this shortcoming, this book is testimony to Delillo's position in comtemporary literature: a master for lesser's to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, but some loose threads . . .","review":"Like most of the reviewers, I loved Libra. However, I had a nagging feeling that the last forty or so pages were not as \\"tight\\" and solid as the rest of the book. Although it may have been a function of my own sense of the book's end, and a desire for a fantastic finale, and not the writing itself, but there were many questions and plotpoints left unaddressed. Basically - great build-up, disappointing finish. Maybe a follow-up novel built around the plotters' reaction to the Ruby assassination of Oswald or SOMETHING . . . or is this Delillo's point - everyone has a feeling of something left quite unanswered and unfinished."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste -- I just don't get it","review":"OK, after many years of reading reviews touting DeLillo as one of the greats of modern American literature, I decided to read \\"Libra.\\" If this qualifies as great literature, America's literary future is in serious peril. His characters are cardboard cutouts. His dialog is stilted and unrealistic. His descriptive passages are underdone with little evidence of imagination or enthusiasm.Overall, this was a boring book that I would not recommend to anyone. Desperate to understand DeLillo's appeal, I forced myself to read all the way to the end...then wondered why.I've been an avid reader for almost 50 years, reading books and short stories from every genre. I'm always willing to give an author the benefit of the doubt.Maybe I'm just older than most of DeLillo's followers. Maybe it's just that I was old enough in 1963 to understand what was going on. Maybe I'm just expecting too much from DeLillo.This was my first DeLillo novel.

I have found that the style of the author's writing to be confusing but think about it, it was the intensity of the book that kept me so anxious about turning the page. To this day, the exact details to the murder are still not clear, but one thing is for sure: DeLillo has brilliantly depicted his belief of what went on during the time period of the assassination. Don DeLillo did a great job of mixing facts and fictions, making them all seem so real to the reader. Even though some of DeLillo's implications seem unrealistic, the thought of \\"what if\\" what Don DeLillo wrote was true is definitely worth some thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Libra Review","review":"Don DeLillo's use of figuritive language and his use of varying sentence patterns made the reading very interesting. This one was deffinately a page turner. DeLillo takes one of the most popular assasinations of world history and tells it from a different point of view. The reader gets to look at the whole incident from the perspective of Oswald. While at some parts I still did not know what was going on in the book and found it very confusing, i loved it, just for that. It was not some easy reading, predictable book. It made you think and thats what I loved about it most.

A sad faced man came on the television screen and announced, \\"President Kennedy has died.\\" People were crying everywhere.

I never was a Kennedy assasination buff and I'm stll not, but I loved reading this novel. The story kept me on the edge - this is a real page turner. Part-fiction and part Oswald's world, the story may be close to the truth of what really happened, or it could be a fantasy from DeLillo's vast imagination. It doesn't matter where the truth lies.

Hey, I was desperate to help the fund raiser.I only made it through about 50 pages. It's 266 pages of Dr. McCormack telling about his life as a rural veterinarian in Alabama. No engaging story line, IMO anyway, just page after page of stories about him establishing his business, helping animals and talking with locals in southern, country lingo.The story starts with him coming to the rescue of a cow nearly dead from some gas causing it to bloat excessively, which caused its uterus to protrude.

I took the shrinkwrap off of one and had to immediately place it outside because of the horrible odor.I will try to return these items - I will report back what happens with the return. Based on the seller's return policy, my gut feeling is that they won't refund the shipping and will charge me a 35% restocking fee since one of these items is opened, even though I believe they are defective (i.e. smell like chemicals) and not as advertised (i.e. not 4 lb).

Bland white man blues with no subtle nuances. And let's face it, his voice is not great by any means. I wasn't particularly impressed by guitarist Duke Robillard either - he seems to be just going through the motions. Perhaps a good album for a party, but it's rather barren musically.

It is also a fascinating, well written biography. Overall, I agree with the review posted here by Lawrence Hauser, which is excellent. In particular, I concur with Hauser's praise of the chapter on Waterman's son John.What most captivated me about Guy Waterman's story was his refusal to seek help, his belief that somehow his life was uniquely different. He seemed to live with all kinds of denial, including his alcoholism, even though he did manage to stop drinking. His ultimate denial had to do with his reason's for killing himself -- the argument that impending old age would be unbearable. 67 and in perfectly good health? Of course, the only health Waterman had was physical. His deep depression and inability to communicate emotionally with his wife suggest a gravely ill man. But Waterman, an otherwise very intelligent person, refused to seek help. As Brown tells it, Waterman's life was truly tragic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"You will love this book.

I have been interested in the Titanic long before the movie & was unable to find this book until now. Thank you Leo & Amazon.com. Although most of the similarities to the Titanic wreck are only in the first few chapters, it does not diminish their impact & their significance. I was impressed by their accuracy- you think of most predictions as being vague & probably could apply to anything- not this book!!!! He names facts & figures. The story itself is a pretty typical Edwardian novel & lacks some of the polish you may be used to- It was nice to find it in a paperback edition- the original cover is a nice touch. I would recommend it to any fan of the titanic- the real event and fans of the movie. 5 stars!!! Check it out!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, it's NOT like today's writings, but...","review":"This is a story (really stories) worth reading.

I've known of this story for years, but could never get a copy of it until now. The story itself is only about 37 pages long, shouldn't take more than a hour to read, yet seems to never end. The similarities between the Titan and the Titanic are mere coincidences, and the story is choppy and incoherent. This book is not a prophetic work. Perhaps if it were lengthened it would make a decent novel in its own right, but comparing it to the Titanic is a waste of time. If you want to read about a good historical prediction try reading about Cortez's landing in Mexico, and how it coincided with the return of an exciled devil of the Aztecs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Similar to titanic","review":"But, a lot of differences in the story line.....still reading, very good so far!

If not for the fact that it resembled the Titanic disasterin some remote way, few would likely know about it. Its coincidence with the Titanic is not nearly so remarkable as some might make out. In fact, the 70-page story contains a few dozen sentences about the Titan and its wreck; most of the rest is unrelated and hard to understand. The style was very abrupt and choppy where the Titan was respected, and too prolific concerning the hero, John Rowland, by the way, who was altogether too heroic. His feminine love was much too perfect, of enough mention was made of her to be able to tell. The story centers selfishly around its hero, who, stranded on an island after the ship sank, one-handedly kills a polar bear with a jack knife to save the heroine's daughter. As for the Titan, it apparently just flops over on its side and sinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE TITANIC...","review":"This book would not even be of any value. The book had very little to do with the ship, Titan and the storyline that Morgan Robertson applied to the story was scarcely believable. After so much attention was given to the similarities between the Titan and the Titanic, I was expecting more than what I got.I know little about the author but he did write other pieces that had some degree of prophecy associated -- lasers, as US war with Japan, etc. But he could not develop his thoughts and put them down on writing in an entertaining manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"If you're expecting a story about the sinking of a Titanic like ship, you'll be sadly disappointed.

He includes as a ground breaking discovery a letter about Orciani's effort to manufacture an alibi for Vanzetti's pistol. Without any other background on the strategies and tactics of the defense from 1920-27, this is out of context and meaningless for both new students to the case, and researchers.The book is not a comprehensive transcript.

He always tries hard to experiment with new ideas and forms. But for quite some time now, he just hasn't been able to come up with any compelling material. This book covers (yet again) themes that are hallmarks of previous work, including a fascination for war and weapons, incest and the eccenticities of the aristocracy. But he has nothing particularly interesting to say about any of these, and no matter how hard Mr Banks tries to re-deal his cards these days, it is from the same old, dog-eared pack. Here, he also tries too hard to intellectualise his threadbare material, making one wonder at the end 'just what did I read that for'? Perhaps this effort could have made a reasonable short story, but I think Mr Banks must have some hardback contracts to satisfy, and so turned his thin material into his annual hardback output. It certainly shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Least impressive Banks' book I've read so far...","review":"While Ian Banks is one of the most interesting writers I've come across in the last few years, unfortunately \\"A Song of Stone\\" is one of the least engaging novels I've ever finished. Muted, yet overwrought, this tale of dissolution is less shocking than turgid. The extended and tedious stretches of \\"purple prose\\" in this disappointing book, which were apparently consciously intended to embody the self-absorbed and effete mental state of the protagonist and narrator, did little but lose my flagging interest repeatedly. Coyly lurid, and basically quite unsatisfying, this dim variation on an apocalyptic, Road Warrior-ish theme goes nowhere and then dies...Read anything else by Banks before or instead of \\"A Song of Stone\\". Though I do rather enthusiastically recommend Banks as an author, I can't in good conscience give thumbs up to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Iain's worst by far, I think...","review":"Iain went too far with this book. If you read this, it's good at first (especially with the Lt.'s introduction killing Half-Caste) but when you keep going it gets horribly one-toned.Too many scenes are ruined by its consistently bleak nature. Abel always seems to be the underdog; the loser. When he gets his moment, he ruins it again and the story gets worse and worse. Way too much angst and way too much extremities simply adds up to a bad novel.It's too bad really, because it makes an excellent first impression. However, it has too many flaws as a novel so overall I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring rubbish","review":"Although the use of language is most eloquent, the story doesn't go anywhwere. What story there might be is interrupted by chapters about the main character's sex life, which couldn't possibly be more out of context. This is one of the worst books I've ever read. I stuck to the end, even on the last chapter hoping there would be some redemption. But there wasn't. Not only that but it is a very dark and depressing story, to which I failed to see any point.Loved The Wasp Factory, The Bridge, Complicity. Hated this one and Whit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turgid and overwrought","review":"Doomed by turgid and overwrought prose, this story dies unborn. Banks seems more intrigued by his ability to present the reader with both decadent and debauched imagery than with a functional storyline, or characters that assume any more qualities than cardboard cutouts. Overall, this book comes off as being unfortunately amateurish; Banks is more enamoured with utilising his vast vocabulary than with writing a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited Appeal","review":"I don't review many books here but the thought that a little effort on my part would save someone else from having to read this awful book made up my mind to do so.I loved the author's \\"Consider Phoebus\\", and decided to buy some more of his work. If I had read \\"A Song of Stone\\" first, I would have avoided him like the plague.If you like first-person narratives from whiney, incompetent protagonists who spent half their time spouting trite, sophomoric philosophy, then you may just enjoy this book. If not, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant as ever","review":"As always, Banks is brilliant with words and spins a yarn that gets you tangled quickly and permanently.

In fact, I didn't enjoy it at all. The main character is not particularly likeable, drives you nuts with his inability to act, and remains the most likeable person in the novel. The ending is unpleasant, to say the least.In spite of the \\"M.\\" in the author's name, this is not a work of science fiction or The Culture (he writes under two names, with and without the M, to distinguish between his science and mainstream fiction). The novel takes place somewhere more like war-torn Bosnia.Of all his books, this is the only one I'll get rid of, because I will *never* read it again.

I assume that this book is a product of those zany minds that bring us The Onion and The Harvard Lampoon. This one really skewers the Religious Right and their attitudes towards women. My only criticism is that some points that the \\"Dr.\\" makes are a little to extreme to be believed. The key to great satire, as I understand it, is to walk right up to the edge of incredulity without going over it. Some of the positions taken in this book are pure lunacy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pinnacle of credibility and integrity.","review":"This book is an absolute joke. According to Hager's ex-wife, he is a chronic rapist who tormented her by forcing sodomy on her in her sleep for decades before she finally got the courage to leave him. As outlandish as that sounds, I'm not making this up! Furthermore, when she asked him not to please refrain from putting it THERE, he replied that he couldn't tell the difference between her **beep-beep** and her **boop-boop**. Can a man who claims ignorance of his own wife's anatomy possibly make any credible contribution to the understanding of women's health? Hager is the posterchild for the argument that the more sanctimonious, patriarchal, and moralistic a fundamentalist is, the more disturbing his private sexual shame is likely to be. <Sigh.> I'm prayin' for you, Dave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prayers for PMS?

He was appointed in December 2002 (two years ago, folks) and he'll be out in June of this year (2004). The chair of the committee is a woman scientist from Stanford. Some of the circulating Hager rumour is exaggerated. However, at least three standing members in the FDA roster do publicly blend their christianity with their Science. I'm simply glad there are still committees of scientists involved in government. I tried three weeks ago to post this message with links to corroborate myself, but my post didn't make it up here.

Piper brings all the elements of the folk artist together, as well as displaying quite a cross-section of interests and influences. In \\"All my Angels Past,\\" Piper shows his talent and philisophical views as his lyrics impose. I can pick out three artists that have possibly influenced Piper; Bob Dylan, Don McLean, and Johnny Cash to name a few. But Piper has a style of his own, an individualism that makes his album a collector's item. His brassy vocals and harmonics on Jacarenda, and Jathida are catchy enough to leave you humming the rest of the day. The lyrics of Rudder and sail can be taken religiously, as well as philisophically, and Blood of Our Mother paints a picture in your mind of the past hardships of one family. In retrospect, for an album you can relate to, laugh with, reminesce with, and simply ENJOY for many years to come, I strongly recommend this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Goons deserved better","review":"Anyone who's heard the Goon Shows knows they were masters of absurdist comedy, and this film sadly contains little of that quality. The four Goons take on a single character from the Goon Show's plethora of characters for \\"Down Among The Z-Men\\".The plot is pretty meager, concerning two thieves who want to steal an atomic formula from Michael Bentine. Harry Secombe plays a store clerk who accidentally winds up in the army, where Spike Milligan plays numbskull Private Eccles and Peter Sellars is General Bloodnok.The films tries hard to be entertaining with goofy routines, musical numbers, etc, but is pretty understocked with laughs. It's certainly not the fault of the Goons, but of the dumb story they were cast in. Yet I still enjoy the film as a typical bit of early-fifties fluff and others might who are hard-core Goon fans, if only as a novelty.The cover box picture of Peter Sellars is not from the film, but the way..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Goon Lovers Essential","review":"I love the Goons and have a number of CDs of their shows, when I discovered there was a movie I just had to get it.

The story line was extremely far fetched and really not believable at all. The ending was really really really disappointing. I had a hard time actally reading the end and quite honestly, just skimmed it, I was that disappointed with it. Ms. Creswell, had spent a lot of time building up to a climax that just didn't pan out, it was if she realized she had enough pages and had to wrap it all up. It just wasn't worthy of her other stories. I would suggest reading The Daughter, The Disappearance and The Inheritance rather than this one. I hope she regains the momentum for her next book. I look forward to her stories, especially since she only puts one out per year. I certainly won't be keeping this one, into the donation pile it will go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"I believe this book is out of print but if you happen to find a used one it's worth a read.

Before reading this one you should try one of her other \\"better\\" books (ie. The Conspiracy, Secret Sins, etc.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Refuge","review":"Once again Jasmine Cresswell delivers an outstanding story! Fans of her previous books will recognize Cresswell's ability to present engaging and sympathetic characters in an intriguing and fast-moving story.

Double Dare follows the charismatic Zoe from her final days on set of Xena in New Zealand all the way to Hollywood where she is picked up to double on Kill Bill. The film isn't the best documentary I've ever seen but Zoe Bell takes the audience along on here wild adventures and makes for a great story.

A very intimate look at two outstanding artists of their profession and the DVD even offers more: the various deleted scenes, commentaries and interviews even deliver a wider range of information and insight and thus bring to the fan what no documentary before has delivered: a capable and intimate insight into the lives and works of female stunt artists, a profession that made films such as Kill Bill possible"},{"rating":"2","title":"Double Dare is the best documentary I have seen","review":"Double Dare is an in depth look into the lives of two stunt women in a profession dominated by men.

The size was the right fit for my camera, however, when I inserted the compactflash into my camera, it said there was no memory available, which means that the card is useless at this point unless I give it to some one else who has a camera that will allow it to work. I don't know if it's my camera thats at fault (Nikon 4300) or the card itself. I wished when I ordered, information was provided about which cameras these cards are best used for. I am pretty disapointed that this card, which was the right size, didn't work for my camera. I decided not to return it because it was only about 15 bucks and perhaps, I will find someone with an adaquate camera that will allow this card somehow magically to work.

I used a Nikon d70. I have 2 other compact flash cards I have had for a few years and they had no problem. I can't tell if these are real or fake. The articles I read mainly show these with an Ultra II on them, which the older cards are. When I bought these, they were shown in the online picture as Ultra II with a write speed of 15 rather than 30. I really wanted those, but kept these after I tried them. Since I have been using digital for about 12 years and this is the first time I have had a problem, I can feel there is a problem with the cards.

I also have three 1 gig Ultra II's and have noticed that they seem to be faster than the 4 gig version...but I usually don't need more than 9 pictures of an event in less than 5 seconds anyway, so this has not caused too much trouble. I have taken about 5,000-6,000 pictures on this card so far without any problems, other than running low on hard drive space because I end up taking more pictures due to this cards large size. So if speed is your main concern I recommend buying a few 1 gig cards or even moving up to an Extreme III, but other than that this card is a very good size for the cost and gets the job done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine died too....","review":"I bought this in April for my new Canon 30D and it worked great until several months ago.

In this, the sixth book in her Inspector Sloan series, the body of a murdered man is found buried under the rubble of a fallen monument in the bell tower of a church. No one can get into the room because the rubble is blocking the only door.So how was he murdered? The unfolding of the story includes love, lust, religion, science, big business, greed and misunderstandings. All done in a very British way, of course.Poor Inspector Sloan is saddled, as usual, with the young, brash and brainless Constable Crosby, who provides a light touch to Catherine Aird's prose. If you like Ellis Peter's Detective George Felse series, you'll really enjoy Catherine Aird."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Locked-Room Mystery.","review":"Ms. Aird's version of a \\"locked-room\\" mystery is an intriguing one. Her dry wit and intelligent writing make it an excellent example of thie genre. Not only that, but the book in its entirety takes place during the space of one day. It can't get much tighter than that. It all begins when an arm is seen amongst several tons of broken plaster in a locked church bell tower. This sets Inspector Sloan on the track of a murderer. But its her characters that make the story so special - the enigmatic Sloane, the bumbling Sergeant Crosby and the colourful Superintendent Leeyes. Ms Aird is a master craftsman of the the cozy mystery formula."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kept waiting for the good part...","review":"Yeah...no. The back of the book was far more compelling than the actual novel. Some well-written scenes and occasionally a lovely sense of time and place, some well-crafted caricatures -- none of it is enough to rescue the self-concious, coming of age tone, despite the author's obvious attempt at something much more noble and searingly insightful. It's as if we get a lot more anatomically involved in \\"Are You There, God, It's Me Margaret\\" when what the author was shooting for was \\"The Vagina Monologues.\\" The book is readable, but only if you've checked it out from the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"One annoying distraction","review":"I agree with the other readers, with one caveat: an annoying distraction for me while reading this otherwise excellent book was the author's chronic use of incorrect terminology when referring to female genitalia. There are at least 5 or 6 points in the book where she refers to a woman's vagina, when what she clearly means is vulva. It's just irritating when female writers, especially, don't know the parts of the female body."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you ever wonder....","review":"How some of these books actually get into print and does it not seem that several of the reviews are from the same person...I might have given this two stars but had the misfortune to meet the author perhaps on a bad day. She was postivitely doting over a man in front of me and then a real haughty bitchy way of condensendingly signing her book which on a camping trip a week later and running out of Charmin I used it.....My rear end had several paper cuts- <the cut below>However my penuriousness in stars for this book is a mixture of unfortunately having met the author...Sometimes its better to just order the book off Amazon........and leave the rest to the imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vendetta by Michael Dibdin","review":"The book is well written. The story kept me guessing until the end. By reading the book, I learned a great deal about Italy- especially the island of Sardinia- an interesting place I'll probably never get to visit in person. I did not give this book 5 stars because I did not like it as well as Dibdin's book, Blood Rain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed this.","review":"I've been enjoying Italian mysteries lately. Zen is fun, especially since the stories are also now on PBS. Dibdin is a good writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad, but it drags.","review":"He can be a wonderful writer, but this time he got off track. Descriptions are great, but action is slow, and the plot wanders. There's too much delving into past cases, which distracts from the present one. And the protagonist doesn't seem real; a \\"voice\\" isn't enough to flesh her out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Middle book of 'trilogy'","review":"The first three books of the Aurelio Zen series (of which this is the second) read as a trilogy.Whilst enjoyable, and as engaging as its predecessor, Ratking, and successor, Cabal, I thought there were some MINOR plotting weaknesses (eg a luxury car whose steering didn't lock when being driven without the engine running).The Sardinian setting was well-evoked.I do recommend reading the Zen series in order, especially the first three, where character development builds."},{"rating":"1","title":"my high hopes were dashed","review":"I was so excited about this book I left work early the day I bought it just so I could start to read it. I thought it would be a more 90's version of reunion & how it felt at her age to be found. It resembled (sometimes eerily) how I was found. I am sorry to say how disappointed I was. Her writing is amazing, but I couldn't quite get over all the people she was mad at. Where did she develop all her hangups? Her father was a supportive figure all her life, she was close with her step mom (whom she called mom), she was approached cautiously yet carefully by her birthparents, yet she just couldn't stop whining. There are worse fateful situations than hers, how spoiled and selfish she is. Towards the end of the book, I was rooting for the birth parents to pat themselves on their backs, that they found their birthdaughter and were glad she was ok. If I was Hannah or Adam, I would not have wanted to meet her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why not use the truth?","review":"What I don't understand about this book is how it and the Amazon reviewers of it can be so brainwashed by the adoption industry that they do not respect Sarah Saffian's natural parents as being such. The demeaning word \\"birth mother\\" is used not only throughout Sarah's book but also in reviews of it. In addition, Sarah seems to refuse to acknowledge her parents as what they really are: her parents. Sarah's lack of thinking for herself and her inability to understand and respect natural family relationships is sad indeed. May she one day take a few steps away from denial and from the adoption industry, which she obviously supports, and realize how terrible mother and child separation is. I'd like to read the book that she writes after she wakes up from her adoption fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"With it's intelligent grace and honesty, Ithaka impresses.","review":"I felt loss after finishing Ithaka. For me the book was a pleasure, a retreat, an inspiration, a comfort, an achievement, and a counterpoint. Sarah poignantly gave voice to many of my feelings-- though in fact our experiences were quite different. I am a motherless daughter who was orphaned after my father's death 6 years ago. To witness the careful poise, honesty and sense Sarah maintained in piecing together her story was/is extremely helpful to me in my efforts to define my sense of family and self. Thank you Sarah."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real page turner","review":"I am an adoptee who found both my birthparents. I read Itaka in the midst of that process. I found this book very interesting, full of humor and very honest. It was a great book which was hard to put down. 2 thumbs up!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for Adoptees","review":"I am an adoptee (age 34) and found the book to be extraordinarily timely. I met my birthparents two years ago, and the roller coaster of emotions is overwhelming. Sarah Saffian's ability to articulate the things I am feeling is uncanny. I checked this book out of the library, then had to get my own copy so I could underline and highlight.For those who've said she is self-absorbed, that's the point. So many huge pieces of her life and her identity were altered without her consent, before she was even born. How can a person help but question her feelings about each of the parties involved, about her obligation to each, her connection to each, and how each affects her. Given the magnitude of the revelation (Hi - I'm your birthmother, and I married your birth father and you have a set of \\"full-blooded\\" siblings.) Sarah deserves the opportunity to wallow around in self-absorbed questions about her identity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puzzled By the All the Hoopla","review":"I finally picked up a copy of this book, which has been much-touted in the press and elsewhere, but I'm really not sure what all the enthusiasm is about. It seems to be yet another \\"poor little rich girl gazing at her navel\\" story, and the writing, while competent, is certainly unexceptional. I do appreciate the author's willingness to probe her psyche in some meaningul way, but the end result is a narrator whom I felt indifferent towards. Adoptees, in and of themselves, are not special people-- so why do we hunger for their stories?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Here comes the judge","review":"Boo-hoo, a very rich girl by birth is adopted by a very rich family. This is a melodramatic book about a very real subject that could have been handled with great depth and sensitivity if the author hadn't been so self-absorbed and sophmoric that she couldn't understand her privelege. This is not to say, of course, that people of money can't be in turmoil or crisis, but to put forth a tone that makes this struggle the equal of people who are adopted into poverty-struck, drug-addled families (and yes I'm talking about white on white adoption here) is both disgusting and shallow. She has skills but veers into self-pity and martyrism much too easily. I hope she is young enough that she can learn to be a better person."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring little rich girl","review":"i had really high hopes for this when i started it, but was soon disappointed by the author's tiresome self-absorption. the writing is usually decent, except for the cringeworthy \\"inside the womb\\" section. sarah saffian is not a likable woman, sorry to say. i wish she was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-absorption is not a virtue!","review":"This book had been recommended to me, so I decided to take a chance and purchase it. But immediately I was turned off by the sacrosanct tone of Ms. Saffian's writing. It is didactic in a way that is very, very distancing. Her experiences as an adopted child are not useful, educational, or compelling to anyone else due to the author's absolute selfishness (there are many incidents of this in the book). Both with regard to her birth parents and her adoptive parents. She seems like a spoiled little rich girl looking to justify her behavior through this book, but that isn't interesting at all. The author would do better going to therapy and recording her feelings privately. It is surprising that both sets of parents were so patient and understanding with this girl. Her writing style is the final straw here. It's pretty awful in parts. Find a better book on the subject of adoption; there are many out there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dazzling","review":"This is simply one of the best books of recent memory. In place of the self-involved, self-centered ramblings of the typical memoir, Saffian gives us a complicated story about people wrestling with elemental problems: family, loyalty, loss. And even though she is at the center of that story, she does a marvelous job of making everyone else in the book as real as she is. The title is well-chosen, since the book is suffused with an almost Greek sense of the way life entails coming to terms with your destiny -- in Saffian's case, the sudden and unexpected appearance of her birth parents. This is a book of uncommon maturity and seriousness. I've read it twice now, even though I have no special interest in adoption, and I thought it even more impressive the second time around."},{"rating":"2","title":"insightful","review":"I heard Sarah Saffian on NPR and was so impressed with her poise that I decided to pick up the book, even though the topic did not interest me at first. While I occasionally find Saffian's writing style to be a bit overwrought, on the whole I am impressed with her telling of the story. Saffian is exactly my age, and frankly, I can relate to her moments of melodrama--trying to adjust to post-college life was challenging enough without meeting birth parents! In this telling, Saffian and her family members are not \\"good guys\\" or \\"bad guys,\\" they are just people struggling to make connections. I think ITHAKA offers good insight into human relations in general--Sarah's reaction to being called out of the blue is instructive to (for?) anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a fellow adoptee and I can't relate to this book.","review":"I found this book to be drawn-out and the author's views to be slightly presumptuous. The recurring theme of pushing away the birth family gets old quickly, and the book takes on a whiny tone. Certain aspects are over-dramatized. After seeing Saffian at a book fair, I wanted to relate to this book, but found the author's focus on herself to be smothering and alienating. On the positive side, Saffian is successful in not jumping to one side of the fence or the other in the open/closed records debate. While she wasn't sure she wanted her birth parents to find her, she also seemed to be at peace with them by the end of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get over yourself...","review":"I'd have to agree with the reader/reviewer, linda from sarasota, fl. Though well-written, I find this author dreary, selfish and overly affected by her small life. As an adoptee, I've heard every story possible regarding meeting or attempting to meet birth parents. I'm disappointed that the author couldn't have portrayed a stronger, more sensitive and giving person through this ordeal. It's a shame that the story happened the way it did...what a wonderful reunion this could have been for all concerned. Instead, the author portrayed herself as a 'stalkee' and then had to emotionally beat herself up and everybody around her through the entire ordeal...and a ridiculous 3-year ordeal it was! I stuck with this book through the end because she didn't actually reveal the 'reunion' until close to the end; however, I was relieved to finish the book, so I could be done with poor Sarah's journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take your vitamins.......it's tiring and dreary","review":"I wanted to love this book and I wanted to give it to some of my friends who are adopted and have had a similar search. To be honest, they all did it better and in less than two years of vascillating! I have faced cancer, divorce, deaths of child, mother, brother and business partner with less pathos than this young woman needed just to pick up a phone and call her parents! I just don't get it! My friends who have gone through it did it better and I'm encouraging them to write about it in a more tangible manner. I felt the author was wimpy and torturous in her journey and also extremely selfish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save yourself the money","review":"This is a memoir written, like so many, by a complete narcissist. It should have stayed in the author's diary and not been made public. There are plenty of good books about adoption, but this isn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"Being very interested in adoption, I had waited a long time for this book to be delivered. However, it turned out to be a big disappointment. As others have mentioned, I found it to be very well-written, but it did not give me any insight into what the writer was experiencing. Good books, in my opinion, are books which emotionally take hold of me. Make me cry,laugh,mad, sad etc. With this book, I could not help but be fustrated in how little it was able to do so. I was always left totally detached. Bottom line, over-rated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable","review":"I am at a loss for words on how this book affected me. As an adoptee who is still in search of my own elusive birth parents, I have to wonder if I wouldn't react the same way as Sarah. To have my birth mother just call me out of the blue like that would be, for a lack of a better word, shocking. The emotional tidal wave it sent her on was understandable. TO say this wouldn't happen to me would be total denial on my part. I wept, I laughed. I had to put the book down on numerous occations just to regroup. My emotions overcame me at times where I just went outside and screamed in frustration. If I could just be so lucky. Great Book! A must read for any adoptee in search for the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"An authentic jouney of heart and soul","review":"Sarah Saffian speaks to us from her heart about her feelings after her birth parents found her. She is thoroughly honest and reveals her innermost thoughts as she moves from first contact to the point where her birth parents become a part of her adult life. This book is a gift to anyone who has faced the dilemna of how to reconcile any long term satisfying relationship (here Sara's relationship with her adoptive family) with new kindred souls who manifest in our lives (here her birth family). Ithaka reads like a novel, and has lasting value for any person commited to explore what it means to be a loving person in a complicated world. You don't have to be a member of the adoption triad to find peace and happiness in Ithaka."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"Item arrived well packed and ahead of schedule.

Though I CAN view all the photos I copied from the camera to my PC, Ringo Uploader won't upload all of them, there are some (around 50%) \\"BAD FILES\\", which means I'll have to upload them manually. Yeah, manually uploading works, so the software that verifies whether the file is okay, is giving the error. Bottomline is: this card does not work as seamless as the 1GB Ultra card.

The default channel had too much static to use, but once we switched over to the 'B' setting, that stopped being a problem. I can hear everything through the monitor, even being able to distinguish between my two children breathing. I love the option to turn off the sound and see whether the babies are noisy - one of my girls HATED bedtime until she was a few months old, and this allowed us to let us see whether she was still crying after 5 minutes without having to go in the room or listen to the I-hate-bedtime screaming. After nine months of daily use, the receiver stopped working, but this is decent value for the price. I found that the Safety First monitor I bought picked up the sounds from this one's base, but with increased sensitivity. It would have been nice if the nightlight could be turned on without the monitor relaying sound, but the option to turn the nightlight off is fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Junk","review":"I returned the first monitor with power problems. Unless held just right the power supply to the receiver failed. The second unit has even more problems. Any subtle movement near the transmitter causes a loud crack from the receiver. The antenna is loose and reflects any movement to the microphone through it's rattling. The receiver has steadily picked up more and more static from it's power source. After three weeks the only way we can get even marginal reception is to use batteries. If the box and receipt had not been thrown away this unit would be returned as well. I'm purchasing a new (different brand) monitor and will consider crushing this unit and sending it to the manufacturer to let them know how I feel about their products. \\"Fisher Price\\" is for toy's not electronics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I'd registered for a different monitor!!","review":"This monitor is horrible! I thought the idea was nice, lights indicate noise level as well the sound. Static is horrible! It squeals for no reason, even when I'm across the house from the base! On channel B, the sound goes in and out for no reason. And the batteries died so quickly, in the middle of the night while I was sleeping no less! I didn't hear my daughter until she was screaming and wailing! Thank God it has a cord to plug it in as well, which is how I use it now, but that is SO inconvenient! The monitor picks up the baby in the downstairs apartment crying through the floor clearly, so why does my daughter sound distorted? And the newest thing: it now picks up a radio station!

The great point is that I can hear my baby breathing which comforts me. My monitor is sitting about 6 feet away from the crib. I had this monitor for 1.5 years and have been generally happy with it. As far as the static goes, it does have static at times, you can move it in a different spot to lessen or make it go away. When your cell phone rings, it'll make the receiver buzz. I just make sure my phone is not sitting next to the receiver. The Lights on the receiver light up when your baby makes noises. I can take it outside, but not very far. The further away from the house the more static. I am planning on buying another monitor like this one if I can find it for the $19 price I originally bought it for.

Enjoyable listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great concert, satisfactory recording","review":"Went to see this great concert in 2003; excellent band. In my opinion, this was McCartney's best musical/vocal performance in his solo years (apart from the silly Freedom-song). Respect! The sound (on this CD) is mostly better than of his previous concert tours (Tripping the Life Fantastic or Paul is Live).Comment: the CD contains too much dub, cut & copy, past; why is the CD not more like a simple concert registration? Furthermore: McCartney wrote an enormous amount of other great songs. Why does not he perform them? The playing list could at least include more songs from his Wings/solo period like Junk, Wild Life, Dragonfly, 1984, Call me back again, Letting go, Beware my love, Getting closer, Girls school, We got married, Souvenir, Beautiful night, She's giving up talking, Rinse the Raindrops,...Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"So sad....","review":"Having been a huge Beatles/McCartney fan since '64, it pains me to trash this but trash I must. I can deal with the fact that Paul's voice isn't what it what it used to be (after 40 years, who's is?) but that's the least of the problems here. The whole performance is at best perfunctory at best what you'd expect at a three-times -a-day Las Vegas show. The arrangements are rushed and emotionless. It makes some of his other live releases seem positively brillant by comparison. Paul doesn't need the money so why release something so underwhelming? The one thing these CD's do well, is make me want to put on the original performances of these songs, since nothing on these two discs compares."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best live CD ever possible","review":"Paul McCartney's live performance on these two discs is astounding. He performs almost all the songs energetically, and with feeling. However, the last four or five tracks on disc one seem a bit weak, especially \\"Carry That Weight,\\" and \\"The Fool on the Hill.\\" The sound quality is excellent, much better than the live tracks on The Beatles' Anthology albums. The accompanying booklet is full of photographs from the tour, and there is a little message from each of the five band members.

But in the last ten tears, we have the 'unplugged', 'tripping', 'paul is live' and now 'back in the us'. This is probably a Guiness record! I'd say about 80% of the tracks on this album have already been released in a live version in the last decade, so I am taking out a star because of that. This item is more like a concert memorabilia, like a t-shirt or a cup, but nothing really worth to listen more than once, unless you attended the concerts. For me, 'tripping the live fantastic' is superior and more much interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"OK, so the CD has all the songs from the tour on it, whereas the DVD is missing about 7 or 8 songs.But the CD, for me, is completely absent of any of the excitement and emotion I saw and felt when I saw McCartney in Atlanta. Why? Because the CD is song...applause...song...applause...song...well, you get the point.NOT ONE BIT of Paul's onstage comments are included in the CD. The omissions that stand out for me are:1. When he introduced Getting Better, and talked about doing live Beatles songs that they never got to do live...2. His heartfelt dedications to Heather for Your Loving Flame and to Linda for My Love.3. My biggest disappointment is omitting his heartfelt words about John when he introduced Here Today, and then talking about playing ukeleles with George before he played Something.As with the DVD, Paul is listed as Executive Producer of the CD. In both cases, he's a better musician than he is a producer."},{"rating":"2","title":"You say goodbye, I say hello","review":"I am a serious Beatles/McCartney fan and collector. I attended two of Paul's shows in 2002. They were both really good shows, and this CD is among the best concert CDs in my collection. Age seems to do Paul McCartney good. He can still rock out, and can sing beautifully. Much of the music here is from the '60s, including a few songs that he had never played live before. The new material comes through strong for the most part. On the whole a fine concert by Sir Paul. There is one piece of bad news: although every song in the concert is presented, all of the chatter between songs has been deleted. This means his enthousiastic greeting (\\"We have come to rock you tonight!\\"), his passionate words for John and George, the band introductions, and the humorous stories behind some songs (those of you who attended these shows will know what I'm talking about) are all missing. But the music is excellent, and Paul will probably never do another tour like this one, so enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Wait!!!","review":"It had been a while since McCartney had been in America but it was worth the wait. He plays some hits from his days with the Beatles and more hits from his solo career. Paul is in great voice throughout and is really a crowd pleaser. Reccomended for all fans of the Beatles and Wings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice collection from his recent tour","review":"If you're one of the many fans who couldn't attend one of Paul's shows on his recent tour, this is an enjoyable sampling of what you would have experienced. Similar to his \\"Tripping The Live Fantastic\\" CD from the late 80's, early 90's World Tour, this CD essentially re-creates the set list from his live shows. Other than his longtime keyboardist Wix, Paul has a new and younger band to accompany him, and they really seem to keep Paul sounding fresh. It's amazing to hear him still hit many of the high notes at his age, and still rock. Keep up the good work..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Concert Memories","review":"There's nothing better than seeing Paul live, (I did 5/1/02) but if you missed the show, you must hear this album. It's a great collection of Paul's songs and the quality is suprising. The second CD starts out a little weak, but is great at the end. Being a huge Macca fan, I LOVE IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Macca still rocks","review":"Any of you Fab Four freaks will love this latest CD. Thank god he included his tribute to John Lennon, \\"Here Today.\\" BEAUTIFUL. Anyone who was lucky enough to attend any of the \\"Back in the U.S. 2002\\" concerts will be glad to have this to play (again and again and again). His tour group was about the best you will ever hear. I loved everything about the show, and this CD is a MUST for all of us who love Macca. Thank goodness he is well and hopefully happy now. Keep on rockin!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Live Performer Ever","review":"I love this CD. Paul was brilliant in concert this year and the CD captures the energy of the show, even though it would be impossible to capture the magic of seeing him live. In my own opinion this is a much better CD than the last two tour albums. Paul's voice is in great shape. I would recommend it to all Paul's fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul is the Greatest!","review":"I was very excited when I saw they were putting this concert out in cd form (and now video)! I got tickets to his concert in Tacoma for my birthday, and as far as I am concerned it was the best b-day present EVER!! This cd is almost like being at the concert all over again. As I listen to each song I close my eyes and can imagine myself back in the Tacomadome with Paul up on stage in his little red shirt and black trousers putting on the greatest concert ever. Although I do wish that they put in the little bits Paul would say about some of his songs, and the bits about John and George, that would have been nice. I don't think, however, that it detracts from the main focus of the album, that being Paul's great music. (I would like to hear more massage stories though!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as great as being at the show.","review":"As an avid Beatles fan, I went to McCartney's concert in Indianapolis hoping he would play many Beatles tunes. He did, but I left more impressed by his solo work. His latest production, Driving Rain, has been out for a year without major success. I bought it when it came out and did not pay any attention to it, I wish I had. Now i am hooked on tracks like Loving Flame, Here Today and Drivin' Rain.I recommend this CD to anyone that has appreciation for a good recording of classics and moderns. It's so great that you cannot go wrong with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too old to rock and roll","review":"Sir Paul should stick to studio recordings at this point. His voice no longer sounds good live, understandably so.If you want a great Paul McCartney live album, when he was at the peak of his powers, with a great band, buy Wings Over America."},{"rating":"1","title":"I REALLY DIDN'T LIKE IT!","review":"I REALLY DIDN'T LIKE IT THE ONLY SONG I LIKE WAS FREEDOM IT WAS A GREAT SONG PAUL COULD HAVE DONE BETTER I DIDN'T LIKE HIS VERSION OF SOMETHING I LIKE GEORGE HARRSION VERSION BETTER!FROM KIRSTEN"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heads up Ringo","review":"To me this disc is marred by Macca's knack for opportunism. Beatles greatest hits packaged in Red white and blue. How timely. I am amazed at how petty Paul is. Reversing the song credits to Mccartney/Lennon is shameful. All you need is love Sir Paul. Oh wait, that was John's. Or was it? I'm sure if he recalls correctly, Paul can take credit for writing George's Something. The one apparent truth seems to be that The Beatles are dying in order of coolness. Heads up Ringo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read my lips: This is about M-O-N-E-Y.","review":"Paul McCartney has made a post-Beatles of pandering to children, but this strategy ceased to work finally with \\"Driving Rain\\", which sold poorly. What to do? Go live and charge the highest prices for rock concerts in history, then milk those concerts further by releasing a live album. (How many live albums does this guy need in his catalog, any way?) In any case, the post-Beatles material is drivel, and the Beatles material is exploitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Concert was Much Better...","review":"I saw a show on Paul's tour this past year and it was really amazing. This album is good, but barely even tries to capture the amazing show that some of us were lucky enough to see. Best songs:Hello, GoodbyeJetAll My LovingLet Me Roll ItWe Can Work It OutHere Today/ SomethingBand on the RunBack in the USSRCan't Buy Me LoveHey JudeI Saw Her Standing ThereThis album features the set-list from the first half of the tour. This means that it contains the songs Mother Nature's Son, Vanilla Sky and C Moon. I was on the second half of the tour so I know that these songs were replaced with Michelle, She's Leaving Home and Let 'Em In."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great band feeling.","review":"I love this cd for the super sounds expressed.The band is extremely in harmony with the McCartney point of view.Tracks are very similar to the original feeling.I prefer the Wings and the McCartney discography that the Beatles discography and anyway this CD contains much Beatles songs than McCartney and Wings.You can't loose \\"Jet\\", \\"Let me roll it\\", \\"Coming up\\" and more.Superlatives!!!!!!!!!Yes maybe the sound mix is not perfect - I'm not competent - but the spirit of the music there is in large quantity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Compilation of McCartney Classics","review":"If you like the whimsical ultra lightweight music of Paul McCartney, this CD is for you. I Saw Her Standing There, Back in the USSR, and Hey Jude are good, but 3 good songs out of 35 isn't even 10%. Nevertheless, I give it 1 star because of Hey Jude, which is a legitimate classic with some depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't you just get enough ??","review":"Although I'm a huge McCartney fan, owning all his Wings and solo works until \\"Flowers\\", I beg to differ from these great reviews. I mean don't you just get fed-up of all these live concert albums digging back the same old catalogue from the Beatles and Wings days ? This album already contains 20 Beatles tracks out of the total 35 !Wings Over America was ok, being historic in itself and contains a lot of great Wings songs. It captured the spirit of Wings in its 70s heydays. Then McCartney decided he was getting old and needs to re-live his young days. That's when I really got irritated ! Unplugged, Tripping, Paul Is Live and this ! Don't we get enough of this ??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deja Vu All Over Again","review":"All the Sir-Paul-ers (who can't refer to McCartney without appending the title), or, for the matter, the Sir-Mick-ers, the Sir-Elton-ers, and the Sir-Bob-ers, should bear in mind that David Bowie TURNED DOWN his knighthood. Let's hope John Lennon would have too (remembering that he returned his O.B.E, Order of the British Empire, medal as a Beatle).That, of course, has nothing to do with the recording in question, but, really, what's the point of reviewing it even? This is the zillionth or so time McCartney has released a live album including these same songs. McCartney zombies will buy anything McCartney releases (and believe anything McCartney says), then come back here and give it five stars.

Now when I got it I may say only one thing: this is THE WORST ALBUM MACCA EVER RELEASED!!!1) The performance is poor - a half of CD1 is solo performance with lots of la-la-las and tu-tu-tus in vocal line (where the hell the band has gone??!!). The songs are not interpreted for the solo singing. Singing is careless as well. The only thing is good - Freedom.2) The praise words in the booklet lie that \\"this is the magical tour and no maybe about being amazed after the show\\". Hey! Come on!!!3) Nothing is new in this \\"album\\" at all - no life (as in \\"Over America\\"), no spirit (as in \\"Tripping\\"), and even no nostalgia (as in \\"Is Live\\"). Here, in our clubs we play much more impressive and powerful.Finally) Long time ago poets and singers were dying - now they are being sold for the money.

April 2011 I finally found this one. It's soooo close to perfect that it pains me to say that I can't recommend it because it doesn't breathe *at all*. It makes me sweat more than I normally would because it doesn't breathe and it leaves me and my clothes wet after even short bicycle rides. If the manufacturer changed the material to one that breathes it would be perfect. But as is, it's very unpleasant.

Reduction is another welcome addition to his solo catalog from the last few years. From sparkling cool atmospheric jazzy stylings to razor sharp funk grooves, this album shows many of Banks' guitar mastery. The songs are more about composition than showboating, like most guitar albums, however there are plenty chops for those who are unaware of Banks' skills. Also, check out his earlier albums Instinct and Self-Contained. My favorite guitarist - and I'm a drummer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A delighful collection of dissenting ideas.","review":"Glenn Gould has occassionally been accused of being different just for the sake of being different.

Reilly describes different herbs, fruits and spices and how they can effect the senses. The scent of vanilla, the warm burn of chiles and ginger really do have a soothing, (and sensual!), effect. In the this book, you'll use the sexy ingredients to create such treats as creamy milkshakes, hot honey nuts and triple gingerbread. If you wanna treat your man to a filling meal, (while possibly wearing stilettos), try spending an evening sharing the task of making Moist Mango Meatloaf!This a great gift that I'm passed on to many friends.

However, as much as I enjoy the erotic in life, I purchased this book for the express purpose of finding some nice recipes, not just for titillating text, and it is sadly lacking in the recipe offerings.

But if his lack of research and misinformation is as bad regarding the missing planes as it is with the ships, the only thing this book is good for is the fireplace. One example: he has the ship Charles M. Price as 'mysteriously disappearing' on Lake Huron in 1913. What he totally neglects to tell the reader is that the Price (which didn't 'disappear'-the hull was found capsized with many of the crew washed ashore) was in what many historians consider to be the worst storm the Great Lakes have ever seen and appears to collected most of his material from one writer, and rather selectively at that. Many of the other ships which he alludes had 'mysterious' disappearances were actually victims of severe storms, which the author usually neglects to mention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Space Opera pure and simple","review":"Several rviewers have written about Green having found his niche, I agree.

As with most all of his other novels, we spend very little time on intro and set-up. By page ten we're on the road heading into our first adventure. Despite having written books with similar themes, \\"A Wagon Train for Brides\\" and \\"Buster Adams and the Ragamuffin Gang,\\" the story remains fresh because 1)the characters are so clearly drawn, and 2) there are plenty of action points and plot twists that are unique to this book - not just dusted off and trotted out to beguile the indiscriminate reader. I've compared Kent Conwell to Louis L'Amour on more than one occasion, and I will continue to do so.

There is a blue LED inside the body which you can't see unless it is powered. I like the cap variations and the size factor. I don't like that much the too long neck strap, I could do with a much shorter one just for my hand. The drive is quite small and smooth so if you have sweaty fingers it is difficult to pull the drive out of the USB port.The reading speed is the promised 12MB/sec but I got only between 4-5MB/sec for writing. It still, however, by far surpasses the minimum needed for the Vista's ReadyBoost, although I haven't tried it. A 730MB file took 2:50 to write and only 1:00 to read.

There are poorly drawn comics throughout the book which have very little to do with the content.I am very disappointed in this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, eye opening episode!","review":"I really liked this episode, because it demonstrated another way of showcasing the wonders of nature in a garden - with humor and a good deal of silliness.

The closed captioning is woefully incomplete with only about half the film closed captioned.

It goes on to compare IMF officials to slave owners and place the blame for all of Jamaica's woes on colonialism and free trade.For example it spends a lot of time bemoaning how cheap imported food hurts local farmers but never stops to consider how cheap food might benefit people in a developing economy.Anyone seeking a better understanding of the world economy, the problems of the IMF or development will get little from this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"zero stars if possible","review":"this movie is slanted and one sided. if you are looking for an education on how the IMF, World Bank or UN do business look else where. clearly the director hates america as she incinuates americans evil many times in the film and actually says we should be ashamed to come to jamaica and spend our money while people their are starving. i think this director needs a reality check and if she hates america so much go and live in france germany or england or any number of socialist countries and see how much more fantastic and utopian it really is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patronizing your audience?","review":"Stephanie Black has some nerve. She wants people to watch her documentary and them proceeds to insult them by chastising them for vacationing in Jamaica? Really? I agree with other negative reviews on this film in that Ms. Black has an agenda and that agenda is making capitalism and colonialism out to look evil when really it appears that socialism contributed heavily to Jamaica's economic downfall. And it's quite silly of Ms. Black to put down tourists who contribute their hard-earned dollars to Jamaica's economy. After all, Jamaica relies heavily on tourist dollars. I've been wanting to see this film for years but when I actually sat down to watch it I couldn't get though the first 15 minutes without feeling that Stephanie was wagging her big-fat-liberal finger at me. So I hit STOP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would you like to help ?","review":"This documentary blames the IMF for Jamaica's poverty, like if Jamaica was not poor before the loans. Like if so many other countries did not benefit from IMF's loans.Since you want to help why don't you invest your life savings in Jamaica and help create some jobs for the poor? The reason why you don't do that says more about why Jamaica is a poor country than any conspiracy theory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye Opening","review":"This documentary shows just how evil the world can be to those in need.

Under the guise of assistance from above for the island to join the world economy, instead what we witness is a systematic deterioration of Jamaican business enterprises while the \\"world\\" takes advantage wherever it can.I must say that previous to viewing this film, I was hardly convinced that the demonstrators at World Bank events weren't ideologues of the type I usually find painful to listen to. Now, I'm not convinced still, but I sure am interested to investigate the veracity of this film's thesis.I much enjoyed the scenes of everyday workers in various enterprises on the island. Their testaments have the ring of truth to them. The montage of the film is well balanced. The overall effect is compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michigan Star Watch","review":"This is a great book .It explains the constellations and where to find them and also has detailed star maps for the different seasons of the year.It has been invaluable in looking at the summer sky with my grandson.It is also filled with information about the history of star gazing and how the constellations were named.

This one is beating them all. Because it's Jagger playing himself: a super-duper cool rock star. Aside from that the movie has countless other great parts that make him a truly great cult film: 1. the very cool gangster story at the beginning of the film (this comes from someone who's no big fan of gangster or mafia movies). 2. the amazing soundtrack (the old vinyl lp is selling sometimes for 500 bucks!). and of course, 3. the hypnotic surreal atmosphere that starts when Chas is entering the world of Turner (Jagger).

Don Cammel was a brilliant, bizarre genius who burned out early, probably because his lifestyle was as jolting as PERFORMANCE.(Look for his bio/documentary and be amazed that his life hasn't been made into a movie.)I've seen it so many times in so many states; it stays remarkable and provoking and superb every time. Actually, in some ways it gets better with multiple viewings.And then there's Jagger. For me, this movie matches his incredible stage presence. I've seen him perform live and listened to his music often, andseen his other movies. Always edgy, always intellectual as well as primal, Jagger in this movie does it all in so many dimensions and degrees.Way ahead of its time, and in some ways ahead of ours, it's a movie that will make you yearn to have been there. In that mansion and in the 60's."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Like My DVD Copy","review":"I think there may be small flaws in sound sync occasionally, but the film is 38 yrs old. I wasn't aware of a voice dubbing issue until I read the reviews. I wonder if some of the confusion might arise from the midnight movie mental state some of the reviewers may have experienced in the early 70's. The picture quality is excellent and the sound is quite good. Just get the DVD, \\"shut your bleedin' 'ol\\", and enjoy the trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Artsy And Ambitious","review":"The first half works as a violent crime movie and then suddenly the main hoodlum plunges into a world of sex, drugs, rock and roll. There is a moment when Mick Jagger suddenly breaks out into a surreal song and dance number that makes you realize how much of his talent was untapped by the limited script. It always has a loose cynical swinging 60's attitude of making everything so energetic and stylized that you don't notice if the story is really \\"going anywhere.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite movie ever.","review":"I bought this to fill out a gap in my collective memory about Rock and Roll bands.

My best friend was Art director for EMI during the Stray Cats era and when he gave me a pre-release of Brians first solo album It was Live Nude Guitars? and I was really impressed with his sound on the album, so different from the Stray Cats formula. \\"Every Tear that Falls\\" is a pop masterpiece with a Byrds ring to it that I play all the time and friends are amazed when I tell them who it is. Bravo Brian!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Make out in Rome","review":"This movie was very boring. And while i understand the Olsens are getting older, they want to do more grown up material. Making out every 2 minutes in the morning is not the way to so it. The plot was unbelievably stupid. Even for an Olsen fan. I think if your a parent and want to get this, Its appropriate for kids maybe under the age of 12 as long as you don't mind them watching a lot of kissing scenes. Any kid older than this will be bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most corny movie I have ever seen in my life","review":"I've seen a lot of movies, both good and bad. This one really bites the dust. The Olsen twins have zero enthusiasm. On the bright side, all the other actors are very enthusiastic, although I have seen better acting in high school plays. I don't think the plot can get any more predictable. If I, your average citizen, wrote a film script it would probably be more interesting than this one. When, you are buying this movie you may think, 'hey at least I'll see some pretty shots of Rome'. Believe me, there were barely any, and for some reason a lot of the scenes where they are traveling around Rome seem to be filmed with a home video camera or maybe purposefully made to look that way (because the director thought it looked 'cool'??), and they are very grainy. I would just skip this movie, its not worth your time, definitely worse than other Olsen twin movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"pass the dramamine!","review":"I've never writen a review before but this \\"movie\\" moved me to act. One star is too good for this pre-teen dribble. My 7 y/o daughter loved this movie but I developed sea sickness. Not only is the story line unbearable but camera bobs side to side, up and down as if the camera man is drunk. Did Mary-Kate and Ashley take artistic control of this movie intending to be modern day Hitchcocks? The fake accents are worse than Kevin Costner's in Robin Hood. Who would admit to writing this..someone who needed the money, has reads the articles in vogue, and graduated from middle school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmmm...","review":"I've definately seen better movies than this one. I mean, the whole plot was, well, totally exciting! I would love to go to Rome, and I think the Olson twins are truly talented! I liked the movie a lot, but like I said, I've seen better movies, such as The Lord Of the Rings: The Two Towers, but this is one of the best MK & A movies yet! By the way, did you ever notice that Leila (or was it Charli?!) never kissed? That's a bonus!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical","review":"Once again,this is quite an unrealistic movie, the typical Olsen twins movie theme is quite apparent- teenage girls galavanting in diffrent locations around the world, hence the title 'When in Rome'. I do believe their list of exiting new places to film their movies must be shrinking, just as my enthusiasm about their movies these days. Its been the same ol same ol for about 5 movies now- the girls travel to some vacation spot and find boys....puh leez...Spare me before they come out with a movie called \\"Make out in Manhatten\\" !! I just could not pay attention watching this one, its defenately not their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for young girls","review":"My daughters (4 and 7) loved this movie. I could not sit through it. The whole premise of the movie is so unrealistic that I couldn't get past the idea that two interns from America are invited to stay the weekend at the company's President's house and it just gets worse from there. Luckily, the Olsen twins aren't singing in this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not bad","review":"you have 2 girls who are interning in italy for a job in fashion. They meet boys, mess up their intership and have fun. This movie feels like something from the 1980's. Very mild and laid back. Nothing fancy or exciting, just mild.

You have to in a world like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I am a BIG Olsen fan and love their movies,but this one-boring. I wached like 15 minutes of it and just turned it off.

My little sister claimed she could have written a better script! Haha. But MK & A are still some of the best role models ever, beautiful, talented, and I am a FAN FOREVER! Let's just hope they can produce more films at the quality of \\"Our Lips Are Sealed.\\" SIDE COMMENT: to w scott keigwin, if you had watched the behind the scenes on the DVD, you would have noticed that the \\"fake accents\\" were actually real!

Beautiful shots of Rome really take you into the Italian feeling. Mary-Kate and Ashley are cute in all there movies, but especially this one. I was waiting forever for them to go to Rome! The actor who played Paulo I am extremely impressed with, because he spoke wonderful English, and reminded me of my Cousin who lives in Rome. The other girls, sadly enough, I could not understand one word of their English (okay, so I exagerate a little) but, in the end, it was a cute movie, so if you get around to it watch it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"When in Rome...Olsen twins","review":"I saw this movie on T.V. one day and thought it was pretty good.

My hair is so long that I go through a bottle of shampoo and a bottle and a half of conditioner every week. I never pick it up, curl it or color it. I tried Dove shampoo and conditioner for two weeks to save a few bucks. It cost $2 cheaper a bottle than my Pantene Pro-V. I loved how Dove made my hair look thick and healthy but after a week of daily use, I developed very bad dandruff. It was like it was snowing from my head when I brushed it and it was obvious when I wore dark tops. Changing the routine to every other day did not stop the dandruff and would just leave my hair feeling greasy and dirty and I can't stand that feeling.

The smell also gives me a headache, so I have to keep my distance from other family members who use it.That said, not everyone in my family has problems with the smell (which is otherwise pleasant).

Throw in a hearse-full of lyrics that God wouldn't like, and you've got the prototypical old-school death metal CD. Very fast. Relentlessly brutal. Morbidly evil. And pretty darn good.Overall, this is a well-written, well-performed, competently produced death metal album. But it's by no means a classic, and if you're a death metal fan you probably already have a CD in your collection that sounds a lot like it.

While I never thought of Grant as a \\"butcher\\", it gave me new insight into his merits as a commander and a person. It brought out a number of things that I had read in other contexts relating to the failings of other civil war generals and highlighted the strengths of Grant in avoiding their problems.It was easy to read and understand. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"unfortunately I agree","review":"Whether Grant is an \\"overlooked military genius\\" is in itself a doubtful premise - however, this book was very disappointing - lacking depth, analysis, insight or the kind of narrative writing that can render even a well known subject interesting. The complexities of the Civil War are great - just the two months of March and April 1864 alone are worth a book in Grant's career. This is just too simplistic of a book to be taken as serious or even enjoyable reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother...","review":"There are several solid biographies of US Grant available (not to mention his own memoirs), this is not one of them. And that is what this book is... Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent maritime mystery.","review":"P.C. Richmond's book GOLD is a great book for all armchair sailors and also for general readers. The locale is the Mediterranean where the author uses local knowledge of the islands and coves along the Italian and Spanish coasts to spin a totally engaging plot. The book is a real page-turner that readers will find exciting right to the last page. The well-drawn characters move the story along using dialog that has just the right pitch for the circumstances and place.

If you have common sense, nothing in this book will be news to you, and not all of the advice is good. The book also fails to treat men as individuals, as the author seems to think that the same tactics will work on all males. Being a male myself, I can assure you that this approach is erroneous. Better communication with your partner will do far more than this silly tome ever could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Juvenile","review":"This book uses a lot of cliches, that I could have wrote myself.

I wouldn't recommend it to anyone I know. There was a lot of fluff and not much do this do that which is what I was looking for. If you've only had a few encounters it may be ok for you.

The tips were either things people should know from common sense, or just outrageous and literally medically dangerous.

It provides a solid overview of VB Express and .Net. Its review of OOP was suprisingly easy to understand and the sample applications that you learn how to build provide a very practical learning experience. The only negative that I can point to are a few minor typos but nothing out of line with most books these days. The bottom line is that this is most understandable programming book I have every read. You won't find an easier read or a better presentation for beginner users."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Book - Many Problems","review":"I really want to like this book. The explainations are good. The projects are nice and game oriented so they keep your attention. However, the book has a large number of mistakes in the text. Especially in the code you need to follow.Also, the author totally misses on showing off Object Oriented Programing. He gives a decent showing of what OOP is, but the project that comes in that chapter lacks the creation of any Classes. I was really liking the explaination of OOP, but you get nearly no experience of it from the project.This book had a lot of potential, but misses."},{"rating":"2","title":"good begining book","review":"this is my second book on visual basic . the first was microsoft's build a program now .

I chose to type them myself and found errors that were actually very challenging to fix but was able to find them . There were a few code errors in the later chapters of the 2005 version book. But over all a very fun and challenging book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very practical guide to T-SQL programming!","review":"This is a very concise and to-the-point book. It assumes that the user has a basic understanding of T-SQL. So, you won't see any repetition from SQL Server Books Online.Authors chose very interesting topics, and backed them up with real life scenarios and practical examples. So, every example makes sense.Book is very easy to read and understand. If you are a beginner T-SQL programmer (or someone coming from a VB or other programming backgrounds), this book helps you get on the right track, as it clearly explains how to think in terms of sets. If you are an intermediate level SQL programmer, you can really use the examples provided in this book and start your journey towards becoming an advanced SQL programmer. For advanced users of SQL, this serves as a great reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Treasure","review":"Read the negative reveiws and bought the book anyway. Still can't figure out what it was that other reviewers found objectionable...This book was helpful to me because it takes the subject of a SQL query much deeper than most of the texts that I have read. It puts emphasis on solving problems using the query language instead of procedural language, and it shows some truly eye-opening examples of what can be done with a simple SELECT statement.The authors are clearly subject experts, and their work is in keeping with O'Reilly's generally high standards for technical references. My only regret is that the book wasn't longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrows heavily from Henderson's Guru's Guide to T-SQL","review":"I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this.

What explanations there are are frequently wrong. I will be returning this for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, just terrible","review":"This book isn't worth the paper its printed on.

They belong alongside live and studio jazz material the likes of Davis and Coltraine. Jazz has always been about interpretation and Skalpel does some razor-fine sampling here that makes your ears listen twice and think to themselves \\"is that real?\\". Well, of course it's REAL in that it was taken from real-world samples. But the way that Skalpel arranges these bits and bytes is something wholly new. I also love that the rhythmic section often goes off meter, which gives it a live-played feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good collection","review":"This is a collection of music ranging from 1969's Lady Coryell through 1980's Return. There are no new or alternate tracks if you have all of his Vanguard material through this time period, so I will deduct one star for that. It is a solid collection for Coryell beginners though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Open Your Mind and Learn from the Best","review":"Often villified because he breaks new ground continually, this book encouraged me to attend one of his seminars. I have to admit I found Mind Mapping difficult until then. After the seminar, with just a little practise, I found the technique is unbeatable. How else can you attend seminars/lectures, and come out with complete notes that cover everything you need. This book gives a broad overview of all his techniques and lets you experiment to find the ones you like. Once you have an overview then get the more specific titles, like Mind Mapping etc.If you are at all interested in improving yourself this book is a must! Be Warned his techniques are not little tricks that can be applied instantly to make a little improvement.

Their arrival sparked a revolution and the overthrow of the Shogunate: SHINSENGUMI: THE SHOGUN'S LAST SAMURAI CORPS is the first English narrative of these events, tracing the internal conflicts within the Japanese world and the rise in murders, assassination and violence as a result. The Shinsengumi were the most dreaded security force Japan had ever known, and their power and effects are followed through one of the most confrontational periods of Japanese history. A 'must' for any student of Japanese history and military culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"For all the Shinsengumi fans","review":"Shinsengumi is one of most popular historical figures in Japan like 47 Ronins.If you are fan of Rurouni Kenshin or Peace Maker, you must read this since this is the only English book about Shinsengumi.I hope someone will translate great Shinsengumi novels like \\"Moeyo Ken\\" \\"Sinsengumi Keppuroku\\" \\"Bakumatsu Shinsengumi\\" etc...someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting","review":"It is very hard to find a book in English about the Shinsengumi.

For example the \\"Shogun\\" are refereed to as \\"Bakufu\\" which is what they are called in Japanese. I always thought that \\"Shogun\\" was a Japanese word, but it is not.I needed a book to reference for my Japanese culture class paper and this book was perfect for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good read for historical buffs","review":"the author makes it clear that this is not the definitive version of everything that happened from this era, rather its his telling of events as he best could gather from the available information left from that period.Having an interest in Japanese history regarding the tokugawa/meiji era (19th/20th century), this book greatly fleshed out my understanding of the events and people from that time.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Japanese History","review":"This was a hard book to get through.

I'm surprised that there are only nine reviews. Lickona uses Kohlberg's moral development structure to lay out some really really helpful ideas for parents. I appreciate the down to earth nature of the discussion as Lickona clearly addresses some of the most common and difficult parenting issues.

Of equal importance: He gets it right!Shirer, in this important book, explains not ony the rise and fall of Nazi Germany, but of Adolf Hitler.

Based upon his own personal experiences and a large number of official German documents captured in the war, he has written _the_ history of the era. It covers the history of the Nazi party from the birth of Hitler, all the way to the bitter and shattering defeat in 1945.The writing is superb and the story he tells is both compelling and horrifying.

As expected, the book is a riveting account of a very dark period of world history, expertly written by William L. Shirer. Unfortunately, due to a printing error, my particular volume did not include pages 837 through 868, 30 critical pages chronicling the beginning of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. I have contacted Amazon and they are going to send a replacement but I only hope the error was caught by the publisher and the replacement does not have the same missing pages.

This book documents each baby step towards totalitarianism. Just at the Black Book of Communism illustrated Marx's Communist Manifesto, Rise and Fall of the Third Reich documents fascism in action. This book is a chilling read. I could not finish the chapter about the human experimentation that was conducted in concentration camps.

No single man is more worthy of the hell he now resides in than Adolf Hitler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anywhere it falls open you'll keep reading, fascinated","review":"A completely absorbing study of the characters and events that shaped the Third Reich.

This book ( since I have read topics in reverse order apparantley) is a great jumping off point to reading other topics on the Nazis, there is no end to the madness. There is a serious lesson to be learned from the Nazis and the events found in this book and applies to events today; Appeasement never works or accomplishes anything but destruction...eventually. For evil to flourish, requires good men to do nothing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This bestselling classic book by a foreign correspondent and historian is fantastic. It describes in great detail the situation leading up to Hitler's assumption of power and how he and his cronies took power and led Germany to commit some of the most despicable atrocities ever.

Every stage in the history of Germany during the mid twentieth century is explored in fantastic depth. The Kindle edition however appears to have never been edited. Typographical errors occur frequently enough to distract from the text. There are also numerous footnotes that are not active, or lniked to other citations making them inaccessible. It is a shame that this was offered in such a condition, it has made me far less likely to purchase Kindle editions of older works."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Huge Undertaking, But Worth It!","review":"This is a masterpiece, hands down. It took me a few months to read it, but I wanted to take my time to get something out of reading a book of this length and breadth. It was worth the effort. This is the best overall account yet that I have read about the Third Reich - it's a must have for any serious World War II buff of the European Theater.If you are really intent on learning a great deal from reading the book, take notes, especially of all the names and abbreviations; it can be a bit hard to follow at times.A true masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"For historians AND novices","review":"I have to say that I was never a fan of historical accounts but I found Shirer's history of Nazi Germany remarkable. If you are a historian and an expert in the field, this book will meet your expectations (the primary resources are most impressive) but if this is the first time you read something that is non-fiction, the author's style is not too oppresive as he presents the incredible events that transpired during World War II. The miracle at Dunkirk, the flight of Rudolph Hess, the rescue of Mussolini... if you don't know what I'm talking about, yet you're reading this review, you owe it to yourself to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third Reich revealed","review":"While I have not quite finished this book, I highly recommend it to anyone interested in history in general and the Second World War in particular. The author was personally present during that time and witnessed many of the events first hand. It is a very long book, but well written, covering in detail the period from the end of WW I through the end of WW II. It has given me vastly greater insight into the period and the events surrounding the entire Nazi movement. Most fascinating are the intimate portraits of the major characters in Germany as well as those from Britain and France."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.","review":"An excellent insider's documentation and review of Hitler's Germany.

It behoves us all to diligently guard against a repeat of that eventual worldwide disaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rise and fall of Third Reich","review":"William Shirer did a masterful job in this book of revealing how Adolph Hitler led the German people into this chaotic mindset of his. Most of his communication to the German people was lies and misrepresentation of what he had in his warped mind for Germany. Once it got started it traveled through out the country like a virus to a populace that had been put down since the end of the first World War; that was looking for something, anything to bring back a proud people to their previous position in the world order. Shirer knew first hand what transpired since he was a War Correspondent (American) that lived in Germany in the 30\`s as the Nazis were coming to power, and on into the war in the 40\`s. Wonderful book, ranks in the top three books I have ever read.Robert L. Hayes"},{"rating":"2","title":"The classic text","review":"This book is deservedly a classic. It is reporting, not scholarly analysis, but Shirer was there and reports what he saw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely well-written for a history book","review":"Most history books tend to be very dry, spending much of the time listing names and dates and very thin on context & motivations... this book is the complete opposite of that! I especially like how the author spreads blame around judiciously and evenly. That he lived through this history gives Shirer the opportunity to draw on real insights and impressions of people and he takes advantage of this opportunity early and often. This will easily remain my most favorite history book for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rise & Fall of the Third Reich","review":"Enjoyed reading the book. Hard to fathom that an eccentric individual can influence a country and attempt to rule the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"RISE AND FALL is a masterpiece","review":"William Schirer's exhaustive chronicle of Nazism rarely strays from the evil cabal of men who created, imposed and perished under it. Hitler, Goebells, Goering, Himmler, Papen, and countless others are described in great detail. Schirer relies on his personal recollections when he lived in Nazi Germany along with captured Nazi archives he sifted through after World War II to tell his story. His personal biases for democracy, individual freedom, and equality are clear throughout the book (especially when recounting the horrors of the Holocaust) and he does not apologize for them.RISE and FALL reminds us to stand guard against people who would take away democracy, individual freedom and equality if given the opportunity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly excellent.","review":"I have to admit that this book is probably the best (and most truthful) book I've read on World War 2.Even though I like the World War 2 parts, the thing that interested me the most was Hitler's rise to complete power.Anyone who wants to read about World War 2 must read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Exceptional Read and Far More Entertaining Than Anticipated!","review":"The previous reviews say what needs to be said. Amazingly, this work has been and is being read by many family members and friends of all ages and who have varying interests and backgrounds. A twenty something female family member is reading it for the second time! Very well researched and well crafted. I learned a great deal and am still ruminating over much of it. This remains one of the most compelling and interesting books I have ever read. It sucked me in and I could just not stop. An essential read for all."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not realize version did not include maps, photographs etc.","review":"I did not realize the version of the book I purchased did not include maps and images but was just plain text."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Short Histories of the Third Reich","review":"For anyone eager to gain a fairly comprehensive understanding of the development, growth, decline, and collapse of the Third Reich, this book is it. With Shirer, you have someone who was a witness to many of the events described in this book - e.g. the Nazi Party rallies at Nuremberg, Hitler's marching of troops into the Rhineland in 1936, the incorporation of Austria into the German Reich in March 1938, the Munich crisis, and the French surrender in June 1940.Shirer also makes skillful use of the wealth of Nazi archival materials to give the reader a full scope of the characters and policies which defined and shaped Germany between 1933 and 1945.In today's uncertain times, reading this book should also serve to remind the reader that any democratic government, whether threatened by real or perceived enemies, can succumb to Fascism if its people permit the slow or precipitate undoing, by executive or legislative fiat, of their civil liberties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent book, needs a copy editor","review":"As many others have said, the book is excellent, but the copy editing is terrible.Far too many typos, and the footnote system is abysmal.Hopefully, they will update a corrected copy, with footnotes inserted into the text body.If they do, I will update my star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"The five stars is for the book and not the kindle edition","review":"This was loaned to me by a friend, so I can't say that I paid for it, but if I had I would be upset. I read this for a class in high school and was blown away by the detail and yet how intimate it was. This is one of the best histories ever done in my book.The transfer rates as one of the worst, however. Wrong words (see other reviews to get a better understanding of what this means), choppy chapters, and the like. This begs for someone to come along a proof read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Education in History","review":"I am a detail person, and so this book really hit the spot for me.I would listen on a hike, I would listen on a bike.I could listen in my car, I could listen in a bar.OK, I never actually listened in a bar, but I did listen pretty much anywhere and everywhere because of how much this book kept my attention, despite being over 50 hours long. The only drawback to this book is that my audible credits built up for a couple of months while I listened. William Shirer combines amazing depths of study and research with his personal knowledge and eyewitness accounts to make sense of the Third Reich and give understanding to the dynamics of it's rise and fall.Despite it's length, this book is extremely well organized and easy to follow, while at the same time the true story of Nazi Germany is woven in a way that maintains your interest from beginning to end. I have never been a history buff, but since reading this book, I am ready to learn more."},{"rating":"1","title":"The German Resistance to Hitler is woefully mischaracterized","review":"The characterization of the German Resistance to Hitler in Shirer's book is embarrassingly uninformed, sticking to the myth that it was little more than a military plot devised by ambitious officers who simply objected to Hitler's military strategy.Anyone interested in the true story and/or in the non-military participants in the Resistance -- completely ignored by Shirer and other Anglo-American historians -- should read Peter Hoffmann's \\"The History of the German Resistance, 1933-1945.\\"[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated, Boring, Unintentionally Funny.","review":"I picked this up used after the German film \\"Downfall\\" reawakened a long-dormant fascination with the freakshow that was National Socialist Germany. I was disappointed. Shirer's prose is inelegant and heavy-handed. After about 300 pages, I gave up. But not before reaching this amusing nugget: \\"Many of the [S.A.'s] top leaders, beginning with its chief, [Ernst] Roehm, were notorious homosexual perverts. Lietenant Edmund Heines, who led the Munich S.A., was not only a homosexual but a covicted muderer. These two and dozens of others quarreled and fueded as only men of unnatural sexual inclinations, with their peculiar jealousies, can.\\" Good luck getting something like that published in 2005."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reading for those who despise dictatorships.","review":"Having read and re-read this book, I often wonder how it is possible that Germany was let off the hook so easily despite the incredible moral and physical damage which it inflicted upon human civilization. Shirer makes it abundantly clear to all that this sorry history should never, ever be forgotten, nor repeated. This book is about why so many Americans died in Europe at that time, and why Americans should feel the values behind our constitution, our democracy and our ideals of social justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rise of Shirer.","review":"Being a WW2 buff, I have many, many books on Hitler, the Naziesand the Third Reich. This book stands head and shoulders above them all. The best all-covering book on these topics. A must!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Monumental Book","review":"This book is a piece of art. It is written masterly and interestingly. Shirer dips into every fact that he knew and expands on it. It recounts every bit of information from the childhood to the death of the infamous Adolf Hitler. I am 14 years old, and I loved to book so adults should love it even more. I would also suggest Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler to learn about Hitler's logic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST book for an overall view of the Third Reich","review":"Please IGNORE all of the 1 and 2 star reviews here. I have read them and they are completely inaccurate! This book is well worth the read. It flows smoothly and effortlessly while keeping your attention. It is difficult to put down! The author lived and worked in Germany during WWII and saw Hitler speak on many occasions. Therefore, the author was intimately familiar with what he writes about. BUY it and ENJOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT READING","review":"William Shirer is the \\"poster-boy\\" for his age of reporting. He delivers hard facts and keeps the atmosphere of the time period in perspective. That's what makes his book \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,\\" a page turner. Eventhough some Germans have described Shirer's book as being one-sided, he allows us to view the world through his journalistic ventures into Nazi Germany and to political strategy in Churchill's England."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Good After ???? Years","review":"I bought this book when it first was published, because Shirer was a highly regarded journalist/expert on Germany before and during WWII. I had such a high opinion of the book after reading it then that I bought it in the Kindle version when I saw it on the Amazon list. My Kindle says it was published in 2011, but I first read it in the 1950's or 60's. It was a thick, heavy book but easy to read and very factual.This book gives the best description I have seen of the development of Hitler's mind and the formation of his twisted ideas and the ingredients of his rise to power. It removes him from a slightly comic--and very deadly--tyrant to an almost inevitable product of the period between the wars. This book will not tell you everything about WWII, but, in my opinion, you cannot fully understand the war without reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!!","review":"Some what terse in details near the end of the book. specifically regarding the russian armies in approaching Berlin. On another note some detail lacking on the Italy campaign and German army in the budapest sector."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could Not Put It Down","review":"I think the highest praise you can give a book is stating that you had a hard time putting it down. That's certainly the case here. Shirer puts you at the scene of some of the most secretive and important meetings between Hitler and his staff, and between Hitler and the leaders of other countries. You get a chance to experience the mind of Hitler, how he operated, and how he treated others. This is possibly my new favorite book. I spent many late nights reading this book and lost sleep because I simply couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book","review":"I first off want to say this book is amazing in terms of its sheer volume of knowledge. It is just packed with information. Despite its length it is not a dull book at all in my opinion.The only problem I have with this book is it seems to portray the classic stereotype of the soviets having essentially unlimited manpower from the empire to draw from. I don't think it really gives the germans enough credit for how close they really were to beating the soviets. The author can be a little anti german in his views(can u blame him?) and somewhat overestimate the soviets power.Other than that this was a great book. Highly recommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"This book is journalistically interesting, and that describes both its strengths and its weaknesses. This is not history - it is journalism. There's a difference. Shirer was a journalist and this book is a compendium of his impressions while working in Berlin during the 1930s. Like much journalism, it manages to be entertaining, but is essentially shallow. For depth, I would suggest Hitler's 30 Days to Power by Henry Ashby Turner, or Hubris, by Ian Kershaw. For the casual reader, this may be sufficient, but it is a light read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Shirer was obviously not immune to propaganda.","review":"A definitively balanced account of WWII in Europe has not yet been written. Are we to believe that all Germans of this era were sociopaths, or that 6,000 Jews were gassed daily at Auschwitz, requiring over 340 tons of human remains to be cremated and disposed of per day? As you read this book keep in mind that the evidence and motivations on all sides are just beginning to crystalize in the historical record. Many aspects of this epic history were not ready to be accurately told at its 1959 publishing, as Mr. Shirer appears to have been content to let the propagandists fill-in many of the blanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must read for all boys and girls","review":"a must read, seriously, if you have eyes, a brain, and a heart, jewish or not, veteran or not, current member of the armed forces or not. this is a must read for everyone"},{"rating":"2","title":"Making WWII readable","review":"Written in a nice narrative format, this book is big but easy to read with nice back ground for all the events. The only negative would be its a bit heavy on the Nazi hate. Yes, yes, the Nazis were way bad, it just starts to get a bit heavy so that it can distract from the history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent in-depth history","review":"This in-depth, well-written and meticulously researched work remains the benchmark on this topic. Shirer was an eyewitness to many of the events he described. One of the things I liked about this history is how Shirer spent time examining the political and diplomatic events, along with success and foibles, on both sides.You would have a very difficult time finding a better researched and written book that examines in detail one of the most horrific periods in the world. I can't recommend this book enough. Definitely a must read not only for fans of history but for everyone so that these events will never be repeated in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great history book.","review":"A Classic book.

A very important reminder of a very dark the human evel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely educational","review":"William L. Shirer's novel is so well written that I cannot put it into the right words. I want to say that it felt like I was there, his descriptions of people and places were very, very heavy. That is the least of my concerns because this is a novel that goes so much farther into the history of Nazi Germany than perhaps any other I have ever read.Shirer's book starts with exhaustive research that takes you into the childhood of Adolf Hitler. While known the world over as a monster, it was still important for me to see what this man's days were like before his deadly actions. Srategies, Socialism, tactics, politics, betrayal and so many other things are brought out and although some historical figureheads better versed on the subject than me may know some of this, I found a lot of it to be somewhat of a lost history that tends to take a back seat to WWII in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Blast From The Past","review":"I think this should be recommended reading in secondary education.

Seller told me good luck on my shopping and made no offer to find or replace with correct edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"No excuse for poor editing by publisher","review":"This is a marvelous portrayal of an \\"evil empire\\" and its rise and fall. The author is clearly influenced by his participation as a witness to many of the events he portrays, and he captures them in moving detail.The serious flaw in this book is the extremely poor editing by the publisher. It is replete with typographical and other errors for which there is no excuse. This book is a classic and deserves better presentation for readability. I bought the e-book version because the library copy was so heavy that I couldn't carry it around or hold it for reading. The convenience of the electronic version clearly was a factor in my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Must Read? Try thirty years ago","review":"It is a very sad thing to see that this ancient, very shalow and badly researched book of Shirer is still considered by many as a source of reliable information about the Third Reich and Nazi Germany. It tells mainly about the level of knowledge about the subject at hand of the people who think that. Shirer's book has but one thing to its credit: it's very well written. A long, charming, feather-weight journalistic report. As a boy, I have read it with fascination. It's a marvelous thing to read when you're 11 years old. It's like the light classical music records you hear when you make your first steps into hearing classical music. But things change and people grow up and just like listening to Peter and the Wolf or the Toy Symphony so with the Rise and Fall. Past a certain age and level of knowledge it is pathetic to consider it a worthy reading material. The book is simply childish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless you have no life, do not read this book.","review":"i was made to read this book for a class i am taking and it was torture. i didn't understand a word of it, it was way too long, and just plain not enjoyable. unless you are a nazi enthusiast i do not recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and boring.","review":"Although this book may be a classic it is not at all high school reading. It is required reading for my Honors World History class and many honors students are failing to understand this book and are in turn failing the class.

I think it would be better written if he got to the point and didnt beat around the bush."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle version recommended","review":"Despite the \\"flaws\\" noted by others, I find the Kindle version a highly valued resource.

The book is HUGE, with more than one thousand pages (!), but it is no boring at all. It is very complete, covering all the facts from the years before the WWII start, until some years after its ending. It puts you in each important fact place and time, explaining the real situation that leads to each movement. The chapters are well splited, that means you won't loose the main idea, eve if you read a chapter per month (for example). It is very reach in details, tolding even about the personal life aspects of each main piece who somehow had an important impact on the greatest war ever. The author did a exemplary research and every information is based on historical researches, on wich he indicates mostly the sources of it. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Valkyrie","review":"The research that pulled this book together was presented in a concise chronological sequence that many things I did not understand about Hitler's Germany now make sense.Even the movie Valkyrie and the chapters about Valkyrie in the book coincided. The book was more in depth. When I hit this part of the book I could not put it down until the end.Another movie that readers of this book might find interesting is titled \\"Downfall.\\" It is a German movie with English subtitles that shows the last few days of Hitler in The Bunker. Here again the movie and the book both coincide and it is dramatic.Hitler was a \\"nut\\" with a force of conviction that held the whole house of cards together by sheer willpower."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"read this book when it was first published.

I highly recommend it to any student of WWII history!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Illuminating","review":"This book gives an insightful view of the history of Adolf Hitler's rise to power and subsequent fall, and how the German nation allowed him to drag them under.

Although reading past this book would be a great investment in time and energy - one should at least start here (regarding a real study of history). The history channel can only go so far in presenting facts about Hitler and the Nazis, however; the devil is in the details, and Shirer's book is full of them. If one weren't to read this book and merely gather information of the subject from television, then that person would have to be considered ignorant on the subject.

This book is great from the first page to the last. I didn't have much knowledge of the Third Reich before reading this book but this book easily changed that. No, it doesn't go in depth into the war but this book ISN'T based soley on the war, but on the Third Reich itself! The last 300 pages or so are incredible, mainly when it talks about the final attempt to kill Hitler and what happens to the plotters afterwards when the attempt fails!

I have heard that story so many times that I'm pretty tired of it, so I didn't like that much. It also has a couple of short parts(a couple of minutes each) from Shania interviews from Australia, which is nice if you like Shania, but the interviews aren't that special. You also get a small book about Shania. It has her lifestory AGAIN and some pictures of her. Most of the pictures are from when she performed at FanFair for the first time and from different award ceremonies. I don't think that the pictures have been published before, but that's probably because they aren't very good. And there has been a lot of other pictures from these events that have been published, so I wouldn't buy this just for the pictures. Overall I think that this is okay if you're a big fan, but nothing to get that exited about"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impactful - important for all!","review":"Wonderful DVD that focuses on something so central to our existence and quality of life.

It's educational (amazing how much I didn't realize about something so elemental as breathing), and it's a great reminder that we all possess this ability, this inherent tool, when harnessed properly, that can be so impactful to our relationships and the way we live with one another.

The battery life was terrible and plugging it into the wall caused a screeching sound that made dogs within a 10 block radius howl.In short, not even worth the time it took me to write this review."},{"rating":"2","title":"no complaints","review":"we own the previous sounds 'n lights dual receiver model, and bought this for use with our second baby. not sure why there are so many negative reviews. we are very happy with this product (again). one thing i was not sure of prior to purchase was if it would be possible to use these new monitors at the same time as our old ones, since we now have two children to monitor in different rooms. it has worked out with no problem with one set on channel A, and the other set on channel B.as for the \\"interference\\" that other reviewers have mentioned, i have noticed it if, for example, you are charging your cell phone on an adjacent outlet. the thing also will go haywire if you have the receivers on without the monitor turned on or if you happen to not have everything set to the same channel (A or B). but if set up properly, and without too much going on in nearby outlets, you should find this set to be perfectly reliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"This monitor has so much static - it's awful. I can also hear my neighbor's telephone conversations as well as another baby. The Graco monitors are much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for 2 months","review":"Then stopped working. First one of the receivers stopped getting any sound, thought it was since we left it on all the time but then the other one did the same thing. Lights still work but are no use at all. Waste of money, will look for another one now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy","review":"The unit fails on two levels: Form and Function.In the form category, the base station is fine. It can easily be hidden in the nursery. The handheld units, however are bulky, uncomfortable to wear (via belt-clip) and generally unattractive in any environment. Maybe if your home is decorated in 1950s space kitsch they might work.The functionality of the unit is crippled by having only two wireless channels. In our home, both channels pick up radio stations (Spanish, talk, sports) - multiple ones at that - so hearing the baby over the din of noise is almost impossible. The light indicator is also useless, as it registers 100% on even the quietest baby noises."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT IS IMPORTANT TO READ REVIEWS","review":"I wish that I had read the reviews for this monitor prior to buying it. I bought this monitor because it had 2 receivers and was within my price range. When my children are sleeping (a 1 1/12 year old and a 2 month old) the monitor is keeping me awake with horribly loud static(can be heard several rooms away). The static is so loud it has even woken my 2 month old up on a number of occasions. I did not keep the box because it worked fine the first week or two so I am now stuck with it and have to buy a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Pros - 2 receivers, the lights are easy to see across the roomCons - Constant interference, usually bad enough to disturb an exhausted parent's precious few hours of sleep. Batteries never last long. After about a year, both monitors developed shorts and would randomly switch off so that exhausted parents are finally woken by a child's wails from down the hall - NOT the sounds and lights.I don't know why I endured this piece of crap for 20 months. Now that it's finally dead, I'm going to buy something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Spend the extra $$$, you will anyhow after you use this for a while. It started out with a little static and got louder, and louder and even picks up local RADIO, ughhh. Stick with Graco, our Graco works like a charm with no static at all, even with both monitors on, there is never any static on that one. The Fisher-Price model is JUNK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This monitor is garbage. It's been in use for less than 1 month and one of the monitors lost its sound. I would give it minus 5 stars. I purchased it because of the Fisher price name and reputation. I will no longer consider Fisher-Price products. I think that this product is so bad that Amazon should not be selling it. Since it failed more than 30 days after purchase the customer must absorb the loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"I have NEVER written a review on Amazon, despite the fact that I will read reviews prior to making a purchase. To our suprise, we had our 3rd child 5 years after our 1st, so we needed to repurchase everything. Sadly, my wife bought this monitor (name brand - it must be good). However, it was terrible. I actually bought a new one (Graco - that is great) and tossed this one in the garbage...Save your money, buy another brand. I feel generous giving this 1 star, I would do negative stars or no stars if possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good choice","review":"We purchased this thinking the Fisher-Price name would mean it was a good product. It worked ok for the first couple of months, but then suddenly the static got really loud to the point we had to turn it all the way up to hear my daughter crying. The static was very loud, there were often loud clicks, and our cell phones and wireless internet seemed to constantly cause loud beeping.We just purchased a Graco iMonitor and couldn't be happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre","review":"I have tried many of the recipies from this book. I find they often do not turn out well even if the instructions are followed to the letter. Also, the instructions are short and often leave essential steps out. However, the section on rice bran pickles is very good and may make the book worth purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anything But Typical","review":"If you are aware of Qwel's abstract lyrical flow then you should expect an album as creative as this one. If you are not then you are in for a big surprise. Qwel's second effort has once again captured the senses and proved that this emcee can touch on any kind of subject matter and still sound exceptionally good.Tracks that stand out are Host which is as good as anything you could expect from Qwel, Dan Rather, Sundial and the title track, The Rubber Duckie Experiment. Another obvious standout is Pinnochio Syndrome. This song sounds like something you would expect on a Typical Cats album but Qwel manages to work the beat well as he flows effortlessly throughout the entire track.Once again, Qwel has solidified himself as a great artist. This is an album you shouldn't miss, and if you haven't picked up Qwel's debut album, be sure to pick up that as well...."},{"rating":"2","title":"VCI RELEASE!!!!!","review":"Very pleased with this release from VCI. A very good print makes for enjoyable viewing. It should be noted that this is a re-issue. The original film production company's name has been removed and the re-issuer's name is on the end title.

Horrible setup, no menus, DVD tracks start in the MIDDLE of songs, audio quality is awful. It's like they couldn't be bothered to record the audio from the FOH or from a mixer. It almost sounds like a crappy old school bootleg. They should be ashamed for releasing this POS as a finished product.I've seen better produced videos from amateurs on youtube."},{"rating":"2","title":"French intrumental trad, infectious rhythms and melodies","review":"Bouffard's trio -- hurdy gurdy, French bagpipes, button accordion -- gives us the classic French Big Noise, but with an energy and urgency that I've never before heard. This type of music (French Country Dance? Massif Central? Auvergne? I'm not sure what it's called!) is hard to find in the USA so I don't have a huge amount to compare it to, but I can't keep it off of my CD player. I listen again and again and I want more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blatent Pro-Communist Propaganda","review":"This WWII era film is about the most fraudulent picture of Stalin's Russia to ever come out of Hollywood. When you consider the volume of negative information that has come out of the former Soviet Union, this picture is surrealistic in it's bucolic picture of Soviet life on the verge of WWII. In point of fact, the peasants in the Ukraine welcomed the German Army with flowers. They had been so brutalized by Stalin that they actually thought (for about five minutes) that they were being liberated. Then the Germans turned out to be as brutal as the Bolshevics. It is hard to believe that the Cold War began just three years after this film was made. If you see it or buy it, view it as a double feature with \\"Enemy at the Gates\\", a recently made film that is extremely close to the truth. No wonder McCarthy investigated Hollywood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need to be married with children..........","review":"Good if you are married with children I would guess.

We are very pleased with the Semi-Flush mount in our kitchen; it casts a warm glow over the dinner table."},{"rating":"1","title":"The online book review was very misleading.","review":"This book is not so much about ASP as it is about Visual Interdev. The book comes with a CD that contains a trial copy of Visual Interdev that drops dead after 90 days. Rather than teaching ASP, the author shows how to construct Active Server Pages using Visual Interdev. He does show and discuss screen shots of the ASP that is created. The screen shots however are displayed in a faint blue text that is hard to read. This could be a helpful book for anyone who intends to create Active Server Pages in Visual Interdev, everyone else would be better served by purchasing something like \\"Beginning ASP Databases\\" by John Kauffman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Do It!","review":"This was the first ASP book that I got, and it was pretty much a waste of money. It's not writting well and there's many pages with print screens showing you how to install things like InterDev............Does the author really think we cannot install software?????The reason I gave it 2 stars is there was a couple of times I was stuck on some VBS syntax and this book had what I needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD-Rom problems","review":"Ooops, slight CD-Rom problem with this one. I was unable to install it. On their web-site, Prima-Tech state that \\"some file seem to have disappeared at the duplicator's\\". They offer a ZIP-file to correct the problem, to be downloaded at one's convenience. Well, make sure you've got plenty of time - it's 27 Megs....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concise and to the point","review":"This book is definitely targeting people with some basic knowledge of VB or VBScript, however I found it refreshing that it really concentrates on the essentials of using ASP, unlike many ASP books that are full of information you rarely, if ever, need. This book aims to get you up and running with ASP quickly and I believe it does just that. If you don't want to wade your way through mounds of unnecessary information this is the book for you. I've been programming in ASP for a few years now and I still learned some useful information from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's a cat!","review":"I think the birds, squirrels, fish, etc. are cute. Unfortunately they do not keep my cat's attention long enough for the scenes to loop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly useful","review":"When I first got this DVD, I felt a little cheated. Poor quality video, same loop of bird songs, not enough content, etc. But then I remembered I didn't buy it for me...My cat loved this DVD. (He has since gotten over it, but will watch it sometimes.) He bats at the television, looks for the fish behind, and is generally amused. A good buy if you're worried your cat may get lonely or bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad copy of video","review":"The video keeps freezing up in spots. Bad quality DVD. Would not recommend buying this because of this issue. Going to buy the cat sitter dvd to replace this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i was expecting","review":"I ordered this item hoping that it would occupy the attention of my cats at least temporarily. Sadly, my cats expressed around 5 minutes of interest in the packaging for this DVD, which they batted around and bit a few times, and absolutely no interest in the DVD itself.I gave this product a 2 star rating not because of it's appeal to my cats but, because it does have a certain zen like quality that I enjoy listening to when reading.Please note that the opinion I express here is relative only to my experiences. Clearly there are a lot of people here who have had a lot of positive experience with this product and if you should choose to order it, I hope your cats love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"cat uninterested after 60 seconds","review":"Sound track is bogus - doesn't match images and loops over and over.

The entire looping track of all the animals is the same annoying bird chirp throughout. No sounds of mice, bugs, or fish anywhere. You end up muting the DVD while it's playing and the cats got tired of the short repeated scenes within 1/2 hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfactory","review":"Far from purfect.This video is boring from start to finish. It's not geared to me and even I was insulted by the poor, unrealistic editing. Birds chirp during underwater fish scenes, a repetitive soundtrack which lacks imagination plays throughout the video, regardless of what is displayed on screen.My cat showed no interest in the video and with no surprise.This video appears to have been produced by an amateur who recently bought a video camera and decided to film random scenes about their neighborhood. A short, repetitive and annoying soundtrack is dubbed over the entire length of the video which shows no coordination with the visual display whatsoever.No purrfection here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chirping Birds Will Drive You Crazy","review":"Exxon was interested in this video for about 10 minutes, batted at things on the screen. Texaco watched from the sofa looking totally bored. I do not know why there had to be chirping birds throughout the entire video.

I will be ordering another for Christmas!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Not the greatest DVD\\"","review":"I bought this DVD along with 2 others, and this one I hardly ever put on for my cats. They feature birds, squirrel, and other animals, but there is no real sound from them. Then there is an option if you want to play soothing music along with it. But then it is still missing the nature sounds. The sounds don't match the real sounds the animals are making at the time. Seems fake, and it is all repeats of itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not eventful enough","review":"The whole story is about a plot to seduce a married man and woman. I found it to be minimally entertaining. The cinematography was poor in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"I have several of these throughout my house and love the look but they are terribly made. This one in particular, the 3-way 600-watt push button dimmer, I've had break on me three times! It's expensive to begin with but once you toss in replacing it three times and paying for an electrician to install it becomes prohibitive. I'm on my last one before I switch to Lutrons, which never seem to break. The part that breaks for me is the push button which just stops operating (maybe a spring breaks?). Though I do have one 300-watt where the dimmer part broke and the on/off still works. Very disappointing. And yes, they're all the same manufacturer -- you can tell if you look closely and see the \\"CA\\" for Classic Accents on these switches pretty much anywhere they're sold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Return of the Funk Soul Sisters","review":"I bought this because I love love LOVE Return of the Funk Soul Sisters. What a mistake.Whereas the Return of the Funk Soul Sisters is full of upbeat, fast tempo FUNK FUNK FUNKY grooves, this is full of slow, soul-less yawners and horrid disco.There are two good tracks, no great tracks and the rest is forgettable garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising start, beginner's ending","review":"A quick scan of the review indicates that there are two main camps here - those who find the ending edgy and those who see it as vandalism, as pointless as painting a mustache on the Mona Lisa. I have to agree with the vandalism people. If the author had foreshadowed it, I would not have cared for the effect, but it would have been acceptable. However, sprung jack-in-the-box-like as it was, one can only wonder what the author's point was.\\"Life is senseless, so books can be, too\\"?\\"Junkies are junkies and no matter how much they seem to have changed, they are really still cold, self-centered jerks and shame on you for being fooled by them\\"?\\"It's my book, I owe the reader nothing, and I can do what I want\\"?I really don't know nor do I, at this point, care. And it's too bad, too, because the author has the potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am going to read this again!","review":"I'm not a big reader of fantasy so when I say this book is unique, perhaps it's more just unique to me. I read Singer of Souls several years ago but it is one of those books that sticks with you. Besides unique the story is haunting and lately it was haunting me to read again. I don't read books more than once often. But of course I couldn't remember the title or author. After about an hour of searching google with terms the combo of busking, faeries and festival found the book and now that I found it I'm going to go read it again. I also noticed that a sequel has come out since Steward of Songs- BONUS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nine-tenths of this book is gold","review":"There are a lot of well thought out and explained reviews already, so I am not going to elaborate very much. I agree with most of the reviewers regarding Stemple's engaging and authentic voice. I think he has tremendous potential as an author. I similarly agree that the ending was botched. Where I disagree with many reviewers is that the book's failure at the end deserved an overall rating of one or two stars. I do still recommend this book to any lovers of dark fantasy. You can put it down as the plot begins spiraling toward oblivion and it will have been worth the read. Stemple's engaging voice is rare enough that he's worth a few hours of your time to just enjoy his prose and the promising plot that he's laid out, even if he doesn't fully deliver in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good story deteriorates into a splatter film","review":"Adam Stemple has the makings of a good writer. He has a fertile imagination and a quirky sense of humor. His descriptions of people, places and events have a feeling of authenticity. At times he's capable of working some real magic with language. However, like many fledgling writers, he has trouble distinuishing the voices of his muse and his inner demons. As the story progresses, the demons get the upper hand, and a novel that begins as a charming mystery degenerates into a neausating bloodletting. Mr. Stemple seems to have chosen the worst possible ending for this unfortunate book, resolving all conflict with an ugly adolescent power fantasy.Adam, you can do better than this. Don't let your demons write the ending of your next book. Let them have their say, then put their pages through the shredder and give your muse some breathing room."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a work of good scholarship","review":"Being that this was written by a PHD, I was expecting thoughtful and well-reasoned arguments to respond to. However, this pamphlet appears to simply re-iterate much of the common stock arguments proposed by most critics. There is nothing new to address here which has not already been answered elsewhere [...]. Furthermore, this pamphlet is without references or footnotes, so it does not give the impression of a scholarly work. Instead, the author tends to provide extended monologues on his own opinions and insights--in the end without proving much of anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for the price, but missing a team","review":"this was a great product- especially for the price, and it goes great with our son's room. unfortunately, it was missing one team- and had 2 of another teams pennant. we e-mailed the vendor for a replacement, but we never heard back."},{"rating":"1","title":"NUNCA RECIBÍ EL PAQUETE","review":"nunca recibí el paquete, lo espere desde hace mas de un mes y nunca llego a mi dirección de casillero."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great First Bible","review":"The illustrations and length of each story make this just a great kids Bible.

I purchased this for my daughter whom is learning to read. I look at several different bibles for children and was not satisfied with the quality (biblical accuracy) of the stories and the amount of the stories within a given bible. I managed to find a used version of this from when I was a child and am completely happy. You have to be careful however because the company that produced this bible produced a newer version with the same title by a different author that just falls short with its stories and detail.

If it has had it's charm, it's been lost somewhere in these past decades. The plot is shallow and there is no real action (apart from a couple of man-to-man fights which hardly qualifies). The story is full of unused people (calling them characters whould be to much praise) who don't have a real purpose being there. And there are a lot of 'accidental' occurences just when they come in handy (f.i. as a last rescue, or to warn the hero) For as far as there is a plot it lacks cohesion, speed, and direction.As for the possitive side: Zelazny probably should enter history as the first to mention self-darkening sunglasses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obscure Story","review":"I didn't like this book very much.

The hero is Conrad Nominkos--or so he likes to be called. He's a man with a mysterious past that one has to piece together as the book goes along. He is also very symbolic and metaphorical, something that you don't see done often, or well, in scifi/fantasy. Half saint, half destoryer, this immortal is the narrator of a tale of a time when Earth is in dire need... though the \\"alien invaders\\" of this novel, the Vegans, come with checkbooks, not guns. My only complaint with this novel is that the other characters aren't as fully developed as Conrad. If this book is never made into a movie, I'll right the bloody screen play myself!

Earth's remaining human population lives mostly on islands, as the larger land masses are still too radioactive to live on. This is certainly a promising premise for a science fiction novel, but I really was not able to get into this one. I could not identify well with the characters, and the plot seemed to meander from one point to another with little apparent end in sight. This book somehow tied withDunefor the Hugo Award, but I'm frankly not sure what the voters saw in it.

We now have a 2 1/2 year old and I'm glad we saved our old video tapes since the show is no longer on. Wishbone is a cute little Jack Russell Terrier. Our neighbors have one just like him so my little one thinks he's the one on the tape and loves to watch them all. They are fun, imaginative and kids just love dogs.In this version of Washington Irving's classic early American ghost story, Wishbone steps into play Ichabod Crane, the nervous school teacher who comes to Sleepy Hollow. The producers did a good job of capturing the look of early colonial America and you know the budgets sure were not very big for these shows. This is a good way for kids to learn about this classic story without having quite the frights of the actual story or theatrical versions.The fact that my little one loves Halloween and all things scary even make this more of a treat. Just wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"It wasn't as scary as it was engaging.

A little gingerbread baby pops out and says, \\"I am the Gingerbread Baby, Fresh from the pan. If you want me, Catch me if you can.\\" After that it runs around the whole village saying that phrase and running away from everyone and everything that tries to catch it.

The book is unorganized, jumps all over the place, repeats its self too much, spends way too much time on how things look today, is written in a way that is uninteresting and confusing and the computer graphics are horrible! When I say horrible I mean they are an embarrassment to the publisher. It's sad when the old Prehistoric books from the 60's and 70's put the new stuff to shame.

On the other hand, Matthews' dictionary, unlike Crystal's, has brief entries on individual linguists (Panini, Halliday) and specific languages (Etruscan, Pashto).

Yes, fun!Watching Vincent act with two other legends is a treat, with Peter Lorre doing what he does best (ad lib).Including 3 stories which are separate, but have the same mood, the violence is minimal, but the atmosphere makes up the shortage of gore in abundance.American International Pictures, one of the better Independant film companies who seemed to touch the pulse of what kids wanted to see during the late 50's and early 60's , who during the 70's almost went major, should be thanked for releasing these types of films.

I have used it a couple of times and already my teeth feel cleaner. I also find that it is fun to use so I end up brushing my teeth a lot longer than with a regular brush.I went to see how much refills were at Wal-Mart and they were $7.97.

Has many of the same features and the timer is a nice feature. Pros are that it seems to be as efficient as the Sonicare, easier to keep clean, and is lighter. Cons are that after the timer goes through it cycle it does not shut off the toothbrush. Also, the location of the on/off button is such that (for the way I use it) it is easy to change the setting on the brush or shut it off. Once you change it the timer resets itself.All in all I would recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oral-B Model S-200 Sonic tooth brush","review":"I purchased this tooth brush because my other one gave out.

It leaves your teeth feeling cleaner than ever without harming your gums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oral B toothbrush","review":"My dentist recommended this and I had been watching prices to get the best deal when I saw this and ordered it. I really like the way it makes my teeth feel just like I had a real cleaning at the dentist office. The only thing that takes some getting used to is the vibrations, they make my nose tickle. It works great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Toothbrush","review":"I bought this to replace a worn out (dead battery) Oral-B 3d electric toothbrush. The Sonic seems much easier on my gums, and seems to be an effective cleaner. I'm not thrilled with the 30 sec timer (it stutters), but perhaps it's forcing me to brush longer. The sonic action really seems to get the toothpaste into all the nooks and crannies, but also (unfortunately) onto my shirt. You really have to make a conscious effort to keep your mouth closed, and even then toothpaste will inevitably leak out. I think the sonic action liquefies the paste much more than manual brushing. A great toothbrush overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"sonic toothbrush","review":"This is the second purchase of one of these. The last one lasted 4 or 5 years. We like the timer, it reminds us to brush for 2 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its great.","review":"It was recommended by my dentist and it's terrific. You can really feel the difference from other electric toothbrushes. It both cleans your teeth and massages your gums. Even my girlfriend who I never thought would want to use an electric toothbrush used mine and then wanted one for Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clean Teeth... but not for children","review":"I have had a sonicare in the past and was in the market for a new toothbrush. This one is very good. I like the 30 second stutter that happens as you brush. It makes brushing mindless and helped my boys know how long to brush each area. There is a high and low setting that was useful for the kids. One problem I had happend 2 weeks after the purchase. My oldest boy dropped the tooth brush in the sink and a corner broke off the bottom. Not to worry it still worked and charged. Then 3 months later I started having trouble with the vibration of the head. I think my boys were pressing too hard on their teeth. Now it does not vibrate at all and its useless. I can't really fault the tooth brush but...thought I should mention it."},{"rating":"1","title":"VeryProblematic","review":"This monitor interferes with our cordless phones on all channels - a shrill noise emits when the phone rings or when you talk on it. ALso, it beeps out of range even when at distances much less than the stated 800 feet (- from our daughter's bedroom to the kitchen). I would definitely not recommend this product, and had I not lost the receipt, I would have returned it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!!","review":"I bought this monitor because I thought it would be good for our 2 story home...WRONG! The receivers had lots of static from the beginning. By the time my daughter was 3 1/2 months old we had thrown away one of the receivers because it didn't work anymore and the other receiver had even more static from when we bought it. I wish I would have taken it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This monitor has been nothing but trouble for us. The battery life is terrible. It can charge all day, and by 5am, it is beeping from low battery already! The beeping is so scary the first few times you hear it! My daughter has been sleeping 9 hours since she was 2 1/2 weeks old, and the monitor's battery didn't last as long as she did. I had to get up and change the monitor to the other one that was charging. Ridiculous!Now we are having problems getting them to turn on. My daughter is only 11 weeks old, so the monitors are fairly new. We have to turn them on and off about 15-20 times before they will turn on. If you are shopping around for monitors, I would suggest a different one. Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible - buying a new monitor after only a 2 yrs of use","review":"This the first review I've ever written and I'm only doing it to save somebody else some money. This has got to be the worst monitor ever. I've used it for less than 2 years and it is just horrible. Horrible reception, horrible battery life, and now I can't even get sound from it unless I wiggle the plug into it. One of the receivers is taped up and I still only get sound every once & a while. I have to buy a new baby monitor. Very disappointed. Would have given it negative stars if I could have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a quality product...","review":"I've experience similar problems mentioned in other reviews. The monitors work well at first. After a few months, both monitors won't hold a charge so we had to plug them in from room to room. After 6 months, one monitor stopped working, and today, just over a year old, the second monitor died."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy!","review":"We were thoroughly unimpressed with this monitor. Its static wasn't just the white noise kind but like interference from a walkie talkie, so we'd lie awake waiting for the next loud crackle. Not only that, at full volume we could barely hear our baby! The manual changing of the channels on both the receiver and monitor was equally annoying. We just bought a Safety 1st DECT monitor and so far it seems to be far superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"HappyMom","review":"This monitor is simply awful! We have suffered with this piece of junk for way too long (6 mo.). Hence, here I am on Amazon to purchase it's replacement. There is constant static. If someone walks in front of the monitor, including our cat, the static noise soars. We have tried several locations throughout our home, turning it every direction...you name it. To no avail the static is always present. It only changes from loud to louder. My husband is an engineer and very gifted with problem solving but unfortunately, this is beyond his fixing. Save your money and frustration, buy something other than this monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Monitor for Three Months","review":"This monitor was an excellent monitor for three months. We were able to use it on all three levels of our home and was so sensitive we could hear our son breathing! However, the charge on the receivers faded until they didn't even last through the night without being plugged in. Then the channel display on the main console died and the system does not work at all. An expensive investment for three months. If you decide to get this I would definitely buy the service agreement, although you still lose money on shipping the broken product to them and the price of the plan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor microphone","review":"I picked up a set of these based on the positive reviews here but was disappointed with the gain on the microphone in the base. With baby in the crib I placed the base on the opposite side of the room, and didn't hear or see any feedback on the receivers.Other FP models we've tried, I can hear breathing if I turn the volume up high enough on the receiver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointment","review":"After reviewing baby monitors I thought that this monitor would be the best one for the price. However I was wrong. The monitor worked for like 3 minutes(and when it worked there was a lot of static) and then it lost it's connection to the receiver. We'd change the channels and still nothing. We called Fisher Price customer service and they were of no help. They advised us to return it. I do not recommend this product to any parents. We ended up spending a bit more for the Graco Digital with 2 handsets and that has been A++++++."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good after 3 months","review":"This monitor worked well for us, but only for 3 months. I thought the reception was great and we never had much trouble with static or interference. We would leave the recievers plugged into the charger though and the rechargable batteries have crapped out on us after only 3 months of use. I'd be hesitant to buy this product again. If you do get it, don't let the recievers sit around plugged into the charger!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Receivers aren't reliable!","review":"This baby monitor worked well for about a month. Then we noticed that the receivers weren't holding a charge as long as they used to. Then it got so they had to be plugged in all the time. Now one is completely dead and the other needs to be plugged in or it goes out after a few minutes. We hardly used the things for two months before they went belly up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy","review":"We can't get these to work without constant static. They have never worked. We did everything the \\"Problems & Solutions\\" recommended but they still never worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE PRODUCT","review":"I don't think this product even deserves one star. During the 3 months that it lasted would not work all the time. I had to keep the hand held piece plugged into wall or it would not work properly. Defeats the purpose of it being portable. I was not able to take it outside while we were in our pool while my newborn napped...which was main reason we bought a baby monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I have bought 3 sets of these and they are all a waste of time. They last a short period of time so within a few months to a year you would need to get another one; Initially I bought 2 sets one for home and one for grand parents who baby sit at times; the one at home spoilt really quickly as it was in use a mot more; then when I was looking for a replacement it was the only type available quickly in the stores here so I bought the third set,(which was a newer model) eventually all were useless and my kid is only 2 1/2 now. The only benefit is that it picks up all the sound in the room really clearly but there is a lot of static and interference from other objects especially mobile phones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time and Money","review":"We bought this monitor 2 weeks ago, and I'm already shopping for a new one. The static is NON STOP. We can't hear our son over the static. It's ridiculous. We leave it plugged in during the night and use the batteries during naptimes. The batteries last about 2 days. It beeps constantly, even when the base is plugged in and turned on. (it says it has a far reach, but my sons room is 2 rooms away and it can never seem to find the signal) DON'T BUY THIS MONITOR. Waste of money!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great monitor","review":"I'm surprised to see so many negative reviews - our experience with these has been great, especially the range. I sometimes have to take the dog out to the lot next door while the baby's sleeping, and it reaches with no problem. I've actually experimented, and it still had 2 bars a whole block away. There is occasional static, but that doesn't bother us. One of my friends bought a much more expensive monitor, and it hardly reaches to their front porch. It also holds charge well. A great monitor overall!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Snap, Crackle, Pop","review":"We bought this baby monitor to hear our toddler daughter call us in the night if she needed us. We had an old Safety that we used for 5 years but as it aged, it became more static-y. My husband wanted one that had a privacy feature so I picked this up. He immediately commented that the 900MHZ frequency really wouldn't give us privacy but would try it out.This baby monitor worked for a few weeks but then the receiver would start to \\"pop\\" loud static sounds. First it started around 4am in the morning but then progressed into all hours of the night randomly. My husband thought maybe it was picking up wireless or X10 signals... Whatever the reason, these receivers are useless to use at night and will have to be used only during day use for my younger child's naps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good monitor with 2 drawbacks.","review":"I have purchased 2 of these monitors for both of my children and the two main things I would change is the amount of static, which isn't constant and the length of the battery life. Even though they can remain plugged in, it is nice to be able to carry them around with you and when the batteries finally gave out after less than a year, I wasn't able to use them unplugged any more. Other than that, I like the private connection feature. For the price, I would recommend these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I recently purchased this monitor when my old Fisher Price 49 MHz Sounds 'n Lights monitor stopped working in one of my twins room after only a year. I could hear my next door neighbor but not my baby upstairs. I figured this one has many channels to choose from so the chances of that happening where slim.Well... It works and I enjoy this monitor so much better that I am considering replacing my other Fisher Price one. With this monitor I do not hear any noise from it unless my child is making noise. My other one makes a low static sound all the time, it is not bother some but I can still hear it. I would highly recommend this model. The price is great and I have not tried the rechargeable batteries yet but it is nice to know that I can take it off charge at any time and not have to worry about finding new batteries.A great find, a great buy, a great product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"***** JUNK!! do not waste your money on this one *******","review":"Pros:1)rechargeable batteries;2)LED sound lights on receiver can see from both sides3)new designCons:1)sound from receivers is low even high volume and constant static2)have 10 channels but you have to manually set the channel on both the receiver and transmitter; they need ought to have an automatic channel changer to get best signal so you won't have to manually change it.3) LCD screen on receivers has a backlight when you turn it on but needs a backlight button to press to see otherwise you need to turn it off then on to come on.4) range alot less than product statesThis is the 2nd monitor I returned and in its place I bought the Fisher Price Sounds 'n Lights 49Mhz model M5578 and it works great loud and clear the only drawback is it uses batteries they are not rechargeable but have an AC power like other monitors."},{"rating":"2","title":"duel monitors","review":"I have seen many of the baby monitors on the market,but for the price you get two belt clip moitors,and the reception is very good. You can't beat it."},{"rating":"1","title":"read if you plan on using the AC adapter!","review":"Monitor itself works fine -- but not if you plan on using the AC adapter.....Fisher Price customer service recommends that the AC adapter should not be plugged into the reciever for more than 13 hours at a time or the rechargeable battery and/or unit will be damaged. In my mind that makes the product useless if you intend on using the AC adapter -- you'll have to remember to unplug it every morning or risk wrecking the thing! (the fisher price rep actually told me I'd \\"fry it\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"We have been very happy with this product. We used to have to move our one receiver around with us when we wanted to hear if the kids woke up in the night. The two receivers make the logistics much easier. The choice of channels also reduces interference and makes getting good reception pretty easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must I have","review":"I have an average size 2 floor house (1700 ft) Works great for us. Lets my wife and I do other things when my daughter sleeps. We hear ever peep she makes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for us!","review":"This monitor has been great for us. We have been using it for over 10 months, and the only complaint I have is sometimes there is a little static, but even then we can hear our son stirring, and often we can even hear him breathing! I love that we know he's up before he starts screaming. These are also very small and light, and very portable. We throw them in the diaper bag and take them with us so we can move about or go outside while he's napping. The two receivers are great to keep one in our bedroom and one in the living area. We're very happy with this choice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Irratic out of the box","review":"Maybe we got a lemon, but out of the box this monitor acted irratic. The primary concern is with the base. When it displays the channel, it's working. But sometimes we have to unplug it for quite some time to get the base to work. And when the base doesn't work, the receivers sound like a weather alarm. Not fun at 3 am. I checked Fisher Price web page and it didn't mention a problem exactly like ours.We are going to return it for another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for us","review":"We didn't like hearing the constant white noise it makes when on. It's too loud. We ended up going with Sony's baby call monitor and LOVE it. It has voice activation. So you only hear the monitor when baby is making noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud noise","review":"This monitor worked ok at first but it has increasingly gotten louder and louder in terms of static. It started out that it had to sit in a few certain places around the house and it would be ok but now nowhere we sit it is it ok! My mom got one too for when she baby sits and one of her receivers completely stopped working and the one that does is doing the same thing. I would not recommend this if you want to use them longer than 1 year. My son is 14 months and I am getting a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend","review":"The receivers are good; sound quality is good, and I like how the receivers and rechargable and last for about eight hours or so without a charge. However, I have owned this product for about 7 months and the monitor base isn't working so well. It doesn't want to turn on. I don't think it will make through the year. It's hard to find something that actually lasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep this for a long time","review":"I bought this as a gift based upon the recommendation of my daughter who has been using one. Hers was so good that her neighbor borrowed it and packed up the more expensive one she had. That being said, having the cordless option allows mom or dad to walk about or go outside BUT if you don't need a cordless option, I recommend a good ol' intercom that plugs in. I have had one (from Radio Shack) for almost thirty years that we used to communicate with kids upstairs or down in basements, as well as listen for baby cries or elderly calls in the night. This is something that has uses far beyond infant care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"This monitor has bugged me after 6 months of use. Lots of static, random buzzing & now it just plain wont work! It did well showing the light gage of noises in my daughters room. When Im trying to sleep & the monitor is randomly buzzing its down right annoying. there shouldnt be a problem like the buzzing since my house is 1000sq ft & all other electronics in the house arent interfering. The battery life is really short so we had to keep it plugged in all the time. I figured buying an item over $50 it would be a solid piece of equipment but its junk to me & disapointing. Keep your receipt!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy is an understatement","review":"I accidentally dropped one of the receivers off a 3 story balcony onto a concrete patio.

When disconnected form the power cord, the receiver shows almost no charge and beeps to be recharged. Basically, the batteries fail. The receivers only work when connected to the outlet. I gave 1 star because it worked for at least a year, and the second star because I like the 10 channel selection. Other than that, I do not recommend buying this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOVE STATIC? Buy this monitor!","review":"This monitor had so much static no matter what channel it was on. We bought a Fisher Price monitor 4 years ago and absolutely loved it! After getting dropped for the billionth time and being on non-stop for four years, the base unit stopped working and we went for a replacement. This was not even close in quality and performance! When the sound is turned down low enough that the static isn't aggravating, you can't hear the baby. We're returning it as soon as we can find a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 years and dead","review":"After 2 years, the speaker is dead on one receiver and both receivers are \\"blipping\\" due to some unknown interference (we do not have 900 MHz wireless in the house) and the first lights are ALWAYS on. These were fine for almost a year and a half and then they went downhill fast. This gets very annoying at night when you are asleep and the lights are flickering for no reason at all. We are trying to figure out what model to get next and believe that we will go digital next.I read in another review that you should not have the receivers plugged in for more that 13 hours at a time. If this is true, this is truly an absolutely horrible design. We have these plugged in at all times, one in the living room and one in the bedroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful monitor","review":"I purchased this monitor about a year and a half ago and within the first couple of months one of the dual monitors just stopped working. Aside from that, the monitor itself is very loud and fuzzy at ALL times and no matter what channel it is on, it frequently makes a beeping sound. Now just a year and a half after using it..the other monitor has stopped working. This monitor is such poor quality. Do not waste your money on this monitor, let alone any fisher price monitor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Satisfied OK","review":"Works very well and allows the owner to choose between different channels to reduce inteference.

And you will sympathize.Hanif Kureishi is a brilliant writer.Happy reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"128 pages that felt like 500.","review":"I read many glowing reviews of this novella in sources I implicitly trusted; Amazon.Com's review section included. The gap between promise and fulfillment has never been so large in my reading experience. The central character, who unfortunately is also the narrarator, is a whining, mawkish, hyper-sensitive narcissist who should have reflected and learned from his wife's criticisms, instead of ruminating about leaving her. Consequently, I've lost an evening from my life reading this trite missive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Packs an incredibly complex range of emotions into 118 pages","review":"The honesty and clear-eyed sensitivity of this book and of its narrator make it impossible to categorize it (or him) in a simple, judgemental fashion. Kureishi gives voice, tersely and unapologetically, to emotions, hopes and desires that anyone, male or female, has experienced when thinking about intimacy. The protagonist certainly seems to be representative of his time, negotiating all the beliefs and expectations of how to live life and find love in the 1990s, and yet the novel has a timeless feel to it; the narrator's struggles are similar to those of Newland Archer in Wharton's Age of Innocence. The only fault of this novel is that it occasionally slips into '90s platitudes, and the protagonist fits too exactly into the mould of New Labour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too much intimacy?","review":"Kureishi calls this \\"Intimacy, A Novel\\" but it is really hard to believe that you aren't reading his most personal thoughts. The narrator is a writer, living in London, who has been nominated for an Academy Award. Kureishi too is all this. He tells of his decision to leave his wife and family for a variety of reasons, but which really all end up with his inability to accept the limitations of a permanent relationship and a family. Most of the time you want to grab him by the lapels and tell him to grow up...but part of the time you know exactly what is going through his mind. Kureishi doesn't pull any punches here, and he reveals more than enough warts on his character for us to dismiss him as nothing more than a selfish lout. But few selfish louts have the skill and courage to bare their souls so completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than blown away","review":"I loved Kureishi's \\"Buddha of Suburbia\\" and enjoyed \\"the Black Album\\" but \\"Intimacy\\" failed to leave any lasting impression on this reader. Other readers praise the book as offering some great insight into the male psyche, yet, as a male I found it hard to relate to the novel's self-indulgent narrator. I want to state, for the record, that not all men feel they'd drown their wives and children for the sake of great sex. \\"Intimacy\\" is however a somewhat compelling book and Kureishi is definitely a wordsmith. Read \\"Buddha\\" way before you go for \\"Intimacy\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining read","review":"INTIMACY is a very fun book about the agonies of a man who can't quite bring himself to leave, though he's persuaded himself this is exactly what he wants.

Its diction is inconsistent. Yet the prose has literary pretensions (it oozes pretension): much of its awkwardness is deliberate, perverse, ostentatious--abusive.The forest: In place of a plot we have the protagonist--a dim-witted, shallow, narcissistic fellow--droning on about himself and the deadly dull circumstances of his life. This protagonist prides himself on \\"the depth of his thought\\". Dramatic irony? No such luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite.","review":"I found this book to be appalingly shallow and, taken as a whole, rather dull. There is no thought-provoking content introduced here; just the sad, silly ramblings of a typical self-absorbed post-modernist urban male trying to recapture the youthful zeal of a past rememberd but never lived. Not only did I fail to sympathize with the narrator, I did not care what he was saying or why.I did not have a problem with the novel's content - infidelity has been the topic of novels, films and plays too numerous to mention, many of which I've enjoyed. The successful ones broach the subject with a clear eye or fresh voice (or both), and shed light on what is generally overlooked or ignored. INTIMACY does none of those things."},{"rating":"1","title":"...!!","review":"I have just read the novel \\"Intimacy\\" and the \\"Midnight All Day\\" stories by Kureishi. Kureishi follows the \\"write about what you know\\" addige too literally. Every monotonous story is virtually identical; about a neurotic artist who's either separated, divorced or cheating. The only thing I got from this work is a more clear impression of the strange Kureishi himself.If you like reading depressing stories with no climax that go absolutely nowhere and leave you wondering if you've bent the cover too much to return the book...you'll love Kureishi's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Men Have Feelings Too","review":"Popular culture would like us to believe that men who feel inclined to leave their families are monsters.This book presents a broader picture. How the motivation of a man is almost entirely the same as a woman that leaves a husband: the search for love, the search for passion, the search for meaning.I really thought I would end up loathing this main character but instead I felt a measure of sympathy and humanity towards him.I will be less judgmental about marriage and divorce after this book.Stylistically this book is beautiful. Not only is short and hard-hitting but its so clean. I think the contradiction between the cleanliness of the writing and the pain that is on display is one of the best things about this novel.Well done Mr Kureishi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still great and it's now 2010!","review":"I purchased this TV in the Summer of 2006, with the sole purpose of having a cableCard slot.

I will not hesitate to order again.Fred"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely bad DVD quality","review":"This movie is 1930's history. It's always fun to see a great cast like Boyer & Lamarr. But this print that was put on DVD is unwatchable. Grainy, jumpy, inaudible, faded - and this is being kind. At one point, there was even a double soundtrack being heard. I strongly advise - let's put a stop to this type of DVD being offered to the public. DVD's are a marvel to watch. It's a crime when you are subjected to this type of mess!!DO NOT BUY IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the other DVD version!","review":"After reading the EXTREMELY bad reviews here of this DVD copy, I bought the other version (ASIN: B0002CR4GY) for sale here on Amazon.The other version has none of the quality problems reported here. Don't be fooled into thinking this is a better version just because the photo on this DVD case is in color and the other in black & white. See my review on the other version for more information.BUY THE OTHER DVD VERSION THAT AMAZON SELLS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"5-star film;1-star quality!","review":"Boy, that other reviewer was right about the lousy production quality of this movie. It's such a marvelous film. Charles Boyer does a fantastic job as the master criminal who possesses panache, intelligence, and a desperate need to escape the casbah that is both refuge and prison. Hedy Lamarr is luminous. Such a classic movie deserves restoration, and those of us who love good movies enough to purchase DVDs deserve better than this. Okay, I'm used to the faded, grainy, jumpy aspect of the typical AlphaVideo DVD, and am willing to put up with it just to have this film. But the sudden intrusion of another movie's dialogue -- including a man screaming -- right in the middle of the story line is inexcusable. I nearly came out of my chair in startlement. At times you can barely hear Pepe le Moko's dialogue for this other, loud overdub. If this is the only copy of this film you can find, it's still worth having, but be prepared for a really stupid production mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAP PRODUCTION","review":"I love the movie \\"Algiers\\". For those who know, there are some authentic touches through gestures and through music of old Algiers. And, any fan of the Charles Boyer/Hedy Lamarr foreign intrigue/exotique film genre will enjoy it immensely. But, this copy might as well have been bought on the streets of Shanghai. The quality of the copy is extremely poor and even more offensive, midway through the film another conversation keeps taking over, what is it? \\"DARK SHADOWS\\". No mistaking the \\"Dark Shadows\\" music or Joan Bennett. I recommend that Amazon drop this vendor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored me to tears","review":"I recently bought this dvd, since many consider it a classic from the late 1930's. I doubt that Charles Boyer would make it as a star today. And Hedy Lamarr is good looking, but not that good looking. Her acting was also just so so. And the quality of the dvd just didn't hold up. Very dark and sound was pretty bad- but it was made in the 30's. I just found the movie real boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"For such high price I thought it would be an effective solution to solve the bird problem we have in the building.

It is an intelligent read and a wonderful look at urban life in the late 20's. Block out some time and prepare to laugh out loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Praise of Thorne Smith and his work","review":"Turnabout by Thorne Smith is a wonderful combination that celebrates the raucus hedonism of the 1920's and derides the hypocrasy of puritanical prohibition. It is the love story of a couple not in love that rediscover their love again once they trade places (literally and hilariously!). Through the devises of the mysterious \\"Mr. Ram\\" and local neighbors they set about creating a riot throughout their small town. It is a book I highly recommend. Anyone interested in humor, sex, and challenging authority should check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful Comedy","review":"Read this fantasy on several levels.

I think you can get the UMD from a company called Silver Platter.This film has some of the best riders out there today, they hit the sickest jumps, hugest rails, and have the sickest big mountain lines.

She does a great job of showing her character's decent from being an enabler to a complete psychosis. Michael Shannon proves yet again he is an actor of unflinching talent, here one can see a parallel with his character in Take Shelter. Watching it, here and there I wondered if there is anything to their delusion - how many steps are there between these characters and, say, people in conspiracy shows, i.e., anybody who gets killed off in shows like The X-Files? That is the scary part of this movie. Though I do wish the characters' decent was explored in more details - there are obvious jumps in the story, mostly due to the fact it was based on a stage play. Other than that, a good movie to raise questions about what we think we know - about others, but more importantly, about ourselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"BED Bug","review":"While the ending was a mind trip, this movie is completely dull. It is misrepresented as a horror movie, which isn't true at all. Besides that, it takes over an hour for anything interesting to happen, and even the \\"interesting\\" bits are dull. Overall I'd say this movie was one to sleep through, and you should spend your money on something else.And if you like this movie, more power to you. I just can't sit that long while nothing happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bug","review":"\\"Bug\\" was marketed as a horror movie, but is really a strange mix of drama and psychological thriller. Agnes white (Ashley Judd) lives in a motel where she gets phone calls from someone who never says anything, presumably her abusive ex-boyfriend Jerry. She meets Peter (Michael Shannon). Jerry (Harry Connick Jr) stops buy for a visit and beats her up. Agnes and Peter get increasingly afraid of the bugs that supposedly infests the motel room and that may be part of some government cover up.The actors are all doing a great job. Ashley Judd's performance is Oscar worthy. Agnes and Peter's descent into insanity could have been very interesting but it feels more like a play than a movie, and on more than one occasion, it crosses the line from dramatic to over the top, almost laughable. The movie is weird, but not in a good way, and ultimately doesn't work either as a drama nor as a horror movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bug","review":"This movie really bugged me (pun intended). It follows the relationship of a paranoid schizophrenic and a woman at a run down motel. For whatever reason she seems to like this guy even though he's quirky and convinced the US Army placed bugs in his system. He cuts himself, pulls his own teeth out and generally freaks out in every scene trying to reconcile himself to the bugs living inside him.Eventually he convinces his girlfriend that she too has bugs inside her. By the end of the movie they have decorated their motel room in tin foil so the bugs cannot transmit signals to each other.I can't help but think this movie was a waste of time and money and the acting really isn't all that remarkable, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"A stage play movie ?!","review":"They use conversation to present a movie!I bought this DVD, because of Ashley Judd and think that it is a sci-fiction movie.But very disappoint. What happened to Ashley Judd?It looks like a stage play movie more, or it should be broadcasting on the radio.Why? Because nothing to watch (except a few seconds of Ashley naked), most of the time, you are watching Ashley Judd and Michael Shannon talking at Ashley's living room. A lot of conversation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Itching for more","review":"Many people have said creepy, many have said that it will get under your skin... they are right.

I agree with most of the previous negative reviews that have been posted here, especially the numerous plot holes. Friedkin loves to leave the audience guessing but here he just leaves us hanging.

So much for being what it says on the box. This movie was a total waste of money. It wasn't a thriller at all. This was a little blood and crazy stuff.

Don't be Jodie Foster and be such a victim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful.","review":"This movie starts off okay, but descends into awfulness quickly. My favorite part was in the first five minutes of the movie, when Ashley Judd tries to open a bottle of wine with her teeth. Please don't watch this movie. There are 0 bugs in this movie, just in case you were wondering. This movie doesn't even qualify for the \\"so bad it's good\\" category.

I can roll w/ the punches and have to say that overall I was impressed. Another reviewer didn't get it when they stated that the explanation didn't make sense-Duh- it wasn't supposed to! If it did then you would have to have your head examined. Its the state of the characters paranoia and how their madness makes all seem like a plot against them. Its a gradual build to the climax w/ some excellent acting done by Ashley Judd. The Gentleman in the film is quite good also and had apparently done the off b'way play for many years. I can't believe so many one star reviews so I gotta offset by giving it the maximum. Its probably worth 4 anyway IMHO."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely not what I expected in the most amazing way!","review":"When I first viewed this film, I thought it may actually be about bug infestation of some kind. But it is actually a psychological thriller, with amazing acting, that kept me both equally enthralled and totally disturbed as your trust in the characters' reality continues to crumble throughout the movie until the final climax/ending. I don't want to give much away about the plot, but it was superbly acted and played out, although it really was much more of a play than a movie. What I will say was that it was truly spectacular, and that when the credits rolled I literally sat staring at the TV in an open-mouthed stance, completely incredulous. I haven't done that since I watched American Beauty about 10 years ago...."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Point to This","review":"I was looking forward to the experience of viewing \\"Bug\\" after reading about it and its source as a play. This film is nothing to me. I cared not one bit about any of the characters. We've already been down that \\"what-is-real\\" road before with better results. People laughed out loud at some of the over-the-top moments but my mind had already been made up. I'm never impressed with actors who are given a broad canvas in which to take their particular character. Anthony Hopkins in \\"Remains of the Day\\" or Paul Newman in \\"The Verdict\\" are examples of what I consider incredible acting where they have very little to use outwardly to convey the inner turmoil of their particular characters. I was truly disappointed in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, just wow.","review":"Spoilers, not that there's anything to spoil.I'm a huge fan of psychological thrillers but this was terrible. The movie starts off extremely slow. It was about thirty minutes of introducing characters and their issues. Then you finally start developing a plot of bugs, little made up bugs. This random guy that is staying in a motel room with the main character starts flipping out, later to find out he's mental and they set themselves on fire and die. The writing, dialogue and acting is god awful. It was a interesting idea for an movie but was executed horribly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ashley Judd's worst possible role/worst movie","review":"The trailer and dvd packaging give the impression this is a government conspiracy horror movie, which couldn't be further from the truth.All this movie is about features two schizophrenics who didn't take their meds so they are having a breakdown. The movie is nothing more than bad taste. The two main characters spend their time naked and out of their minds. The writing and acting is awful. This movie goes nowhere!!!!Don't bother!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"The first half of the movie was very interesting and I kept waiting for the horror to start. Then when it \\"happens\\", I kept waiting for the movie to end. The actors are good, but when the first bug enters the movie you should turn it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"SENSELESS AND OVERWROUGHT","review":"Only the career defining performance from a dynamic Ashley Judd mskes this movie worthwhile. Director William Friedkin's translation of the play by Tracy Lettis tries to instill suspense by fueling the paranoia of Judd and co-star Michael Shannon (in a very good performance). If you were expecting a true horror movie, you will certainly be disappointed. I had a hard time seeing Judd's descent into the paranoid woman -- her involvement with Shannon is deep but to fall so hard into the maelstrom of Shannon's dementia isn't grounded. Harry Connick Jr. is pretty good too as Judd's abusive ex-husband, but overall I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"This really was one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen. It is clearly trying to be \\"deep\\" and draw you into the world of mental illness. Unfortunately, it is not believable in the slightest and when it comes to portraying \\"mental illness\\" it is downright sloppy--confusing paranoia, delusions, folie a deux, and the effects of smoking crystal meth.It is way over the top, and it is clear that this was written for the stage. However, I can hardly believe it would have been any better on the stage. I couldn't wait for it to end. I kept thinking it might get better but it just kept getting worseIt is way worse than I expected, given that it was directed by the same talented man who brought us the \\"The Exorcist\\" and \\"French Connection.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of Time","review":"This movie was very stupid. I rented it and my husband I really felt like we wasted our time. Do not rent it or buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Ever","review":"The movie has about 5 actors and two sets. It's almost completely dialog and runs in chronological order, so it's like a play and can get boring because of the sameness. Connick gives a great performance as a convincing bad guy (as he always does. If you want a bad guy, choose him), but the rest of the cast is lackluster. Not necessarily because of lack of talent. I think it's more due to the poor writing and direction.The plot is about a lonely, needy woman who latches on to a stranger who says he's being hunted by the Army. He was part of a Tuskeegee Institute type experiment where bugs were implanted in him and they are spreading. The movie strains credulity. Since it relies on believability for entertainment value, it has none. As a mental health worker, I hate seeing psychosis done badly, so my opinion may not be in the majority."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible ending!!","review":"This movie tried to come off deep but failed!!

If you can think up a conspiracy, it probably already exist in some form. Bug pushes that to the extreme in detailing the popular conspiracies of the modern world. Bildebergs, Tuskegee, Tim McVeigh, Gulf War Syndrome, AIDS etc.It is a psycho-drama that just gradually fades into a mental health tragedy that is more of a downer than a lesson in life.

Instead, I got a movie about mental illness. The main problem I have with this film is that there is no one to root for. All the characters are unappealing. Remembering Ashley Judd in such films as \\"Double Jeopardy\\" just makes the whole thing worse.

If you are expecting a \\"monster movie\\" filled with actual bugs, don't bother. This movie was a complete misrepresentation of a horror flick. It was more a psycho thriller (a bad one at that). By half way through, I was praying it would be over soon.I was impressed, however, by how well Ashley Judd created her \\"white trash\\" character. I am a huge fan of hers, but this movie doesn't even make the list for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely terrible","review":"This movie was such a disappointment. The first half hour provided a real mood of suspense and menace, but it went headlong into the toilet after that. The writer had a great opportunity to use the topics of paranoid delusion, military testing, and isolation to create doubt about what was real and what was imagined, but instead he/she went way overboard and made it clear that the guy was merely a nutcase. The scenery-chewing acting in the finale drew unintentional laughter and by the end I had no empathy for any of the characters. Sad to say, I actually cared more about the \\"bad guy\\" than the supposed heroes. Harry Connick Jr. did a good job as the abusive ex (not exactly a tough role to play), but the two leads had nothing to work with after the first act. I felt badly for for Ashley Judd as she flat-out embarrassed herself at the end trying to bring intensity to the ridiculous dialog she was given. Poorly conceived and directed, and a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"STOMP THIS BUG!","review":"I am an avid movie collector. This is by far the worst movie that I have ever seen in my entire life! What was a wonderful actress like Ashley Judd thinking when she made the decision to take on a role in this film? Even though her performance was very convincing, the whole storyline dragged out and was way too far fetched. I made sure that I returned this movie extra early to get the dollar credit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly The Worst Film In History","review":"After watching in shock to completion, I sat in silence thinking about any other film I have ever seen in my 45 years on the planet that was worse. I could think of none. This has to be a bad joke, maybe a satirical finger-in-the-eye of the movie going public because I can think of no other reason why this dreck was written, financed, and produced. I can usually find something redeeming in any film, but this one is a record breaker as there is absolutely nothing redeeming about it, nothing. Horrible acting, direction, writing, production value. It is now clear to me that Hollywood has nothing more to give, this is it, the bottom of the barrel. The creative tank is empty. Thank goodness documentary film makers are making up for the feature length garbage passing as film this last 10 years. BUG is unparalleled as the worst film ever made!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a bad bad movie","review":"Although when this was over all I could say was, stupid, stupid, stupid, the acting wasn't too terrible.

The person who directed it directed the Exorcist so he definately knows how to unsettle people. It's not the violence that was unsettling because only three people get killed in the whole film. What's unsettling about it was watching a man's descent into madness and watching him completely lose touch with reality. Not only that, but watching how a man was able to plant some very powerful and absurd ideas into a lonely woman's head and even take things a step further, made it doubly unsettling.What I got out of the film is that a person's belief is a very powerful thing. Our values, morals and principles can make or break us. Everything which happens in this film can conceivably happen in real life. I will not spoil the film by telling you that there are really no \\"Bugs\\" in the film, they were imagined."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse Film Ever!!!","review":"I saw this in theaters, and almost everyone in the theater hated this film.

The guy was crazy and all he did was convince the other girl to be crazy to. I found this movie funny and useless. One more thing if you do decide to watch this, the sex scene makes no sense because in real life if a guy said \\"I haven't been with a woman in a long time.\\" and then gets sex from saying that, just don't buy it if anything rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It'll BUG you alright","review":"For those of you that rated this movie above 1 star you must have some investment in it.

With the title, box art, and even the description on the back, this can be unclear, and is what is leading to some of the negative reviews you see here.The interesting thing about it, for me, is that it highlights the fact that we all have weaknesses caused by the pain in our lives, and if you are unlucky enough to meet someone who reinforces those weaknesses, it is a fairly short trip to trouble.This is the essence of codependency, and happens all the time when two people with a weakness for drugs, overspending, overeating, gambling -- you name it -- get together. The result is a steady escalation of the worst traits from both people as they reinforce and validate each other.That's what this movie is all about, and once it starts, you won't be able to look away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not recommend","review":"Beware that some spoilers here... First of all forget about bugs, the main idea of the movie is mental illness. It is nowhere near a horror movie unless you are afraid of having paranoia or schizophrenia. This film does not even try to trick your mind about what is real or what is not. It is just like watching real patients. Do not wait for a suprise at the end. It is more like a drama that you can listen over the radio or a stage play. I do not think it is worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time stolen","review":"I have never felt indebted to by someone I did not personally know, but William Friedkin owes me two hours of my life back. Bug joins \\"Wicker Man\\" and \\"The Bridge to Terabithia\\" as one of the worlds most deceptively advertised movies, and certainly one of the worst. This is the worst possible genre Hollywood has ever come up with; The Statement. There is supposed to be a message in a Statement, but I've not been able to discern it in Bug.The movie unwinds interestingly enough, but then seems to go nowhere. Plot elements clash; Why does the doctor smoke hash? Seems unusual for a medical professional, at least in public. Why does the very dangerous ex-con boyfriend not just toss the loony bugman out? What is the point of this somewhat disgusting and very disturbing movie?William, if you are reading this, feel free to contact me.

I wasted an hour and a half of my life hoping it would get better every minute and it never did. I thought maybe my boyfriend would like it, he graduated with a psychology degree, and I had read in some reviews it was a great psychological thriller...he HATED it.

It wasn't really anywhere to go with the plot. I applaud her for her realistic portrayal of Laurie's MSD, but that's all the plot had going for it. Laurie was accused of a murder that we are led to beleive that one of her personalities commited. There really weren't a lot of suspects to consider. This book does not prove to be memorable for me.

It has been so long since I read the book but still remember it as my favorite. Clark portrays the emotions of the kidnapped child so you begin to feel for her. The suspense is great up until the very end. The book is not predictable and keeps you guessing. I highly recommend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I thought All Around the Town was a great book. Laurie is kidnapped from her home by Bic and Opal at four and after two years she is finally returned home but she is a different person. Actually, she is five different people because she developed multiple personality disorders to protect her. In college she falls in love with a professor and after a confrontation with him about letters she's been sending him, she threatens him. Later he is found dead in his home and all evidence points to Laurie as the killer. Her sister has the job of proving her innocence which is hard because everyone including Laruie believes she did it. If you want to find out who the killer is, I recommend reading All Around the Town. If you are a Mary Higgins Clark fan, I definately wouldn't miss this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT TOTALLY ROCKS!","review":"I think that Mary Higgins Clark did an awesome job on this story. And even though it is a little disturbing it was a great book and keeps you glued to the pages. If you love a mystery and love the suspense that goes with it than this book is totally what you want to read. For a little info on the book: one of the main characters (Laurie) was kidnapped at age 4 and returned two years but never fully recovered from the abduction. 17 years later she has been diagnosed with multiple personality disorder and is accused of murder, however Laurie has no memory of this but all the signs point to her. The kidnappers come back in her life and try to ruin it but Laurie's sister Sarah is helping her through the whole process and.... well I guess you just have to read it to figure out what happens hope you like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her best!","review":"This is the first book by MHC that I ever read and it is still one of my favorites!

She used to be an outgoing, playful little girl. When she returns she is scared all the time. She can't even have a relationship when she gets older. She doesn't know why she is terrified but she is.Then her proffessor is found dead and every thing is linked to her. She has no idea what is going on.

I have been a MHC fan for many years of satisfied reading. She seems concerned about her characters and surroundings being believable to her readers, I like that.

The book is written well as far as MHC's deatails, maybe a bit too good. Yet the subject matter is very distrubing and the ending is preposterous. The main character Laurie, would need many years of agressive therapy, and most likely hospitalization. MHC's, ending of Lauries Super quick recovery is absurd. The two villains are just down right evil, and there is no real conclusion as to what happened to the disgusting opal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with it.","review":"I read All Around the Town a while ago and was thoroughly disappointed.

Miller is good too. All the acting is good. The problem with the movie is plot. It is his birthday, he finds the money, his wife gets \\"discovered\\" as an artist, and the wife is having a surprised birthday party for him. So many small things to wrong in the movie to keep the certain characters in the plot, it makes the whole thing uncomfortable. It is like a \\"Fawlty Towers\\" episode on steroids without the laughs. There a few chuckles in the movie, but it just doesn't justify the frenetic pacing. Penelope does the best she can with a strange role. She plays a depressed drunk for most of the movie. Chevy hits his part just right, but he isn't given much to work with. Even before I read that it was a movie made from a play, I knew it was a movie made from a play. It had a claustrophobic feel. Most of the action takes place within the house.The movie frustrated me more than made me laugh. It just was not funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfunny money","review":"In January of 2007 this movie debuted in limited release on four screens, pulled in less than $2000, and hopefully those few people demanded a refund.The director and the cast should have paniced sometime during filming when it became clear that the movie had only one joke, not amusing the first time around, but repeated over and over in every scene until I finally had to give up on this film in disgust.I liked Chevy Chase early in his career in TV and film, but his talents have dissipated even more quickly than his hair.

There are many other examples of weirdness and political incorrectness in this book..... and I understand it's a mark of the times (1940s), perhaps, but why doesn't the publisher at least revise it to correct these things???

I was so disappointed in how this book ended and if all goes well, she will not make this a trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alice Coloring book","review":"This coloring book includes the story on one page, and the drawings are beautiful, full-page, vintage style illustrations!

I got this one the day it came out in Los Angeles. Sorry to write again but: YOU HAVE TO CHECK THIS CD OUT!!!! My girlfriend who is NOT an Eric Burdon fan now drives around L.A. singing every word to this GREAT WORK!!! I have met Eric several times in Mississippi and New Orleans and would often tell him how good the new \\"live\\" cd was but: I cant wait to see him again to give him a hug on this one. I really hope he is happy with the efforts on this one. I also hope he smiles all the way to the bank. It is Eric Burdons turn!!!! He worked for US fans to make us happy on this cd. In my opinion: if the radio stations dont play these songs and people dont buy this cd, the record business is OVER for great artists!!!!!If you like rock, spanish / latin, blues, jazz and easy listening: you will LOVE this cd!!!Eric NOW has a problem: What can he do to top this one?????"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Burdon disc of the past 20 years","review":"Much as others have said... interesting variety, solid production. I think his voice is much stronger here than on other releases of the past two decades."},{"rating":"2","title":"New E.V.B. Standards","review":"This is a great work. Every song grabs you with the hook and each cut is different. From the opening tributes to Marvin Gaye and Otis Redding through the jazzy blues of Jazzman and ending with the Leonard Cohen title track, this is Eric's crowning achievement. Do not miss this fabulous album from a legendary performer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent, Sensational, Outstanding, Fantastic, Terrific.","review":"What kind of words can I use to describe this new CD by a journeyman vocalist whom most of you have probably heard of? All of the above. Seldom in today's recording industry does an album reach out and grab you with it's full creative force behind it which the artist has learned over 40+ years, thru countless miles on the road and association with some of the best artists in the world. The result is Eric Burdon today and he has never sounded better. If you liked any of Eric's music in the past, be sure to get this one, it will reach out and grab you."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Secret Life","review":"I saw Eric in Cleveland at a Rock Hall fund raiser the day before this CD was released and he did 2 songs from it - the crowd loved it!

Been a fan of Eric Burdon's like forever it seems, been collecting his music from each turn of his career, and the first word that comes to mind about this new recording is WOW!Not that it will \\"replace\\" my old EB favorites... but this is the kind of album in particular where one feels the overwhelming desire to roll down the windows and crank up the volume! The style, variety, quality of voice and sound is astonishingly good. This is music that keeps playing over again in your head long after the stereo has been shut off. Brilliant effort by EB and a MUST HAVE not only for hardcore fans but anyone who can appreciate great music and pure TALENT. The sound clips just can't do this album justice... you have to buy it, listen, and be blown away. We fans eagerly await the next musical journey from Eric Burdon, he doesn't have to \\"top\\" this cd, just more of the same please will do!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blows you away","review":"The first Arch Enemy album I heard was Wages of Sin. That album is great. Anthems of Rebellion is simply incredible. The power, the melody, the grit and the gut, this album has it all. Some of the best black metal you will ever hear. It was worth waiting for this album. One of the best albums of the year. Pick it up right away, you won't be disappointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money 'cuz you aint missing a thing here!!","review":"Im more of a classic AE fan. stigmata, Burning Bridges, etc. this album is just way to \\"nu\\" metal for me. It still has some classic AE moments (nice solo here, cool riff there) But if your a fan like me than dont even waste your time. It basically just picks up where Wages left off. A song will start off with a good hook and then it just looses ya. It seems like the Amott bros. dont even try anymore. In comparison to their other stuff, its a waste of money. but if your into this kinda music than by all means, knock your self out. whatever floats your boat I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite...","review":"I own albums preceeding this one as well as Doomsday Machine that came after and I must say I'm a bit confused after hearing this. Angela's vocals are just as good as ever but the music is a bit disappointing. There are some allusions to Metallica and Megadeth thrown in with material that is unique to this band but when you compare the music to Wages of Sin or Doomsday Machine the intensity and creativity is missing. The albums from before they had Angela in the band were all but ruined by their lame male vocalist who sounds like a dying mule but at least the music was inspired and way more creative than this. Tracks like Instinct on this album are rediculously simplistic and really just not up to par for a band as talented as this. Its still half way decent when compared to albums by some other metal bands but i don't recommend buying this if you're a fan of AE's other work."},{"rating":"2","title":"finally a band that changed for the better","review":"now matter how hard i tried, i couldnt get into the old arch enemy with the male singer. when i heard back in 2000 that he left, i was anxious to hear the new vocalist, and when i found out it was a woman i was stunned to hear her performance. she blows most male vocalists out the door. this cd along with wages of sin showed a great improvement in song writiing and techincality. melodic death/progressive at its best"},{"rating":"2","title":"could be better","review":"First of all try and ignore the mainstream poser that gave this album a one.This a good album but it doesn't quite match up to their previous release Wages of Sin.The guitars are incredible and great drumming.Angela Gossow sounded better on Wages of Sin.If you are a TRUE METAL fan pick this one up and Wages of Sin;you wont regret it.But if youre into the mainstream crap, you should go hang out with Fred Durst's buddy and listen to the radio together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arch enemy is one the best death metal today","review":"Arch Enemy is one the best there is rigth now. Why because the singer is so out of this world and the drum faster and faster then before same with the guitar are unique. Look everybody are so critic that Arch enemy is not metal man is arch E is not metal so what is metal today?. Other thing that in flame is better in flames is good but the in flame of now is nothing compare with arch enemy the only band that is better that In flames and Arch Enemy is the best Band of all time is Linkin Park hahaha I am Joking Is NEVERMORE This a Band but Arch Enemy is my 2 band so purchase this CD ^m^(oo)^m^"},{"rating":"2","title":"Got $13.99? Spend it on this!","review":"Arch Enemy's new realease is awe inspiring. The guitar on the CD is simply brilliant. The drums, are more melodic and black than ever before. Angela is completey awesome at the mic. This CD is just jam packed with #1 potential. It has already hit the top of the charts all over Europe and Japan. If you don't purchase this, you're missing out. Notable songs to check out are: We Will Rise, Leader of the Rats, Instinct, and so many more. If you make one purchase this year, make this it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metal Fan","review":"I have been a fan of the Gothenburg metal scene for only half a year now and am thoroughly impressed with the bands associated with it. I'm a fan of In Flames, Soilwork, Children of Bodom, Norther (maybe those two don't fit, but they're similar), and now Arch Enemy. I was blown away by this album and look forward to listening to their earlier work.By the way, this \\"Fred Durst's Numba one Fan\\" you're all so pissed at is probably a haughty metal nerd just like us. He's obviously playing a prank, so don't get so angry, just laugh at his parody of the vapid, commercialized landscaped that is pop music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Explosion","review":"If there was any doubt as to the power and fury of Arch Enemy this album puts all of that to rest. Starting with the ominous tones of \\"Tear Down the Walls,\\" Angela and the band proceed to do just that with the explosive track \\"Silent Wars.\\" Any appriciative metal fan will find the energy of this album electric and the force with which its will is imposed upon the listener is truly awe inspiring. The lyrics speak of breaking from the norm to create a unique barrier shattering expierience. Beyond the superb musicianship and clever lyrics is the awsome presence of Angela Gossow. Her bone jarring voice truly causes walls to crumble with its sonic fury. She must be spawned from some nether realm because her tones are un earthly."},{"rating":"2","title":"arch enemy, anthems of rebellion..","review":"This is one of those cd's that you cant imagine being any more perfect, wonderful songs, great solos, and who would of ever thought a chick could growl that good.

While some bands (Soilwork) may disappoint with a new release AE does not , 10 blistering tracks that literally kick the sh*t out of you each time you listen to the CD. Female vocals that make Kitty wish they were as bada$$ as AE , double bass that could easily wake the dead !Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre","review":"Now, i dont want people to think i dont like melodic deathmetal only because i dont enjoy a.e.'s music...Arch enemy never realy impressed me to be honest--i can't get into their sound and i never could...If any thing ? They only bored me to death! I know plenty of melodic bands that aren't mediocre & will give Ae a run for their money--example ? Darktranquility,vehemence,children of bodom,darkane,in-flames,old mans child--well,there you guys go! Now, that i have given you an reason to stop support crap & such a mediocre abnd like arch enemy...Just stop supporting them!

Several of the stories really stayed with me and I've been trying to find the book ever since. Finally, I asked the librarian at my school (who is nothing short of amazing) what little I remembered about this book - it was published sometime in the 1930s or 40s, it was a collection of work from Esquire and that it included Hemingway's \\"The Snows of Kilimanjaro\\". Shockingly, she was able to find it and via Amazon Marketplace, I had it in my hands three days later.It was worth waiting for.These are essays and stories that for the most part, would never be included in an anthology today - they are too much of their time; their humor is too quirky - but that is exactly why I love them. Reading at its best transports you to another time and place and these stories do that.Read it.

The whole engineering of this thing was badly done. I can see alternatives in my mind that certainly would work better than the design of this product.The whole point of core/plug aerating is to produce a plug.. not compound the problem by smashing holes in your lawn and compacting it more - you could just use a spike aerator for this and avoid the compacting problem. Core aeration should bring the bottom soil to the surface and not clog on the first operation. Too much work to constantly unclog it.. so you end up 'aerating' the lawn by pushing a hole... not cutting a hole.Basically a waste of money if you want true core aeration. As mentioned previously, you are better off taking your money and going to a rental shop and renting a 'real' gas powered aerator for same amount."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lawn Bully","review":"This worked out great.

After reading the purpose of their oath it doesn't really stand to wonder what this sinister organisation is all about.From a historical point of view to nobleman and women who have stood up against relentless tyranny from the society of Jesus, it is poignant to say the least that our hero's who stood up to this filth such Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, Benito Pablo Juarez, JFK and Oliver Cromwell to name a few, ended their lives by either the poison cup or the lead bullet from the Jesuits.I take my hat off to the author for sharing his profound work.

He barely inserts appropriate pauses, and the information is just brutally hard to pay attention to and follow.While the actual information to the book may be alright, I would not recommend the audiobook to anyone.The only information I've truthfully ascertained is that at the end of the day, if you have a serious idea or trademark issue, you need to find a patent attorney.

Michael Lechter may indeed be a very bright guy and a star in his field, but he is an absolutely horrendous writer. The intro by Robert Kiyosaki was the only really enjoyable part to the book. Lechter immediately jumped into complex explanations of the various types of IP protection available without really clarifying anything for the lay person like me. And no real life examples of anything -- just references to a couple hypothetical \\"horror stories\\" that he relays at the beginning of the book. The only reason I gave this book 2 stars and not 1 is because at the very least I was able to get some basic definitions of IP terms down.

An educated layperson or non-Christian could read this with profit. Soards keeps the technical matters of lexicography, archaeology and grammar to endnotes. In the text itself he gives a careful, if conventional, verse-by-verse commentary. This volume surpasses Morris in the Tyndale series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Narrow and compilative overview of Judaic mysticism","review":"The book is written by the former President of the Israeli Academy of Sciences. It reflects traditional Orthodox view on the greatest pages in the Jewish history - Qabbalah, Shabtay Zvi and Hasidism, with a slight covering of scientific speculations. Qabbalah is described without any connection or association with the Egyptian or Chaldean mysticism. No word is said about the great Jewish gnostics. The only question is if the author consciously lies or subconsciously avoids problems, which still remain out of the Israeli national concensus."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Scholarly Look at Mysticism","review":"For those of you who want to understand where and how the major trends in Kabbalism developed, look no further. This book covers all of the major ideas in their proper historical context, from Gnosticism to Hasidism.The author's concept or purpose is to dispel many of the misleading, and speculative notions on the nature of Jewish mysticism. In the process, taking the mystical/magical portions for the most part out of the equation.What I like best about Scholem's work is that he is not so concerned with what the meaning of each Kabbalistic notion but is primarily concerned with where it originated and what circumstances allowed for the development of an idea. This allows for an objective and unbiased consideration of the concept being studied.What you won't get in this book that you will find in most others about this subject is the promotion thereof. No evangelical tendencies exist which make for a more throrough reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mysticism Without Obfuscation","review":"What I love best about Scholem is that he wrote eloquently about spiritual enlightenment without presenting himself as being a mystical master or guru. He will guide you through the history of Jewish esoteric thought, after which you can sample some source texts (many of which now are available in English translation). No preaching here - just good scholarly thought and clear, eloquent writing. It's also amazing how a 60-year old volume remains the standard introduction while still being regarded as controversial in fundamentalist quarters.

While this may make some think my review would be biased, it's actually the complete opposite. I am even more critical of the music because of this.Tone is a unique band to say the least. They are a an all-instrumental group consisting of 2 drummers, a bassist, and 5 (!!!!) guitarists. The result is an impressive wall of sound. The depth that is provided by the layers and layers of guitars is amazing. Most of the songs start \\"slow\\", and build with a steady progression, until finally exploding.

I think what really offended me about this book is at the top there is a comment from Tyson Blue who says \\"Impressive...Better than Anne Rice!\\". Let me tell you, this book is neither impress nor is Gail Petersen a better author than Anne Rice. This book just oozes cheese.There is nothing worse than the cartoonish caricature of a vampire being a musician. Anne Rice made this ridiculous stereotype more interesting with her eloquent writing while Gail Petersen just made me wretch with this book. How many times must the public endure the same ol' crud like the character Kate stuck in limbo with her so-called \\"suffering\\"? This storyline (if you want to call it) is laughable and the writing was a bigger joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started well then ....","review":"I really wanted to like this book. It started out well enough and I almost gave it 3 stars. However, I asked myself if I'd recommend this book to anyone and changed to 2 stars. The beginning started out well and I really liked the interaction between Justin and Kate. I did find Kate's struggle with Vampirism interesting. But, when Kate decided to become a rock star the book took, IMO, a turn for the worse. It was too contrived. When I did get to the end of the book it started to pick up again, but with only a few chapters left. The book would have been much better without the rock star section which was a big chunk of the story and expanding on the evil doctor and Justin relationship. I think Gail decided to write about what she was most comfortable with (rock n roll bands) than what could have been a great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for any orchid fan/grower!","review":"This is a very lovely charm.

Yet 80 years ago, almost all school children were taught about this incident.And what's more important--It really happened, it's verifiable, and it was COMMON KNOWLEGE to Colonists during the Revolutionary War era. This is one of the reasons so many people had such trust in George Washington during the Revolutionary War and afterwards. They knew that he was protected by God.This booklet gives the account of the battle in which General George Braddock is ambushed during the French and Indian War. General Braddock is killed and all of the mounted officers are killed or wounded except ONE (George Washington).

I'm sure Hebborn would have infuriated me, in person. But the guy could write! I come across hardly any art books, especially by artists, that are written in an engaging everyday style. Hebborn could have been a journalist, but he just happened to be poor-born, misfitted, delinquent, driven, selfish, witty, and a bloody genius with pencil and paintbrush. I think I have read it cover to cover five times, always with pleasure. I find myself agreeing 95% with Hebborn's pronouncements; the missing 5% concerns what seem to be excuses and evasions. It is also a terrific guide through art history, and through art education. You don't have to be schooled in art to enjoy and learn from this book.

Every so often he includes a couple of sentences that describe details that I found sublime. The characters and their relationships are complex and interesting, and as mentioned in the other reviews the book might remind you of Stand By Me or Richard Laymon's Travelling Vampire Show. While there are hints of what's to come, the first half of the book is the characters being fleshed out as they spend a summer on the coast of Maine. The Ketchum depravity that follows is up to par. This book also reminded me of Laymon's Night in Lonesome October.A night of fun trespassing in a haunted house--What could possibly go wrong?"},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed - Audiobook","review":"I wanted to stop; but had read all the reviews where it gets better and very scary toward the end.So I trudged on.It was slow and boring to begin with and worthy of eye rolling toward the end.Too many other good books out there to ever read another one of his."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay","review":"it was a quick and easy read. a bit predictable - reminded me of his offseason&offspring books, minus the gore. not scary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Ketchum...Tremendous!!!","review":"Vintage Ketchum. Starts out innocently enough, then WHAM! This one took a little bit longer to get going than some of his other works, but just as is with everything else that he's written, once you reach \\"that point\\" there's no turning back! A little bit like \\"Ketchum Light\\". Not as intense as \\"The Girl Next Door\\" or as disturbing as \\"Stranglehold\\" or as overtly violent and disgusting as \\"Offspring\\", this is still an excellent addition to your Ketchum library, and is well worth searching out and reading (it's now OP).

There are many cameos from old TV show stars in this film, but they are not all that memorable.

I looked forward to watching it each summer. BACK TO THE BEACH pokes fun at it's two lead stars - Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello (who produced this film). This is part of the hilarity of this film. It spoofs the beach films for which the stars are famous for. This would be Annette Funicello's last theatrical release before her multiples sclurosis sets in. She has the greater parts in this movie. One highlight in the song \\"Jamaica Ska\\" for which she sings and dances. What you have to remember is that all the cheesy dialogue and lame jokes are intentional.

First off, Annette's name in the Beach Party movies was Dee Dee (although, Frankie was still Frankie.) This was really a spoof of a spoof, y'know? Because, the beach movies were campy as get out to start with, but, they had an adorable quality to them, and a specific formula: Frankie does something stupid, Dee Dee gets mad. They flirt with other people to make each-other insanely jealous. They make up. (Yes, this happened here, too, but... meh.) And, where was Dead-Head, Animal, Candy, the Von Zipper Gang, for pity's sake? And, what was with Pee Wee Herman???

I also love 80's movies but this was the worst movie ever. Annette was too nice to Frankie in the original movies she would have been with a different guy in 2 minutes after she saw Frankie with that other girl. Also they wouldn't take all the [stuff] they got from Bobby, their bratty son. Frankie would have also started a rumble between the surfers and the bikers. There was no cheesey songs either.

This movie was so bad I was trying to gouge out my eyes with a box of \\"Dots\\". It's very slow and painful, the only worse movie publicly available would be Manos: The Hands of Fate which at least has a redeeming quality in that it ends sooner than this horrid waste of a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a masterpiece of post-modernism!","review":"Gosh, I love this movie. It was my personal candidate for movie of the year when it came out in 1987. If postmodernism--nicely described by Umberto Eco as the \\"ironic discovery of the past\\" or words to that effect--can be absolute pure unadulterated pleasure, this is it. The underlying concept--that the Franklie / Annette beach had not changed an iota since they left--has to be one of the great pop movie ideas of all time. The whole film is beyond criticism--everyone is, quite simply, perfection.For a really, shall we say, enjoyable double feature, couple this with Psycho Beach Party."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pajama Party","review":"I love this movie.

The film tries to loosely have some kind of \\"hell\\" theme by continuously referring to $6.66 as payment for different items they buy along the way. We get it. You didn't have to do it 7 times. I wasn't sure exactly what theme the writer was trying to convey, but it doesn't matter because the story it was based on was so bad anyway.

The store clerk said he found the movie to be disturbing, and it wasn't good at all, and told me to tell him what I thought about it next time I was in the store. My answer: I'll bet you liked it better than I did. Maybe I'm a redneck who can't relate to this movie, but that's fine by me.

The young and stupid will think it speaks to their generation, the old folks will wonder what's the matter with kids these days, and the discriminating viewer will go for the stop button. Leave this one alone--it's dangerous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Top of the list.","review":"This movie easily tops the list as the worst movie I have ever seen. There has never been a more grotesque or ridiculously disgusting movie ever made. Anybody who gives this movie any positive credit should seriously have their head examined. The violent and sexual content involved in this movie deserve much worse than an \\"R\\" rating. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE YOU WILL REGRET IT. Movie-going will never be the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just plain bad","review":"This is the most unexciting and vapid movie I have ever seen. Bad dialogue, bad direction, and an overdone storyline. You might like this movie if you are a 12 year old stoner which wouldn't be old enough to watch this vile piece of garbage anyway. Now I know why I found this movie in the horror section of the video store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I give it ZERO stars","review":"movie sucked, plain and simple.Kaboom sucked as well.Folks can form their own opinion after watching it but I would give this and Kaboom Negative stars if I could.I almost feel the director should pay me for wasting time watching his junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark, Sexy, Violent..........a mind blowing trip!!","review":"What a trip!! Rose Mcgowan is such a great actress - her present in movies is such a credit. Her dark, seductive character keeps the danger going the entire way through. And James Duval as the troubled and caring boyfriend who experiments and discovers throughout the film. The non stop thrills - violence, sex and death make this movie entertainment heaven from beginning to end. Meeting the dark and sexy Xavier turns their whole night into a never ending spiral of adrenalin. Totally recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DANGER, BEWARE THIS MOVIE !!!!","review":"Danger is what makes this fim so alluring. Whether it be in he form of physical, emotional, or even sexual, danger lurks around every corner in this movie. And to make things even more horrific, Araki masterfully blurs the lines between good and evil, so much that the viewer is unable to separate herself from the film's misunderstood characters. This is one of the most fantastic movies I have ever seen and it should not be missed by anyone period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch it now!","review":"Low budget filmmaking that uses up it's resources like an anorexic teen eats a Tic Tac. It is required viewing and I've passed my copy around to all my friends so they can experience the movie for themselves. Yeah, sure, it's kind of gross and the homosexual themes aren't for everybody. But it's a fast, frenzied ride that will leave you with your jaw dropped, especially after the last scene. I believe that it was a French-American co-production and the movie really doesn't have a lot to say about the youth of United States... the main characters' last names, as we find out in the credits, are Red, White, and Blue. There's so much here to slurp up and analyze, yet it's such fluff that you don't have to have a brain to take it all in. I can't say enough about it. Okay, let me say one last thing. Don't watch it with your parents... I did the first time I saw it (on Thanksgiving no less) and it was a mistake! However, you laugh, you gasp, you scream! Watching it has changed my life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarassing","review":"It's almost bad to the point of being funny.It's almost a parody of indie movies. Actors staring into space saying lines like \\"life is boring\\". Shots into the windshield of a car while the vixen in black sunglasses dives through the desert. Shallow one-dimensional bad guys, even shallower nihilistic bisexual club kids..It has it all. Perhaps if I was 20 years old, went to art school, and did a lot of X I'd find it amazing.I'm tacking on a star just for the beauty of the actors/actresses, and the general style of the film. Everyone did look super cool.

In fairness, Araki's \\"The Living End\\" is much more honest and engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is doomed","review":"If you like bad dialogue, bad acting, and bad directing, then this is the film for you. The characters are brainless and annoying. The plot is pointless and unfocused. I didn't care what happened to anyone in this film. I only watched it to the end because I had nothing else to do. Even the appearance of Parker Posey could not save this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"romping-stomping awesome crazy!","review":"This movie is one of the most messed-up, but at the same time, kickin' movies of all time.

You will wish you never saw it. Also on the list: U Turn"},{"rating":"2","title":"Active viewers only","review":"The thing I think that says the most about this movie is the ratings I've seen so far- while browsing and looking at the ratings and comments, it is apparent that Gregg Araki has done his job well. 95% or more of the ratings are 5 stars or 1- which is quite telling- Anything people either love or hate certainly affects them. I'd personally hate to make a movie everyone agreed was okay. I'd rather have some people loathe it and others adore it. In any case, this violent movie is an examination at catharsis, self discovery, and is perhaps best for people who are educated yet able to think for themselves. Teens will love it- although perhaps many won't \\"get it,\\" and most open-minded analysts will be provoked to.... thought. Perhaps that's what scares so many people off. Not a movie for people who don't like violence and/or wish to be entertained whilst sitting and picking their nose."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed this Movie a lot","review":"Doom Generation is my type of movie. It is not for those weak of heart, but for all of the people who enjoy getting lost in a world not quite our own, it's a winner. The plot twists and turns in nearly every direction and never fails to astonish. The ending will take just about everyone by suprise. If you enjoy pretty young slackers, who act quite well, getting into and out of the most amazing predicaments, then this is a movie for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake art","review":"Don't judge a film by the bands on its soundtrack. Doom Generation includes songs by early-90's art-rock giants like Lush, Cocteau Twins and Jesus and Mary Chain, but the film has little else to recommend it. Boring, arch and unfunny, it's the sort of movie you might keep watching because you think it HAS to get better. It doesn't. I'm a big fan of subversive cinema, and this aint it.The 3 principal actors give fine performances, considering the godawful material. The DVD edition contains no bonus material, is not widescreen; sound and image quality are comparable to VHS."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies I've ever seen","review":"There is some decent acting in this movie but aside from that, it's complete garbage. I hate it all the more for trying so hard to be hip and in-your-face. It almost dares you to hate it if only to cover up for its consistent lack of quality. I don't hate this movie because it's shocking, I hate it because it thinks it's so shocking."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie I've ever seen","review":"I could make a list of 50 reasons why this movie is the worst road movie ever made. The first one is probably the fact there's no story. It's supposed to be a road movie and they spend quite some time on a car but they go nowhere, they are not afraid. They kill but they are never caught, never really worried. In the middle of the movie we hear about the polcie but we never hear of them again. The movie in itself is very repetitive: They kill, they have sex and they supposely go 'deeper'. First it's alright but when it continues 5 minutes before the end of the movie (very short, 80 minutes), you know there's something going wrong. I think the only \\"central\\" point of this movie is sex. I don't know if it's supposed to have psychological issues but I know you'll waste 80 minutes of your life if you see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Boring.

Poor plot, poor movement, poor writing. You get the idea. Waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dooming review...","review":"Doom Generation is a blank. If you watch it, you will be wasting time and money. Natural Born Killers is much better in every category than this flop, which is one of the worst films I have ever seen. 666 repeated? Head flying off? Shearing body parts? Yes, all here. Unfortunately, this movie has pathetic characters, dialogue, and script. It's too bad that people as talentless as this director get to make movies while skilled directors like Sean Penn have to struggle to direct movies. This movie is pitiful in every sense of the word. If you watch this movie, you will never forgive yourself...you may even lose brain cells in the course of the experience. I would give this negative stars, but, unfortunately, that was not an option.If you want violence done in a psychedelic way, watch Natural Born Killers. Better yet watch A Clockwork Orange. Ultimately, my advice is this: Consider jumping in the shark tank at the zoo before you consider watching this horrible excuse for a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS MOVIS IS HORRIBLE","review":"i love indie movies, but this ... i cant even describe it....

It used a lot of leftover scenes from the 1st movie, \\"Angela\\" floating in the halls, to name one thing. I guess the religion thing kind of made this movie less desirable. It had potential, but it couldn't quite do what the first movie did. It didn't really create that Halloween ambiance like the first, the house didn't seem as creepy to me, and the kills were a bit BLAH. It's not a bad movie but...the first is better and why in the world this one is MORE EXPENSIVE is beyond me. It's worth adding to your horror collection if you can pick it up for like 5.00-8.00 or something, maybe. I'm more of a zombie fan anyhoo, not a demon/ghost movie type person. I guess I thought since the first was really good that this would be too, wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I saw the first one a long time ago and it was excellent.

After watching that I wanted to cry, it had made a complete mockery of the first one and although I did like a couple parts, mostly it ... . The house in the beginning was ... because instead of a wall they had a picket fence! Man if there was a picket fence the first one would have had just a few less casualties.

And of course, this founded that really annoying form of music you'd hear in 1950's-1990's british TV shows. A classic example is Mr. Bean. You cold say that this film is a landmark film for its time.I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!PS Also with the cover art, it has a picture of Claude Rains and the female star, Marta Toren.

He kind of just needs to move things along and make his point, then he could be free to speak as much as he would like on all the other stuff. Even Friere himself admitted much later on, that some of his stuff was inaccessible. it must be hard to love all the great philosophers and not aspire to write the same kind of neurotic diatribe.

I guess Ingersoll Rand has lost its quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ingersoll-Rand website doesn't match documentation","review":"After much research, and reading everyone's reviews, I purchased the IR 2130. I opted for the 2130 over the 2132 because based on information on Amazon and Ingersoll-Rand corporate website, it appeared the specs for two were very closely matched, and I couldn't justify spending the extra money. However, to my surprise, when I received the 2130 today and actually read the owner's manual, it states the recommended FWD torque range is 25 to 350 ft.lbs. However, the corporate website shows the FWD torque range is 50 to 500 ft.lbs. So what's the real value? And why such a huge difference between the website information, and the actual owner's manual? I expected a little better consistency from IR's communication."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I am very disappointed with this tool. It works hard just to take off medium-torque lug nuts. It could barely break loose a ball joint on my Dakota using an impact-driven ball-joint separator. This is marketed as a \\"heavy duty\\" impact wrench?!? What a joke! If I ever have a son I will let him use this to work on his tricycle but otherwise this is not fit for work in ANY kind of garage. The 550 ft-lb rating is only in reverse. It can only tighten to 350 ft lbs. I am very doubtful of those figures. It sems to apply the same amount of torque as my 20 year-old rockwell I bought at a garage sale for $5. Also, the manual states that to achieve the full torque output, you need 22 CFMs from your air compressor. I'm not going to go buy a $3000 compressor just to run this piece of crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good air impact","review":"I like the impact gun, could use more power.

I did some research and this impact wrench had good specs for the SCFM rating I could support. Just changed my timing belt last weekend and it was great for removing the wheel, motor mount, crankshaft pulley bolt etc. The IR is short enough that it fits into most places you'd expect to use an impact wrench. Also, it fits well in my hands and has a solid feel.There are three power settings on the back. The counterclockwise rotation is full force regardless of the setting. With the middle setting, my lugnuts go on just a bit tighter than spec, so I actually avoid using a torque wrench when I use this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent impact for the money.","review":"I purchased this impact to replace a cheap HF impact that was pretty weak. Ingersoll-Rand has been making air tools for a long time and this tool exhibits that experience. It is fairly light and comfortable to use. The plastic parts that help keep it light feel solid and it feels like it will last. The torque selecting switch is a little stiff, but may loosen up over time. I have used to to dismantle several old cars and I have not found a bolt it would not loosen or twist off yet. Perfect for all home garages and most likely professionals as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really???","review":"I purchased the impact for the 550 ft lbs. The impact was not at all powerfull.

I wanted to be in control; I just didn't know how to do it.Then I came across this wonderful book by Manuel J Smith, with its pragmatic advice; that we all have \\"assertive rights\\" to do what we want to do, with no apologies (excluding malicious or illegal behavior). How does it work?Example: \\"Do you want to go to Aunt Mildred's tea party?\\" - \\"No thanks!\\"Wasn't that easy? Buy this book; read it and heed it.

Since it was first published in 1975 I have given away several of these books and gotten as many \\"thank yous.\\" I still use the techniques and 35 years later they still work.The book was shipped quicker than promised, and was exactly as it was described.

Thank God I learned these skills before I had to deal with insurance companies about my long term illness. These techniques work great with insurance companies! Especially the broken record technique. It is amazing how few \\"no\\"s an insurance rep has! <smile> I have read almost all books on the subject (I have my masters in communication), and this is still the best one out there!

Since over one fourth of the women of child-bearing age in America have had one or more abortions, you probably know one of abortion's Second Victims. In this book you will travel the devastating road of abortion with someone who tells of the horror firsthand. Twenty years ago Pam Koerbel chose abortion, and the experience crippled her emotionally for years. After finally discovering freedom from the guilt, anger, and shame, Pam thoroughly researched the problem of the Second Victim. In her book she lets you see into the minds and hearts of other Second Victims and goes on to show how women can find freedom from the horrible aftermath of abortion and experience peace and forgiveness.

It is almost as if someone got only the physical descriptions of the characters and maybe a few catch phrases and then decided to write something they deemed worthy of Star Trek canon. Instead of her deciding how the characters felt (and in such depth), maybe she could have treated them more superficially until official canon had developed them.

So when I go on vacation to Disneyland with my kids, I am not worried about the life of my batteries.Instead I can have the time of my life and get great photos!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera easy to use","review":"This camera is very easy to use, and the color pictures look great! It came with everything I needed to get started right out of the box.I also got larger a xD memory card (128MB or higher would be about right), a charger, 2 sets re-chargeable batteries, and now I'm set! It's a keeper! There's also an waterproof/underwater housing for it as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera","review":"I bought this camera for $229, and i think its a really good deal. i really like this camera because its small, easy to carry around, takes great pictures, and is handy wherever its needed.People give this camera bad reviews for its battery life. well, this is a digital camera, like most other digital cameras, this of course will eat normal alkaline batteries like pop corn, thats why you spend a little money to buy the lithium crv3 or the Ni-MH batteries. As for me, i prefer the Ni-MH batteries because not only are they powerful, but also rechargable. i got 4 batteries, and a charger at radio shack for about 26$ (including tax).so giving this camera bad reviews for batteries is just dumb. anyway, again, i like this camera a lot, and it takes great high quality pictures, just not always, but even the best of cameras wont always take the best photos in the world all the time.hope you enjoy this camera more than i do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed...","review":"We had a Olympus 35mm camera, liked it, thought it would be good to get a digital one, went on a trip to Black Hills with it, found these DISPPOINTING facts with this D560:1. BATTERIES: It drains up battery like sponge soaking up water! I put in a brand new 2 AA Energizer batteries, 5 pictures later, it started beeping, indicating low batteries, each shot after that I had to wait till it recovers with full power!2. Picture Qualities: We took pictures of grassland and buffalos, they all turned out mooshy! You can't tell it's grass other than a big patch of fuzzy green stuff, the buffalos turned out to be a fuzzy dark buffalo shadow! (By the way, I tried all different modes) - What a joke!3. Lens sliding door - it's so flumzy, yet you have to really slide hard to shut it, some time you'd be worried it's broken!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and overpriced","review":"I usually like Olympus products, but this camera falls short of all marks. The pix are blurred, no matter how high you set the resolution. The macro is fussy and quickly blurs under 7 inches. The macro is also blurred. None of the pix could withstand magnification. True, they didn't pixellate until over 200%, but even at 75% they were just plain not in focus. Olympus blew it on this one. Don't buy it, it's a waste of money, even for casual photos. The only good thing is the software, which is fantastic, but even it can't fix the poor quality of the photos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Olympus D-560","review":"This turned out to be the worst Digital Camera I have PurchasedBought this as a second easy to carry low price $ 229.00 and found that the picture quality is good only in daylight.

Maybe I had a lemon, But could not wait to return it the next day.. Would not recommend this model Olympus"},{"rating":"1","title":"unsatisfying deal","review":"Camera has good features and software, but after 2 days of usage, two defects make it an unsatisfying deal:1)Battery life-time is ridiculous. To add insult, camera comes with no charger nor adapter.2)Optical viewfinder is worthless, does not allow to frame a shot. Its angle is strikingly smaller that the actual zoom/lens angle. You cannot frame a shot unless you use the LCD viewfinder screen, which entails holding the camera away from face, resulting in more unsteady/blurry shots."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have to agree with Bob's review","review":"This is a great little digital camera for the money and I haven't had any problems since putting in the Ni-MH rechargeable batteries, though I didn't like that the original batteries died within like a month.Everything else about this digital camera is up to par for me, including easy set-up and use. Basically, you should have a nice set of good rechargeable batteries for something like this ANYWAYS, as you're going to always want batteries that work in a camera, so why not splurge a bit initially so you don't have to pay a fortune down the line?"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are far better compilation discs out there.","review":"I was drawn to this 2-CD set because of names like Moby, Static Revenger, DJ Quicksilver, ATB and Underworld, but on listening to it all the way through, I found it less-than-stimulating. I can't imagine it being a crowd-wower at parties, despite several good songs. It's simply too generic. At one point it started to sound like something you could hear in a department store. Frightening. And as for those of you who just like to listen to dance music - don't bother.I mean, if you wanna throw a beginner-techno party off the cuff, maybe try Got Dance? but if you know what you're doing, look for something with a lot more substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"You must know Latin and/or Greek to use this book.","review":"Well organized but if you are looking for a book that gives you the Greek/Latin origins of English words this is not it.

Instead, look for the Chambers Dictionary of Etymology, or Raymond E. Laurita's 1001 Affixes and their meanings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get to the Roots With This Book","review":"When teaching Greek and Latin roots and affixes, this book is a great resource for students and educators. This book helps students learn roots and affixes in context, which means the knowledge they acquire is lasting. This book has become a keystone in my seventh grade classroom; we conduct word studies rather often, and students do have their favorite resources. This book is valued in small group discussions and independent inquiry done by students who seek enrichment activities. One copy of this book is not enough because every small group wants to use it. I have five copies to help keep the peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inadequate and inaccurate","review":"Do not waste your money on this book. Though it purports to be 'a comprehensive guide to the classical origins of English words', one might better subtitle it 'a scanty collection of classical roots and a few English derivatives of each of them, with ludicrous amounts of space wasted on limp example sentences and excessively verbose explanatory notes for page-padding.' This book's intended audience seems to be the semi-illiterate; and judging by the typographical errors and even etymological errors sprinkled liberally throughout, its authors were as well. Spare your intelligence the insult and buy a good dictionary instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy read for elementary students, but beyond that age, not very enjoyable.","review":"From the moment I started reading this book until the end of the book, I could predict everything that was going to happen; In other words, this book was too full of cliches for my liking. I personally love fantasy, and I hoped to read some fresh materials, but this book definitely did not bring anything new.Starting with Gabrielle's mysterious birth to the generic plot line, I felt like I was just reading a poorly-written (and sappy) romance novel. I honestly could not read more than 50 pages per day because of the sappiness in some parts.Overall, the story is extremely simple, very easy to follow (and foreshadow), and cliche, so I would only suggest elementary school kids or ESL students to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice train to add to our collection!","review":"My son loves Thomas the Train.

It arrived with the clear plastic cracked on the sides. I returned that today and received the replacement today. The replacement is ALSO cracked. There is no cushioning for this item in the box - only the clear plastic bag it comes in - so no wonder they're broken. I have asked for a refund, and suggest that anyone looking to purchase an item like this (which otherwise looks like it would do what it's supposed to) someplace that doesn't require shipping or properly packages their items for shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"I used this carrier to take some cupcakes to a birthday party that my friend was giving for her daughter. I placed the carriers in the trunk of a car and we traveled from Brooklyn to Manhattan and back. I was pleased to see that the cakes didn't just survive the trip, but they looked the same as when I packed them. The top part of the carrier was great, but the metal bottom part gave me some trouble getting the cupcakes out. The carrier was easy to transport, and can take a few bumps without messing the contents up.Unfortunately, the second day I had them, the latch on one of them broke off, however I was able to reattatch it easily. Also, when placing the top level over the bottom, you do run the risk of smudging the sides of the bottom layer because they have to align perfectly, and you might not notice the alignment is off until you try to close it.I am still happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exacly durable","review":"I am a target shopper. I also make alot of cupcakes for my children's school parties. So I bought two. I was very disappointed. There is not alot of room for frosting on the bottom layer of cupcakes. Plus the red divider that holds the top cupcakes bows under the weight when it is filled with the cupcakes. Hence, smashed frosting on the bottom cupcakes. I expected better quality from Target. This is definently a Walmart product. I should have looked a little closer to the Oneida carrier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a different one!","review":"I used this once and it did work well for transporting the cupcakes; however, the latch broke on mine the second time I used it. It was easy to fix that, but then the plastic also broke around the latch. I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Design","review":"This carrier is useless! The bottom layer of cupcakes is difficult to remove without smudging the frosting, since holes used for baking are much deeper than the holes should be in a cupcake carrier, plus the bottom layer also frequently gets ruined by the top layer.

Well, I bought the other one thinking I'd return it if I indeed found a cheaper alternative.Well, about a month later sure enough, she found me one and bought it. I used it for the first time this week. I hate this thing!The red top carrier bows under the weight of the cupcakes, doesn't sit securely on the bottom, and I can't stand the bottom.Another reviewer said getting cupcakes out of the bottom gave her a little trouble. I'm gonna be real, I could not get the things out of there without sticking my fingers all in the frosting. I gave it two stars because it does keep them safe while traveling, I have to give them that. But I hate this thing. Look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragile and inconvenient","review":"I was given this as a gift and it gets my cupcakes from point A to point B, but I wouldn't recommend it. The bottom pan is too deep to get out decorated cupcakes without messing them up. The biggest problem though is that it is fragile. One of the raised pieces on the top level broke when bumped, and the two latches break off all the time. It's a flimsy piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless you have suffered from addiction, don't bother","review":"Extremely disappointing and even frustrating at times since this book emphasizes on addictions and recovery - from addictions.When I purchased this book I thought that recovery meant turning things around - no matter what the cause might have been. This book mentions over and again addictions which makes it all the more difficult to relate if you have never gone down that road.I wouldn't recommend it unless you are a recovering alcoholic or are considering taking part in a 12 step programs.For all others, check out ''Sex Smart - How your childhood shaped your sexuality and what to do about it'', you might find it more enlightning."},{"rating":"1","title":"PHONEY-BALONEY","review":"I thought this book went overboard. Emphasis on the nitty-gritty. Reduces to clinical -- what is so much more. Biased. Posturing her own perceptions.

Spenser starts to pull the string and the mystery slowly, but eventually, unravels. We get all the usual twists and turns in the case, along with Spenser&#65533;s wit. People try to kill Spenser, but you know that&#65533;s not a good idea, especially with Hawk around. We even get a cameo appearance by Jesse Stone, a character in another Parker series.All in all a very satisfying addition to the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"Pure Parker...but so much less of it! Talk about churning out a novel for money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing new here","review":"Spenser's asked to solve an old murder. He's paid six donuts.

Any questions?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Spenser retire?","review":"If you're from the Boston area, and you haven't read at least a couple of Spencer novels, you're missing a cultural icon. Boston and environs are as much a star as the erudite ex-boxer turned detective, Spencer.This is the 30th book of the Spencer series, and it's tired and formulaic. There's no real tension, the ending isn't particularly surprising (or interesting). It's not clear to me if the characterizations would hold at all if you hadn't read some of the other Spencer books.Maybe it's time for Spencer to retire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing, funny.................never predictable!!!","review":"Robert Parker has yet another great Spenser novel to add to his success list. In Back Story, Spenser agrees to investigate a 28 year old unsolved murder. As he begins to investigate the murder, many unexpected facets appear. The FBI, an aging but very dangerous mobster, a hitman, college radicals and several ex-cons appear and disappear, putting Spenser and the love of his life in extreme danger. Hawk, his friend and most reliable co-conspirator, steps in to act as a bodyguard and to help him unravel the threads of this case. The characters are all there from previous books, even one from another series by Parker and as always they all mesh perfectly to create a novel that is both intriguing and funny. The lines of dialogue are great, the reactions so honest and dealing with unexpected answers only heightens the tension of this novel. Robert Parker is a reliable author, but he is never predictable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Reunion With Old Friends","review":"For those of you who are already fans of Parker's witty, aging detective, Spenser, this is another classic tale. Spenser's assignment, the murder of a woman twenty-eight years ago, lacks freshness. But, the chance to meet up again with some of the classic characters - Spenser, Susan, Hawk, Quirk, Vinnie - is well worth the read. They are as charming and multi-faceted as ever. Their faults are human and their loyalties unshakeable.For those who are new to the Spenser series, this novel may appear lacking. It requires at least some familiarity with the characters to really understand what's going on. Otherwise, things like Spenser's agreeing to take on a dangerous case and risk his own life for six Krispy Kreme donuts may seem implausible. However, Spenser and his contacts are worth getting to know. I would recommend to anyone new to the series go back and read some of the old Spenser novels. They are still fun reads today - fast paced, introspective, witty and delightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spenser Back","review":"This is an excellent novel. Plot was very suspenseful. Also the ending only is worth waiting for. I'm a Spenser fan for life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough, Already","review":"Parker came upon a unique and clever idea when he befan writing the Spenser series. The characters were of interest and the plots well tailored. Although this series would never be confused with great, or even good literature, it was always good for a fast and harmless read. It seems as if the writer is going to the well far too often. The story is more miss than mysyery and the story becomes tedious at times. The story is rather predictable and this entry lacks the snappy writing style that was so evident in the earlier books of this series. The characters are like oft-used stereotypes andthere is little development of them. It was a good run yet appears to be time to give this character a rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"typical parker","review":"I was a big fan of this series for a long time but I find it to be a little stale. It's not that back story is bad, it's just not anything new. If you've read one Spenser isthe last ten years you have read them all. It's the same cast of characters, Hawk, Susan and Vinny and Quirk. Same storyline. Spenser takes a job for no money, angers people, someone tries to kill him and he calls in backup. Parker needs to take a break and come up with something new for this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big mistake","review":"It was fun to visit with all the old characters, and the Spenser/Susan/Hawk interplay is very enjoyable, but there's a big plot mistake.On pp. 180-181, Spenser, looking at Anne Fahey's college yearbook, is struck by the resemblance between Emily and Daryl. Emily's photo \\"could have been Daryl with a protest sign.\\"\\"Her daughter looks just like her,\\" he says.Later in the story, Daryl turns out to be the child of Bunny/Bonnie, the gangster Karnofsky's daughter. Emily had unofficially adopted Daryl.So how could Daryl resemble Emily?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good one","review":"I love the Spencer series and all of Robert Parker's books. This one was equally as good as the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"If I could have given this story zero stars I would have. The story wasn't interesting and the characters were flat. Hell after thirty books you would think that they would get better. The average chapter length is only two and a half pages, making it difficult to really get into the story. I have read reviews from past novels that said that Parker is the heir to that icon of the hard-boiled dectective story, Raymond Chandler, but even Chandler had more than two pages per chapter. Marlowe and the supporting cast in all of Chandler's books are more interesting than any in this book. For some reason I felt compelled to finish the book but it was a struggle. I just couldn't get into the story. I will have to try some of Parker's other, non Spenser stories. Hopefully they will redeem him in my mind. Don't bother purchasing this book it isn't worth the money, or the time really."},{"rating":"2","title":"This made me laugh out loud!","review":"When a book makes me laugh loudly to the point that I can't control it...it is definitely worth a look! Parker gives his characters such snappy comebacks and hilarious lines that you end up racing for a pad and pen so you can remember to use them on pals at a later time! (shhhhhhhh!;) LOL)Parker has a wonderful sense of timing both in his comedy and his pacing of the story as it opens before the reader. I was simply unable to put this one down until I had finished it.I give this book 5 badges!"},{"rating":"1","title":"He's An Old Man","review":"Lots of white space around every page as usual. I think I would have enjoyed the book more if I hadn't done the math. Spenser and Hawk are over 60, probably pushing 70. Spenser fought in Korea in the 1950s and was at least in his mid-thirties in the first novel in 1974.Parker still writes fight scenes as if Spenser and Hawk are 40 and can stand up against younger, stronger, faster bad guys.I think Spenser has passed his \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\" date.It's time for Spenser to retire."},{"rating":"2","title":"what can you get for 6 donuts?","review":"You can get Spenser, that's what. A lady wants Spenser to solve her mom's murder from 28 years ago, and once Spenser starts snooping, he discovers both the mob and the FBI wants him to stop. But why? He snoops around a bunch that reminded me of the Sybonese Liberation Army (remember Patty Hearst?), i.e., overgrown hippies who break laws in their quest for social justice.As usual, Robert B. Parker keeps his book moving quickly, with rapid fire action and snippy dialog between Spenser, Hawk and Susan. A classic Spenser novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A SPENCER BOOK","review":"this is a good parker Spence volume that you will enjoy reading. Fortunately the Parker family has decided to have someone continue this series so we won't run out of volumes to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stack is Ahead of the Pack","review":"When I first read this book (several years ago), I knew it would become important to my consulting business. It has become a book I purchase for my clients, especially (but not exclusively) those who own their own businesses.Employee retention has become a significant problem for most businesses.

Actually, many of the ideas Jack Stack mentions are common sense and easy to implement. An excellent power tool for all managers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for a business owner","review":"I have gotten a lot of good information from this book in building my consulting business. The author discusses his own experiences on building a business and how things might not go exactly the way we want them to if they do at all. In the world of business, nothing is a guarantee but what can be a guarantee is to wake up in the morning and tell yourself, \\"I can do what it takes to make it happen!\\" Just saying that will get you through the day because you are not opening yourself to high expectations. It is important to remember, when having high expectations they may not always be there and that will cause a downward spiral that just damages everything you have worked so hard to build. This book is what you need to get you through the day of building your business one step at a time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pivotal - a must-read","review":"A masterpiece. We use this book in our consulting practice as a textbook of sorts - as an illustration of why and how to develop a cohesive management team and then manage \\"by the numbers\\". Stack had to learn the lesson the hard way when his company underwent an employee buy-out. Long-story-short, he figured out how to bring the management team (and the rest of the employees) into the critical reporting metrics by turning it into a \\"game\\" similar to a sporting event everyone could follow.. thus the title.

I was pleasantly surprised to find out that there were elements of the book in the musical that were not in the Burton film, and that I was also correct in my observation that the Tim Burton film stayed closer to the book.

Roald Dahl is a superb author, brimming with imaginative tales that strike a passion for reading, in anyone who does read his stories.This tale, of a young, poor Charlie, chronicles his escapades in the Chocolate factory. It is a book filled with hope, sadness, happiness, and moral lessons. It does not sugar coat everything, though. It lets the young readers know that life is not always fair. This book is a must-read for children, and adults for that matter.As Roald Dahl's books are always great, this one is too! ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is only for those with vivid imaginations & minds","review":"If the highest goal of any author is to create a picture in the mind of those who read his or her works, Roald Dahl can rest easy. I read this book when I was 10 or 11, and the vivid images that raced through my mind as I read were incredible. I feel sorry for anyone who can only see on the poverty of the Bucket family, the fate of the four less than saintly children, or the evasive turn of phrase used by Willy Wonka. This is a wonderful work of literature for those who see the good in Charlie Bucket and understand as he does that goodness is its own reward. The chocolate factory is just, if you will pardon the expression, double fudge icing on the heavenly devil's food cake. I hope my 10 year old niece has the same wonder-filled experience with her Christmas present this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but a little moralizing","review":"I first read 'Charlie & The Chocolate Factory' many years ago; probably about grade three. I enjoyed it, but years later the only thing I remembered was the golden ticket,the kid who stuck her gum behind her ear and the glass elevator. I remember thinking as a kid, that a glass elevator that went every which way, would be soooo coooool.Having read it again 30 years later, I am not quite as impressed (well duh it's a kids book!). I found it a little on the cruel side and a little too moralizing, as Dahl takes literary vengeance on all the things that kids do that bug him, like watching t.v. or chewing gum. I guess I just found the moralizing a little too heavy handed. But your kid will probably love it and if it teaches him not to stick gum behind his ear, I guess that's good too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A SWEET Read","review":"OK, this reviewer had never read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory - never saw the movie with Gene Wilder, and even though am a Johnny Depp fan, never saw the newest movie -I dropped my defenses and got this book, and was I surprised!

I used to sincerely believe that outer space was inhabited by Vermicious Knids. But the new illustrations seriously detract from the book. They look like they were scribbled in five minutes by a hack comic strip artist. They have neither skill nor charm. Sorry, but I can't stand Quentin Blake's style.

I like it very much because of its highly imaginative writing. The fantastic descriptions really appeal to the imagination: you can almost guess what a Whipple-Scrumptious Fudgemallow Delight tasts like. It is a very funny story because of the wonderful writing and characters, for example: the Oompa-Loompas who have te deal with dangerous animals such as hornswogglers, snozzwangers and whandoodles. On the other hand, the story has a bit of an evil side as well. Really nasty things happen to the other four children and Mr Willie Wonka has a bit of a cruel streak as well.

With the exception of the main character, all of the children are bad and are punished in cruel ways for their faults. Are most children fundementally bad and deserving terrible punishment, at the moment they least expect it?

But there's nothing in the book of redeeming value for girls to identify with, unless one counts long-winded railing against spoilt kids with very bad habits?The underlying message of this book is that girls have no part in larger adventures and rewards, that men and boys and male Oompa Loompas run the show.

This account is more appropriate for bedtime anecdotes handed from father to child, than anything even remotely comparable to the writings of McCourt and other contemporaries.

But stated with such a beautiful, lyrical simplicity (if that isn't an oxymoron) that one feels he could write a 500-word description of a garbage heap that could be set to music.

After all, writing a calculus text is no small feat. The authors of these books have to try to include every possible concept for fear that a math department or instructor will reject the book because it omits something or other. This means that you will get a little bit of everything, with a paltry few examples for each section. If you have a sadistic professor (aren't they all?), you may feel lost in trying to grasp calculus concepts from this book alone.Math texts are full of assumptions, often skipping steps along the way in the examples. Packed with lots of \\"Thus and therefores,\\" this book will be a mystery to all but the few geeks who were members of the math or Star Trek club in high school.

I would advise taking at least some of it with a grain of salt, though, as she does rather go on about the fictional Celtic Great Goddess and the equally fictional Tree Calendar a bit. She seems to take all sources as equally valid, citing authors like Robert Graves, Mary Daly, and Kaledon Naddair along side authorities like F. Marian MacNeill and Anne Ross and more technical documents like pollen studies.This said, she seems to be an excellent source for Gaelic names of plants, medicinal traditions in the Highlands and Islands, and material regarding fiber arts and dyeing. She falls down a bit where she goes with Gravesian and NeoPagan sources for spiritual information.

I didn't read the first book in the series since the reviews were not as good as this one. I certainly won't now.The problem seems to be that Ms. Putney is just doing it for the money and not from a writer's perspective of weaving story lines and characters together. The plot lines seemed contrived and just thrown in. I laughed out loud (not in a good way) at the unicorn and virgin. There were also discrepancies. Her heroine was strong and learning new skills until each time she ran into the bad guy when she seemed to regress. It wasn't very logical.The author would also throw in random bits of history as if to make the book more worthwhile.

Barry Hart, John Previti and Rick bring a wealth of experience to the table and it certainly shines in this, as well as their other CD recordings.\\"Live in Captivity\\" was recorded \`live' in the studio.

It is, perhaps, the most comprehensive text on the subject available to the open market, but while it is very name, date, and place intensive, there is little in the way of anecdotal information that might interest the merely casual reader.

But if you are a parent, especially with a recent born, and not in my case, but others, one with any kind of physical problem, stay clear the heck away from this.Also, the thing just kind of drags on and on."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO INTENSE.","review":"An American (Billy Drago), who could have been played by a mannequin, searches for a prostitute with whom he had once fallen in love. (I can't imagine any squeeze being that good. And if it out there, I don't want to find it.) He hires a different girl on an island of prostitutes and demons (although we don't see much of the later). She tells him various stories about his lost girlfriend being dead. The torture scenes of needles being inserted under the finger nails and into the gums were very intense. The movie contains slight nudity (Japanese girls are not well endowed in this flick) and abuse and beating of women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Film That Proves Horror Isnt Dead","review":"While not as frightening or disturbing as the staff that helms Showtime productions, this film definetly proves that horror and creative filmmaking aren't dead. In this pseudo rebellious, bought off society of vaccuos proportions, its great to see someone who still cares enough about film to slap the living hell out of the audience. More of this is needed in todays banal and nondescript rock and roll experience called....oh yeah, life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imprint: Good Horror Movie","review":"Scary! The really gross sort of scary too. Not a wise idea to watch it alone on a stormy night. That's what I did & had bad dreams because of it. Yeah, the acting wasn't great, but I feel it was good enough for this kind of movie. An actor who was a demon on the tv show Charmed played the main character. I thought the story was pretty clever & interesting. It kept you on the edge of your seat. You never knew what to expect. Watch this if your looking for it good scare."},{"rating":"1","title":"acting helps with movies","review":"I've seen other Miike movies and I've seen other things Billy Drago has done: this is not their best work. Drago's acting was horrible, I felt nothing for his character and thus nothing for the story he was being told. The story seemed convulted and I laughed on a few ocassions -- not what I want to be doing during a horror movie unless it is intential. Of course it looked beautiful and it was a bit graphic but that can't make up for characters you can feel empathy or sympathy for and a conherent plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too gross, becomes unwatchable","review":"I like horror films, but this was too unpleasant to watch. So much gore it was a turn off. I liked Audition, it was well done but this was a disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"This ones a little heavy","review":"I haven't been able to find one MOH that was above somewhat entertaining so I decided to try Imprint. I have to say it was definately a bit much. It was definately too gory for my taste. I also wasn't a big fan of the torture and abortion scenes. I thought it couldn't have been bad enough to get banned, but I could actually see why after viewing it.It started off interesting and had a creepy vibe but it just got out of control after that. Not to mention the always laughable Billy Drago was the main character. This guys overacts more then anyone I have ever seen. However he did provide me with a few laughs which always helps.I would have to say that if you are all about gore then this would be perfect for you. Personally I wasn't impressed. It was way over the top and really had noting going in the scare department."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masters of Horror: Imprint","review":"One word: AWESOME!!!! Great, original story. Awesome special effects. Great acting. A+ all the way. If you love horror like I do, you MUST get this dvd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect, but most certainly a MoH highlight","review":"Although the acting from the male lead was absolutely terrible, and for the first 30 minutes, I thought I was watching Memoirs of a Geisha, this little story must be commended for how it is insidiously scary. It somehow manages to combine both subtle creepiness with shocking images to worm its way into your unconscious and linger there. The result cannot be understated... this is the masterpiece of the MoH series, with a couple of notable exceptions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miike stumbles","review":"Talented director Takashi Miike falls flat on his face with this installment of Showtime's Masters of Horror series. Searching for his lost love, an American (Billy Drago) travels to a sinister island, where a disfigured prostitute (Youki Kudoh) tells her terrible fate before revealing her own disturbing secret. Miike's first mistake is to shoot this in English. Many of the performers stumble over their lines. Drago overacts dreadfully, and the story seems to be little more than an excuse to string together graphic scenes of torture and abortion. The prostitute's secret turns out to be quite ridiculous. If you enjoy watching films that aim to shock, you will find much to enjoy here, but you'll be disappointed if you're hoping for a coherent narrative."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hunt for Horror...","review":"...but found nothing of particular interest here. It was par for the MOH course. So if you've seen any of the episodes then you know what to expect. I don't know why this was\\"banned\\". Not even the torture was significant. I'm glad I didn't buy it, but I had to see it considering all of the mixed reviews it got. I didn't find it comical, not even the hand. It wasn't creepy, and I really wanted to understand the story as it was told; but like most japanese horror the third act failed to deliver only because, in typical fashion, defeating the oni isn't the point . That's all part of the experience. So what if it wasn't the greatest story ever told, it was a ride worth taking just for the girl's disturbed smile at the end. It's truly fascinating to see how other cultures handle horror. The difference, I find, is significant and always fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Against the grain","review":"Unlike some people posting here, I found this to be one of the worst Masters of Horror. They tried to go for gore in exchange for a decent storyline and in my mind they did not succeed. When you put this story up against a masterwork like \\"Cigarette Burns\\", it pales in comparison. The story drags for the first 2/3 and I almost turned it off. Another issue is the fact that you have to stay poised on the volume button. There are times when dialogue is almost impossible to hear and the next minute you hear crashes and booms that will explode your eardrums. Ultimately, this MOH goes nowhere and is poorly acted. I don't reccomend this at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mike!! what were you thinking during casting?Pick any old washed up actor?","review":"First, let me say I loved this movie. It was the first movie that was so grotesque that I had to turn away. I would of loved it even more however, if they did not cast whomever that washed up actor was in one of the lead roles. He was over acting and very dull. I wasn't the least bit interested in hearing from him in fact I found him to be quite annoying at times yelling like some dumb wino who has never acted in his life.The rest of the cast was excellent. I would of just liked to see mike play more on the ghost that was present in the room in the beginning of the film to add some horror aspects to the movie instead of just shock factors by showing dead fetuses and such. Overall, it was pretty interesting just next time I hope he picks a better male actor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takashi Miike has issues","review":"This movie was messed up, but in a wonderfully entertaining way. Miike has always had the power to make me squirm and this did not fail. I made a mistake in watching this movie as my first pick for the Masters of Horrors series, because now all of them will be judged by this one. It'll be interesting to see if the rest hold up."},{"rating":"2","title":"definitely Miike, but its no Gozu or Ichi","review":"It's the story of an American man and his search for a lost love. but that barely scratches the surface of the forces at work in this movie. when our main character arrives at this particular island, his search may finally come to an end, but the world he is about to enter may be too much for his own sanity.there really are no redeeming or happy qualities to this movie, its a descent to a place most people wont be able to stand to watch. a story ripe with torture(one of the most drawn out, cruel torture scenes ive seen), death, and lots of other dark elements, including primitive abortion proceedures and disposal of dead fetuses in the river(probably why it got banned from American cable)if your a horror fan that isnt bothered by the content i listed above, by all means check this out, its more than worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book With A Choice","review":"This book was fun to read. It's perfect for any nine year old who wants to read a good book with a wide selection of of stories. It's not 12 books all crammed into one it's 12 parts of books that lead you to one (Or how ever many you want) very good books. They picked really good parts of each book.

One day he discovers that another dimension exists and it changes his life. This 19th century classic is not only an explanation of dimensions, but it is also a social commentary on Victorian England. I was disappointed in this story. I was looking forward to an interesting look at geometry and dimensions, but mostly I was bored, especially with the first half of the book. I had to repeatedly remind myself that it was social commentary and that the horrible description of women may have been commentary and not the author's real feelings. If you are interested in a way of viewing dimensions, the second half of the book might interest you, but as a whole I wish I skipped this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind-Opening..","review":"This little book(and subsequent sequels by other authors) is guaranteed to cause the non-mathematically inclined reader to think in new ways and new directions.As one of the classics in this (very limited) genre, this book is well-worth the brief time it takes to read.."},{"rating":"2","title":"a sparkly-imaginative read for the mindful type","review":"Quite simply, this book is an absolute delight to read for anyone who is analytically-minded, imaginative, philosophical, and/or enjoys math.

I bought copies for college students and was very disappointed in the presentation. Very small print, poor contrast, and no decent formatting. Try to find an older printing, used if need be."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine example of early science fiction.","review":"Although the decidedly Victorian language may sound a bit strange to the 21st Century ear, Abbott's approach is classic: assume a set of social rules that is driven by an alien environment. In this case, assume the constraints (and freedoms) offered by living in two dimensions. Further, imagine encounters with life in one or three dimensions. Do you mock those living in one dimension? Do you gape in awe at the three dimension world? You might read Flatland to appreciate the historical foundations of modern sci-fi. You might contemplate the themes for personal reflection. You might share it with others to sponsor interesting conversations. No matter how you use it, it's worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible and amazingly provocative. A page turner!","review":"Abbott's imagination is just fantastic. And I say fantastic in the most realistic sense. He has so many amazing ideas and makes everything so believable, but also makes you consider the possibility of something, some world completely beyond your conception; completely beyond your reality. It's entertaining and interesting and left me turning page after page, not putting the book down. Anyone who would like a good, interesting book should check this out. It's great for everyone because not only is it a fabulously well-written imaginitave piece of literature, it's very short. Short enough to finish in a day as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic irony has alot to say about year 2000","review":"I disagree w/last reviewer. Flatland doesn't just lampoon the 1880's. Victorian is Abbott's writing style. But his social comment is as sharp today as Gulliver, and Screwtape's. If you can't spot the irony the entire book is offensive. If you do spot it, the parallels between say - its women & the current suppression in Afganistan, or education & Chinease purges, or angling up & US college sport programs - are hilarious and bone chilling. Abbot's guesses on equator based navigation are quite accurate. North swimming bacteria actually have a lot in common with the travelers in Flatland."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Edition is Garbage on the Kindle","review":"This edition is terrible on the Kindle.

A book I hate will keep me talking for weeks... I might have hated it, but at least it made a difference. But this book practically wasn't there. It made NO impression on me, and just wasted an afternoon. One bright, sunny, Sunday afternoon that I can never get back. A Sunday afternoon that could have been spent mowing the lawn or doing the dishes.I understand that many people love this book, and that it has been influential in turning people on to mathematics, philosophy, logic, etc. But I really can't say it triggered ANY ideas in my head. Thought-provoking? Heck no.Yawn provoking? Sure thing.This book is not inspirational. It is a sleep aid, much better than any other I have tried."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real snoozefest","review":"This book is a cure for insomnia. If I ever have trouble falling to sleep, I'll just dig out my old \\"Flatland\\" book, and I'll probably be fast asleep a few minutes later! Listening to the A. Square character telling us about his flat, two dimensional world is not thought provoking, its just confusing! Trying to imagine life in two dimensions is truely mind numbing. I mean I understand what Flatland would be like, but only after I carefully think out what Mr. Square is saying. I spent more time trying to comprehend the two dimensional reality of Flatland than I do enjoying the story.

I was introduced to Flatland many years ago and it has been an inspiration for many new thoughts and ideas since. The book is easy to read and understand, at first, lending credence to the epigram \\"the more we know the less we understand\\". I recommend Flatland to all those who have any questions regarding socially accepted paradigms of intellect, spiritual awareness and just plain fun.Chuck Mackarness"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, However Just a Little Confusing","review":"I was required to read Flatland for a geometry class in high school.

NONE of these images are from the print editions of the book.. or have remotely anything to do with the text! more perplexing than vexing, the book is still really fun to read.. i would just recommend that you opt for one of the OTHER illustrated editions!
