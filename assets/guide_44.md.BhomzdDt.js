I can only say ditto to just about every negative word said in the previous reviews. I would encourage any school thinking of using or currently using this textbook to reconsider. Well over half the students in my class have thoughts similar to my own regarding this book. Indeed, students actually swear at the author when speaking of this book (which I rarely, if ever, hear about other texts). If your unfortunate enough to be in a class using this text, Speak up!

This is by far the worst electric circuits text that I have had the misfortune of being forced to use. The examples are rudamentary, as are the general explanations, and inadequately prepare one for the homework problems. I have taken electric circuit theory at the community college level and the texts used for those courses were far better. However, since I attended community college some time ago, I fear that the texts I used at the time are currently too outdated for recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst book I have ever used","review":"This book is terrible. There are far to few answers to the problems in the back of the book. The answers that are there are also frequently wrong. It is very confusing, and close to impossible to teach yourself the material by reading the book alone. My teacher says he will never use this book again. AVOID IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Horrible","review":"I used this book for my introductory circuits class three years ago and, upon reflection, it was one of the worst books I was forced to buy in 4 years of engineering. The examples are too trivial to help with the problems, which are too hard because the explanations are horrible. My teacher wasn't much better at explaining the material, making this the worst class I have ever taken. But after taking more advanced circuits classes, I find them to be less appalling."},{"rating":"1","title":"terribly written","review":"reasons I wouldn't go with this book:1. poor pedagogy, i.e., easy examples, but unsolvable problems2. not necessarily very up-to-date, lacking in innovation, extremely old-fashioned3. there are surely better written books on Circuits out theree.g.: Alexander&Sadiku; (which is an easy but great read), or Dorf (which is pretty decent)"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst ever","review":"This is the worst text book I have ever had throughout any educational program. I strongly suggest requesting your school to use another book for circuit theory. There are error after error in this book and the publisher even forgot to attach appendix G. The example problems have incomplete solutions and are elementary compared to the difficult homework problems. The writers of this book must have expected you to only use this book as a work book because the methods discussed dont prepare you for the homework. Stay away from this book. Also the binding is week as mine has come apart after 1 semester (and i bought it new)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A book that does not work","review":"If you are new to circuits, and don't have an amazing instructor, this book will make you work for hours just to finish a few problems in the exercises. The examples in the book are ridiculous, cause they are so easy. But wait till you get to the exercises, you will know. It is true, if you can learn to do the harder problems, easier ones will be no factor. But you NEED to learn first, and this book is in no way a self- teaching book. The ability of the writers to communicate with the readers is almost non existent here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, inadequate development of concepts.","review":"I'll be brief.

The authors cut all the junks and go straight to the points. This makes the reading pleasant.Cons: Since the authors decided to make the text short, they cut steps on how to solve the problem on the examples. So if you need to look for help by reading the examples, you are screwed! In addition to it, I feel like that just throw the concepts to you, without explanations and expect you to figure them out.The most frustrating thing to me is: In some problems, in order to solve them, I have to guess what the authors were saying because the language is so confused.If I have a choice, I will not use this text book. Too bad, I don't have a choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems Are Too Complicated","review":"During my first semester of Circuits, I loved this book, but I came to find out during my second semester that it was not the book but my professor that was teaching me well. Primarily, my problem with the book is that it offers too few examples dealing with the actual homework problems in the back. If you read and work out the (on average) four examples in the chapter and then begin the problems, you will find the content very different and more difficult. Occasionally, after three reads through the chapter and some outside sources, I was able to work some of the problems, but overall, they are not structured on the chapter topics and many of the problems are poorly worded. The solutions in the back are also in an inconsistent order, appearing to offer solutions only to the easiest of the problems. I enjoy the reading, but the problems need to be redone, or the reading needs to incorporate some of the ideas in the problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't buy !","review":"Many college in Korea use this book as original text book.

This book is a trainwreck.","review":"I hate it when textbook authors are well aware of all the flaw in their books, then change a few problems all to force students to purchase a new book (old editions dont make them any money) and dont fix any problems they know exists. this is just about as sloppy of a book as i have seen in engineering and its a shame. the clear profit motive leaves me feeling much disgust. i felt so strongly about the LACK of organization and explanation in this book that i created a youtube channel where i solve some of these problems and explain things along the way. my channel name is thuymyers. you can search for it by name. shame on the authors for being money grubbers. if youre not going to change content and quality, STOP CHANGING EDITIONS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible textbook translates to terrible grades!","review":"I had to use this book for my introductory circuit analysis class and THANK GOD I'M NOT AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING STUDENT. I'm so glad that I can forget about the nightmare that this book brought me. It's terrible in every aspect possible! From horrible explanations of concepts, to the lame examples that DOES NOT EXPLAIN STEPS, to the INSANELY DIFFICULT PROBLEMS without giving you enough information from the chapter, also the JUMP TO THE CONCLUSION DERIVATIONS (I'd like to know how you derived it, please!), and just giving my headaches when trying to use it to learn the material. It's definitely the worst textbook I have ever had and will definitely not be keeping it on my bookshelf. This one's going straight out of my house after the term is over. I can't believe my professor ordered this book for my class. It's just brought nightmares and misery over what should be fun and easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!!!

It's a major frustration having to study with this book in my CIS class. I hate the author! Examples have skipped steps & sometimes I can't tell how the author came up with certain numbers in his examples. Honestly, I have read better circuit material in my experience.To all those who have to deal with this book, I say \\"good luck!\\" Your gonna need it.I mostly don't burn my textbooks after I'm done with them, but in this case, I'll make an exception.

Despite having had less-than-great professors for Circuits I & II, I feel this book has been indispensable in my understanding linear circuits.I understand many readers are discontent with the fact that this book doesn't contain ANY end-of-chapter solutions. I completely agree with that sentiment, and that is why I only gave the book four stars. However, the solutions manual is obtainable, and it is very comprehensive. The book and solutions manual combined provide a formidable tool for learning basic circuitry.On the other hand, if you're unable to get the solutions, this text, just like any other, would certainly make it difficult to get confident at solving linear circuits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget it!","review":"This book is not even worth 1 star. I won't bother you with the details since some of the other reviews posted are right on, especially that long one I saw by SDP_8. I will add that I wouldn't sweat about not having the solutions available. There are plenty of online sites where you can look that information up for any text book, just ask any of your fellow students. Because of this book, I transfered to a local Technical College for EE for more hands on. I have lost all respect for Engineering Courses at major Universities.

After investigating the book, I found that in the United States the \\"International Student edition\\" of any textbook is not legal to sell. That is because it is a bootleg version - basically some guy in some other country with lax copyright laws bought the book and photocopied every page and sold it.Needless to say, I had to buy another book.

After going through the chapter and following along with the examples, everything seemed crystal clear. Then you actually start doing the homework problems in the book, and all of a sudden you realize that the author only did the simplest of the examples, and didn't adequetely prepare you for anything more difficult. Also, in my class, after struggling for hours on end to try to get the same answer that the back of the book had, I found out from the professor that about 1 out 5 answers in the back of the book were WRONG! Boy that sure helps a lot! What a waste of money that book was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking","review":"This textbook is missing so many of the key ingredients that make a good textbook -- I am still amazed at the large amount of instructors that continue to use this inefficient and lacking text as their main instruction manual.Using this in a circuits course probably will not help you and will make the subject more confusing most likely. If you have a poor instructor as well, consider yourself lost for the class. Get another text. The examples in here are so simple but then the homework problems make these conceptual leaps that prove quite challenging for students -- even engineering students.This book needs quite a bit of improvement before I would use it as my main circuits text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"This book is [costly]for what it's worth. I am a CS student and after taking the Digital Circuits class, wanted to learn some electric circuits out of interest. I wasn't taking a class in my university (Univ. of Idaho) but this was the required book for the introduction to circuits class. So i bought this, and tried to learn on my own.It was a nightmare. The basic concepts aren't explained well at all. The introductory chapters are just for the sake of it. The author uses a lot of calculus in places where it's not even required. If this is the required book for the first EE class, then I can assume many would have a wrong impression of EE and drop out.I read Schaums or however thats spelt, and that made life so much easier and simpler..Analyzing the circuits even in Nilsson's book was easy.Final Word: Don't read this book..Atleast if you want an introduction / window into Electric Circuits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the paper it is printed on!","review":"I had to purchase this book for my intoductory ECE class, and I ended up dropping the class unable to understand the concepts.

If you wish to truly learn electronics look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is possibly one of the worst engineering textbooks ever published.","review":"This is a really bad textbook! It's easily the worst one I have come across. It's in its 8th edition, yet it still has a great number of typos. The assessment problems are very useless too. They give you a problem statement followed by the answer with no detailed solution as to how they got the answer. The chapters themselves also do not explain enough or give enough information to do most of the end-of-chapter problems. They show you how to derive equations then give you a bunch of problems that leave you scratching your head. The problems at the end of the chapters really go beyond what is discussed in the textbook chapters and prior knowledge in electrical circuits is required to get through most of the problems. I think the lessons are way too abstract and more information needs to be given. The book is overpriced too and really isn't worth the investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful textbook","review":"This textbook is horrible, probably even for EE majors, which I am not (which makes it worse). The book does a reasonable job of explaining basic concepts in the reading and the reading itself is easy to understand, but it's sorely deficient in worked-out examples within the chapters and what's there bears pathetically little resemblance to most of the exercises at the end of each chapter. The user is left to muddle through on problems that are much harder than and almost unrecognizable next to the examples and the text. It's as though the authors want this to be an entry-level introduction to circuits and at the same time expect you already to understand the material at page 1.I'm not asking to be spoon-fed but this book had me beating my head against the table most of the time, and that's not productive, either.I wouldn't recommend this book to ANYONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst textbooks I've used.","review":"I did not find the explanations or examples in this book to be very helpful.

This is one of the worst textbooks I've come across. There are no good examples in the books (the only examples are missing complete solutions) and the chapters are worked through with very simple theoretical circuits with nothing complex to base your understanding off of. The authors also completely neglect units when making calculations, which is a huge problem when dealing with this kind of material. they simply make a calculation and throw in a unit onto the answer at the end.the major problem with this book is the lack of SOLVED EXAMPLE PROBLEMS. a textbook is no good without step by step explained applications.overall, this book is a bad excuse for a textbook. if you can, stay as far away from it as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for elementary school kids!!","review":"My daughter thoroughly enjoyed this book.

One day, I measured myself according to the directions. Then I picked up a 20 lb laundry basket while still on the scale and (not surprisingly) my \\"body fat\\" percentage went up 5 points. I am inclined to think that if it was really able to read my body fat, than even if my weight goes up (i.e. as with added muscle weight) than it should be able to accurately read that and not simply add to my \\"body fat\\" percentage.

Written by Tonde & Riki Barber, two twin brothers who both play professional football (American-style), the book centers on Tiki's leg injury after a bike accident and his slow, aphorism-filled summer recovering with the support of his hard-working mother, the professional medical community, and his non-injured brother. The bond between the two brothers comes through in the childish dialogue, the motivating struggles and the water color art of orange skies and the frozen tundra of the football gridiron where the two brothers find their place on the field of life. Football, determination, inspiration, and twins. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"This is a cute short story. Not much to do about football as the cover suggests.

When is the last time you or anybody's heard, spoken, or written the word \\"partridge\\" except maybe during the holidays? There are thousands of other words that a baby is likely to hear on a daily basis that begin with the letter P. What bugs me the most is the letter \\"Q\\". The author chose \\"quotation mark\\".

Be sure to purchase a screen cover ; a small square of thin plastic that protects it from scratches but will not be noticeable during movie or photo playback.

I am reminded of the joys that were held in the unabashed emotional outpourings that were also made somewhat mainstream when Incubus arrived with Make Yourself a while ago. This singer, like Brandon Boyd, has an excellent sense of contrasting melody off of his band...not quite the intimate chemistry that singer/guitarist share in Incubus, but as a four-piece unit, Mute Math excel with an accessable yet passionate drive, making the radio sound beautiful, if just for a moment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical","review":"In the song \\"Typical\\" the singer says, \\"Can I break the spell of the tpyical?\\" I wish he would have before they made the album. Their music has a unique blend of sounds I want to enjoy, but the same gimmicky fake high dynamic range visual style used on the album art is applied aurally to the music and consequently gives it a gimmicky, blunt and WAY too overdriven sound with hardly any... dynamic range. The lyrics are lackluster, and forgettable and remind all too much of Sting's verbal meanderings. Break the spell, please.Gimmicks don't make for good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Retrospective of Jane's Addiction and 90s prog rock.","review":"Unfortunately I had to give these talented musicians one star for their effort here. Their music is trite and unoriginal but the main problem is that none of the songs really take off with inspiration. There aren't any catchy melodies that make you want to dance, jump, or sing along.

However, I loved it so much, I knew I had to purchase it and support Mute Math. (Could this mean that the RIAA is mistaken?)I used this album extensively while I studied. I find it makes great background and driving music. I have listened to every song over and over again; the tunes often get stuck in my head. Sometimes after switching to other music for awhile, I find myself craving their music and rush back to my room to grab my copy.They mix mellow tracks with lively, upbeat songs full of effects resulting in an album that has great variety and texture. For an experimental sound of great quality, check out Mute Math!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound for a small price!","review":"This CD is great!

At the time, they were still little known and it was a great surprise to stumble across a band with so much energy.I immediately loved the album and shared it with my finace, who also then fell in love with it. with such a broad range of sounds and musical genre's, MuteMath's talent to experiment with new musical techniques created incredible sounds. We were extremely excited to get to see them live in a very small club with about 40 others and they put on one of the most fun and exciting shows i've ever seen.I would highly suggest checking out this album, you won't be disappointed.

It sends pulses of electricity through your feet and legs... only. Basically, the upper part of your body is ignored because the pulses don't travel through that area. Using the measurements taken from your legs, the scale guesses your total body fat. The problem being that people store different amounts of fat in different places according to their genetics. So if you tend to store more fat in your legs, this machine will rate your bf% much higher and if you store more fat in your upper body, it will rate your bf% much lower.I would recommed a scale that has both the feet and hand plates for measurement. Those scales are much more accurate for your total body bf%. The same company that makes this scale makes one, but it is, of course, a little more expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked good for a little while.....","review":"but then it would only display my weight in stones.

We went ahead and ordered a second set for the back seat. We only ordered one the first time, just in case it didn't fit.

I like the look. I have wider calves so this was great for me, but might now work if you have thin calves.The only reason I didn't give it a five was because after a few wears the seam on the back of the boot split by the ankle. I went the the aerosoles website and called the service number. It had been within a month (their guarantee) and so they sent me a new pair. You have to ask to get the postage sent to you. They were very nice and on the phone said this wasn't a normal occurrence, so an exchange for the same boot was fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought Aerosoles were supposed to be comfortable...","review":"I bought these boots after reading countless reviews of how comfortable they were. I was looking for a pair of cute, black suede wedges that I could wear during my commute and at work. These are not the right boots for that. First of all, your balance gets all thrown off in these boots - you feel like you're teetering around on the balls of your feet. I've seen other girls in the same boots and they all walk the same way, like they're going to fall on their face any second. I added an inner sole to try and soften the pressure on the balls of my feet, but it didn't help much. Also, when I tried to waterproof them, one turned a funny, faded shade of black while the other one stayed normal, so that didn't help the situation. Cute boots, just totally uncomfortable and hard to walk in, and obviously not meant to be waterproofed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Boot Ever!!!!!","review":"I wanted these boots when they first came out in the fall, but I refused to pay $159 for them. My mom loves wedge heeled boots, so luckly I found them here for $45 WoW. I purchased a pair for myself and my mom. After wearing them my mom had to have all of the colors in the line. Unfortunately, I was not so luck to find them again for that price, but I purchased them for $89. I still love them they are worth every penny and you can wear them all day. They work with any outfit.

I the late 80's I borrowed a friends turntable and duped it onto cassette tape. I was really excited to listen to it on drive up from LA to SF. After 20 min of listening to it and 20 years of listening to many other kinds of music, I was really disappointed. I realized that these guys were simply not as good as I thought. Tower of Power's horn section was ans is soooo much better than these guys ever thougt about.

I particularly enjoyed the title story and \\"What Men Live By\\". These two stories showed a real grasp of human nature and presented memorable insights.On the other hand, the military stories are hard to read and the language is basically 19th century gargon to me. I'd love to see a modern version of \\"The Two Hussars\\" for example, where a more current setting and scenario may help to clarify what the story is about. I stopped reading \\"the Woodfelling\\" about half-way through because it just wasn't going anywhere in my opinion.I'll buy it again to be honest, because there are a few gems in it...and who knows, maybe I'll re-read the other stories in a few years and be better able to grasp their meaning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 1 pair","review":"They are a very nice pair of socks, but I can't see paying $10 for one pair of socks!!

Bill James has printed similar types of essays in various books in a much more lively and entertaining style. Also, some of the methods used and assumptions made are very questionable. (I am an MBA with over 20 years experience in compiling and using statistical data.) Felber's book can only be recommended to the really hardcore fan who is willing to wade through a lot of really boring prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this is a landmark, then I'm very lost","review":"This book presents a lot of information in an uninteresting way and doesn't break any new ground.One of the first chapters by Felber states that the best hitters hit early in the count as once hitters have worked themselves into 2-strike counts, their batting averages drop sharply.Of course they do. That's because with 2 strikes, you can strike out on the next pitch. With 0 or 1 strike, a batter can do a lot of things with the next pitch, but one of them isn't striking out. And striking out is the end result of a lot of at bats.The chapter on bullpen usage makes some sense, but the examples given are presented poorly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sentimental Favorite","review":"I think this movie is very well done and thoroughly enjoyed it.

The bulk of this CD is wonderful, fun, uplifting music that you can dance to non-stop for hours. The highlight is the first single, Don't Falter with guest vocals from Kineckie's Lauren Laverne.

But after seeing the new incarnation of this film - the only thought I was left with was \\"Why bother?\\" This is a completely different film because of the soundtrack changes that have been made and this new film isn't frightening nor is it interesting. Furthermore, if there is one thing that bothers me even more than changes to the actual film it is changes to the artwork and packaging.

It was hysterical. One of my favorite black comedy's ever! It's not scary at all. This was another entry in the early 1980s slasher cycle of films that began with Halloween (1978) and Friday the 13th (1980), and like many of the copycat slasher films features a holiday date-themed titles. Happy Birthday holds some promise over the others in that it had a quite respectable director at the helm - none other than J. Lee Thompson, who had made films such as Cape Fear (1962), McKenna?s Gold (1968), Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972) and Battle for the Planet of the Apes (1973). Cape Fear, in particular, is a masterful film noir psychological thriller. The prowess that Thompson displayed there is something that should set any slasher film light-years ahead of the competition. But fails miserably and finishes with one of the funniest horror films ever. Not scary at all. 5 stars as a comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did We See The Same Movie??","review":"Granted, \\"Happy Birthday To Me\\" may rise just a little above the rather braindead norm of most early 1980s dead teenager flicks. The plot did at least keep me interested. Yet I am baffled by the folks who rave over how \\"truly frightening\\" it is. This movie couldn't scare my kitten away from its milk! If anything, the murder scenes are so goofy and extreme, they are kind of amusing.\\"Happy Birthday To Me\\" is a bad time waster for people who feel a little nostalgia for early 80s cheese. It's nothing more. Perhaps the dude who called this a classic can let me know what he's been smoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Burried Treasure re-discovered...","review":"I have the laserdisc and vhs copy of this stylish and underrated 80's horror classic and now I will finally have it on DVD!!The atmosphere of this movie and the genuine plot twist is totally unforgetable.SCREAM borrowed alot from this movie and gave it no credit..Those of you that have seen this movie will know exactly what I'm talking about..Melissa Sue Anderson is great and the murders are twisted and fun.If you haven't seen this movie,it is worth your time to invest in a good solid horror movie with a plot that doesn't rely on gore over substance..to tell a story.The ending is truly haunting."},{"rating":"1","title":"I will never forgive Sony for releasing this FAKE \\"Birthday\\" party!","review":"I applaud the widescreen treatment, but without the original score, the DVD is completely WORTHLESS to a fan.RELEASE THIS MOVIE WITH THE ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this dreck!","review":"...Alright, the movie is basically a \\"whodunnit,\\" as noted by most of the previous reviewers. However, it's pretty obvious that it's NOT the \\"heroine,\\" as we know that there's some sort of a plot twist and all along we've been shown that she's doing the killings. Could it be that someone else has been doing them, someone who looks an awful lot like her? Oh boy...As for the main billing on the cover of the video box (\\"Six of the most bizarre murders you'll ever see\\") I'd have to say that unless you've never seen a horror flick before, you'll probably find people who get poked in the mouth, die by throat slash, and stabbed in the gut to be pretty run-of-the-mill stuff.Finally, since the movie is called a \\"horror\\" film, I feel that I ought to warn you that there is really nothing very frightening about it. I went to bed immediately after watching the tape, and didn't have any trouble sleeping until ten the next morning."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Happy Birthday\\" didn't make me happy!","review":"Like other fans of this great horror film, I looked forward to its release for many years and was thrilled when I read that it was finally coming out. Imagine my shock and disappointment to hear the terrible, cheesy new score that had replaced the wonderful original. What were they thinking?! If there was a rights issue, I personally would have rather waited on the film to be released the way I remember it as opposed to this version. While the movie itself is still a favorite of mine and the DVD picture quality looks good, the new score music makes it almost unwatchable. This is a 5 star movie as I remember it. But in this newly released version? I pushed myself to give it the 2 stars that I did. Give us the version we remember!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Corporate Killed the Video Star","review":"John Carpenter and producer Irwin Yablans have argued how vital music is to a horror film (a la \\"Halloween\\"), and one element of early slasher films that creates their terror is the music. It's unfathomable to me, then, that Columbia released this DVD with an alternate score. You know all those people who criticize slasher films for being Gorgonzola? Now they have a valid point. Watch this DVD, and you'll find yourself rolling your eyes as the ridiculous disco music plays along to a killer slitting someone's throat. I don't understand how Columbia can withhold this movie from public release for years and then pump the money into a new score whilst ignoring a disc commentary let alone even the original trailer. Corporations should not make artistic decisions about their products; their realm is to push units and make money. Leave the actual filmmaking and sound duties to the professional artists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same movie","review":"Do not buy this DVD. If you must see this film rent it. Sony has decided to release an inferior product due to the fact they could not obtain licensing or they were to cheap to pay the copyright holder of the music score. This movie was very eerie and dark with orginal score now it is just plain cheesy."},{"rating":"1","title":"HAPPY BIRTHDAY HORROR MAN.","review":"Today is my Amazon friends birthday,and like alot of my friendshere(you know who you are) I thought I would give a nod as Iwill with the rest of you on your b-days(that's right...nogetting by the C.B.,of course you can delete your birth date)So anyway to my friend HORRORMAN hope you and your familyare enjoying this special day....Now on to the review!A sullen looking Anderson stars in this fairly lavish-looking slasherabout a gloved killer(No!

One of my favorite \\"slasher\\" films.... The cars jumping the bridge was an excellent part too, all around a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just my 2 cents...","review":"I've loved this film forever. It's a yearly viewing at Halloween for me. My VHS was looking more and more worn out, so a DVD announcement was met with much excitement. However, for everything that's already been mentioned here, I didn't buy the DVD. I've seen shots of the image quality and it looks excellent enough to make my mouth water. But all the bad comments about it still stop me from buying it. Now, it's much cheaper in some places but even so I find it hard to waste money on something that has essentually been ruined by a wrong-thinking studio.Closing: read the comments here and realise that we will all buy this film (heck, even for the price this one was listed at) if you will just restore it to its original print, complete with all scenes and musical score. This version isn't even worth 6 bucks.Thanks in advance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horror movie classic. Who is the killer? Best twists!","review":"This review is for the VHS release.Here is another horror movie classic. College kids like this one. Melissa Sue Anderson (\\"Little House on the Prairie\\" tv series) and a gaggle of other university students are being killed one by one. Each one of the students are a little on the crazy side, so no telling whom the killer may be. Her mom had died. Eventually her dad and herself move back into town and the family house. \\"Virginia\\" is really down and bothered. But she is making friends in school and considers herself to be in the Top Ten.Cast also includes Tracy Bregman (Days Of Our Lives, Young and the Restless, Bold and the Beautiful) and Glenn Ford (Superman [1978]). Can you guess who the killer is?This RCA home video print is not too good. The color is faded. The film being Canadian might have something to do with that. But this is a good film worth watching and good acting from Melissa Sue Anderson."},{"rating":"1","title":"The real villain here is J. Lee Thompson.","review":"Happy Birthday to Me (J. Lee Thompson, 1981)J. Lee Thompson may have directed films in Hollywood for almost four decades, but somehow they never got any better.... Melissa Sue Anderson, seemingly desperate to shake the good-girl image that came with the success of Little House on the Prairie, plays the coed whose friends are getting killed one by one as her birthday approaches. She always seems to be in the area, but just can't seem to remember actually killing anyone. (Oh, come on, you can figure it out.) Unfortunately, the only thing this movie actually killed was Anderson's burgeoning career as a serious non-typecast actress. Special effects, direction, etc., are about what you'd expect from a bargain-basement Halloween clone. There are some good lines, though, and one character has a pet rat. So the movie is saved from complete destruction, but not bymuch. * 1/2"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slasher.","review":"Although I adore slasher films... this is not one of y favorites. It's a hard watch. Not because of the blood and gore, but because it's slow. It kind of dragged on. But as a horror fan, it fits in well with the rest of my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull","review":"it's a good story. and i like the fact that we are told the story from Judas' point of view. you get to see the politics surrounding christ and you see that judas isn't evil, just a man, a patriot. but the writing style is boring, slow, and dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Riding the Iron Rice Bowl","review":"Theroux's early travel writing places him firmly alongside Lewis and Newby; his middle period novels only a little below Greene. This novel, however, makes 'Nobel House' seem well-researched and insightful.The plot of Kowloon Tong is loose and although the novel is thankfully short, Theroux seems to anticipate his reader's ennui with the whole concept well before the middle of the book. It is the sort of thing you would expect of someone who'd paid a fortnight's vist to the Territory to stay with friends who didn't go out much.The characterisation of both the English and Chinese is wholely unbelievable and the energy and 'vividness' of Hong Kong which has always been unconnected with ownership of the place is totally lacking.Clearly a piece of opportunism on the part of his publisher, which Theroux should be ashamed of himself for going along with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try Arnote's Book Instead","review":"Coming from this author you would assume a GREAT BOOK - andmaybe a movie down the road.... Well it's not!!! I was intrested inthe backdrop of the book - Hong Kong and the Chinese Takeover. It was a few weeks before it actually was going to take place in real life when I finished the book, but the book left a lot to be desired. When I finished the last page I keep looking for some more pages that were missing - it was like Theroux just decided to stop writing and finished the book without closing the story. I wanted more of Hong Kong so I've been reading HONG KONG, CHINA by RALPH ARNOTE - another book along the same lines taking place at the end of the Britts rule. It's better. Don't waste your time on Theroux go straight to Arnote's book instead!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected \\"awesome\\" -- got \\"awful\\"","review":"The characters were unbelievable, one-dimentional, andshallow. I couldn't have cared less about them. Theroux also managedto create a setting that was equal to the characters--bland and unreal--thereby ensuring that this novel would be a complete disappointment. A pity, too, since the backdrop to this novel (Hong Kong) has such literary promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely unrealistic in place and character","review":"This novel has almost no relationship to reality. I live in Hong Kong and can recognize nothing in these British characters that ring true. Yes, the Brits here may be a bit nostalgic for Empire but the idea of them ignoring the impending handover until it is too late is simply ludicrous. The area of Kowloon Tong is in fact very wealthy, one of the few in Hong Kong with single family homes. There is not a factory in sight. And if the main character, Bunt Mullard, owned one, he would have sold it years ago for tens of millions of dollars.What can Mr. Theroux be thinking about ? Did he actually visit Hong Kong ? If so, did he learn anything about its land and its people ? Don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment","review":"Having traveled many times to Hong Kong and having heard aboutPaul Theroux's previous works, but never having read anything by himbefore, I was anxious to read his new book. I expected a good novel set in a very exciting part of the world. What I found was a story badly flawed by (the author's ??)senseless and shocking racism - combined with a totally unreal portrayal of Hong Kong (as it was before the hand-over and as it is today). There is nothing to recommend in this book, and I see that most other Amazon reviewers have experienced the same disappointment. A writer with the past success and presumed skill of Paul Theroux should certainly be capable of delivering something far better than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Victorian in its ignorance . . .","review":"Typical Theroux: a splash of acid on some old, rottingtripe.

It seems to be set on Mars for all the accuracy in location and characterization. I live in Hong Kong and have done so for 8 years. I am Australian and even I don't have such a dismal opinion of the British. I can see from the above reviews I am not alone! I have been a fan of Thereaux fiction for years. I think his travel books are arrogant and tedious. I loved the books of Africa where I travelled extensively. He must be desperate for money!! I will think twice about buying his next book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Racist and with zero basis in fact","review":"Paul Theroux should really have visited Hong Kong before hefigured on cashing in on the \\"handover\\". Of course his stockforeigners are shadowy and dangerous. Of course his Chinese women are sweet, submissive and beautiful. Of course! Paul Theroux once again trots out his boring stupid prejudices.Interesting fact missed missed by Theroux during his research through Hong Kong tourist guides- Kowloon Tong is not an industrial area but an exclusive residential zone. There are plenty more of these, fact fans.

The openingpage was the worst I have ever read. Despite the offer of a hefty reviewers fee, I could not bring myself to wade through such moribund and ill-conceived flotsam.

It makes one wonder why this was not the major hit song it deserves to be. Overall, it is a good place to start if you are unfimilar with most of Sheena's songs or if you are a casual fan. If not, I'd suggest getting her individual albums before this compilation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheena Easton - Greatest Hits Remastered","review":"I had at one time, the original album and this remastering has ruined her voice quality and songs.

Not that anyone else who has left feedback does work for them! I am not implying any such thing! But I do not. I just love this tea. I have found that one tea bag makes one 8 oz. cup of tea. The first thing I notice when I sip CS Vanilla Hazelnut is a nutty flavor I have never experienced with any other. I am not a big tea drinker to begin with, coffee being my drink of choice, but I have at least one cup of Vanilla Hazelnut every evening after dinner and I could not care less if I have dessert to go with it, that's how satisfying I find it to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I expected to like this tea because I love the flavors of hazelnut and vanilla, but I am disappointed with the flavor of this tea and even \\"doctoring it up\\" with sugar and milk doesn't make it appealing to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"I bought a six pack, thinking that I love normally love any beverage with vanilla and/or hazelnut.

A young king of the sea who defended his realm from any and all evil. Today Aqua-Man acts very much like Namor; The Sub-Mariner, he hates air breathers, attacks those who pollute the sea, and he can't seem to get his personal life in order. That pretty much desribes these new stories in this volume. Aqua-Man has not been treated well by comic book writers for much of this decade, with him loseing his right arm and becoming more and more of a character that walks the line between right and wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best yet!","review":"I've been a fan for awhile and this is by far their best album.

The stripped down acoustic presentation serves to underscore Young's creative musical genius and his talkativeness between numbers reveals an amiable personality at 25 that would take on an increasingly steely edge with age. With all the recent concert releases among my favorite artists (Grateful Dead/Doors/Byrds/Dylan), I can't remember the last time I listened to a studio album or even a culled collection of live tracks.

CD should not cost more than $5 in this cardboard sleeve. Guaranteed to be quickly scratched when the slightest debris gets into the sleeve. Doesn't stack well or fit cleanly into CD cabinet. The packaging is about as \\"cool\\" as the $40 t-shirts at the concert I just went to. The recording is a good example from the period, but the medley on 4-Way Street is much more powerful.

It's a true \\"classic\\" that has been around for 15 years. I mostly agree with \\"pianistcritic's\\" earlier review here, except that I found Steve Amerson's rendition of \\"Is There a Place?\\" to be quite excellent and very appropriate for the CHRISTmas season. He was one of the song's composers. If lip-sync was used, it was done tastefully. This is a MUST HAVE video which I find is excellent for gift-giving. You'll play it every year! It really gives you the Christmas spirit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doctor Who: The Macra Terror","review":"Few of these Doctor Who novelisations can be called litery masterpieces , in fact some of them are just downright bad , but for me THE MACRA TERROR is almost certainly the worst of the whole range. What\`s wrong with it ? Allegedly the televised story the novel is adapted from is \\" a classic \\" , but reading this bland novelisation left me underwhelmed . It lacks anything resembling atmosphere or charachterisation. In fact it\`s just like reading a script with a few brief visual descriptions thrown in. I know the Target series of Doctor Who novelisations are aimed at children but that\`s no excuse for not thrilling the reader. Tedious in the extreme"},{"rating":"2","title":"blues that make you smile","review":"Much of bb king's stuff is \\"more of the same\\" but I can't stop listening to this one. It is a very casual and very inspired recording that is technically very well recorded. Just try not to smile as BB and Bobby try to catch each other in verses with no obvious rhyme. It is equal parts blues, soul, intimate riffs, big groovy horns, house rockin music, and down home storytelling. The interaction of these two artists with each other and with the audience is first class.

This CD just doesn't do it for me. It is very soft and lyrically weak, girls will probably love it and it will sell but it is not their best. No Cntrol is probably the best song on here; Green Hell and Zicky's song are also very good. Good enough opens with some very promising riffs but lyrically turns into the common \\"soft\\" theme of the rest of the cd. The rest are pretty much weak filler and are worth no more than a listen to figure that out. I'm not sure if it was Atlantic records that caused this or what but I hope they can rebound very soon with some new material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much!","review":"Pepper has come up short on this album.

I like you guys, I like some of the songs on this record and you are fun in concert, but I can't help myself continually feel like that the band should just cover Sublime. Pepper writes some good songs and I can't complain about any of it (drop it at a party on any given summer day and people will all be smiling and grooving with it), but Sublime wrote better songs and the sound of this band is not different enough for me to actually label them anything other than a wanna-be Sublime band.Sorry.

But UNDERNEATH THE ONION TREES is even better than much of his other work.It's a mellow, acoustic side of Bob that we've seen glimpses of on other albums. Mitch Watkins is the guitarist here, and he's amazing. His playing is stunningly beautiful, and Bob has provided some lovely songs to go with Mitch's playing.This is the sort of album that you listen to with the lights off and a glass of wine in your hand, late at night. Truly one of the most intimate albums I've ever heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another side of Bob Schneider","review":"Together Bob Schneider and Mitch Watkins deliver a fine mello work of art. I strongly suggest for you Schneider fans...get the DVD recorded at Bend Studio featuring these two guys. They play these songs and more, very good. Mitch is a master on the guitar!! This one proves that Schneider is so versital, as he is on the jazzy 'Galaxy Kings'. For Rock, you'll want 'The Californian'.

As she got older she wanted to have a snack but didn't want to sit in her highchair. This item allowed us to give her a snack and let her to have it anywhere. It is wonderful for shopping, when you don't want to be picking up an entire bag of goldfish off the floor after your child dumped it out. Or when visiting friends and family, not only eliminating mess at their homes but also in your car. We love this item and it holds up really well. Toss it in your diaper bag and you are good to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"completely pointless for our 10 month old","review":"Maybe our daughter is too young to use this product as intended. As soon as we gave it to her, she understood how to reach in to retrieve a snack, but she quickly learned to completely remove the top. Ultimately, fun won out over hunger and she either held down one of the flaps and then shook the container; thereby releasing all contents onto the floor and her lap; OR she just removed the top and dumped the contents onto the floor and her lap. We gave it to our neighbors and their 15-month old is able to use the snack catcher just fine. It's possible that our daughter will grow into being able to use this, but I'm not entirely convinced. Why is it so easy to pull the top off? A screw top instead of a pull on/off lid would be more appropriate, I think."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Pack","review":"I am very disappointed this is just a one pack when these are typically sold as two packs.

Upon using it, I initially thought it well-made and durable, despite the inevitable falling out of a few Cheerios whenever my 21mo toddler would use it. And she loved eating out of this cup. After a few weeks, however, I noticed several red scratch marks on her hand - the same hand that she uses to take the snack out of the cup! I inspected her for a couple of days and decided to chuck the cover. I still use the cup part because we like the handle. Although there's a lot of spillage without the cover, it's better than the cuts she's gotten. I wish Munchkin would redesign the cover to make it safer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive, misleading","review":"Call me ditzy for not realizing that there was only one in the package, but the picture shows 2. I should have read the fine print, but I felt this was a little misleading.And, $8 for 1???? If I had realized there was only one, I never would have bought it. And, I definitely wouldn't have bought it for a 2-year old that is smart and immediately knew how to get the lid off and dump his snacks everywhere!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Photo is misleading","review":"While this may be a really good product (don't know, haven't tried it yet), I placed my order expecting to receive 2 snack cups since the picture shows 2. I was surprised when I received my order to learn that there was only one. Had I known this, I would have ordered from a different company that offered a second snack cup for 60 cents more than I paid for this one. I am very disappointed in Amazon that they supplied a photo which is misleading to the consumer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading picture","review":"I should have paid more attention to the other reviews! I love the snack cup, but did not realize that you actually only get one (even though the main picture is of two).

We have purchased quite a few \\"adult\\" themed games to play and this is by far the most fun! If you want to laugh a ton and drink quite a bit in the process then this is a perfect game for you. It is a great way to liven up any party and makes for great conversation topics long after you've played.Warning: If it is not your intention to get drunk then this is probably NOT the game for you. You could always substitute juice or something but I really think it loses something in that translation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"If you're looking for that one \\"adults only\\" party game that really pushes the boundaries without pushing it over the edge, this is the game to get. Where Loaded Questions really relies on a level of unknown between the players, this one is great even if you're close friends; and it can be easily tailored to the comfort level of the group (which changes quickly, since it's a drinking game).Educational? It seemed like it was almost impossible to walk away from it without knowing more about the people you're playing with. It's a great ice breaker, and once you get started even lets people who don't normally open up feel free to have a good time.The only complaint would be that you need to relax the drinking requirements a bit, since it doesn't pull punches on the amounts it calls for... you'd have to be a pro to get all the way through the game. Tailor the rules for your group a bit, keep an open mind, and this is the best party game I've played."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks","review":"Bought for game night and wife and friends enjoys it... aWESOME!!! aWESOME!!! aWESOME!!! aWESOME!!! aWESOME!!! aWESOME!!! aWESOME!!! aWESOME!!! aWESOME!!! aWESOME!!! aWESOME!!! aWESOME!!! aWESOME!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game for girls weekend!","review":"Bought this for a girls weekend and we had so much fun playing it.

When I read it, I was hoping his critical comments would prove to be simply wrong, or at least too harsh. But in fact they are right on target. First, he is correct that the tea itself does not look at all like the image on the webpage (it doesn't consist of what looks like rolled leaves, but rather is in tiny flakes). Most importantly, he is right about the flavor. There is practically none; and the flavor that is there is stale, dull. It is the most insipid green tea I have ever drunk (and I have drunk many kinds, from China, Japan, Sri Lanka, etc.); but in light of the off-putting nature of the flavor, I was actually glad there was not more of it. This tea might, in light of its price, look like a bargain; instead, it is exactly the opposite...a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best green tea","review":"Was pleased as to receivingmy favorite tea.

Roger Moore is at his best. I love the way he talks to the viewer at the beginning and end of every episode. Very personable.If you are a fan of the B&W;, gritty, 60's spy genre, you will enjoy this series better than the later \\"color\\" Saint episodes. These earlier shows are based on the Leslie Charteris, creator of The Saint, original stories.

Please release more of the early episodes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Saint Collection Set I Review","review":"This is really cool. I remember the old reruns on TV from when I was little, and recall enjoying them so I took a chance and bought this set. I do not regret it. Even these early episodes are very well-written, well-acted, and to my surprise the film quality is quite good. Sometimes with older TV shows you get iffy visual quality, but these are crystal clear. Moore is terrific as the Saint. It's also cool to see different parts of the world circa the early 1960's. Cool cars, cool furniture, everyone is well-dressed, and of course Moore is very classy. The thing that impressed me the most is the writing and the plots. I was afraid TV from this era might not age well, but they're not cheesy at all, and they really did age quite well. Still completely watchable today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent -- one episode description is off...","review":"Love this hard-to-find product.

The back of my case sums it up as, \\"Germs before wisdom finds Simon dabbling in biotechnology\\". Huh?! The plot had nothing to do with that, and I have found it more accurately described elsewhere as, \\"Simon financially invests in a friend's pearl diving scheme in Mexico, but the venture goes horribly wrong.\\" It is, even more accurately, a love story.

(Yea!) A Great Magazine for Horselovers!","review":"This magazine really scratches an itch when it comes to beautiful horse photos and individual breed studies, not to mention the excellent horse training articles and very important horse care information contained in each monthly edition. The attractive layout and precious letters from horsey readers (I was especially touched by the letters from owners of older horses) makes this magazine a great pick for horse-lovers of all kinds -- owners and non-owners, and very enlightening for wanna-be-owners. The advertising section in the back of the magazine is a great resource for locating breeders, tack and supplies, where to go for a weekend getaway on horse-back, and even schools that offer education in Vet/Farrier fields.

Zander's influences show throw the music with covers of tunes by Harry Nilsson, and Neil Young. Tell It To The World is reminiscent of earlier songs by George Harrison, and Reactionary Girl immediately brings the Rolling Stones to mind.

None of this is really the manufacturer's fault or Amazon's (although I did return it for credit), but the construction is quite weak. Just a light hit will permanently dent this thing.In addition, while I didn't use it, the size was rather small. I would have had a hard time getting more than 2 days of clothes in it.

This simple solution is cheap and it works! No need to pull out the garbage disposal or even go under the sink to install the new splash guard. Working from above the sink, just push the new splash guard into the neck of the disposal. It'll fit snugly, conceal the old splash guard, and work better than the old one ever did. And, even though it's installed externally, it won't become accidentally dislodged. It's also easy to pull out for cleaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"it works","review":"This wheel kept on spinning just like I hoped it would! hahaIt's very simple and looked great on my truck.If you order the center caps, be sure to order the stainless steel not the cheapper ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny but....","review":"The Guys looked NOTHING like the two girls which is where the biggest flaw in the movie was.

I was a huge fan of In Living Color growing up. Even when they where reduced to dumb comedies like Don't Be a Menace... and Scary Movie I thought they where ontop of their game.

Its basically black men putting on \\"white face\\" and making fun of white girls.

All Hell would break loose but I guess its okay to make fun of white people. This movie sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie worth watching!","review":"I have to admit that I did not know what to expect from the film, but as it turns out it is a very pleasant and entertaining movie.White Chicks brings to the screen the story of two FBI agents who go \\"deep\\" undercover in an effort to prevent two wealthy girls from being kidnapped. Along the way, they get into all sorts of trouble resulting in a great comedy!Though not a masterpiece, White Chicks is a very funny movie, guaranteed to provide more than a just a few laughs. The casting is very good, and the story is very well written.On the negative side, the unrated version is only in relation to language...Overall, it is a movie definitely worth watching, and even though quite silly at times, it will surely put you in a good mood!Strongly recommended for an evening's entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"FuNnY!!!!","review":"This movie was hilarious i dont know how these people dont think this movie is funny and personally i didnt find anything in this movie racist.

The story is ok, the actors are attractive, the comic dialogue is very entertaining, and the leading ladies (and men dressed as ladies) have excellent chemistry. It's no profound film, it's just a simple comedy. It's not the best film of the year, but it really has some of the funniest scenes of any film this year. I honestly laughed out loud during the film numerous times. Although everyone else laughed too, I worried someone was going to tell me to quiet down a little (I tend to be louder than most people). The point is: I actually noticed that I was laughing a whole lot more than I do at any other comedies. It really had some great moments! Even so, I'll give it overall two to three stars, after all it's no Oscars contender."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie of the year!!!","review":"This movie gets my vote for WORST FILM OF THE YEAR! Marlon Wayans is way to talented to be doing a film like \\"White Chicks,\\" I was expecting a lot more from him. Anyway, the plot is lame, the acting is mediocre, and the jokes are old. Add those ingredients up and you get a really bad movie. Save your money folks for a better movie, such as The Terminal."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS MOVIE!","review":"ok I live in a weathly white suburb.

We own it and i have seen it probably 10 times in the past year. The unrated edition is just a little better than the orginal, but maybe i am just loyal to the orginal?"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK...But not that funny!","review":"I rented this movie expecting so see a laugh-out-loud comedy from the Wayans--this didn't do it for me! The Wayans brothers' FBI job seems a little bit unrealistic, and the voices they use to impersonate the Wilson sisters get pretty annoying by the end. They sound too gabby!There was one part where I laughed when Latrell started singing the Vanessa Carlton song in car...That was my only LOL...If you want to rent a funny movie, don't rent this one. It drains along with not much plot to go on, and tries to have a heartfelt message at the end. Not what I wanted to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racist Garbage.","review":"If this movie was called \\"Blach Chicks\\" and stared two white guys in \\"Black Face\\" I'm betting the two has-been Wayans brothers would be whining about \\"Racism\\".This is trash, nothing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's The World Coming To?","review":"I'll have to agree with the reviewers who claim that this movie shows clear and obvious racial bias towards white people. And yes if this movie had the title BLACK CHICKS or LATINO CHICKS or ASIAN CHICKS etc. there would've been a serious backlash from those respective communities and rightly so. There is a double standard at work here never mind that so called \\"white, western culture\\" is dominant and there is an attempt in this movie to criticize this culture and it's motifs, the Wayans brothers could've done that a little better than this poor and somewhat racist attempt. But like SOUL PLANE, if you don't like it's premise and title don't pay money to see it. It's as simple as that. I expect a little more from the Wayans brothers instead of this film that attempts to cash in on racial stereotyping."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Laughing Matter","review":"This is an awful movie, and not a laugh anywhere. Actually, it's quite disgusting. Not only is it racist towards whites, but it stereotypes blacks. All African Americans should be insulted, and the Wayans should be ashamed of themselves.

Jesus people did you actually watch the movie? I'd say it's the worst movie ever, but I've yet to see \\"Little Man\\". Man, that one has got to take the cake.But as for this movie: the plot is ridiculous, the racism atrocious, the acting makes Paul Walker look like an Oscar winner, and the premise just so lame it makes me want to castrate the writer. I can just hear him thinking: \\"Hey I've got a great idea for a hilarious and original comedy! We'll have two MALE fbi agents go undercover as WOMEN! Hahaha! Histerical! Because really, they're men, but everyone will think they're women! Except the audience, and we'll all laugh at the pranks they pull on people! Oooh oooh wait wait wait... Even better idea!

I do like The scary Movie genre, so this is partly why I saw this. The movie is incredibly funny (its also longer than most comedy movies), and has dozens of funny scenes. And the story is actually quite good compared to previous Scary Movie sagas. If you like comedy movies, this is definetly a must to watch. Although I would admit that it is kind of racist to white people. So if your someone who is easily offended, then you probably shouldn't see the movie. I admit it really is a good movie, but I know most white people are going to get really offended. Its still enough to lit some sparks.

I had very high hopes. I liked the Scary Movie series (with the exception of the third one) and the previews made it look promising. Well, the opening scene didn't get any chuckles out of me and 45 minutes into the film I still hadn't even broken a smile. I think I have a pretty good sense of humor, but this movie just didn't cut it for me. The makeup jobs were horrible. You could tell they were men wearing makeup. I figured it looked so bad because it was a very large screen. When I noticed it was on Starz! I thought I'd check it out to see if it was any more convincing. Nope! Still looked just as bad on a regular TV screen, too.The makeup aside, the jokes were not very amusing and it was pretty unbelievable that these two bumbling boneheads were FBI agents. But I guess if you like toilet humor and fart jokes you just might enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"As I sat down to watch this movie, I wondered who would be the brunt of the jokes, blacks or whites. To my joy, it was neither.It seems this time the high class, dingy rich snobs are the ones put down and in quite a humorous way.The Wayans brothers play FBI agents, who despite trying so hard keep messing up. Finally, they see a chance to redeem themselves and foil a kidnapping of two rich sisters, due to take place at a weekend at the Hamptons. Taking the white rich sisters place,made-up to look like them, the fun begins.This movie had some good chuckles in it,and I found it entertaining.Shirley Johnson"},{"rating":"1","title":"Racist","review":"I have to agree, this movie is racist and unfairly stereotypes white women.Don't buy this piece of $h!t."},{"rating":"1","title":"a laugh or two at most","review":"this film had some moments early on,but it was a bad joke after a while.alot of cliches involved&wahtnot.it had a little message in there,but this film was a Bad joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"i thought this movie was pretty ood.......not my favorite but good. there were more than a couple amusing parts. i probly wont buy it but i might rent it a couple times"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I dont know why people hated the crap out of this movie!

These type of movies can be very funny and entertaining, either intentionally (\\"Johnny Dangerously\\") or unintentionally (\\"Mars Needs Women\\").\\"White Chicks,\\" on the other hand, is truly horrible. Normally, I would chalk up 5 star reviews for a bad movie as something to do with its kitsch, camp, or cult appeal. So, while I can tolerate a 5 star rating for \\"Pootie Tang\\" (a pretty entertaining and very funny bad movie), I find it disturbing a significant number of people gave \\"White Chicks\\" 4 or 5 stars.If you watch this movie, you will have wasted 90 minutes of your life, time you could have spent staring at the ceiling or watching water freeze.What is truly sad is that the people who did find value in this movie do not even realize it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Movie is Hillarious.","review":"This movie is absoloutely hilarious.

Ugly women (whereas the two they were impersonating were HOT!) but still believable women.Wayans, why are you not trying serious roles?

It is so, so terribly and disgustingly pathetic that even kids will cry from the pure sadomaschist images seen on screen. The people didn't even try to make Mel believable; it's like the production desiger said, \\"let's take some of this crap latex and stick it onto some metal parts. Take apart this Electo-set motor and form it into a turtle.\\" Seriously, did director Joey Travolta honestly think the mechanical turd was convincing? You can freakin' see the skin flopping around over the mechanics! And the visual effects are so, so poor that you'd think Uwe Boll would use them in his next mockfest. Ernest Borgnine was definitely on drugs to believe he could save this atrocity.

The novel traces the lives of two relatives, Annalukshmi and Bala. Annalukshmi is a bookish teacher who is the eldest of three daughters. She is facing pressure to marry but she wishes to remain a teacher. Unfortunately for Annalukshmi, having a career and marriage are mutually exclusive. Bala is the son of a prominent Colombo citizen who is a closet homosexual. When his former lover from London appears in Sri Lanka to work on a commission about the future of British colonial rule in Sri Lanka, he is forced to confront his past and come to terms with the fact that he gave up his true identity to satisfy his father. The book traces the political issues of the time as well as critiques the social mores and is a very interesting look at the conflicts inherent in colonial society."},{"rating":"1","title":"too long","review":"A novel set in the upper class of the gracious, repressive and complex world of the 1920's.Cinnamon Gardens is a suburb of Colombo and was built by the colonial masters for the purpose of gain. In these and around the gardens were exclusive homes; in two of these homes were related family members. This book tells of two families and their stories are intertwined. There is the uncle Balendram, who must suppress his secret desires and urges. And Annalukshmiis, a young teacher and niece of Balendram, whose family has arranged marriage to a man she does not love, causing her to be torn between family honor and her own independent nature.I found this to be a mature complex read of 400 pages. Fascinating read of the 1920's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"A novel very well written in which the individual stories of each one of the personages interacting themselves in their emocional or family relationship represent each one of the political, religious or social tendencies of the colonial Ceylon in the 1920s.Cinnamon Garden, an aristocratic neighborhood in Colombo, Ceylon is the setting of this story where cingaleses, tamils, mixed raced and brittish live together and debate themselves between their millenary customs or the new one introduced by the colonialist, the christianism or the traditional religions, the social liberalization or the cast prejudice, the colonial status quo or independency, traditionalism or progress, a debate that confront each one of the personages and ruled their lives.A story masterly written recommended for those readers who enjoy a novel where history and manners mixes with a good trama."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Mr. Selvadurai","review":"I enjoyed the book and found the author's personal website immensely helpful and rewarding.

Pretty good and ofen brilliant, in fact.","review":"At his best, David Foster Wallace is an astute chronicler of the often needless (and fruitless) complications characters create for themselves. In these eight stories, he outlines the absurdity, sadness, and sheer comic reality of the outer-edge of consciousness. Fashion magazine editorial boards, consumer research companies, and paranoid office situations are among the areas fictively explored where human activity fractures into dozens of frantic, nervous tangents. Oblivion is a dizzying, daring set of tales - a riveting virtuoso performance. Ironic, yes, that Wallace's exhausting \\"maximalist\\" style, which seems dedicated to fitting everything in sight into a sentence that contains everything else, works best in his shorter pieces: the humor hits harder, the stretches of associations don't have time to die on the vine."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Like DFW, You'll Like This; If Not, You Won't","review":"This is not DFW's best work in my opinion but it's still excellent. I particularly liked the story \\"Good Old Neon.\\" The first story of the collection \\"Mr Squishy\\" was boring and overcooked to me and the worst of what makes DFW's writing so distinctive. I was afraid I wouldn't enjoy the collection, but I'm glad I persisted, because I've liked all the subsequent stories a lot.As I say in the headline, I think if you like DFW's style, you'll enjoy this. It's very much \\"him\\" and in no way a departure. There are less footnotes, but the parenthetical type lengthy digressions are still there along with his slavish devotion to grammatical sentences, the sort of errant pedantry up with which most writers will not put. But for him, I've always found it charming. He has the intelligence and talent to make it work. But if you've read his other works and found this sort of thing tedious, you'll surely not enjoy this one either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Depressing","review":"A friend told me that David Foster Wallace was a great author whom I should read. Because I found this one in the library I thought it would be a good one to start with. Well, I have MDD (Major Depressive Disorder) and researched later to find out that this author killed himself because of his own mental ilness(ess). I struggled through this (mainly just to be able to say I did) but it caused me to use alot more of my anti-anxiety meds to do it! It seems that what many people call \\"irony\\" (from a review I read of the book) just seems to be more to be miserable about to me. Too dark and oppressive, I think. Not sure if I will try more of his work later. Maybe it will be lighter."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same","review":"There are writers who engage almost solely a reader's intellect. There are also writers who engage almost solely a reader's possibility for emotional response (of course these latter often peddle to softness and sentimentality). Then there are writers capable of doing both, and doing it smart. I was hoping for a little of this bothness in this collection, hints of which I had seen in DFW's earlier stuff. But, alas, nada. These stories mostly sacrifice story for style and a systems-kind of cultual crit, which is great, if it can be woven into something where you give damn about what you're reading. I found these stories to be mostly tedious and a retread of previously covered ground by the author. If you're a fan, you'll probably love this, but if you are, like me, only one of the curious many, regardless of your personal tastes in writing, there just isn't much here to hold you in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read this to study for the GRE, but not to be entertained","review":"This is fiction of a style I would label A.D.D. prose: there is very little action yet we spend pages reading about dribbly insignificant details. It is easy to lose focus while reading this book. Wallace writes sublimely detailed sketches of the characters, but it is only a still life; there is no action, no dimension. The one redeeming quality is the English of this book; extremely erudite, it is like reading a dictionary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something like an enema","review":"I'm going to wait until it gets cold enough to burn this guy's book. \\"Oblivion,\\" couldn't be a better title, while reading these stories--I couldn't actually bear to finish even one of them-- you feel as if you have entered some circle of Hell, and your punishment is to have to read all this crap.

We follow a small group of blind Tibetan teenagers on a journey to climb a mountain right next to Everest (23k feet in elevation... no easy journey); a daunting task for anyone, let alone someone who is blind. As we follow this journey it seems like the goal of reaching the summit is impossible, and this is why the movie works so well.I found myself rooting for these people so much it almost hurt. That being said this movie also presents an interesting perspective on how different people and cultures view life... the journey towards the peak in this case being a microcosm of life itself. Is the most important thing about the hike getting to the actual peak... or is the journey itself what is important? This one is just what the doctor ordered for a nice dose of inspiration... and to put things in perspective. I loved it. 4/5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Midnight Lace: Classy thriller with star-studded cast","review":"Midnight Lace was one of my favorite suspense movies growing up. Starring a stellar cast of Doris Day, Rex Harrison, John Gavin, Myrna Loy and Roddy McDowall, the movie features Day as an heiress married to a London business tycoon. Wedded only three months and living in the unfamiliar London, Day becomes the target of a caller who says he is going to kill her before the month is out. Police say it is only a telephone talker who likes the \\"intake of her breath,\\" but the calls continue with increasing knowledge of personal information. She is surrounded by a barrage of possible suspects, including an admiring construction foreman, a gambling colleague of her husband's, the ne'er do well son of her maid and a mysterious figure shown following her about town. Suspense esclates as Day's nerves threaten her undoing, and an exciting climax brings Day face to face with her tormentor. Why this isn't on DVD yet in the U.S. is unfathomable to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Hitchcockian...","review":"This is a great movie; you'd think it was a Hitchcock.

She was PERFECT in this, & the suspense keeps you guessing 'til the end( as noted by another reviewer). I don't remember ever seeing John Gavin in any other movie( 'tho I'm sure he was).Well written, performed and filmed. Truly the best film of 1960 in my opinion, & the best performance of her career.

It's Doris Day in a vey different setting of being under the power of a husband who wants to do her in by driving her insane. Quite the opposite of most of Doris Day's films where, opposite Rock Hudson she always plays with a bit more upper hand of what the man is up to and makes him work for it.

Not one shred of evedience is offered to back up any claim that this is the only thing you need to know how to invest. The fact that volume is totally discounted as usless information should regulate this book to the \\"don't waste your money\\" pile.

When Lonelyland came out we stopped going to his shows because Steamboat closed and it was too long of a line to get into Antone's. Instead we would sit on the porch, drink beers till the sun came up and listed to Lonelyland. I even heard his stuff being played in Phoenix while on vacation, but unfortunately like all Austin musicians of that time, he fell into a void and his music lost something.

Ive been searching for awhile for the right kind of vanity for a great price... then I came upon this and was thrilled... as I stated before... I received my package today... while I was unpacking the product, I saw that there were no screws!!!! I rechecked the box and all the packaging and still... I FOUND NO SCREWS OR INSTRUCTIONS!!!! And to top it off... the dealer isnt even open on Saturday... so that means I have to wait until Monday with all these pieces of wood before I can file a complaint... overall... the product is exceptional (I would have given it 5 stars if it wasnt for the fact that they forgot to add the screws)... Right now, Im just extremely upset that I cannot put it together!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It is impossile to get it assembled","review":"Do not waste your time and money with this. The package consists three main items, Chair, Mirror and the desk. You are supposed to use the screws (included) to attach the mirror on the desk. However, it is impossible to do so.... Either the screws are too short or the wood is not dense enough to hold the screw tight or both. Very disappointed with this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Better Introductions are Available","review":"Aside from an attractive dustjacket and artwork within, this book is not worth buying. I got rid of mine as fast as I bought it. If you're looking for a pictorial, gift-type book with an easily understandable overview of Christian mysticism, then I recommend Ursula King's Christian Mystics. For more indepth, non-pictorial, introductions to Christian mysticism, I highly recommend Bernard McGinn's \\"The Foundations of Mysticism\\" and Evelyn Underhill's \\"Mysticism.\\" The latter is a classic text and the former (along with the other four volumes in The Presence of God series) is soon to be. - Brad Clark"},{"rating":"1","title":"Break out the cookie cutter, kids!","review":"I bought this album without real high expectations, but even my low expectations weren't met. This album fights just to be decent. The first two songs get it going right, and the fifth song \\"Phoenix With a Heartache\\" is great, but *all* of the other songs sound the same. And I thought they were supposed to be a hard rock band. Well, if they are they need to get out and show it, cuz this cd sounds like another Christian rock band leaning way to hard on the praise and worship scene. The lead singer has a very unique voice, but I'm not exactly sure if I like it or not... and his screams sound a little to much like a squeeling pig at times. The guitar is lack luster.If you want to get some truly unique punk-rock-hard-rock-emo check out Blindside, Anberlin, Skillet, or Showbread. This will only disappoint you if you want to listen to some quality music.

It felt like you were strapped to a chairand injected with some tiresome 70s feminism. All men are creepy,women are perfect,if frail,and every word coming out of Swanks mouthis a form of a lecture. It was so bad,I damned near cheered when shevanished.The film had a nearly cartoon quality to it,for the character of Earhartwas so smug and self righteous that you felt that Joan of Arc haddonned a leather flying hat. Whats with the Boston style accent? Ameliawas Kansas born and LA and other points west raised.

I love the story of this pioneering woman! But this movie was a terrible disappointment. We had to keep explaining the plot to my daughter AND to each other. My husband and I were constantly asking each other \\"what was THAT supposed to mean?\\" The flow was so muddy and inconsistent that at one point we replayed to make sure the disk hadn't skipped forward. Amelia came off as a weary celebrity more than a gutsy barrier-leaper. There was a lot more \\"making money so you can fly\\" than actual flying, which may be how it really was in real time but not what a viewer wants to watch. The romantic relationships were time-consuming but not interesting. The story was BOOOORRRRING. Where was the sense of wonder that made her famous? A wasted opportunity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Factual But Routine Biopic","review":"\\"Amelia\\" is a biopic about the career of aviatrix Amelia Earhart (Hilary Swank), who broke many records in the early years of flying and was the first woman (and second person, after Charles Lindbergh) to fly solo across the Atlantic. Mira Nair has directed a routine biopic, when her subject calls for far more. Earhart was a feminist, a flier, a worldwide celebrity, an author, and a self-promoter, but the movie portrays her life in ho-hum, linear fashion. It relates the facts -- her championing of flying, and her relationships with publisher George Putnam (Richard Gere) and TWA founder Gene Vidal (Ewan McGregor) -- but never rises above a celluloid Wikipedia entry. Swank's portrayal is curious. She employs a Katharine Hepburn-like accent and speech pattern despite the fact that Earhart was from Kansas, not New England. Blu-ray and DVD extras include deleted scenes and behind-the-scenes footage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old-Time Moviemaking Shines Through; A Real Treat for Pilots","review":"This fine movie is a return to the traditional tenets of film making, with memorable performances by all involved.

So I guess you should take this review with a grain of salt since I only saw about 45 minutes of the movie. But man were those 45 minutes BAD!!! I usually like Hilary Swank, but her acting in this movie was just...weird - as if Amelia Earhart had Assberger's or something. Her acting was so stilted and wooden that it was really hard to relate to the character. There's no way anyone actually talks that way, unless there's something wrong with them.As for the story itself...it just didn't go anywhere - or if it did eventually, it took longer than 45 minutes. I can't really say much more about it because I can't even remember what happened in those 45 minutes, either because nothing in particular happened, or it was so bad that I blocked it out. This movie was so bad it almost makes it worth watching to marvel at its badness...but not quite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much ado about nothing","review":"The movie is a feminist glorification of achievements that, if accomplished by a man, would not have gotten the least attention. The only lesser-known facts (if they are facts) concern the sordid adultery between Amelia and a man she got the government to appoint to a government job so she could have him around. When Amelia had her lover boy and his son move in with her and her husband, even her meek husband protested. The only sequence of interest showed A and her male navigator lost over the Pacific, but that sequence was stretched on and on and on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Movie","review":"This is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. How many scenes did they think we really wanted to see of those two gazing into each other's eyes. And, wasn't he wearing a wedding ring when he met her and a woman who was apparently his wife was seen in the background of one early shot. Then the ring disappeared with no mention of a wife and what he did with her. The movie was a very good example of exploitation on a grand scale of a woman with very little actual expertise or judgement and there just wasn't anything else to the story. Richard Gere's eyes have always been way too small and too close together but the glasses just made it look worse. This movie is a waste of everybody's time. The makers and the viewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Pan Amelia","review":"Not a very good movie. The actors tried I guess. They were bearable.The movie itself was badly flawed.It did not move along smoothly.

The costumes, color,lighting, was great.I couldn't help wondering how we won the air war in the Pacific with the technology shown in the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great actors in a really badly directed movie!","review":"Not only is the script bad, the thing doesn't flow and is full of technical errors! The really glaring one has to be that it'd be really interesting to see what would have actually happened if someone had really filled up an Electra's engine oil tank with aviation fuel! How about two enlisted coasties saluting each other? A cutter backed up to what looks like 100' from an island's beach? Very few of the scenes flow and much of the dialogue consists of quotes from letters, books and transcripts of radio messages all taken in or out of context. Amelia is first made out to be a simple 'country girl' then has flights of poetic rapture about flying. Hilary Swank very seldom gets to do more than just resemble her. Gere turns out probably the best performance, while McGregor is barely able to be satisfactory. Probably not the fault of these three, but the movie isn't worth more than a rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"amelia","review":"I picked this movie without question.because who doesnt love richard gere and hillary swank is an excellent actress as well and a first for the two to be paired up, but have to say i was very dissapointed. It definately proves that it takes more than an award winning cast to pull off a poorly written story. It started off very slow and did very little to keep your interest throughout the whole boring movie. Richard needs to stick with julia roberts, debra winger, etc. No love lost sparks with hillary......"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"This plot should have focused more on the historical aspects of her accomplishments and some of the fluff should have been cut out. unremarkable performance by Swank, Gere & McGregor"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but short, interview with Hilary Swank","review":"If you like this movie, or Hilary Swank, this is probably worth a look.

If you know basic science of atoms and space and are looking for a deeper understanding of how to find God or the meaning of life you should continue with other videos' of Chopra's. After viewing other videos' of Chopra's like \\"Deepak Chopra: The Essential DVD Collection\\" I found this video very shallow, but I am a scientist so have a very good grasp of Quantum Physics, so my view may me skewed. I learned much more from his other videos'. You will also learn more from his videos' if you have tried some meditation and read some on eastern religions like Buddhism.

I did't gain any new information in watching this and my focus was mainly on its production value and how uplifting it was (as claimed on the dvd jacket)Unfortunately I didn't feel excited watching this or uplifted. The dvd just felt very monotone throughout and I realize it wasn't done on a large budget, but the graphic effects were mostly below par.This dvd may be more ideal for introducing someone into eastern spirituality.

However as usual it pales compared to the book. There is lots of glitz, sound bites and half stated thoughts. If you read the book before hand or already have an innate understanding of the subject then this film makes a great supplement however it is not organized enough to get anyone off the ground and is no place to start or finish.This presentation in its attempt to simplify and be entertaining will be misleading to those people that think watching this presentation will give them anymore than a superficial introduction.However Deepak is quite impressive and you will get much more from \\"God and Buddha - A Dialogue\\" (1999)God and Buddha - A Dialogue ~ Deepak Chopra"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"How To Know God\\" dvd review","review":"I was drawn to the dvd because of the interest that I've had over the years for the writings of Deepak Chopra.

I was not disapointed. In fact as I've shared it with many of my friends, they have ordered copies of their own. It was informative, yet, not didactic.

I had hoped \\"How to Know God\\" would be a good introduction to Chopra's thinking, which I want to learn more about. Instead, I found it very glitzy, full of his ego, quite dull, and containing very limited development of his ideas. His extended treatment of quantum theory is more appropriate to the elementary physics classroom. (I do have a degree in science, though.) I would suggest that his writings are probably of greater interest than this indulgence.

Deadric Malone is the pseudonym of Duke Records owner Don Robey. Joe Scott created and wrote all the hits for Bland when he was signed to the Duke label. Joe Scott's catalog of music under the Duke label has Robey's Name(Malone) with it. Don Robey was not a muscian and he did not write any of the songs that are listed. In that time it was a common practice for label owners to claim credit for the artist and composer's original compositions. Robey used many pseudonym's to claim partial ownership on his artist song credits. Joe Scott was the in house producer for all of the artist on Duke and Peacock Record labels. Joe Scott also was the band leader for Bobby Bland during the height of his career.

It gave me a low fertility level until day 22, when I got two days of high fertility, and then it dropped back down to low and never got to peak. According to the instructions, this means that I did not ovulate, so I assumed that I could not get pregnant that month. BUT, my period never showed up and it turned out that I did get pregnant that month, and I am now 6 weeks along.

I don't know if it's because the seller shipped it in a paper envelope from overseas (the sticks were completely squashed upon arrival) or because the product simply doesn't work. I also bought Ovuquick on the same day just to compare the results, Ovuquick works perfectly.I never understand why the ClearBlue Easy menu says if you hold it in a stream of urine, it will take 3 seconds. But if you submerge it in a cup of urine, it's 15 seconds. Should it be the other way around?I think the only good thing about this product (and why some people have successful results) is because it forces you to start testing on day 6. Sometimes I missed my ovulation day because I tested too late (day 10).

I like the meditative, almost mournful tone of some of the soundtracks, but then others have a certain lightness and sense of humor to them, such as the songs entitled \\"Tony & Elizabeth\\" or \\"Elizabeth & Tony.\\" The music conveys the almost mystified confusion The Queen finds herself feeling at times, but, in the end, there is a feeling of overriding sympathy for her, for the beautiful stag she spots while on her grounds in Scotland and, really, for any of us who have been dismayed or unsettled by our lives at times. Of course, there is also a majestic pride that pervades the whole soundtrack and lends it its moody, powerful textures.

We do supervise and check frequently on the condition of the toy when she seem to be addicted to chewing. Fortunately, she spits out the pieces without swallowing, but when the end looks too chewed up, it's easy to cut it off with the sharp scissors.

She's not an aggressive chewer so it lasted a few months, but I would definitely NOT recommend this to anyone that's got a big time chewer, because this won't last a day for you.Also - just a friendly reminder - watch your dog chewing on this - the plastic pieces do eventually fall off as they chew through the toy.

At the same time, I can't say that this was ever one of my dog's favorites. Nylabone should put some kind of flavoring on these keys to attract the dog and make puppies (who love flavors) more enthusiastic about the toy. My dog likes the chicken and bacon flavored nylabones much more. Although my dog chewed on this sometimes, he often neglected it and was not especially excited when I first gave it to him.

Well, take a look at the 2008 \\"More Conversations with God: An Uncommon Dialogue. This includes Books 2 and 3, a two-color presentation, thick paper, a nice cover, a special Forward by Neale Donald Walsch and, interestingly, a handfull of short interior Commentaries as he introduces sections, notes some of the highlights and discusses thoughts in re-reading the books some years after first publication. A similar edition for Book 1 was released on Kindly and hardback by the original publisher (seeExpanded Anniversary Edition of Conversations with God). For me, I prefer the audio versions most of all."},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGER!","review":"Friends, Avoid this book like the plague! It is filled with fluffy gibberish and makes truth a subjective emotion conjured up in each individual person. It is a dangerous, satanic work that is only good for the fire place. If you want to be your own god and to make your own rules and never face reality, then buy this book. If you are interested in what the true and living God has to say, read the Bible. Remember, we are still accountable for what we choose to believe. The things that this author states about Jesus are absolutely blasphemous. See for yourself if Jesus was as this author descibes Him."},{"rating":"1","title":"this man is stealing your money","review":"He quotes god spoke to him but told him not to believe in words. etc etc. Contradictions like this all through out.

The different colors for him talking vs. God makes it hard to read. It also seems God is saying what the author would hope he would say. Very little so far has given me something to ponder on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God for this book!","review":"This book is almost like an answer to a prayer that I didn't even know I could ask! All my life I have been looking for the answers I found reading this book, and didn't even know it. If you are even remotely open-minded about faith and spirituality, you have to at least read it. Come up with your own conclusions (and for goodness sake let's all think for ourselves for once), but give it a try. It's certainly not going to be very popular with everyone, but it's perfect for me and the way I want to live my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Path to Enlightenment","review":"Read the Trilogy, rent the movie, and begin a transformation like no other.

Get to know God as God really is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disapointed","review":"I had highter expectations for this book. I saw the movie and thought it was great. The book obviously goes more into detail about \\"the conversations with God.\\" The author made God sound like an \\"old hippie\\" concerned only about love, peace and sex. The book accepted open sex as long as that is what makes you happy and makes you \\"feel good.\\" The book even goes as far as suggesting that we as parents need to show our kids how to pleasure themselves!

A total waste of my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete Conversations with God (Boxed Set)","review":"Rec's in BRAND NEW still-in orig. wrap - tho ordered used.Came 3 days after order made vs the later time given while ordering."},{"rating":"1","title":"From God?

Shame on you, Mr Walsch for passing your agenda off as God's voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conversations with God","review":"This book is 100% rubbish, not only does it go against Christian Doctrine but tells it's reads to willingly go against true biblical teachings.

A more advanced reader will however find nothing new here but rather old and simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can you call this the \\"Complete Conservations\\"??","review":"This is only Books 1-3, yet the title says it's the COMPLETE CONVERSATIONS WITH GOD.

God always has and will be holy. Can anyone really think that a just and perfect God will let a mass murder of many Jews enter in heaven? Jesus always has and will be a perfect judge!

Is it because the books made people 'feel' good about themselves and their beliefs? I stopped reading this series when I couldn't stomach any more of this guy's stream-of-consciousness hot air. Where are the skeptics? They're not here debunking New Age dribble like 'Conversations With God' because it's not worth their time and effort. Please, people, read something like Carl Sagan's 'Demon-Haunted World; Science as a Candle in the Dark!' Where is your skepticism in this incongruous world? Just because you 'feel good' about something doesn't prove it has truth to it. And to think that Mr. Walsch is filling his coffers over and over again selling this garbage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsure of Intentions","review":"A few years before I was saved I had read one of the three books included in this set. I was looking for a devotional style book that would get me looking for answers in the Lord's Word - the Bible. However, in reading the introduction to the set, and hearing people thank the author for \\"giving them a God they could believe in\\", I really can't see how this could assist me in my Christian walk. If you are christian, I would suggest looking for something from Family LIfe Ministries or talking to your pastor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than one star. Complete bull and rambling. FICTION.","review":"Don't be fooled, especially by other fools who happen to put their ideas in print. Why do people consider this college drop-out, four-time-divorcee a master of Divinity? What training does he have to validate these \\"answers from God\\"? When you need a medical operation, do you go to someone who dropped out of medical school but has \\"deep wisdom and knowledge in his heart\\"? No. You go to an expert, someone who has studied under other knowledgable and ACCREDITED experts. The answers that Walsch gives are not based on anything but his whim. If you're looking for meaning in your life, go to The Word, which really IS God's answers and guidance for life. There's no better book out there. And it's not fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's NOT God!","review":"This guy is not God and he can not answer these questions from God's point of view. Anyone who says this book will change your beliefs clearly does not have strong Christian beliefs. With many answers the author simply gives readers what they want to hear, not Bible-based answers. There is a difference between right and wrong and God forgives all of us. The author claims there is no difference so there is nothing for God to forgive us for. Please don't let this book fool you into thinking you are reading the words of God. If you'd like to truly learn God's word then pick up a Bible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful one-book collection of the trilogy","review":"I was expecting three separate volumes but this is actually just one hefty book with the entire COG trilogy included. It's nice to have it all in one place this way. The text is colored in a very readable blue or black depending on who's speaking. The pages are thinner than usual to keep the width of the book down, but it also gives the book a refined feel. The dimensions are slightly larger overall than the separate books, much like a Bible, frankly. I'm extremely happy with it. I put some cell-phone pics on Amazon to help others see what they're getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"My new Holy book!","review":"I feel this book set was life changing. I then bought this book for almost everyone in my family and as they read it, I am reading it a second time. The cover is plain white, and not expensive looking, but if it kept the price down so more people could afford the set then great. In book stores, Book 1 is almost the same price as all three books put together in this one version, so if the cover is plain, who cares. If you are looking for a way to grow spiritually, connect with our creator, or find deeper meaning out of life then this book is a must read. It is the best book I have ever read and I treasure it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walsch","review":"This set is a must for anyone on a journey to improve your life and soul.

The topics in the collection of the 3 book series reveals a loving God's view of all life's events, both personal and historical: birth, passage through death, violent acts of man, sensless tragedy-natural or inflicted by others, suicide, sex, just to name a few. The \\"conversations\\" allow the reader to look at these topics through the eyes of a God that lovingly accepts all creatures, all aspects of the universe as reflections of Her perfection.

I was given one of this author's books a few years ago after the sudden death of my husband. After reading that one I had to read this trilogy and am so glad I did. Mr. Walsch has written so beautifully and answered questions I'm sure a lot of people have asked. This book seems to \\"find you\\" when you need it and then you wonder why you didn't read it sooner! This has become one of my favorite books and one of the best books I've read. I highly recommend it to everyone but also instruct people who do read this to keep an open mind and really think about what you're reading. The overall message is about love and understanding. It's a way to re-think what we've been taught and a new way to look at life and how we live it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"How totally true this book is.

Be prepared to spendmany hours absorbing the language with which God \\"speaks\\" to the author. After consuming Chapter one I took the author's (God?) adviseand went back to the beginning and started over again, Now that I am now re-reading Chapter one I find that this was certainly sound ad-vice! I am now beginning to comprehend the-sometimes difficult language with which God presents His case. Try \\"A History of God\\" ano-ther excellent tome on this subject if you want to dig deeper. Anyway, - 5 stars to Walsch's work; I'm really \\"into\\" this book, but I can onlyspend a couple of hours a day reading it, so I'm beginning to wonder whether I can finish it this year! But don't get discouraged by the some-times heavy going - it is well worth your time I assure you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BIT DISTURBING","review":"While I loved the movie and was very interested in the different perspective, I found myself rather disturb by the word-games that essentially contradicted themselves through out the portion of the book I have read thus far. For example, early in the 1st chapter, the writer indicates that God told him that we are NOT here to learn...and yet in the same chapter some pages later, he indicated that God told him that we are here to experience. Learn=experience, that is what experience is all about. I am finding myself becoming suspicious of the content. I am happy for the man if it improves his life, but there are some very \\"esst\\" new age kind of stuff in here - \\"every one is responsible for hunger\\" for example. Not sure this is the book if you are looking for clarity and truth on a spiritual domain.

The author is projecting his own opinions as the voice of God. These books are false doctrine! What is sad is that people truly searching for God's word may come upon this baloney and really believe these are God's words, especially young people. These are not God's words!

According to Jude 3, the Faith was once for all delivered. The Bible is God's final word to mankind and stands as well now as it did when it was written. It is terribly presumptuous to dare to speak for God outside His Word. Hebrews 4:12-13 tells us His Word is living and active. God speaks through the Bible to people today. There is one message for all mankind. That message is that Jesus saves the obedient who let Him be their Lord and do not assume they can rule their lives. John 20:30-31; Matthew 10:32; Luke 13:3; Matthew 28:18-20;Acts 2:36-38. How fearful to make up words for God to speak!

Save your money (I'd like mine back)and buy Wolf's,\\"The Catchers of Heaven.\\" At least you'll get some truth about what's happening on this planet and outside; a bloody good read with a message of truth, hope and despair.

If you want a good counter balance to these other opinions, I recently read The Stargate Conspiracy by Lynn Picknett/Clive Prince. These Nine are just astral pranksters in my opinion and are using the channeler- she does not have the discretion to know the difference in astral and real cosmic LIGHT beings. This is so obvious if you really READ the book.

It's 100 percent astral in origin. Please all newage searchers- use discretion -this is not the real thing- by that I mean some of the information may be harmless and even true but it is coming from her ego beliefs or the astral realm.

My husband is of African descent, I am not. If the things in this book are true, that means some things that I, personally, am uncomfortable with. I'd want more corroboration of 'Tom's' credentials than have been provided so far before taking his pronouncements as revealed truth.Finally, to the true believers who are feeling offended or threatened by these criticisms - take responsibility for the consequences of the beliefs you espouse.

When I got this album and listened to \\"One Inch of Heaven\\" ...

Will, as portrayed by Pip, is an engaging character with depth and gifts that you really feel for in the book. I loved Sive the Shining and the Fey realm, both good and evil sides. There are battles and love, death and destruction as well as gorgeously evocative scenery across all realms.

Basically, I think the hard drive is not sturdy and once it crashes, it's done for. So, although I really like the unit, can't recommend it especially now that so many other units of similar functionality (including Android and new Win 7 mobile systems) are available from other reputable vendors.

They met by chance and Watson said they would try it for a week and see how it goes. It went for 30 years and ended only because Edwards contracted ALS.

Other racing games are so boring in comparison, because all you do in them is just go around a simple track and try not to hit the walls when you turn.

Also Trackmania can be played very well on an older system. I've played it on an older system and a new, much more powerful computer. It looks great and plays great on both computers. I bought PRG4 for the xbox 360 because it seemed like it had really great graphics. But Trackmania is still much more fun to play and still has excellent graphics. Whoever made PRG4 didn't put enough into making the gameplay fun. I don't know why Nadeo doesn't make an XBox 360 version of their game. They are missing out on a lot of money by not doing that.

This is a nice little thriller centered around actor Miguel Ferrer who loses an organ and tries desperately to keep the other one. Though the theme is a little far-fetched, Miguel and heart-throb Leilani Sarelle Ferrer turn in quality acting performances...and a steamy relationship. The cover of the DVD box implies it may be a horror film...not so. It's just a quaint drama for adults. Miguel reminds me so much of Jack Webb of TV's \\"Dragnet\\" fame in the 50's. He rarely smiles...and has a cold demeanor."},{"rating":"2","title":"strange, hard to follow, pay close attention when viewing.","review":"leilani sarellle is great in this film. too bad she has retired from the screen. does anyone know what shes doing or will she return to movies?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A timeless message....","review":"I'm only 19 years old, but I first became a fan of John Denver after I watched a VH1 Behind the Music on his life. There was something about his simple message that made me buy my first John Denver CD, after that I quickly obtained many more, this one included.This album, \\"Back Home Again\\", is usually what I give my friends to listen to when they ask me why I'm such a big John Denver fan. Songs such as Back Home Again, This Old Guitar, Annie's Song, and Sweet Surrender are some of his staple songs, but that doesn't mean that the rest are just \\"fillers\\". This album has its greatest impact when listened to in its entirety, especially because of the fact that it ends with his classic \\"This Old Guitar\\".It's rare when you can find songs with messages so simple and elegant that they mean just as much now as when they did when originally released, but this album does just that. I recommend it for potential and/or tried and true John Denver fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got an LP not a CD","review":"Amazon, create a way to say an item is an LP not a CD, I thought it was a CD when I bought it and got the LP instead.

Although this album came at the height of John's success, it was never one of my favorites. That goes to \\"Rocky Mountain High\\", \\"Farewell Andromeda\\" and \\"I Want to Live\\", which I'm hoping will all be remastered soon. After hearing this freshly remastered version though, I must say that this is one of John's finer efforts. Although a bit to much country seeps into some of the song's there are many gems to be found. Standout tracks include \\"Eclipse\\", \\"Cool an Green an Shady\\", and \\"Matthew\\". I can remember seeing John perform the songs on this album at the Forum in L.A. on his 74 U.S. tour and the memory is something I will always treasure. If you'r a fan then by all means buy this newly remastered CD and enjoy John's music sounding better than it did way back in 74. If you'r a casual fan then buy the newly remastered \\"Greatest Hits\\" and this one together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every American needs this CD","review":"The CD is great. It's all-American.

It's boring and annoying, most rappers uses dirrty languages anyway. Nelly is smart, he knows that if he's away too long he'll be yesterday's news, so making a cd with remixes when he's in the studios recording a new album will make him popular for a longer time. But who would buy an album with songs that has been overplayed on the radio for years now? none i suppose. Therefore he used his brain again to make videos so dirrty that they could even be porn movies. I often complain about Puff Daddy's videos beeing dirrty but this takes the price. He'll get the attention he wants but in the wrong way. I hope you won't waste your money on this cause it's only desperate artists that makes remix albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"After realizing mostly every song was a on a pervious record, I was very dissapointed.

If only I had ead the tracks on it before opening it, I'm sure I would have returned it.

I think the album is pretty hot, i can't get enough of the remixes. yes the lyrics may be the same, but the switching makes them sound different than the originals. I really like the ride wit me remix with John mayer. Pimp Juice is by far the best song on the album.

Nelly has lost his talent obviously because now his CD's are going to be \\"Reinventions\\" of his old songs. Even \\"Iz U\\" is a terrible song, and it doesn't even grow on you.

The only one I liked was the one with Ronald Isley and whoever the person is on the sax, cause other than that, it was wack. And the interviews in between the songs was unnecessary.

They dont do anything positive to any of the songs, only change the basic beat to some generic crap that sounds like its coming out of a $2 kids keyboard. I am a huge fan of Nelly, but I have to be honest, this remix album is a total waste of money.

I really started disliking this guy when he tried to battle a true rapper(Krs-One).Krs-one is one of the pioneers of modern-day hip-hop. Nelly's lyrics are not clever or witty in any kind of way.

This wasn't a romance. It was a study on the minds of abused women. Putting up with abuse in the name of love...ugh.

Disturbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unromantic and dull","review":"Catherine Coulter is pretty much a hit or miss with me. I loved the other two stories in this series. The Valentine Legacy was a favorite of mine.

He spends almost the whole story saying the meanest things to the heroine. For example, he calls her a \\"stupid cow\\" when he is angry.

There's the incestuous relationship of Marcus and Josephine being 1st cousins. Marcus acting like a complete cad flaunting his mistresses and showing absolutely no regard for anyone besides himself. Love scenes that are abusive, painful acts of rape. And of course no story that could possibly resemble a love story.Why Coulter's books sell is beyond me. She writes like a masogynistic man insulting the feminine ideal of love. Her novels always make me feel sick."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is more a tragedy than a romance","review":"I can't believe how wild, petty, and such a brood Marcus is.

However, some of the characters were inane (Trevor??? and Aunt Wilhelmina?!!) and the romance...well, it seemed more the beginning of a domestic abuse story. Personally, Marcus (the lead love interest) seemed to me a horrible, abusive man whose only assets were his good looks. Also, Catherine Coulter seems to have uncontrollable urges for repetition...did we really need to be told again and again how \\"still and lovely\\" Duchess was?

I first read this book in my high- school years and it inspired me to want to know more and more philosophy. Durant's mixture of the life story and the teaching of the philosophy is especially successful. One of the most moving accounts in the book is of Spinoza who in Durant's words was \\" the only great philosopher who lived in accordance with what he wrote\\"There are histories of philosophy which give more real knowledge of the work of the philosopher( Copleston, Russell, Jones) but Durant's remains an extremely readable and attractive introduction to the whole subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Whigism","review":"Durant jumps from Plato and Aristotle all the way to Francis Bacon.

This is particularly true of Morgoth's Ring, which deals with material which was later to become The Silmarillion, posthumously published in 1977 and often criticized for being too much of a summary. As with the writing of The Lord of the Rings, we see here Tolkien the niggler, writing and rewriting, seemingly never satisfied until finally achieving a great final product. But its exactly that painstaking attention to detail that makes Tolkien so superior to others who seek to produce fantasy, and makes The History of Middle earth so invaluable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Morgoths rng","review":"Most of book is made up of paragraph sized revisions, which was if I remember correctly not stated in book description.

I thought the book was gonna be about Teatime, the various types of teas and a few recipes that I could do at home and how I can do my own teatime at home or a party. It was kinda like that but it was very clinical in a way and it was not very interesting to look at; it doesn't tell you how to really do your own or host a party at all. Its more of a straight forward history lesson more than anything else. There are no color pics, just illustrations were drawn and of old Victorian scenes, mono-color and there were no color pics of the recipes except drawn in ink.

I VOTED for her and was glad to see her take the title.One thing I'm not happy about is that her record label is not promoting Tarralyn period. I didn't even know her CD was in the store.All and all I love the CD, but I was hoping for songs with more substances.

Tarralyn Ramsey proves on her debut album that she indeed does have the pipes it takes to \\"diva\\", however she doesn't have the material to back it up. The album is very generic, over-produced hip-hop style R & B with a hint of a ghetto twist, evident on tracks such as the Murphy Lee featured \\"Baby U Know\\", \\"Dolo\\" and the albums opener \\"Where You Are\\", all of which sound like out takes from Christina Milian's debut. The album stumbles along the entire time being saved only by the incredible ballad \\"Up Against all Odds\\" & another ballad \\"Made for You\\" which showcase her vocal ability all while featuring a catchy melody. Good luck to her in the future, but with material like this I don't see life in the industry past this release."},{"rating":"2","title":"She sounds like Whitney a little bit, but has her own thing","review":"I was surprised to listen to Taralynn Ramsey's album. I thought this was a very new artist, but I noticed she won on the \\"Born To Diva\\" show. And wow, does she ever! This is a good debut for her. She sounds like a younger Whitney Houston on some of the songs. I hear some similarities, but Taraynn has such a strong tone and range in her singing. It might even make the more current-image problem-affected Whitney jealous! The dance numbers are so funky (especially Dolo), they have me dancing to them like crazy! I am very impressed with how she sings \\"Remedy\\" and the smooth and soulful \\"Up Against All Odds.\\"For the next album, I hope that she cuts down a little bit on the Whitney-like riffs and vocal acrobatics and have her own kind of singing.

Normally, a new album has to grow on you. Those of you who didn't hear her gospel album would quickly say this album is really good.

You might even enjoy the flowers... or perhaps Old Ma Pringle... will give you a lift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much-loved series reaches finale","review":"Miss Read has written over 40 titles, with this final tome describing how her headmistress heroine copes with her new-found life of leisure.In an afterword, the author says she is laying down her pen \\"with a thankful heart\\". It is all the more surprising therefore that these final tales show no sign of staleness. In fact, \\"A Peaceful Retirement\\" is quite playful in tone as Miss Read copes valiantly with a series of unlooked-for marriage proposals.Given that the school year is so regular the author manages to describe events such as Christmas celebrations and harvest festivals with no sense of repetition, and as ever captures the tensions between town and country living, children's and adult worlds and men and women beautifully.With this book Dora Saint, the real-life Miss Read, can take her own retirement from authorship knowing that she has served her readers well."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING TEXT AND PHOTOS","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. The author is just basically rehashing information from her previous book.This book is simply redundant. It does not do anything to help a photographer working with infrared acheive anything that he or she couldn't do by reading other and better infrared books out on the market today.The idea of visualizing a scene in infrared has been written about before, as has just about everything in this book. Save your money and look for other better books on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH THE TIME OR MONEY","review":"Very big disappointment! This text offers nothing new or advanced that isn't covered in other, better texts on infrared photography. The photos that illustrate the book are pedestrian and misleading at best. Not a very good effort in writing or shooting at all.Steer clear of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"I thought Laurie White's first book on infrared photography was a must for anyone interested in IR. This new effort does expand the scope of the first book, but fails to go into needed depth where it is crucial. For instance, exposure - it is barely covered and offers no constructive place to start for different lighting conditions. And what is the point of listing alternative developers if you don't include development times & temps. Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"still as fresh and funny as i remembered","review":"I searched for this disc for almost a year until I stumbled on to Amazon. Now five days later I have my Rolf Harris disc and I can sit and listen to all the classics again. Six White Boomers,Tie Me Kangaroo Down,Stairwar To Heaven,they're all here and they are all still great!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic album!","review":"I grew up to the music and antics of Rolf Harris and I think he's a genius. One of my favorite songs as a kid was Tie me Kangaroo Down Sport. This album has that song though not quite the way I remember it, but still good and many others that are so entertaining. I can listen to this album over and over. Among my favorites are Court of King Caractacus, Iko Iko and Waltzing Matilda. Big Dog, Nick Teen and Al K. Hall and Jake the Peg are a scream. They are so funny. Rolf Harris is definitely old school. I can't imagine any current day musician having the audacity to carry off some of these songs. They're not very PC, but they're great. Good entertainment value!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ace!","review":"All the great Rolf songs I remember from my childhood, plus a bunch of standards. There are a few lachrymose tear-jerkers (Sonny, Sylvie, Two Little Teardrops) that I could do without, but many more that I love, especially: Tie Me Kangaroo Down; The Court of King Caractacus; Six White Boomers; and the borderline inappropriate Nick Teen and Al K Hall (which is a kids song, supposedly cautionary, about the joys of smoking cigarettes and drinking).My children (5 and 7) are lapping it up. And it's great to find a kids' CD that doesn't make me want to hide under my bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, crazy and outstanding!","review":"I bought this album as a gift for my wife whose parents listened to Rolf when she was young. The album starts off great a lot of his vintage tunes and includes a few surprises. Jake the Peg (which I hadn't heard before) is worth the price of the album alone! Just a lot of fun, join in and sing along type tunes. The weak spot on the album are a few of the later, slower tracks. Although it works quite well on Sun Arise and the first duet, I'm afraid Rolf's voice just can't carry too many slower songs in a row. I loved Stairway to Heaven and only wish that he would have done the whole song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting and Wonderful!","review":"Unforgettable characters who are SO likeable--Loved the author's sense of humor.

Be prepared for chuckles and heart-rending conviction--this book has both! A satisfying, wonderful read for those who yearn to know the Guide who will never allow them to be lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the Shadow of the Lone Cypress","review":"For many years my husband and I have traveled through the Moore Haven area where the author's main character makes his home. The way Settle describes this area is so vivid that you could almost smell the earth being brought to life. Undoubtedly, the descriptions during the 1926 hurricane were chilling. The reality of this book makes it a must read for anyone who deeply loves Florida."},{"rating":"2","title":"Present Company by Janis Ian","review":"Present Company by Janis Ian - Sixteen cuts on this CD from 1971. Prior to her hits of the mid 70's. Many young female singers should give early Janis Ian a listen and then study her 1993 and 1995 CDs. Starting out by her own admission as a \\"Snotty Teenager\\" Janis display here her talents of Writing and Performing. Her songs are well written and thoughtful, if not pertinent to her era. Now, go get and listen to her adult versions of her views and experiences. WOW! Breaking Silence and Revenge will impress you if you appreciate writing and performing talent of one of the foremost female singer songwriters of our time. Only a few write wonderful words and music, and then perform at this level. This music on Present Company is the beginnings of this Great Talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Integer Programming","review":"It's not good for the beginners who never have basic knowledge about linear, nonlinear, and integer programming. Too difficult to understand because it contains only theories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choose another book for twins","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I read this book while I was pregnant and expecting twins and found that instead of being a general guide for Moms expecting twins, it was one woman's narrative of her own experience being pregnant and having twins. She had a \\"near perfect\\" experience, full term twins and a natural childbirth. She does not even discuss prematurity at all! She doesn't discuss C-sections. She was never on bedrest, so she does not discuss that either. If she didn't experience it, it is not in the book. Sleep training? Not even mentioned once! My own experience carrying and giving birth to twins was so radically different than hers, that this book was 80% useless for me (and unfortunately I spent time reading the entire book!) I suggest Juggling Twins by Regan-Loomis as a more general and informative alternative. By the way - there aren't even any great tips in Twinspiration. Very disappointed and confused why it otherwise has good reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...not for moms who already have kids...","review":"I am experiencing my second pregnancy and this time it's twins. I was excited to buy this book thinking that it would calm my fears as other reviews said that this was the least nerve-racking as far as expecting multiples are concerned.This book DOES NOT address if you already have a child--which I do, a toddler. It is merely her experience as a mom of twins and she provides little \\"strategies\\" for handling the ins and outs of everyday experiences. I was hoping for suggestions juggling a toddler and twins...If you're a second (and third) time mom, this book is not for you. In fact, it will make you more anxious--comparing your size to normal pregnancy, stressing how you should rest and elevate your feet--you just can't if you have other kids...Plus the \\"medical\\" advice is mediocre at best...don't waste your money if this is your second pregnancy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good only for first-time moms who are plain vanilla and live in the burbs","review":"I would not recommend this book if you already have been pregnant and have a child - nothing enlightening here for you because the author can't compare a singleton pregnancy to a twin, since this is her first time around. I also would not recommend it if you enjoy any kind of non-mainstream lifestyle, if you live in an urban setting, if you have a very small abode, or if you regularly eat ethnic foods. You won't find helpful tips for any of these circumstances (how to travel on a subway, how to live without a car, etc). Also not useful if you plan to use a midwife. It's just really hard to see yourself in her advice if you do not lead a lifestyle very similar to hers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a laugh","review":"This book was good for a laugh and that's about it. It helped some when it came to traveling with twins but other than that it was more funny then helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts off a little weak but gets better","review":"Revised review- 4 stars: It gets better after the first section! I was disappointed in the beginning of this book- I found it lacking in medical knowledge and patronizing. Much of the advice was very general and one-size fits all- with justifications like \\"why risk it?\\". For a good guide to your pregnancy, I would highly recommend \\"When You're Expecting Twins, Triplets, or Quads, Revised Edition: Proven Guidelines for a Healthy Multiple Pregnancy\\" which provides a lot of medically accurate information and is written in an engaging, mature style.I have revised my review because I did find the second half of the book quite helpful. The author is much better talking about the day to day work of raising, feeding, and coping with twins. I have enjoyed reading her advice and stories about her experience. I changed my rating from 2- 4 stars based on the second half of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"I did not like this book at all. I hated the authors style of wrting, her personal views & found it very diffcult to read. Don't waste your time. Instead, try \\"Twins!\\" By: Connie Agnew, Alan Klein & Jill Ganon - it was a GREAT book if you are having twins!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good if you have never been pregnant","review":"I guess this book has some pretty good info., but since this is my 2nd pregnancy (my 1st w/twins), it just wasn't what I was looking for. I was looking for a book explaining the differences between singleton vs. twin pregnancy, prenatal twin diet info., bedrest if needed, how to handle 2 babies and a toddler simultaneously, etc.. I felt like I was just reading \\"what to expect when you're expecting\\" over again w/some different names and stories. This book was recommended to me from someone who has only been preggers one time,(w/twins, obviously!), so it was great for her. But not for me! So you may love this book, but don't get it if you already have been pregnant!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for alternative moms","review":"If you are at all alternatively minded you can skip over this book. The author while good natured and knowledgeable about her own experience touts an experience of a mainstreamed medicalized birth in a world where twins are considered \\"high risk,\\" instead of just a special circumstance that needs attention. With the exception of nursing, almost everything the author does to prepare for her pregnancy and birth and in fact the birth itself would make a midwife or a mothering magazine editor cringe. On a humorous note, the author in her list of top \\"mommy marvels,\\" list Super Wal-mart as one of the saviors of the modern mom. If this bothers you, and you know who you are, this is a good example of what this book offers. It upset me so much and frightened me that I am considering throwing it in the woodstove. \\"Having Twins\\" by Elizabeth Noble has been a total joy, I would highly recommend this book instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book that gives practical and encouraging advice","review":"After reading several books pertaining to pregnancy of both single and multiple babies, this book was a breath of fresh air. The author offers practical advice to common concerns of multiple mothers-to-be and writes in an encouraging and thoughtful tone. The information in the books provides such insight as to how to navigate each trimester, what baby products are necessary in double, nursing techniques and tips, what to expect from labor, tips on creating a feeding/changing/sleeping schedule in the babies early months, etc... A MUST read for all expectant mothers and fathers of multiples."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful and enlightening, even for a mom of triplets","review":"I devoured Twinspiration when I was pregnant with my triplets, and then later won a signed copy on a book review blog. I re-read it at that time since my triplets were six months old and we had begun a whole new chapter in our lives. Both times, I was captivated by the nuggets of wisdom that I could immediately apply to my life, and treasured other suggestions that I have tucked away for when they become needed. This is a highly quoted book among my circle of multiple moms. Cheryl Lage is seen as not only a fantastic, humorous and quippy writer, but also as a revered expert on the subject of multiples.This is a must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even for $5.","review":"I got this for $5 brand new.

My first one is a 6 wt and this one is 8 wt. Both have good, medium action with most of the flex in the tip. I'm not a \\"whippy\\" rod person and these rods fit my needs exactly. I have some more expensive rods, but these are perfectly suitable for most fishing and they take down in 4 pieces that will fit many duffles or suitcases. If not, there are hard tubes that will fit airplane overhead bins. I recommend Temple Fork rods without hesitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing and fresh songwriter","review":"T Randolph Scott is a breath of fresh air in todays trendy and politicaly correct music scene.

I trully enjoyed this entire CD and look forward to whatever this artist has coming in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great after a little installation trouble","review":"I bought this so I could pair a Bluetooth headset with it for use with Skype. I use XP Pro on my laptop. During installation the MS driver got installed instead of the Linksys one on the CD (not sure how - I *think* it's a bug but maybe I did something wrong). Nothing worked correctly, but the symptoms and error message gave NO clue. Finally a call to Linksys tech support identified the problem (took the senior tech support guy 45 minutes to figure it out) and I got the right driver installed. Once the adapter was working correctly there were still a few problem getting the headset working right, but that wasn't Linksys problem. Headset documnentation is still 100% oriented toward operation with bluetooth enabled handsets, so it took a little work. Now I'm a relatively happy campler - sound is acceptable but not great, the effective distance is 15-20 feet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very flimsy antenna","review":"Bad News: Just a piece of warning, the antenna is extremely flimsy and is being held on with two very small 1mm plastics.

The Linksys USB Bluetooth adapter is unrealiable - Win XP SP2 user beware. So, if you are stuck behind bars and are running Win XP-SP2, this is just the toy to help you pass your days. So, if you Linksys support, think again. After another wasteful morning with Linksys Live Chat support (two separate blokes), they are clueless.

All said there was no solution except to go out and buy an additional remote with a\\"learning\\" function. Solving Olevia's problem by me spending more money didn't make much sense. The other problem is the menu/setup function is very poor and not easy to use. An 83 year old cannot do it.Solution- Took it back to Target and for a few dollars more bought a 26\\" Magnavox that works perfectly and is easy to navigate.

I've read a lot of postings made by Mr. Quarles in several forums and this man gave me the chills. Probably this man is very frustrated and now he has started to offend people very very much. The book is in one word worthless. That's probably the reason of the joker price now asked for this \\"book\\". It's nothing worth. Perhaps it won't even light my fireplace. My advice for people who want to start discus start buying books from good authors like Bernd Degen or Jack Wattley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vague Information At Best","review":"I consider this a very poor addition to my collection of Discus books.

Very cute shoe!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A genuine gem","review":"The more I use this book, the better I realize it is. The unique nature of Chinese, with its ideographic writing system, almost demands a separate etymology for the written word. That is precisely what this book provides.

Buy and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Often inaccurate, some far-fetched, Not good for beginners or young kids","review":"I took out 3 stars because: 1) Of more than 5000 characters in use, this genealogy only lays out perhaps 1000 pictographic explanations, most for traditional form of characters. The rest are simply and often incorrectly treated as pictophonetic characters (i.e., with one element indicating meaning and the other sound). 2) Many translations are close but inaccurate and some explanations are far-fetched. 3) Compared with other mnemonic tools, such as Hoenig's 2178 mnemonics or geniusChinese 5467 mnemonics, this one may be too technical for beginners or young learners.Two stars are given for its very good price (even free at its website) and excellent presentation of the genealogy.Although I only gave 2 stars, I still use it sometimes.

It's going back tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Warning!","review":"Indeed this new dictionary is quite a well put together piece, well arranged and aesthetically appealing. And these are its good qualities. Sadly, having set out to create a dictionary of Chinese word etymologies, this editor fell prey to the seductive charm of cute graphic stories, one or several existing for each character. Since these graphic stories only attempt to explain the graphical structure of a character, making no reference to the SPOKEN word each character represents, they are fundamentally wrong (linguistics 101 folks; Chinese isn't exempt from the universal laws of writing). And misleading for the beginning student, the editor references many legitimate sources of Chinese word etymology, yet himself STILL ignores their content in favor of the fluffy stuff. Ah, and what we have lost to popular appeal...you have been warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I the only one that hates this book???","review":"I read all of these reviews and thought I just had to have this book. I thought it was going to be an actual book, not a stupid character list. I would have returned it if I weren't so lazy. Where are the 'brief etymologies' and explanations of the character's history? This book sucks. And I only gave it 1 star because there isn't a no star option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good if you want to learn all the characters","review":"There are approximately 7000 chinese character, but this book only have 4000 character in it. I wanted to learn all the character, therefore this book is no good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful in some respects","review":"I bought this book when I began studying the Chinese language and after I had become acquainted with the author's excellent website. Unfortunately, this book is mostly useful for students learning the traditional character set. It does include the simplified versions of characters; however, the layout and organization are heavily biased towards the traditional way of writing the characters. For those students who are learning the simplified way of writing characters (the set used by mainland China), I recommend the Concise English-Chinese Chinese-English Dictionary by Oxford University Press that can be found elsewhere on amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential _learning_ tool","review":"This dictionary is of extreme help for me in learning Chinese. I always loved the etimological approach in language-learning, and this is even more true for Chinese.When encountering an unknown character, if you recognize any of the components (not only the radical), the search in this dictionary based on these components is easy and fun. I looked up one character, and found myself flipping through several pages for others. Great for getting used to characters: meaning+meaning, meaning+phonetic.Problem is that if you only know the simplified form and no pinyin or meaning, you'll have difficulty with this dictionary. The simplified forms are given, but you first need to find the traditional one... Sometimes the 'etimological' explanation may not be 100%correct (as other reviewers said).Altogether, still my most used dictionary when learning!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic learning tool ! Add it to your library.","review":"This is an excellent dictionary for learning Complex Chinese characters (fantizi). You can use it to look up a character and discover why you confuse this character with others. Because the character combinations are based on frequency and importance, you can learn a new character much more easily by learning all the useful words its used in. This is especially useful as traditional dictionaries only list words that START with the character and then may list unimportant or infrequently used words. THIS dictionary traces the character if its used ANYWHRERE in a word, and then only gives you useful combinations. INCREDIBLY useful. Anyone who has studied chinese knows there are a lot of good (and bad) books out there. Well, this is a good one and a \\"must buy\\" for your reference library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for learning Charaters","review":"A pretty well thought out book, especially if you are into the study of Chinese characters. Because it shows where the characters came from and why, it makes the characters easier to remember. If you are a beginner or advanced learner of Chinese characters, I would recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD VALUE!!!","review":"I like this dictionary. I also have the Oxford Pocket Chinese English dictionary and they are a good pair of books in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A useful basic reference tool","review":"I have been a longtime user of Harbaugh's on-line dictionary and was delighted to learn there is now a book version. For Chinese students like me who often confuse similar characters or need all the mnemonic devices we can get, the genealogical approach to grouping characters is very useful and welcome. You won't find obscure character combinations here, but the dictionary amply covers the basics. Chinese students up to the intermediate or advanced intermediate level will get a lot of use out of this dictionary. My only complaint is that the stroke-order index is not well organized. But everything else is done quite well, especially for students who focus on traditional rather than simplified characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for Beginners","review":"This is a thorough treatment of the Chinese lexicon but it's not for beginners.

But it's basically an existential play. Redford is a big fan of Samual Beckett, the ultimate existential playwright, so I've a feeling that had something to do with his taking on this film. Many viewers are going to be disappointed for the very things I kind of admired about this film: major stars choosing a dark, talky piece that doesn't end the way you expect a film starring Robert Redford to end. You can be sure studio executives were thinking, \\"Awww, can't we get Redford to appear in 'Pirates of the Carribean II,' instead?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like a zillion closeups....","review":"Rent this movie. Don't pay the 9 or 10 dollars it's going to cost you to get in (unless you're old like me which would mean 'only' a 6 or 7 dollar admission). It'll keep you interested for about the first 45 minutes. After that I become distracted by the endless closeups (full-face, profile, eyes only, mouth only, top of head, hands) and pained expressions which substituted for meaningful dialogue. Frankly, my mind began to wander..wondering why Redford didn't stay out of the sun in his youth, why Dafoe's skin is beginning to look like linoleum, why there was only that one shot of the dog, why Helen Mirren would sign on for such tripe. I'm giving it 2 stars for the actor playing the detective. He was good. His assistant had one line. I'm always curious about such shenanigans."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Clearing","review":"I saw this and thought it was so dull.

But the kidnapping plot and script writing lacks development.I never heard anything about this film beforehand. So I watched without expectations. It came up short in the entertainment value. The kidnapping storyline was drawn out to a full length movie. Ninety minutes was the cutoff budget line I guess.The film look and quality is consistent with trying to experiment with directorial techniques. That feel for a film and plot lacking was disappointing. The strong acting is not enough to recommend this movie as a must see. Their strong cast dramatic performance was wasted. Wannabe actors should see this film for facial and body language techniques. I don't know how much adlib was allowed during filming, but I'm guessing there was not much freedom.I would recommend to rent DVD only. Purchase this DVD if you are a budding actor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet, thoughtful, and beautifully done.....","review":"If you are tired of all the hype (make that Big, Loud, Boring, and Stupid movies) - and would like something different for a rainy Sunday afternoon - curl up to this tasty effort. The acting is absolutely first rate (Helen Mirren should get an Oscar nod for this role), the direction is almost flawless, and this supposedly \\"art house\\" picture plays like a seamless visual \\"tone poem\\" - highly recommended! Redford and Defoe are at the top of their game here. I sincerely hope pictures like this can continue to be made - artistic sanity in otherwise pretty bleak times for celluloid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted talent","review":"It was the great cast that gave me confidence that I would appreciate this film. No such luck. I was bored and unchallenged from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disappointing Lives","review":"There is a deep and profound sense of foreboding that permeates Pieter Jan Brugge's \\"The Clearing,\\" which reminds me, in tone if not in execution, of George Sluizer's \\"The Vanishing\\": another film about a kidnapping. But unlike The Vanishing, The Clearing is more interested in the kidnapee's (Robert Redford) family than in the kidnapping itself: particularly Helen Mirren's Eileen. And despite the presence of Redford and William Dafoe (as the kidnapper), it is Mirren's touching and sensitive performance that dominates and perfumes this film with her transcendent and refined acting.The central story involving the actual kidnapping and the psychological battle between Dafoe and Redford is weak due to spotty writing but when Mirren is on screen \\"The Clearing\\" becomes transparent, concise and intelligent."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"I was anxious to see The Clearning even though I had not heard of it being made. Now I know why I never heard about it. It was a great disappointment. It was not the thriller I was led to believe but instead a real sleeper. Don't waste your money in buying this DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Clearing","review":"A very confusing movie to watch. I had to watch the director's commentary after watching the movie to explain exactly what transpired. There are many obvious present moment and past moment movie scenes, but there is a twist that was not exciting, thrilling or even remotely entertaining. I did not watch this alone, the other two guys who watched this with me felt the same way. The script, concept and actors are wonderful. The direction and editing leaves the viewer confused and feeling like \\"We will never get that time back again\\". The DVD jacket describes this movie as an \\"Intelligent Thriller\\" by The LA Times. Maybe a little thrilling but absolutely not intelligent."},{"rating":"1","title":"So many for sale - wonder why","review":"This was a disappointment, a real bore. Overall a surprise considering the talent involved. I waited for a twist, something exciting & entertaining, and you won't find it here unfortunately. Best of 2004? Not a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"TALKY, PRETENTIOUS AND BORING","review":"The poster showed a man's bound hands. We could see only part of a face, but it was clearly Robert Redford's. Audiences assumed THE CLEARING (Fox) was a suspenseful thriller about how Redford's character was going to get away and perhaps punish his kidnapper, a slightly unhinged but determined Willem Dafoe.Nothing could be further from the truth.This finely acted but dreary, affected, character driven melodrama gives it's ending away in the first act and all the rest is talk, talk, talk. And if that's not bad enough, the staggeringly pretentious commentaries from writer Justin Haythe and director Peter Brugge layers the sophomoric rhetoric into realms of suffocating self-aggrandizement rarely heard in a lifetime of ordinary conversation.Remember, time wasted on bad movies is gone forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely awful!!","review":"This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Robert Redford, Willen Dafoe and Helen Mirren walked through their parts. This movie is so boring that you are actually happy when its over and you get to leave. It's not even worth a rental price and I am sure that it will break the land speed record heading towards video. If its in the theatres another week I'll be surprised. Willen Dafoe kidnaps Robert Redford and takes him up a mountain to kill him. There is no reason given for the kipnapping and you have no empathy for Redford because his character is never really brought to life. As for his wife, played by Helen Mirren, she doesn't even shed a tear when her husband doesn't come home. She goes on with her life and hardly gives the FBI agents the time of day. PLEASE don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid The Cleaering at all costs!","review":"The Clearing goes no where! Don't be fooled that this movie will be another Spy Game. [Great flick]. The Clearing poses a number of hypotheses and numerous clues, none of which lead anywhere or even to each other. When the movie closes you say to yourself, \\"Darn, two hours wasted, stolen from my life.\\" Avoid even for free. I warned ya."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and predictable","review":"Watch the first ten minutes of the movie and you will likely see nothing surprising after that. No plot twists, very anti-climactic . Also annoying are several obvious errors that just might have made the plot interesting but didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE CLEARING is Disappointing","review":"Upon finishing this film, I could hear Peggy Lee singing, \\"Is That All There Is?\\" 95 minutes of a kidnapping (Redford's) and the resulting FBI and family drama associated with it (kind of standard TV stuff)and an ending that, while somewhat surprising, left me cold because I simply didn't care about these people. I'll give you the fact that Willem Dafoe plays creepy guys better than just about anybody, but even he didn't inspire much terror or pity in this one. Helen Mirren (always interesting to watch) and Robert Redford go through the paces as the rich married couple at the heart of the story, but the whole thing just seemed a big waste of time. Several reviewers have gone out of their way to try to put a good spin on this film, talking about the emotional revelations and layers revealed as the plot moves forward, but I still didn't come away with anything except regret that I wasted 95 minutes and a few bucks at the rental store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"The Clearing is so boring that it makes Redford's other masterpiece, A River Runs Through it, which is a 2 hour course on fly-fishing look exciting by comparison. After waiting and waiting for something to happen, the ending is a relief and brought cheers from the audience. We got up and lamented we'd wasted what seemed like at least 3 and 1/2 hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not One of Redford's Best","review":"It seemed like it would be a good movie. Redford, as always, was great, and the supporting cast were very good too, though I think Willem Dafoe was a villain without a character. And that is the real problem, the script. All they did was march Redford through the woods while the families had soft and painful moments in their luxurious McMansion. There were, basically, only three characters, with a few family members added at the end. The end left plot details unclear to me. It was billed as a struggle between good and evil, fate and luck. I thought it would never end."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Depressing Movie","review":"I am a big fan of Robert Redford but this is the worse movie that I have seen him make. The plot of the movie was quite confusing and never really gave answers to several questions. Such as why was he kidnapped? The ending was also disappointing. I'd like to see him make another movie with a happy ending. I came out of the theatre depressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This has to be one of the dullest and least interesting movies","review":"This has to be one of the dullest and least interesting movies I've ever watched.

Arnold knows everything about Wayne. Wayne's wife, played by the always great Helen Mirren (Teaching Mrs. Tingle, Gosford Park) gets a ransom demand from Dafoe plus secrets about Redford himself. Dafoe and Redford go threw the wooods headed towards a cabin as they talk to each other telling about each others lives. Finely orchestrated movie with pitch perfect performances...it's a really good chance to see two good actors face off with each other plus a great actress showing her skills all intwined into one piece. Alessandro Nivola (Laurel Canyon, Face/Off), Melissa Sagemiller (Soul Survivors, Love Object) and Matt Craven (Assualt On Precinct 13 '05, Crimson Tide) also star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thayer Guide to Birds of North America v.3.9","review":"I was able to try the software at a friend's house a few years ago and enjoyed the Petey the Parrot feature that pronounced Latin nomenclature. User friendly. There are good searching and cross-referencing features. The library of species is more extensive than any book I've seen. I like that there is geographic distribution data, population information and song files. It is so much easier to listen to a song file than read \\"two wee\\" in a field guide and get the same effect of information. This software helps with research presentations. The quizzes are great too. I like that the photos available for each species carry mulitple view whenever possible. I think in the absence of photos, drawings could have been included to cover the gap, especially since females are usually the gap and comprise 50% of the species population, so this is important information. So far that is the only short-coming I have noticed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is WebSphere performance in this book?","review":"I found this book promising but extremely disappointing.

I read it in less than a week, I am not a reader, I've been trying to read Aldous Huxley's A Brave New World for a year and half and am only on chapter 8. So you can tell this must be good, easy reading book. I had one problem. Mark Etkind's insight was offensinve to me. It seemed like he was trying too hard, and that he was a student of the idea, and never actually felt those feelings.

Those wounds are unconscious, but, according to the author, we all had them. Many of the exercises (e.g., listening exercises) would be helpful, but they are basic, and many of them are not really based on the theory. The author says repeatedly that we were \\"whole\\" humans in the womb, but we were damaged as children, and we need a healthy marriage to make us whole again. Some of the examples in the book reveal a patriarchal mindset. For example, in the section about \\"rewriting scripts\\" for arguments that a couple has repeatedly, the author suggests two alternatives that give the man what he wants, but no options for giving the woman what she wants. But if I object to that, I suppose that it must be because I was wounded as a child!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting the Love You Want: A Guide for Couples","review":"I purchased the first edition back in the late \`80's I believe. At that time I personally found the information innovative. The fact that Dr. Hendrix and his wife, who has been honored for her work in helping women, have personally proven that the contents of the book work. Plus, they are now teaching what they have learned together, to qualified therapists. I purchased \\"Getting the Love You Want\\" as a gift this time. As always, it's up to the individual/ couple to take what they've learned and use it in a positive way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Answers every question about marrige possible.","review":"O.k, so as a 14 year old, I'm not exacly gonna be thinking about marridge just yet, and neither do i have a girlfriend,but i did buy this book anyway just to see what it was like.And it was well worth money.It gives you tips, hints, pointers, and most importantly the advice you need to maintain a stable relasionship.Hendrix speaks of past cases gone wrong, and how he help couples through there difficult times.Overall this is a very good book which i would strongly reccomend to you.4 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An explanation of why marriage works","review":"I found this book while trying desparately to understand why my second marriage was failing. It showed why we are attracted to our partners and what to do to progress the relationship. My marriage was saved and is now completely fulfilling and successful. Every year I give this book to two or three friends whose marriages are not what they ought to be. That is the highest recommendation of all."},{"rating":"1","title":"the drop down would not let me put zero stars","review":"Recommended by a counselor. Book stunk, so did counselor. Typical tome of the gender, an advertisement for his institute complete with case histories and mumbo jumbo. Lots of insight into imago and not a clue as to what love is and isn't.Typical of the book. Exercise 8 He has the participant to draw a rectangle in which the four corners represent catastrophic exits, ie suicide, divorce, murder and insanity.He says \\" ...if you are comtemplating leaving the relationship through any of these four corner exits... I urge you to make a decision now to close them for the period of time that you are working together on these exercises.\\"Gee Mr. Ph.D I didn't know so many people had the option of selecting a time to go insane! Not to mention that the statement gives tacit approval of suicide or murder as an option after the exercise is complete.The book is full of such babble. Not worth the paper its printed on."},{"rating":"1","title":"hated it","review":"i felt it was very demening i read the first few chapters and got very upset i would not recomend it at all"},{"rating":"1","title":"God is Love.","review":"This self help book ignores the truth of love and makes love out to be something that people are capable of doing. No one can love and satisfy anyone without knowing that love comes from God. I suggest you read the Bible and skip this mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book.","review":"a great learning tool. I read it cover to cover and I think it will help me now and in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"great service!","review":"Came very fast, just as ordered, I would order from here again. Awesome, Awesome book!! I can't say enough. Answers every question you ever had about a relationship. Even though Harvey is a minister, he is also a PHd, and his book is more psychological than religious in any way. I would highly reccomend this book to all couples, and to anyone who is interested in making a relationship work.Great! Thanks very much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great couples guide and reference book","review":"I offer retreats in Sedona, Arizona and am also author of Love's Secret, also a relationship guide for couples.

It offers easy to follow tools and advice for couples to get the love they want and deserve."},{"rating":"2","title":"A non-married person's insight into this marriage manual","review":"I read this book in the hope of saving a marriage that later failed because my spouse was unwilling to join my quest for knowledge. However, I continued to read the book, constantly enlivened and amazed at the insight I gained into all my relationships with everyone in my life and past. I recommend this joyful treatise on living and loving for everyone who wants to obtain their full spiritual and emotional potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece of a Reference Book for Singles and Couples","review":"There is so much truth in this book. I felt as if I was reading about myself. In our search for a mate, we unconsciously seek the positive and negative traits of our caretakers. How scary is that? Although I emerged from a healthy childhood where most of my needs were met by my parents and siblings, I still chose the wrong mate at the age of 35. After reading this book, I now know what my own needs are and the type of person who can meet those needs--as long as we are willing to work hard at making the relationship work for both of us. If I ever contemplate marriage in the future, I will again read Dr. Hendrix' book from cover to cover and ask my mate to do the same. This is the first book of its kind to address a complex subject at a level that we all can understand and learn from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absorbing","review":"I'm reading this and find it the best book I've read so far on relationships and how to make them work better. The author discusses the unconscious and the conscious and concludes that it's necessary to understand and work on both to develop and improve a relationship. He talks about why we unconsciously pick the partners we do, about unfulfilled childhood needs that we may be unconsciously (and unrealistically?) expecting our partner to meet. He then offers some very practical and doable exercises for consciously changing the partnership or marriage. This book gives me a lot of reality based optimism for improving a relationship and making things work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Reading for All Couples!","review":"My therapist recommended this book to me and I must say I learned more about myself and my spouse in a couple of weeks then I have learned in 11 years of marriage. The book is very easy reading and really makes one think about how we think, how we respond to people and provides steps to make changes in relationships. The book also explains how our childhood plays an important part in who we are and how we deal in relationships. I'm not yet finished with the book, but I've already told my wife to please read the book. I believe that if we follow what is written in the book, our marriage can be saved and that we can be happy once again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting The Love You Want","review":"This was an interesting book that focused on the theory and practice of two people involved in a relationship learning how to be become passionate friends.The book is divided into three parts. Part one focuses on attraction, romantic love and the power struggle. Part two focuses on a marriage that is satisfying and part three focuses on teaching you how to deal with the obstacles presented in part one and two.Part three presents a series of step-by-step exercises that you can complete in the privacy of your own home. These exercises claim to not only help you gain insight into the problems but also to help you resolve them.Does it work? Well, that is a question you will have to find out for yourself.This is an interesting book overall and you will definitely gain insight into your partner if you follow through with the exercises presented in this book. You may even surprise yourself and gain some insight into yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic and repetitive","review":"Mr. Hendrix makes a few interesting points and gives a fresh spin on why we marry but he relies totally and incorrectly on one theory instead of the range of reasons that make marriage complex and wonderful just like life. Also, Mr. hendrix needs to write a book about the death of his parents so we , the reader, aren't forced to hear whinings of a totally different topic. This book may help people but only a very small number in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting the love you want-AUDIO CASSETTE","review":"This audio cassette was a complete waste of money!!! I could have read the front and back cover of the book and got the same information as this tape. I purchased it along with the workbook hoping that we could use the two together. That won't happen. In order to use the workbook effectively I have to buy the book and read it. The purpose of purchasing the audio tape was so we could (as a couple) listen to what Mr Harville Hendrix had to say..ya know spend some time together and still enhance our relationship. Well unless I spend more money and time to purchase the book then read it(with kids...HAHA)I will never know how good Mr Hendrix is. Complete waste of money...so disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couple Guide","review":"This book is a good read for men and women alikeI didn't want to read it but once I started I had to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"NingXia Red Wolfberry Juice by Young Living Essential Oil","review":"The product is very good product and it helps to boost my energy.

The pictures are striking, done in many of the warm desert colors. It is an enjoyable read that very easily creates imaginative pictures for both the reader and the listener, enhancing the rich illustrations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Voices of the Loon","review":"As someone who spends summers in British Columbia and who has fallen in love with the loons on the lake there, this is a precious cd. There is no addition of music, thankfully, so loons are foregrounded; this is pure loon call. The most helpful part of this cd is the narration, which instructs the listener in what various calls mean. Now when we know when they are feeling threatened, when they're mating, and the nuances of their communication. And it is hauntingly lovely to hear their calls again; this recording will tide us over through the winter until we can return to the north and its loons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, I could do without the commentary","review":"Thought this CD was ALL Loon sounds, but the first 20 minutes is Loon sounds with commentary. I was looking for a meditation CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding value","review":"I am a student of spanish and have been looking for songs the are clear and beautifully rendered. I have a Venezuelan friend who recommended Soledad Bravo, who has one of the most beautiful voices I have heard. This 2 CD set is a great value and contains a variety of songs: folkloric, ballads, love songs, dance music.I highly recommend set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lo Mejor/ Best of Soledad Bravo","review":"Soledad Bravo is one of the highest exponents of true Venezuelan and Latinamerican music at large. Her powerful and beautiful voice plus the lirics of all the songs she interprets transports the listener to a world of justice ( earlier in her career),melancholy ( when she sings the Polo Margariteno), longing (in Pajarillo Verde)and joy ( when she interprets Magnificent cuban melodies). She is the \\"Song Queen\\", passionate and authentic.Oh, and her musicians are top notch! I love how I can listen to all the great instruments being played -I must admit that the cuatro and drums are my favorites!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality!!","review":"I was excited about my new dual purpose baking pan. It makes great banana bread and I just used the other half for a meatloaf this week. The pan was in the sink overnight, not soaking, just residing. I was in the process of hand washing it just now and all the non stick starts to peel off the lowfat piece. I was so sick I immediately booted up the computer to come on here and prevent another from investing in this particular product. Save your money and try to find same concept by different manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Dieter","review":"I was so excited when I first tried my new 2 piece loaf pan and found it to make moist less fatty meatloaf. After using it 3 to 4 times and promptly washing/drying it each time; I put it away for a month or so. It rusted slightly in the corners of the pan and then when I used it anyway, the coating bubbled and peeled off while I was cooking at 325 degrees. What a disappointment for a great idea to be ruined by a poor coating! I suggest you seek this pan from a different manufacturer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Peeling Coating","review":"I had the same problem with this pan as others, the coating started peeling after only a couple of uses. I threw the thing out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peeling Teflon","review":"I loved the pan. Great concept. Used it three times and the teflon started to peel off in sheets. I'm afraid to use it now.

I have used this set about 4 times. After the last time I used it, it showed rust. Now I want to throw it out and replace it. I may use a glass pan with a rust-proof metal grating on the bottom. I might buy a George Forman hamburger maker that drains fat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as bad as all the reviewers' venom would have you believe","review":"This book intends to be funny and sarcastic, which it is. True, as another reviewer mentioned, it offers little by way of suggestions as to how to combat empty language (for that, see The Evasion English Dictionary by Maggie Balistreri), but the author's purpose is met and she does a fine job. The tone is an amped-up NPR commentary, maybe an underground radio rant. Perhaps some of the negative reviews here have to do with the subtitle's curse word. People, if you're scandalized by cussin', judge this book by its cover and leave it be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad....","review":"In these times of great technological advances, the masses have the ability to knock Kings & Queens from their socialist ivory towers. Sometimes the stones deserve to be thrown, as in the case of Ward Churchill. Ms. Penny does not.Ideologues of both stripes pop up far too often on Amazon from Free Republic & Democratic Underground, tossing meaningless 1 star reviews. Anyone that's not in a persistent vegetative state can figure out for himself or herself if something is biased. This book is & that's OK.I actually read the book & yes, some of the information is found elsewhere & the statistics & studies mentioned (shockingly) back up her points. The book is a well-written & funny opinion piece, in the tradition of Fran Liebowitz, not Michael Moore or Naomi Klein. It's old-school. No solutions are put forward, no one is asked to march on the evil corporations & there's no recipe for papier-mché effigies inside. I look forward to her next rant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it would be","review":"I picked up this book with great anticipation, but was slightly let down by its reiteration of ready-known facts. Like most authors from the left, Penny takes aim at the usual suspects, namely big business and - of course - the Bush administration. Though the book is very well written and thick with wit and sarcasm (sometimes TOO much sarcasm), it preaches to the choir much like other books of its nature (in fairness, Penny concedes as much). What I found especially eye-rolling is that in her attempt to expose the right for its exaggerated and deceptive (re: bulls**t) wordsmithing, she anchors her arguments by cherry picking facts and examples that are equally exaggerated. Overall, an enjoyable read, but if you've read these kinds of books before, don't expect to learn a great deal you didn't already know."},{"rating":"1","title":"I know Lewis Black and your no Lewis Black","review":"As an obvious fan of Tomas Pain, the author is no Tomas Pain either. She rants on a scholarly level then recedes back to teenage speak: like, you know, totally. This is a book with a thinly veiled premise of Dr. Harry Frankfurt \\"ON BS\\" but it turns out to be a political rant on the United States by a Canadian. It is painfully evident that the author has no business or political training other than from The Daily Show.She does, however, briefly mention that the Canadian government does some BS things but it is apparently more fun to drone on about the US. She would have benefited from a facts checker. Maybe this book was supposed to be in the spirit of Lewis Black but it fails from the start. It was neither funny nor very entertaining and riddled with half truths and far reaching facts. She comes across as just being bitc**y. But then this was a book about Bull****. What you see is what you get, BS."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Is Not Important to Us","review":"Repetitious and boring. Laura Penny could have written it in one paragraph. She is an example of the subject she wrote about.There's not one new thing in this book.

Ill-informed, whining, poorly-written, poorly edited (if at all), politically biased. I'd call it sophomoric, but that would insult sophomores.

The whole album is great not just one or two songs!!

I think that comes through in their music. Love it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD....","review":"Tree 63 has a great modern rock feel to their CD and it is a great CD. My only compliant is that, although I love the songs, many of the songs are getting redundant, as they are on everyone's CD. And it is great that they picked good songs but it is just not as powerful when you hear it on everyone else's CD too. That is my only reason I am giving it four stars rather than five. It is however a great CD and a must have for any fan of worship rock I pray they either get some new songs or write their own songs and get a new CD out because I think they have great voices and their music is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best ever","review":"i love tree 63 and think that this cd is a mixture of all their previous stuff and together it makes it the best tree63 cd"},{"rating":"2","title":"cat grass","review":"This is great. My two, older adopted cats, are strictly indoors. I start a quarter cup of seeds every 3 months or so, and they love the fresh greens. If I get behind on schedule, they try to eat houseplants, which is dangerous. It starts easier than the package suggests. You do not have to go the dark, covered route. Just keep it misted. When the seeds sprout, they take off on their own. I put a rubber band over the pot, so the grass can grow great and the cats can't get too excited and steal the entire plant. If you don't secure the planting, the cats will take it out of the container."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good album","review":"The four stars are because this album, although it is very good, it is not a masterpiece. Church of the machine, through the looking glass, the relic and lady of the snow are really masterpieces, but orion the hunter really is a let-down. it is still a good song, but not a Symphony X good song. Despite that, the album is great. Michael Romeo's guitars are excellent (specially the relic), Mike Pinniella's keyboards are awesome and Russell Allen's voice is just great. Thomas walling's drums are not as good as Jason Rullo's, but still good. Thomas Miller's bass I haven't heard very much, because I'm not into bass guitars, but the other Symphony X albums have great bass. Get it if you can!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not their best.","review":"Title says it all. I like the album overall, but clearly the band was just coming into their prime.

Its your loss if you dont check them out."},{"rating":"1","title":"dream theater wannabe's","review":"Dream theater is a hard act to follow and Syphony X is doing their best.Musianship is more than great,but feeling is not coming to them as naturally as it does to DT.We all loved Malmsteen when he burst onto the scene with FBTS,but not much has changed since then,other than vocalists.Symphony X is heading in the same direction if they don,t broaden into more atmospheric horizons.Listen to some Pink Floyd guys for christ,s sake."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Soul 2 Keep","review":"The resurgence of this music is sheer delight. Thanks to David Byrne for bringing attention to folks like me who were ignorant of this awesome music. I've been playing it ever since it first came out.Susana Baca's *Maria Lando* starts it off beautifully, but my favorites are Eva Ayllon's *Azucar de Cana* and Cecilia Barraza's *Canterurias*.

Many husband complains that most teas are like water, with way too little flavor, but he says chai lives up to his standards due to its full flavor and is the only type of tea he likes. I have tried many, many chai tea blends, and this is the best one I've tried so far. Many chai's are too spicy or have an overwhelming anise flavor. This chai is the right balance of spicy and sweet; it has delightful, subtle chocolate and caramel flavors.

Unfortunately, I found that this booklet makes things extremely complicated. Although it is precise and correct, it starts with the first 6 chapters only dealing with the different tones. The examples that are given are probably useful when learning tones, but desastrous when you want to build some kind of vocabulary or practise making sentences. You have to be quite persistent to make it to chapter 7 ('Greetings' - e.g. good morning, good afternoon), let alone chapter 20 ('Numerals' - e.g. one, two, three, four, five).I've learned many languages in my life (6 European languages, Chinese, Japanese, Swahili, Tibetan etc.), and although in most of them I never gained any fluency, I know from experience that this is not a good way to learn a language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Handy to Have","review":"This is a wonderful little book for all my knitting information, pattern ideas, websites for yarns, notes...and the yarn estimate charts in the back will provide excellent informatain when trying to figure out how much yarn I need for a sweater or socks for my family!

My daughter loves it. Parents should be aware, however, that this title requires more advanced mouse skills that other software for this age group: two activities require the user to \\"click and drag\\".

My four year old got frustrated after 5 minutes and gave up. She found the instructions to be too difficult to understand because they were very detailed and spoken too quickly. The premise is that you're supposed to gather items for a surprise party. You need to obtain a specific amount of each item and it goes into an empty room once you gather enough for the party. You need to go to different areas to make cookies, wrapping paper etc. I don't know how a four year old could do this without adult supervision.

Hopefully then she'll enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired and dull with clunky interface","review":"There is one part of this game where the main character enters a room that is entirely empty except for a carpet, a few drapes, and blank walls. It's like someone forgot to work on the scene. There are other parts where the animated characters do the same things over and over and over, and the tasks are extremely repetitive. Other scenes are equally dense or unimaginative. The artwork is awkward and ugly. The interface is non-intuitive, as is the flow of the story. There's also this Blob thing that lays on the ground to help you with navigation, and he's a depressing little thing.So, this title is not recommended. Try Freddi Fish or Puttputt or SpyFox.

No thanks, I just ended up skipping all the way through the CD, as I couldnt find any track I like at all...phew, only got headaches from it.

First of all, even though it is somewhat thrown together, it is full of some great rock & roll, not to mention those incredible vocals. Secondly, \\"Heartless\\", \\"Devil Delight\\", \\"Magazine\\" and the remakes of \\"Without You\\" and \\"I've Got The Music In Me\\" are worthy parts of the Heart canon. Finally, it's very inexpensive!I do think that if you're not a real Heart fan or a fan of rock music from this era (late '70's), this is not a must-have. Still, you'll certainly get your money's worth with this purchase if you ARE one of those fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Heart CD: \\"Little Magazine\\"","review":"For my own enjoyment, and to satisfy my own curiosity, I burned a CD combining the best elements of Heart's LITTLE QUEEN and MAGAZINE albums, which, as everyone knows, were intended to be released as one record in 1977. By doing this, I believe I've created one of the great lost albums of the 1970s. This is it:\\"LITTLE MAGAZINE\\"Side One:1. Barracuda2. Love Alive3. Sylvan Song4. Dream of the Archer5. Here Song6. Kick It OutSide Two:1. Heartless2. Little Queen3. Treat Me Well4. MagazineIn my opinion, these are the best tracks from both albums, and this sequence (retaining most of the original of LITTLE QUEEN's side one) works well, keeping a balance between the rockers and the ballads. The two \\"sides\\" even balance: 2 is only nine seconds longer than 1. Make yourself a copy and take a listen. If you're a Heart fan, you may be amazed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly Filler","review":"There is one fine song on this collection, \\"Heartless\\", and it can be found on best of collections that are a much better choice for all but the most devoted fans. Aside from that, only a couple of songs are worth hearing. The title track, \\"Magazine\\", is adequate, and their cover of Badfinger's \\"Without You\\" (Nilsson made it a hit) sounds like a demo but holds some appeal. The rest is completely disposable. This package was thrown together by the record company from various scraps following a dispute with the band.

However, I would disagree with this since the songs on Magazine are almost top-notch. Granted there are some songs like \\"I've Got the Music in Me\\" that are absolutely horrible because the sound quality is bad, and the atmosphere around the song is just terrible. But songs like \\"Just the Wine\\", \\"Here Song\\", and \\"Heartless\\" all show off the group's flexibility to play all types of music. The synthesizers on \\"Heartless\\" are excellent and it's almost like somebody was having an acid trip while playing them because they are that far out. \\"Here Song\\" and \\"Just the Wine\\" showcase the guitar talents of both Roger Fisher and Nancy Wilson very well. Most of the songs on Magazine are an extension of the creative energy that was used to write the songs on Little Queen.

The only minor flaws were meredith- only because they never resolved anything, and lindsey was kind of useless. But I hear they are both leaving or have left. The other casting is so ON TARGET I feel. You really believe these characters are real unlike other shows. It makes it so much more intense and suspenseful. For the person who is in love with Jane espenson, shes not that great, in fact some of her buffy episodes while they were entertaining, they were extremely stupid and usually didnt go along with the progression of the storyline- eg. band candy, bad eggs, and the worst one of all- superstar.

It takes place on a dying Earth, millenia hence. A mighty hero with an origin and a destiny clouded in mystery strides the world. He teams up with a timeless wizard, an eager lad, a warrior-cat, and, well, it hardly matters. Somehow, the toings and froings, saving this city and vanquishing that horde, never engage me. Plot? Well, since most events could be taken in any order, I'd call it a series of isolated episodes rather than a developing sequence of events. And all that mystery around Silvermane just has no effect on anything that takes place.I guess Carter needed the money.

The idea was good -- get a peek inside this particular lifestyle (and for some people, it really is a lifestyle or way of life) and O's head at the same time -- but the writing was only so-so. It read like a high school boy's fantasy. The material itself was not the least bit shocking to me and I was not offended by any of it. But I've read fanfiction that was written better.

This book is more a psychological study of a disturbed woman, and a bunch of extremely domineering males than any sort of erotic tale. I was far too busy wondering when she was going to grab the riding crop and beat Rene and Sir Stephen until they cried for her mercy to get any sort of enjoyable sexual charge out of this story. I also found the writing style to be extremely redundant, and the \\"plot\\" to be no more than a series of the same beatings and sexual mistreatments in different settings. And the issues above are nothing compared to the fact that they cut off the ending. You don't get to find out what happens to O, much less poor little Natalie, an impressionable fifteen-year-old who is sucked into this world by Sir Stephen. The summary of the missing conclusion is one sentence long. I think that speaks to the importance the book places on any sort of plotline. As I said, a great disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh look, she's getting gang raped - *again*","review":"My fantasies tend to be of the very perverse and violent nature, so I was looking forward to reading L'Histoire d'O. I had a long plane ride, and was hoping it would help me while away the house.Alas, O proved to be boring in the extreme. My thoughts were pretty much \\"Oh look, she's getting beaten again\\" and \\"Oh look, she's getting gang raped again\\" and \\"Oh look, she's being sodomized again.\\" How boring. How dull. There was no tension at all in the book, because there was no conflict. O just accepts everything that happens to her. In order for a story to be interesting, there must be some sort of conflict that needs to be resolved. There is none in this novel.It seems to me that the author tried to get by on the shock value alone, which is not enough in and of itself to make a book worth reading. Plot helps, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time had sullened this great book!","review":"The story of O could easily had earned a 4 or 5 stars rating when it first came out decades ago. It was one of the very first books of its kind, and it had a huge shock value as well as creative value back then. But during the intermediate years from its published date to our present time, the sexual revolution had already made a lot of changes to the SM landscape. Many new theories and techniques on SM literature had been developed since, which in turn had made the ideas and writings in 'the story of O' seem very primative and out of date. My bottom line is that it's not worth awhile to spent money or time on this book unless: 1) you are doing a research on the history of erotica/literature 2) you are an avid collector and want to collect all the erotica writings there is"},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"Ugh. This is so boring I haven't been able to finish it in over 8 months.I usually read it before I go to bed at night, not to get turned on, but to help me fall asleep. Seriously. My mother had a hidden copy of this book, and it was a BIG DEAL that I never go near it because of the ADULT story. This naturally only made me want to read it more. I should have known it was just a big snooze fest. Maybe it was shocking in the 70's but to read it now is just a let down. O is one of the weakest and most pathetic characters imaginable. I guess it gives you an idea of what a bdsm relationship might be like, day to day, but I could have done with out."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic","review":"Perhaps not the raunchiest story I've ever read, but when you keep in mind it is one of the first novels to bridge the gap between pornography and *legitimate* literature, The Story of O can't fail to impress. Not as vicious as de Sade, not as sappy as Anne Rice's Beauty series, it maintains a serious/fantasy balance for every writer who followed to envy. True, it asks to be re-written and updated here and there, its ending tweaked, but overall its dark sexuality and obedience/pleasure theme can move any reader who recognizes the novel's place in time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Control & Lust Vs. Equality & Love","review":"The images intrigued me. I could not understand her motivation, but I wanted too. Even though I found her a victim, I was attracted to her. I did not want to \\"rescue\\" her, but rather to make her mine. O, so willing to be controlled, the question, can love come from freedom no longer required an answer. I chose control & lust from my lack of character and laziness, but I still pine away for equality and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"One woman's fantasy","review":"In a nutshell, this book is really sexy if you share the author's fantasy, and really boring if you don't. It's endlessly repetitive, and there's no plot or real characterization; in fact, nothing happens in this book, other than the constant sex and abuse. If you're just looking for a competently-written story about a girl getting sexed up and treated poorly by a succession of masters, you'll love this book. Otherwise, your time would be better spent on erotica that does cater to your tastes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"B/D, S & M\\" classic ...........","review":"I found the Story of O to be disturbingly erotic. While I found most of the situations that \\"O\\" found herself helplessly engaged in ... arousing, I pitied her for her misdirected love and devotion. I believe the Story of O is one the the more truthful depictions of a \\"B/D, S&M\\" relationship, appealing to Doms and subs alike. If you prefer a softer version of this type of erotica, minus the brutality, delve into Miranda Reigns' world of self-discovery and submission through her newly released erotic novel, CyberWebs."},{"rating":"2","title":"yes it was a woman author","review":"I can't say 5 because I haven't read the whole thing yet. I first read a chapter in the New Yorker when I was young and it took 10 years to get back to it again. Its not something to read if you are looking for the romance novel type of sexuality. Its the kind of thing you'll probably feel guilty about reading, maybe. But its fascinating. ANd btw a woman did write it... it was Dominque Aury. Yes the name was fake but no it wasn't a man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zen of S&M","review":"It is a good book to meditate on. To notice ones thinking and how one might judge things. I found Story of O a great book for disciplining my etiquette and manners. I also liked how Pauline Reage wrote, she got the idea across in proper etiquette. The book had a unique romantic nature about it that many books lack. The ending is a bit odd although, but still a good book to introduce one into the subject of S&M. I suggest anyone who needs discipline of any sort read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Erotic Novel Ever!","review":"There is no way anyone can put this book down. Not a chance. You'll read it in a day and pass it on!

Yes, it's explicit but so was D.H. Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover. If you read Jean Paulhan's introduction, you know the author is a member of the prestigious Academie Francais. The translation by Sabine D'Estree is very dense and intense, but not very erotic. O freely submits--she never whores herself--to her lover Rene and then to his powerful half-brother Sir Stephen. (Kissinger said Power is the ultimate aphrodisiac). If the repeated violence turns you off, I recommend Reage's sequel, Return to the Chateau. It's beautifully written, highly erotic fantasy \\"of a Girl in Love.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"What about the ending?!","review":"I purchased the Story of O with great excitement and could not wait for it to come in and read it. It was everything I had heard and hoped it would be, HOWEVER, after you're reeled into the story and you want to know more the \\"FINAL CHAPTER HAS BEEN SUPPRESSED\\". I was not happy. I still have no idea what happened! Before purchasing I suggest you contact the seller and see if it has a suppressed ending or if you are purchasing the full book. Good Luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Titilating as People Think","review":"Sure, it has moments of fantasy hotness. But by the standards of what people I know are doing in their own bedrooms these days, much of O is really quite tame. It's the \\"thought of it\\" that titillates our naughty bits. The book touches on various concepts and extreme practices, like shaping-corsetry and branding, but in a glossed over manner.Read it so you can say you read it, and then go read one of my own books to read something far more engaging, detailed and realistic.PEEPER (Gethis: History of a Planet)The Healer (Gethis: History of a Planet)"},{"rating":"1","title":"not my favorite book","review":"I didn't like this book as well as I thought I was going to.

The violence, abuse and self-deprecation was too much for me to stomach. What offended me most was the use of the word Love throughout the chapter. This word was used(or should I say mis-used) by both the tortured and the torturer. Although the subject matter sickened me, the writing style and attention to detail was excellent (and scary).

Filled with horrific torture, and yet, what is done to the body pales in comparison to what an obsessive love can do to the mind in this groundbreaking epic of erotic fiction. \\"O\\" is not simply a physical masochist, seeking pleasure in the pain her body feels, she is a submissive and an emotional masochist ... her desire for pain deeply embedded into her psyche, much like the main character in Masoch's Venus in Furs.Love for \\"O\\" must be a torture all encompassing in its magnitude, and for that to be, one must surrender everything: mind, body, and soul.A brilliant work."},{"rating":"2","title":"sexual metaphor","review":"As far as the structure of the novel itself goes, The Story of O is amazingly engaging. I say engaging because as one reads, one becomes intrinsically involved in and empathetic to O's experiences and situations.However, one searching for eroticism should not read this book; despite the events in the story, this book is neither sexual nor erotic in nature. Much more prominent are the male vs. female , human vs. inhuman plots that occupy life. Additionally, the tone of the book and the characters lead me to suspect that this story was written by a man and not a woman, which serves to alter the reader's appreciation and understanding of the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"adult book","review":"This novel is very well written. It's a very unusual erotic s&m novel written by a woman in a time when this was pretty much unheard of. I was a little disappointed in the book because it was very short and glossed over everything instead of going into more details of the characters. I felt it did not delve into their motivations or backgrounds or really let you know them. There was no hero or heroine and no one that you cared about. What really upset me about this book though, is that one is cheated out of the ending! This book is missing the ending. There supposedly are two but they have been censored from this edition! I would not buy this book again and do not recommend it because of that. I feel as though I have been cheated and would not have bought it if I knew that I would not get the ending ahead of time.

It was written to tell a good story, nothing more. It is NOT any sort of \\"how to do SM\\" book. (For books on that subject, see the writings of Philip Miller, Dossie Easton, Jay Wiseman, John Warren, Lady Green or Joseph Bean.)As an erotic novel rich in texture and even a bit of whimsey, it's a wonderful book, even a classic.

I enjoyed taking the journey with O and discovering what was waiting for her around the corner. I especially enjoyed seeing into a world that is considered dark and foreboding.I know as a woman I should be offended and outraged over the way O was treated, but I wasn't because I found O as into the bondage, the sex and the debasing that was being done to her just as much the person doing the deeds.While O was put into the role of the \\"dominated\\" I didn't think for one second that she felt she was being dominated or submissive - especially when she decided to make her \\"Master\\" fall in love with her.I found O to be erotic and arousing. My mind was opened up into a whole new genre that and look forward to rereading the Story of O again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"change of views","review":"When I first bought \\"O\\" I was unsure about reading it. I was brought up to be a liberated woman and not to be submissive to anyone. But upon my first hesitant glance at it's contents I was hooked.

It opened my eyes to a wonderful new world and I will forever praise Pauline Reage for creating a world of desire that I envy."},{"rating":"2","title":"O - How Wonderful!\`","review":"The Story of O is an intensly erotic story of one woman's journey into the submissive lifestyle. Although it is, at times, a bit difficult for the average reader to understand, its extreme eroticism and excellent scene descriptions will take you into O's world of love, passion, misery, and ecstacy. It is a must for anyone in or thinking of getting in to the BDSM lifestyle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed story with violent themes; insider-only appeal","review":"I am fascinated by BDSM myself, and I still think this text is weak with limited appeal to a fringe audience. While it's true that the detail in description of the scenes was sharp, the description lacked a window into the heroine's mind, so that the scenes are only tintilating if acute descriptions of gratuitious violence are your thing. The storyline jumped disjointedly from one inexplicable turn of events to another, without any insight into what would make the characters behave in such a way. In short, it makes a frustrating read for those interested in power exchange but turned off by extreme abuse, and a mystifying read for those not already familiar with the sexual cliches of BDSM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kinky","review":"The \\"Story of O\\" is a kinky, erotically sadistic novel, and is a perfectly fun read if you can remeber that this is fantasy and not reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rule of Bondage","review":"An Important rule of Bondage is \\"If you break your toys, you aren't allowed to play with them any more.\\" In this book, O isn't treated as a toy so much as an annoyance to reduced, abused and disposed of. I do not reccomend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Provokative or Provincial?","review":"Maybe it's because she wrote the book so long ago, but I really got the impression that Reage was trying too hard with the shock effect in this novel. Any initial shock wears off shortly, because sexually explicit descriptions are so indiscriminately employed! Therefore, by the fifteenth page, The Story of O loses any potential eroticism it might have suggested at the beginning; actually, I found the story pretty banal by the end. It's still worth the read, though--if for no other reason to discover what all the hype is about, and for those first fifteen-or-so pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"If nothing else it makes you think","review":"So, ok, this person is willingly being treated like a SLAVE just so that she does not have to think for herself or live off of her own freedom. I hate this book, and everything that it stands for. However, it really does make me wonder why I have such a violent reaction, and what it is that is hitting me right where it hurts. If nothing else it really makes you think about the choices that you make in your own life, and the partners whom you wish to share that life with."},{"rating":"1","title":"cold and unfeeling","review":"I wanted to like this book, really I did. I had heard so many good things about it. Then I read it.The story lacks passion/lust/love/hate and it shows. I just wanted to shake O and say \\"FEEL something damnit!\\" Thank god most real D/s relationships arn't this cold or we all would be suffering from frost bite."},{"rating":"2","title":"sad, but real for many slaves","review":"i have read this book so many times, and it always makes me cry. why you ask? not just the ending, but the simple fact that this story can be very true for many slaves. this particular lifestyle, D/s, is very intense, i myself am a slave, and the thought of my Master abandoning me is something i would rather not think about.O gave up everything she had to him, for his happiness, attention and heart, then he just threw all that away, i really don't blame her for ending her life, not that i would, but the thought would cross my mind, if abandoned.i suggest this book to anyone with an interest in the lifestyle, but i don't suggest suicide. this is a great story!if you took a liking to it, read Justine, by Marquis de Sade."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Story of O","review":"I started reading \\"O\\" with the expectations that this book held many of the secrets of what makes a submissive/slave submit. It was interesting, but I found myself forcing myself to read further, hoping I might get to the \\"good part\\". I know that it was considered provocative at the time of its release, it is rather tame to anyone who has read amateur erotica published today. After reading it, I passed it on to a \\"friend\\" ... would I suggest anyone buy it. NO. But if you can borrow a copy or own a copy, share it freely."},{"rating":"1","title":"O is for \\"Ouch\\"","review":"Perhaps I'm coming at _Story of O_ from a completely different direction, since I was hardly compelled to feel anything toward the characters in the novel. The translation of Reage's novel is bumpy and broken, and often it is difficult to follow thought patterns and dialogue of the characters. If readers do manage to make sense of the prose, they will find a story of whips and chains, S/M, bondage, and so forth--actions still considered taboo in most social circles. Readers will find the central character, O, enigmatic, confounding, and ambivalent: Why would anyone submit themselves to such emotional and phyiscal pain? Love would be the most obvious answer, but surely Reage was thinking of something more postmodern ... Of course these are purely subjective thoughts of mine. One must remember, while reading this book, that one's dislike of pain is another's passion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing more than slightly senstionalist.....","review":"One of my friends told me this was a really gripping story of human emotions and what people can be driven to... I wish she had told me she was joking BEFORE I bought the book! This is, at the very most, basic sensationalism.This book does not even have an ending!!! It builds up towards a huge finale and then stops dead, apparently because the last chapter was banned years ago, c'mon give us a break!!!!!!!!Trust me, only teenagers will be left amazed at this particualr book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Tame By Today's Standards","review":"It is hard to believe in this day and age that O does what she does - giving herself so completely over to a lover. I am still not sure what her motivations were. The story is quite choppy and I can imagine that it was risqué when first published, but it is almost tame compared to what one can see online today."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I had not read it","review":"I wish I had not read it. Very, very cleverly and smoothly written to seduce you into thinking this sickness is erotic. Pages and pages of philosophical claptrap that seduces the reader to \\"buy into\\" a few pages of very arousing scenes. After you have read it there is a bad kickback due to the impersonal cruelty of the men, the self-humiliation of the women, and the the corruption of the child. I recently shredded my copy. I wish I had not read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting &#65533; but not a must read","review":"The story of O is really just that. A story of a lady named O who is in an S&M relationship - although you get the feeling that she wouldn't choose it. An eye opener to see how people who are into S&M live - but not a literary work of art though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely Naughty","review":"I've read some nicely naughty adult books before and heard this one was great. I'd call it an \\"intro\\" book. It's mostly about being emotionally and physically \\"owned\\" and about pain. Not much time spent on erotica outside of those items. I found other books to be much more erotic because they went into detail about touching, licking, tasting, penetrating, etc. I was underwhelmed by this book. Try the sleeping beauty trilogy by Anne Rice instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Story About Slavery","review":"I come to this book for love and sex. I was wrong. It has nothing to do with love or even sex. It is a story of violence and slavery. And how effective violence is, in the author's whimsical imagination, in enslaving women. Just like history of slavery and colony rule in 19th century and early this century has shown us, slave owners always justify themselves by that slaves enjoy being exploit by nature. That slaves enjoy to be whiped, used, exploited, and disposed at owner's will. That is why O was told to be always available, accessible, and obedient sexually to her owner Rene. She was finally given away and exploited to death. I wish I have the opportunity to exploit the author the way Rene exploit O, no matter the anonymous author is a male or female. That satisfys my feeling of revenge and probably the cruelty inside me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Story of O","review":"I just finished reading this book this weekend. It is highly erotic. You have to have a strong stomach to take some of the things done to her. Also remember it is just a story and no real woman would reduce themselves to a slave. There is a lot of hot heavy sex and pain. But it is a classic so I am giving it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected, at all...","review":"Being a mathematician, I immediately bought the Story of 0 when I first heard about it because I wanted to learn why Indian mathematicians invented the number. After I finished reading it, however, I realized it was not the story of 0 but O, a dimwitted woman who knows what (most) men want. Since I read it, though, I've not been able to concentrate on...what was I saying?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, a compulsive page turner","review":"Since my girlfriend and I are into the D/s lifestyle, she really identifies with the power of the heroine. The story is written tastefully yet vividly.A classic that needs be in most every well-rounded library"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"The Story of O wasn't what I was expecting. I thought it would be a love story describing the intense, kinky, sensual, relationship between a dom and his submissive parter. However, it wasn't - it was about a woman who was used, abused, and discarded. I was impressed and was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"STORY OF O..","review":"WRITTEN VERY \\"EUROPEAN\\", THE STORY LINE IS DECENT, THE S AND M IS MOSTLY WHIPPING, IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A HOT READ TRY BLUE THE COLOR OF DESIRE, WHICH IS A LITTLE MORE RAW. IF YOU WANT A MORE TAME READ THIS MIGHT BE FOR YOU. I PERSONALLY DONT FIND DESCRIPTIONS SUCH AS \\"FLANKS\\" AND \\"NETHER REGIONS\\" TOO STIMULATING."},{"rating":"1","title":"An aberration","review":"This story is horrible, disgusting, filthy, dehumanizing. An aberration, a perfect depiction of evil. It's good for what it shows about what evil is and what evil cand do to a human soul.I'm not one for censorship; let people think, write, read, do as they want when not in violation of the law or the rights of others, but also let people call things for what they are. And, as someone wrote on another review, if you have felt guilty for having wanted to subject another human being to any of these things, then you should feel guilty. Try to figure out where that comes from and address it. You are too precious to live like that. Don't let anything or anyone lead you to believe otherwise. \\"To deny the dignity of a human being is to deny the dignity of every human being.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh... Didnt like it","review":"Im all for S&M...; but this book was kinda wordy to me...Not to mention it was hard to get into.I'd rather read Anne Rice"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me.","review":"I loved all three Fifty shades. It was first of all a great story with characters that were compelling. This is not a story with understandable characters. Not because of the subject of the material, but the author doesn't give even minimal insights into the nature of the characters. There is only \\"they did this, and they did that\\" with no \\"why\\". If you want to read something after Fifty Shdaes, I would not bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really what I expected","review":"I don't quite know why this book was actually considered one of the best French books of the 1950s. Yes, it talks about sexual slavery and people taking seriously their fetishes, but to be honest, I found it quite beyond boring, and it was almost a torture to force myself to keep reading it. I am planning to rent the movie soon, maybe it ends up being better, but the book is slow, it's about two hundred pages of a story that could be told a lot better in just twenty!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Those who like this sort of thing will like this","review":"This book started promisingly with a description of how O's boyfriend removed her underwear during a taxi ride; this was good, sophisticated erotica. After this, there was an awful scene where O was whipped. There was more good stuff as O had to go about her normal daily life with no underwear or suspenders and to roll the tops of her stockings to stop them from from falling down. However, after this O was treated more and more cruelly and eventually mutilated with a red-hot branding iron. This required a strong stomach. Beware - only read this book if you can stand such writing. I doubt that this book was really written by a woman; it doesn't have the right feel."},{"rating":"1","title":"1950's","review":"Thats when this book was first written, so it tells you right there it is NOT graphic or very sexual. It is aboout a man who loves his girlfriend so much he makes her sleep with other men, her eyes always have to be down and she is not allowed to talk. THEY lock her up so anyone can have her. She is almost always kept naked, except in the day when she has to lift her skirt up so they can do what they do to her. It's like a S & M book that's very PLAIN not descriptive. If that helps at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"just NOT enough O!","review":"I could not put this book down. Despite its almost vulgar honesty, it is entirely enthralling. Not for the faint of heart...the story of O is a mysterious wander through a dark sexual community, fascinating at every turn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic? Yes. Definitive BDSM book? No.","review":"As SM books go, The Story of O is rather tame. But this book is so much more than just erotica. It's a story of complete submission, mental, physical, emotional. Is it a slam on women? I suppose. Could the protagonist have been male? Sure. But it wouldn't have been as effective. Face it, feminists denounce the book because a women becomes a slave to a man. What would the fems say if it had been the reverse? Probably nothing, because it would have been just another piece of porn (to them). That someone would give themselves so completely to another triggers something dark within us all. As fantasies go, it's a powerful one. As a lifestyle, it's an amazing study of the psyche."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must for every lover of the bizarre love","review":"A great story, highly exciting, full of erotic fantasies, for everyone loving extraordinary games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story of O is disturbing","review":"I recently read this book due to the reviews stating that it was a better read than the Fifty Shades of Grey series. I found this book quite disturbing about the BDSM lifestyle of \\"O\\" and the torture that she had to endure. I get the idea of the submissive lifestyle in some of these erotica books, but to go to the extreme as this book has done with the downgrading, piercing, slavery, branding and torture as depicted, insults any woman who has a strong self-esteem. In the book, \\"O\\" states she has willingly done these things out of \\"love\\" and that the characters who are her \\"owners\\" have inflicted these tortures because they \\"love\\" her. If that is what the anonymous author of this book thought love was, then I as a reader don't want any part of it. At least in the Fifty Shades series the character Christian Grey realizes when the beatings have gone too far with Anastasia and knows enough to curb his actions to win her back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book","review":"Book came very fast and in excellent condition. Would be enjoyed by anyone who likes erotic novels that are different and very expllicet BDSM books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, Very, disturbing","review":"I have just finished the book not more than 5 minutes ago, and I am in a state of shock. The way O gave up everything for her lover, even her individuality, was frightening. The men never gave anything but token displays of love, and she was satisfied in that. She is the image of what women should not be. This book will definately make you think about how much is too much to give up for love."},{"rating":"2","title":"On my top 10 list of L.

It's got an even better story and characters than most of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"8th Grade review","review":"This book was assigned to me to read for 8th grade and was the first Louis L'Amour book I read. I can't really say it's my favorite yet but I really liked it alot! It's about a small group of outlaws led by a man named Considine and as they escape from one of the biggest, most carefully planned bank robberies ever and how Considine meets up with an old friend along the way, named Dave Spanyer, who has a very pretty daughter that he would like to marry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to find an average Lamour Book.","review":"Somehow, this book is special. It has some great shoot-out scenes and the title becomes highly significant once you read along. It is a good western read and although I am fairly new at the genre and even Lamour (have read 9 LL books)this is definitely a dusty trail you will want to follow un into the canyon."},{"rating":"1","title":"I contest the will!","review":"If these are Cthulhu's heirs I contest the will. This was summarilly the worst expression of Lovecratf's weird fantast genre. The imbecilic overtones and dishwater plots reflect more the 1980's \\"Nightmare on Elm street\\" style of teenie slasher films far closer than any resemblance of the erudite and late Mr. Lovecraft.It is a sheer marvel that these works could be published under the aegis of the continuation of Lovecraft's deeply intricate world and mythology. The book is an insult, it demeans use even as liner for a parakeet cage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! What a great find!","review":"I had never heard of Janice Kay Johnson and discovered \\"Her Sister's Baby\\" because it was at the back of a book by LaVyrle Spencer. Wow! It blew me away! Although the outcome of the plot was predictable, the characters were well developed, the plot moved slowly enough to be believable but not so slowly that I was bored. The build up of sexual tension was exciting and the dialogue between the characters (especially Colleen and her children) was believable. I stayed up till 5 AM to finish the book because I couldn't bear to put it down! I would gladly read a sequel to this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"These glasses are the bargain of the century","review":"I'm a cyclist and need glasses that protect my eyes from wind, bugs, etc. Clear glasses enable me to ride in heavy shade.

Both book and workbook!","review":"I bought both the book and workbook for a Home Group study. Since I received the workbook first I started in it right away and found it improving my \\"time alone with God\\" immediately. The book and workbook chapters go along with each other, so are perfect for in-depth study. It turned out I didn't need the workbook for the Home Group, but I continud with both. The book lends itself equally well to personal study or group study and discussion. Since I have studied \\"spiritual disciplines\\" before, I wasn't sure how this would add to what I already knew to do (but haven't always accomplished). But Swindoll has such a natural approach, non-guilt-producing, that in a few short weeks I feel closer to God, to Christ, than I have in a long time. And isn't that what all Christians want? To KNOW Him, and to become more and more like Him every day? I pray you will learn and grow as you study and practice this book -- so, you want to be like Christ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Browning","review":"Its hard to find a non-coated cookie sheet anymore. But if you're looking for a perfectly browned cookie, then this is what you need. Usually, with the darker non-stick cookie sheets, when the tops look ready the bottoms are a little overdone. With this cookie sheet, the tops and bottoms will be exactly the same color. And don't worry about it not being non-stick; for me the cookies slide right off with only about 2 or 3 crumbs stuck to the entire sheet when I'm done--even with no greasing or waxed paper. It is just as easy to clean as a non-stick. All in all, you'll get a better cookie sheet for less price, because you're not paying for a non-stick coating."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Cookie/Baking Sheet !","review":"I just recently purchased this item and the first thing I baked were chocolate chip cookies for my daughter. I have to say that when I took my cookies out of the oven they were baked evenly and they looked great! This product worked alot better than I had expected. When I decided to purchase this item I was looking for a cookie sheet that wasn't non-stick because the non-stick ones don't last very long and can get scratched up very easily.

Its no better or worse than other sheets I have used in the past. I bought it because I expected it to be more durable by virtue of its being sturdier made; It is not more durable, its just average. Which means it probably will bend and warp with frequent use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite 'perfect' browning....","review":"This past Christmas, armed with every kitchen aid I could imagine, I baked several batches of Toll House chocolate chip cookies. I made sure the baking sheet was cold, that the oven was the correct temperature and that the dough was properly chilled. None-the-less, almost all the cookies were a little overdone on the bottom. I would still recommend this because there is nothing out there that is as affordable, quality produced in the USA, and as widely available.As I mentioned in my recent Matfer silicone/fiberglass baking sheet review, I will be using it to line this cookie sheet prior to baking a new batch of cookies.

It comes with two attachments so you can attach it to the side or attach it from the top edge.I got it for my 55 gallon tank but the flow was so powerful that I had to dial it down. I'm going to split the flow and put diffusers on them so that the flow will not be that strong.As far as noise goes, it is absolutely noiseless without the Venturi.

I laughed a little when I read the other review about the fish disappearing because they were sucked into the filter. Boy do I have egg on my face now.Yesterday I installed the power head in a 55 gallon tank for 2 large fancy-pants goldfish. As soon as I installed it the fish perked up. The venturi bubbles are awesome and the pump rapidly circulates water around the tank; this is what I wanted it for, to increase oxygen in the tank.After work when I got home today I found my oranda stuck to the base of the filter. Her eye is all puffy, and from what I've read I'm pretty lucky that she still has her eye intact. I cut a hole in an aquarium filter sponge and covered the little suction dealie at the bottom.So, even if you have large fish mind that serious suction!Edit: Haha, this review was written in bad taste.

You'll have to read through many extensive descriptions and a lot of javascript that doesn't deserve much attention. Selecting the right object in IE or Netscape makes the presented code qualify as a Cross-Browser Framework.

However, I found it annoying the author wouldn't take the time to include a brief synopsis regarding both plot and characters, at the beginning of the book. I had a very difficult time following what was going on. Additionally, the Green Arrow himself did not appeal to me. It just wasn't a protagonist i could care about. I must admit though, i did not actually finish this book as i decided it was not worth my time.

For not having any previous knowledge of G.A. I was able to easily understand what was going on and it helped to develop some other character interest (Green Lantern).

It features loads of guest stars: Batman, Arsenal, Black Canary, Conner Hawke, Deadman, Hal Jordan, Aquaman, Black Manta, Jason Blood/Etrigan, Spoiler, Superman, the rest of the JLA, a character from Smith's CLERKS cartoon and some I wouldn't want to spoil here. There's more than a fair bit of quasi-theology, continuity, and in-jokes (much like Smith's movies) but if your into that stuff or if it at least it doesn't go over your head then your in for a real treat.

Then, when you do that, it sounds really bad. Maybe if this T.V. was a little cheaper it wouldn't bother me as bad. I think its worth more like 225.00-250.00. Not 300.00. I thought there was going to be such a dramatic difference between flat screen and regular direct-view. There is a little, but not so much that its worth an extra 100.00.

The filming of this was awesome--great stage lighting and loved the close-ups of the guitar playing. This line-up of Megadeth is the best one since the \\"Symphony of Destruction\\" era. Great musicianship and the Rust in Peace album has never sounded so great until now. This performance was technically fantastic and totally gave justice to this Megadeth Classic! The way it was filmed and the sound recording makes you feel you were right there at the concert! I ordered the Beunos Aires dvd and hope that it will be as good as this one!

I loved this show(saw it live in Buffalo back in February). Dave's vocals were just fine during that show. So why the dubbed vocals on the \\"live\\" dvd and cd? If I wanted to here Dave singing the songs in a recording studio I would throw in my 1990 copy of Rust in Peace. Does Dave think we are stupid or that we just don't care? I can only hope that he won't be aloud to screw with his vocal tracks on the live Big 4 dvd coming out due to the fact that its a compilation of 4 bands and not exclusively Megadeth. If Dave continues this practice I'll have to stop buying \\"live\\" Megadeth releases. What a let down.

I miss the focus on our main three characters, and thought that should have been the point, especially in the last season, but no, the entire focus was shifted to the Potentials, who, by the way, bored me to death. I mean, don't you think this should have been brought up AGES ago, if it was going to be this significant in the final season? Urgh. It's like the final season is a whole new show, one I don't really care for. Nothing happens. Everyone's character is twisted, and nothing like themselves. Everything was just done wrong.I'm still going to read the season eight comics, just to see if those improve, and I'm really hoping they do, because this was just cringe-worthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad season... great show","review":"Season 7 of Buffy is pretty crappy. Even the season closer, \\"Chosen\\", pales in comparison to the ending for season 5 (IMHO). Seasons 1-5 of Buffy are THE best t.v. I've ever seen. The funny thing is... the show actually ended at the end of season 5. It had a great ending too. Why did they bring it back? Even Buffy was mad she was brought back to life, as part of the plot in season 6. I couldn't blame here; I was mad too.Season 6 is worth purchasing just for the excellent \\"Once more with feeling\\". There is nothing to recommend about season 7."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Final Season.","review":"Buffy throughout the years has always give us entertainment and with this last season she proves to us that she's going out with a blast.This dvd pack comes with all the season 7 episodes that are truly great such as the first episode \\"lessons\\" which talk about the remaking of the hellmouth highschool that buffy had to destroy.Other episodes are with spike dealing with himself now that he has a soul.Then we still have the annoying dawn who does'nt seem to adjust to her crazy life with buffy this season also has the return of faith to help buffy with the hardest mission she'll ever face.I love this season because it reflects the first season which make it one of the best shows EVER."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Finale","review":"The seventh and final season of \\"Buffy The Vampire Slayer\\", brings a conforting closure to all fans through the years.We get to see old enemies that didn't get a chance to develope propetly in season 3 (The First), and good old friends (Faith)(and a little Angel on the final episode), Buffy finally confronts her feelings towards Spike, and Willow moves on beautifully with Kennedy.Xander and Anya, work things out in a funny way, and Giles comes back to help the Scoobys one more time.This season is full of surprises, and even in the darkers moments we can find that great humor in all the characters.If you are a Buffy fan, you'll understand the true meaning of this season.If you're an Angel fan, you'll understand episode \\"The Girl in Question\\" season 5 (and many others).And if you are not a Buffy or Angel fan, you'll become one."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUFFY","review":"Once i started watching Buffy, i couldn't stop.

What a waste of a once great show...though they never were able to recover after graduating high school and losing Angel & Cordelia. What's remarkable about this season is how unremarkable it truely is. They practically never leave that house and the plot is so filled with holes that you could drive Giles's Citroen right through it. All the action is really saved for the final episodes and even then they feel anti-climatic. Even a guest appearnce by Drusilla (though it is not really her) cannot save this sinking ship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series Ender","review":"The final season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer was pretty good considering most series end without warning or preparation. Story lines were wrapped up pretty neatly, but with the ability to continue on (in Season 8 - the comic book). It was sad to see some characters go, but the series had a great run, and left fans eager to get more from Joss Whedon.My only gripe is with the DVD production itself. There is a special features featurette on the third or fourth disc that gives away the end of the series (it literally shows the final scene). Be warned. If you are a first time Buffy watcher, skip the special features until you've completed the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"buffy ruled!","review":"I loved Buffy The Vampire Slayer I really miss that show, here's hoping for an eventual reunion movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"A bittersweet end","review":"**some spoilers*It wasn't my favorite season but it was a good ending!

Thank god for DVDs. I also enjoyed the special features on disc 6 (Buffy wraps party, Joss Whedon's 10 most favorite episodes, etc)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two good reasons to purchase this...","review":"I'm going to buy this set for two specific reasons, and one general reason. The general one is, of course, that I'm a gigantic Buffy fanatic. The two specifics? Selfless and Storyteller, the two brilliant episodes of this otherwise below-average season.Then again, the season six DVDs helped me like that season when I hadn't before. Let's hope that happens again. This season started off strong, and then swerved from good to bad during the middle, and then just kinda took a nosedive towards the end.

Please don't read this review if you want to be surprised by the final season! I know how annoying it is to accidentally find out the ending to a movie or show that you wanted to discover on your own.)Not the best season, but it does have its moments. There are a lot of very cool scenes that help to tie the series together. Bringing most (though sadly not all) of the characters back for the final season was a huge plus.My only regret is the fate of Dawn, I really thought she should have been included with the potentials.Also, and im not saying this is necessarily bad, is it just me, or does Xander really get a raw deal? It seems like, of all the characters, he ends up with the least to live for at the end of it all.Anyway, good season, go buy it. Hopefully if you're reading this review you've paid attention to the spoiler notice anyway and you already know how good it is. The development of Spike alone is worth the green."},{"rating":"2","title":"bcrichguitarguy","review":"it was awsome It's cool that Spike gets a soul and that behavior chip taken out of his head"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best seasons of BTVS","review":"Season 7 is one of my favorites. The episodes were very scary and all the characters became heroes @ the end. I don't know y people say this season is bad. Many of the episodes I enjoyed very much and the ending was bittersweet. I wish Buffy stayed on longer. This show has been amazing. The show has made me angry, bored, cried, happy, and of course made me laugh soo much from Xander's jokes. The show had everything and it deserved 3 more seasons. I especially love love Andrew played by Tom Lenk. Omg he is sooo cute and brings even more fun to the gang. I am soo happy he is going to be in season 8 comics. I wish the writers made him a full fledge cast from the beginning. This season I also loved all the characters even Dawn.

In order to avoid paying over a hundred dollars I purchased the seasons used. Usually I do this and everything turns out fine, in fact all 6 other seasons are in pristine condition. Season 7 came to me water damaged, with food spills and so many scratches it would take years to count. Very disappointed, most likely will never order anything used again. I guess it serves me right for not seeing the actual product before buying. Moral of the story, don't buy used. EVER."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is supposed to be Buffy?","review":"Once there was a show on the WB that ran for 5 years called 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer', then after it finished UPN started a series of the same name, and frankly that is all they have in common. In S7 we see the show retreating back into its childhood, returning to Sunnydale High and trying to recapture past glories but it's far too late. What we get are unrecognizable characters, not grown up or matured, simply utterly changed. The same goes for the writing. The trademark humour is in short supply and what we get instead makes me think that they must have had 'Prozac' as a sponsor. If you want to cherish the memory of Buffy then just pretend that the show finshed with 'The Gift' and give this a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buffy Should Have Ended with Season 6","review":"I have always been a huge Buffy fan up until the 7th season. I could barely stand to watch the Buffy/Slayer wanna be's and Spike torturning himself over his returned soul. I am a huge fan of Spike and would rather him go souless and retain his character's great, quirkey and sexy personality. Besides, Buffy never knew she had it so good with Spike. Who needs Angel. Season 7 was a huge disappointment with the actors walking through their parts. Josh really let his loyal watcher's (no pun intended) down."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've been checking everyday for this to be online!!!","review":"Finally, I can have the whole series!!! Now, honestly, the series finale was a little weak. But the rest of the season was very good. I really liked the developement in the characters in this season. Spike returns with an unexpected surprise. Willow returns from England after Giles has been trying to help her after she went off of the deep end in magic. Then comes the potential slayers, which was a pretty interesting storyline in it's own. This season does flow very well and I was very excited to welcome Faith and Angel to the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffy the Vampire Slayer- The Complete Seventh Season","review":"Although this wasn't the best season of Buffy, it was by far much better than season six. The writers did a great job by refocusing the attention off personal depressions to a larger picture. The actors and actresses were also outstanding. You have to take the episodes one by one most definately some were much better than others, but overall this final season of Buffy could rank number three of the best sesons. Although I wasn't completly satisfied by the series finale, this DVD set is a must have for die hard fans like myself or for those of you that wish to get hooked on one the BEST SHOWS EVER."},{"rating":"2","title":"buffy","review":"Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Sixth Season (Slim Set)Everything was great!

As mentioned in a few posts above, yes the show grew up. You just cant please some people I guess. If we would have gotten more of the same, there would be complaints of it getting stale. Something different, people complain it is going away from what made it great. I loved Spikes development. I liked the fact that Xanders eye gouging was quick/pointless, as are most tragedies in life. Many just didnt get it. They thought Xanders eye gouging had to have purpose. Great season and i will buy to complete my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffy is always a MUST-HAVE","review":"HiI bought this one because I couldn't watch this last season when it was broadcasted in Latinamerica. I have to admit that I found this season GOOD but not as good as the previous seasons. I think the story was kinda slow, I don't know, the very end was very good, the whole season is full of surprises and all that stuff, you definitely will get LOTS of surprises and a LOT of quality on this set.The aspect ratio is the same of the tv broadcasting (4:3 full screen) and the quality of the picture is just excellent. The audio in Dolby Digital 2.1 is cool, you get surrounded in the fights (specially the series finale). The extras are MEGA cool.I don't say too much about it cause i don't like to say \\"spoilers\\" to all that people who haven't seen this DVDs, Buy the set, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffy Ends","review":"An excellent end for the best series on television. Although the soon-to-be removed crutch that we still had Angel to hang on to made it easier to let go, its passing was nevertheless difficult to bear. The most imaginative series on television marked and highlighted real issues in demon form throughout high school, into college and beyond. Certainly not without missteps along the way it still always braved ahead and we were able to take courage as our own person fears took evil shape and were slayed. If it had to leave us alone in the dark it went out as a show worth remembering."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Buffy!

SMG and AH look like they would rather be anywhere else. And since when did show become all about Spike?This was the lowest rated, most critically panned of all the seasons. Easy to see why, the writing is inept, and too much focus is placed on nobodies like Spike and Andrew, not to mention a house full of redshirt potentials that Whedon seems to enjoy killing with the glee of school boy around an ant hill.Save you money.

That made no sense to me at all. Another thing I could never tolerate was Willow. I hate her!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! She's real annoying, and she's a lesbian for god's sake. That time I saw her make out with that other lesbian I almost had to vomit. I started watching the show many weeks later to get my mind off that hideous scene but then I saw them make out again!!!!!!!!!! I almost kicked my TV screen in!!!!!!!!

A wonderful blend of traditional Irish songs magnificently performed by this accomplished artist. I usually don't like 'live performances' but this one is an exception. While listening to 'Live at the Point' you actually feel like you are in the audience and enjoying an exceptional performer doing what his does best. It is a uplifting experience and I can (and do)listen to it over and over again. I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes traditional Irish music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"This is one of Christy Moore's best CD performances. It was done before a live audience in Dublin and the excitement of the live performance shows throughout the CD. One of his best alltime performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Definite Feel Good Album","review":"If you're feeling down just go to The Point for a bit of \\"craic\\" (a good time).

Christie is at his entertaining best in this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"seriously, you need to read this book.","review":"I got a job at the local library one spring day. Bored out of my mind at this job. So i decided that I would read a book (or at least try). I am interested in medical books and the title of this book really was intreaging. So, i checked it out.

It was my first purchase of its kind. The sound quality was mediocre at best. I probably should have done my homework before hand. Within the first few weeks, the dvd open/close tray stopped functioning, dvds/cds would just spin and not play, or at times not spin at all. The Display light would dim and just flutter. When that happened, the system would not work at all. I could not turn it off. I would have to unplug the system and plug it back in. Eventually, the dvd/cds would not spin or load at all and the tray would function partially and become stuck in a quarter to half open position before it finally just stopped working all around. This system is garbage. I have spoken with multiple professionals who work on electronics and they all have said that the problems I describe are common with this model. DO NOT BUY IT!!!

It has transformed the language of my love life with God. Kelly manages to capture the cadence and substance of the inner life and discipleship of the Spirit in a way no other writer has done for me. This book find words for movements of the heart so subtle and hidden, it takes my breath away and stirs my spirit to pursue a deeper level of interaction with my Jesus.If you long for deeper communion with Christ, this book is usher and scribe for the love-life you long for."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Journey Into the Essence of Faith","review":"In a society overrun with information, knowledge and entertainment, the timeless principles set out by Thomas Kelly are a welcome foray into what the practical side of our faith should be. That is, a personal, real and consistent walking in the presence of God, moment by moment. There is nothing theoretical about how he suggests we live in God's presence, and how this state of existence will affect the quality of everything we think, say and do. I love his use of words like the \\"Center\\" and the \\"Light\\" and many other quaint ways to draw our attention to the preeminence of Christ's presence at the heart of everything we are a aware of and all that we are not, in the spiritual realm.Some focus is required to absorb the powerful content from the quaint but enjoyable style of this short uplifting book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thing of Beauty","review":"Call it a \\"classic\\" if you like, but to me, this book is a thing of beauty. There are few books that compare to it.I once gave it as a graduation gift to a seminary student. She later commented that there were lots of things she agreed with. What?! There is no agrument or proposition here! You let it take you, lead you places. You immerse, wrap yourself in its beauty.The 1941 edition with an intro/bio by Douglas Steere (also reprinted in 70s or 80s) is MUCH MUCH preferred to the Richard Foster edition. He not only adds his own intro, but does editing of the original. Blasphemy.

It is deeply Christian and yet can resonate with anyone who feels God as a living reality in all religions or no religion. It also touches upon what the Quakers call \\"consensus\\", how to let the guiding of the Spirit lead people into an understanding filled agreement about how to live, to heal, and to forgive. I have read other Quaker books, but it seems everything is here in this book. It uses less words than all the others and says everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"philips 27rf70s flat screen tv","review":"I have owned this television since christmas, and i have found it to be just as crisp and clear as my friends sony wega flat screen tv.

Maybe they did clean up the sound a bit - but that 'plus' is completely ruined by the poor print they used for this DVD. The MPI release was MUCH better, and I'm certainly holding on to mine. Thus learneth the lesson on marketing that promotes \\"new and improved\\" - especially from Miramax."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the young at heart","review":"I first saw this when I was 11 (in 1975) and went through my own phase of Bay-tel mania as a result. The music is fresh and clean and the Fab 4 are quite appealing. The interview is a scream! (\\"What do you call your hairstyle?\\" answer-\\"Arthur.\\"). Ringo's forlorn walk through the streets to the tune of \\"This Boy\\" made this tune run through my head everytime I took a solitary walk for years. The shabby teen show host who tries unsuccessfully to exploit George Harrison rings all too true even today (one can picture this guy as an MTV-American Idol excec). The \\"clean old man\\" gives the picture added dimension.However, today's kids might be baffled by the whole thing, and the Fab 4's thick accents require repeated viewing for most people. But it does seem to appeal to the kid in a lot of people with the Bay-tels' freewheeling attitudes and the excitement surrounding their music. Sort of explains the whole phenomenon of Bay-tel mania."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funky Soundtrack","review":"Ok, the picture is incredible. Everything is \\"very clean.\\" However, some listings of the DVD have indicated that the soundtrack is in 5:1. Not really. The dialog comes out the center speakers and the songs come out the stereo speakers (almost exclusively the front). There is some debate over whether the songs are in stereo or not (I side with the no they're not). It is just weird to watch when the sound shifts entirely from the middle to entirely to the sides. But hey, this is Hard Day's Night with a bunch of extras at a very reasonable price...what, you're not going to buy it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Defines a Generation","review":"Richard Lester's \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" bursts from the screen in glorious black and white, showing the world what it was like to be young, handsome and talented in the early 1960s. It's a fabulous picture, and every \\"rock\\" movie and video since then are mere copycats, trying too hard to recreate the frenetic fun-in-the-park sequence, John's one-liners and quirky gestures (notice the Coke-bottle-in-the-nose gag on the train), and Ringo's solitary man sweetness. There's nothing better, really. The despair on some of the young girl's faces at the ending concert will even bring tears to your eyes, and you'll wish you had that kind of passion in your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning !

Just compare the full-frame footage in the \\"making of\\" specials to the film itself.They did this to \\"The Last Waltz,\\" \\"Touch Of Evil,\\" and many other good films, but people don't notice it and the studios keep getting away with it.

I know this is an unpopular point of view, but I thought Hard Day's Night was a little cynical in that shameless commercial sort of way. The old codger, Paul's relation, was irritating throughout the movie. The only scene that was sweet and real was Ringo's encounter with the kids playing by the river. In fact, Ringo had the subtlest and sweetest touch of the four!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what a film?? no act & wasting time!","review":"there is no clear story in this film.

The sound on this DVD is bad, there is absolutely no dynamic range. The volume level seems to hover at the same level through out the film, there is no difference in volume between the scenes when there is a quiet conversation and the scenes where the band is playing. I also own the title on laserdisc and let me tell you, the laserdisc has at least 30 db of dynamic range. While watching this film on laserdisc, you can adjust the level of playback so that the scenes where there is conversation is a comfortable 75 db, and when the band plays it jumps up to an ear thumping 105 db or more. This DVD lacks ooph, the band sounds like their playing in a box. This film deserves a better sound treatment, I highly recommend boycotting the DVD and lets wait till they release it in it's proper state."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the film but not the DVD","review":"I've tried to watch this DVD a number of times but the songs don't sound the way they should, the way they were meant to sound, and this ruins the entire movie for me. It's a shame because this movie is the greatest.Why can't they just release the movie in its original form so that viewing it would be like seeing it new in 1964? In the early nineties AMC played a lovely restored & cleaned up version. Why not release that version? Then, as a bonus, throw in some original trailers and the \\"You Can't Do That\\" footage.When you have a perfect film to begin with....don't mess with it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, Bad DVD","review":"First and foremost, A Hard Day's Night is a great film starring the greatest band in the history of music. The Miramax DVD of this classic film is one of the worst DVDs of alltime. The 5.1 soundtrack mix is awful and the attempted letterboxing is equally as bad since the film was not shot in widescreen. If you can get your hands on the first AHDN DVD, issued in 1997 by MPI, grab it at any cost. The MPI DVD was produced after the film was restored and had its premiere on the American Movie Classics (AMC)cable channel. It is not in 5.1 digital sound, but it's a heck-of-a-lot better than the mix Miramax came up with. Don't let my rating of 1 star fool you, however. The Miramax AHDN DVD gets 1 star, A Hard Day's Night, THE MOVIE, gets a 5 star (or better) rating in my opinion. ST"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please give us back the original","review":"Since I originally saw this movie in the theater in 1964 and really dug it, I regretfully have to agree with Pete and David's reviews. Whatever was done to this movie on DVD took away the quality of the original. Perhaps this is the reason that you don't see interviews with any of the Beatles. The interviews that are on the second disc are very much meaningless and don't add to the flavor of the movie. It was cut badly in places that were not cut in the original, and I don't understand what was done with the soundtrack. In a single word the soundtrack is \\"CRAPPY\\"! Perhaps if the entire movie would have been redubbed in Dolby 5.1 surround sound, it might have been better. This issue on DVD is not gear! So please, give us back the original and add the trailers."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad sound quality","review":"it should have no stars at all for this re-released dvd.

I figured when this movie got released for a second time on DVD it would be far superior. My mistake! If you are lucky enough to find the original DVD, I recommend that over this. It's a shame seeing how well \\"Yellow Submarine was done and the Anthology DVD set. I wasn't even happy with the packaging. When I saw the DVD I though \\"This is it?\\".

Boo for Miramax!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD Missed Several Important Items","review":"If you're a Beatles fans, you must buy this DVD: It has many new interviews and snippets never seen before. However, the producers missed the boat in several CRITICAL areas:1. The soundtrack is in MONO and at the wrong speed. Check out \\"And I Love Her\\" == it's one key too low. They should have taken advantage of DVD capabilities and offered the sound in MONO, STEREO, and 5.1 SURROUND.2. Outtakes such as \\"You Can't Do That\\" were excluded -- inexcusable!3. Just like the \\"Yellow Submarine\\" DVD, you should have the option of \\"Music Only.\\"Nice try by the producers, but they overlooked several very key opportunities.

If you enjoy the wide-screen view of a theater, this DVD doesn't deliver. It crops widely from every direction: from the left, right, top, & bottom of the screen. And, if you prefer a full-screen format, because you don't like back bands, this DVD doesn't deliver either. You will still fully see two bands, both top & bottom of the screen. In terms of sound, it is neither fully state-of-the-art, nor is it a fully faithful replication of the original. This DVD is hardly worth it, at any price. Wait for the next reincarnation, one that is worthy of the artists' accomplishment.It is sad that Lennon's vision should be compromised by shortsighted production. Miramax has taken a bite out of Apple; it isn't original, but it is a sin nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality soundtrack","review":"All the songs in this release sound as if they are playing too slow and too loud, with a booming, buzzy undertone.

The humor is SOOOO funny and the things they do are nuts!! We always walk up to each other in school and say one of the stupid lines in the movie, and we burst out in laughter that's so uncontrolable, it's like we're going mad!!My favorite scene is when the Fab Four are on a train and Paul talks about his \\"clean\\" grandfather. The other favorite scene of mine is when John is pretending to be a Submarine Captain in the bathtub with his little plasic sub (don't worry--he had a swim suit on)A huge fan of \\"Help!\\" as well, I know that the Beatle movies are topping my favorites.

The mono soundtrack had some type of weird phasing sound when I played it on an Apex DVD player connected to my stereo TV.

I prefer my original Hard Day's Night dvd when the sound was in 2.0 not the 5.1 surround.

Being a Beatles fan from the beginning of time. However this purchase was for my 16 year old Daughter, who is a bigger fan of the \\"Fab Four\\" than I ever was. I'm assuming that this is the \\"Retro Phase\\" that today's youth are experiencing, and I'm glad in a way because I've always been of the opinion that yesterday's music is much better than a lot of the recent trends that is considered music today. Some of these current artist's scare me a little with their lack of musical talent, and their constant re-recording of earlier artists/true musicians works, and making money off of someone else's efforts.I will always love the Beatle's work, and am glad to see their earlycreations recorded for todays technology."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hard Days Night","review":"This is my favorite Beatles film.

The music is classic Beatles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who's That Little Old Man?","review":"This is a quick review of the VHS - the DVD seems to be taking a trouncing here.At any event, \\"A Hard Days' Night\\" is a good-time movie, one of the best ever made. I love every part of it - the songs, the rapid-fire Liverpool banter, and of course the boys themselves before they grew beards - so incredibly young and carefree.And don't forget Wilfrid Brambell - that very clean little old man. As we all know, he belongs to Paul."},{"rating":"2","title":"good Beatles movie","review":"This was the first movie that the Beatles did and my favorite of their movies as well.Plot: Pretty much a day in the life of the Beatles.

I bought this DVD with high expectations and I got them. Sure, some of the extra features are lame- but can't we just rate this on the film itself?I think this is one of the funniest films in the history of cinema. It is just so WEIRD. The dialog is fast-paced and all four Beatles shine in at least one scene (my personal favorite is George in the TV executives office).This is an excellent film, not only for Beatles fans but for anyone who likes a great movie. Have fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Hard Day's Night..Hard on the Ears!","review":"It is my considered opinion that whoever is responsible for the \\"digital remastering\\" of the songs on this DVD should be shot! Believe me...I LOVE THE BEATLES! That is why I'm so disappointed. For one thing, the levels are totally screwy. But to really hear just how f---ed up the sound is, listed to Paul's vocal on \\"And I Love Her\\". Then go and put on the cd or better yet your old vinyl version. You've got hear it to believe it. I'm sending mine back today. :-( Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Beatles","review":"First off, whoever wrote that this film ripped off the Spice Girls is obviously not paying attention to the fact that \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" came out in 1964 and \\"Spice World\\" came out about thirty years later, so I believe that means the Spice Girls ripped off the Beatles, not vice versa. Anyway, this film is a great piece, and though not a very good representation of the Beatles, it features their classic songs, some humor, and you gotta love that classic black and white. There are some dull moments, but for anyone interested in this time period it's a must-see."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very dissapointing DVD","review":"A lot of things were said about the release of this DVD. Unfortunatelly the people that were involved in it didn't care about it.Instead of giving us new things they cut out good stuff, such as the \\"I'll cry instead\\" intro, the trailers, and the stereo sound....the sound is very dissapointing, and the interviews, especially in disc 2 are quite boring, and don't bring anything new or exciting to what we know about the beatles.I will hold on to my old DVD version of this movie, which has a stereo sound and really more interesting things than this \\"new\\" version"},{"rating":"2","title":"For this great movie: The best sound ever AND the best presentation ever!","review":"The Beatles/ A Hard Day's Night (Miramax): It would be absolutely foolish to pass up on the Miramax DVDs just for an extra half inch of sky on some wretchedly sounded old version of the movie. This isn't Fellini ya know, it the Beatles having fun and in the process they taught a whole generation of kids how to be a rock-n-roll band. When the Beatles are talking, I want to hear what they are saying and you get that with this version of the movie. I want to have a decent audio for the Beatles songs and you get that on this version of the movie. You don't miss a thing with this DVD, in fact, you get to see it more clearly than you ever have before. The Beatles \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" is a Great movie and the Miramax DVD is the BEST way to see that movie.

This DVD is just a shambles too--similar poor dynamic range,flat,compressed,lifeless sound. THE BEATLES sounding like THIS? I'll take other reviewers words regarding chopped-off cropping of the picture as well (I don't own the previous AHDN video editions to do my own A/B comparison).

Its protagonists, Ringo, John, George, & Paul, were favorably (and in my opinion, correctly) compared to Groucho, Chico, Harpo, & Zeppo. Most of it consists of The Fab Four playing some of their songs and trying to avoid their legions of female fans. Although they did the former quite well, they don't make that much of an effort at the latter!Insofar as there's a plot to this funfest, it consists of the boys's handlers trying to make sure they get to a TV appearence on time. Will they make it? Buy the VHS or DVD and find out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the movie but this DVD stops in the middle!","review":"A Hard Day's Night is my all time favorite movie, but when I tried to watch it on my DVD player that usually plays the complete disk it stopped in the middle of the movie right out of the box! This is disappointing. Haven't had a chance to try it on another DVD player. Maybe next time I'll bite the bullet and buy the Apple version."},{"rating":"1","title":"the sound is yikes! the acting is a nonsense!","review":"hmmh...how bad this remastered version is. But this isn't a remastered version, what other people thought.The songs are sounding very slowed down and muddied.What a waste of time, money, and ultimately the version might ruin people's perception of the movie.Unfortunately I have bought the old VHS version,...which has the same quality like this one. The cover looks great, the sound is bad and the acting of the musicians in the movie is a nonsense, they were only running and jumping. Many people bought this film because it is the beatles that's all!PS: I agree with some people, who said some other rock bands are much better than Beatles like the Black Sabbath Dvd's, Led Zeppelin dvd's or Deep purple Dvd's are much better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"you all fell in love with the guys from the past!","review":"yes you are! this film is exactly a good nostagia for all die hard beatle fans but some people who do not like beatles, they do not have any interrest in this dvd film. More over the DVD version is not really as good as I thought,...it lacked the system! see all reviewers below, they have the same opinion like us! my question is: why didn't the film company try to color this black & white film? I guess it should have been coloured, haven't it?

But this movie is so slow and boring, I don't know what the big deal is? Sure, it's great watching the Beatles run around, and you get a sense of their chemistry. And of course, the music is fantastic. But the directing is sloppy, the jokes unfunny, and the invisible storyline painfully tedious. More of a curiosity picture than a movie. For die-hard Beatles fans only. Even the Monkees were better at this sort of thing..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged","review":"DVD did not play......vendor did not return emails.

It's puzzling to have this kind of experience. I wasn't foreign to buying things from Amazon. But now after reading several reviews I guess I should be grateful not to get one because it sounds like this particular package might be a total waste of time and money. I love the Beatles for many reason but I'm not likely to pay 60 bucks on Ebay for the special MPI version. I might however wait for a better version that is sold at a reasonable price if Miramax or whatever studio decides to re-release A Hard Day's Night on DVD.I hope this is helpful or atleast inciteful."},{"rating":"2","title":"What people like me used to read before the internet","review":"When I was a grad student in the 70's and 80's I used to read some of this book before going to bed.

The quality is nice and it does not bend or reform in a hot oven. However I wish the sides were a bit higher on the outside.

Without the pan, the bread was good. With this pan, the bread is fantastic. The crust is crusty; the inside is perfect.

I would recommend this to everyone who bakes french bread."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chicago Metallic French Bread Pan","review":"This pan is great. It did exactly what we wanted it to do which was to provide a taller loaf than when using just a cookie sheet. We spray the pan with oil before placing the loaves in the pan and have not had a sticking problem with 8+ loaves. We use a bread machine to prepare the dough and provide the first rise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended for crusty French bread","review":"This pan is fabulous for making French or Italian bread. The loaves are perfectly shaped thanks to the curve of the pan and the bread develops a very nice crust due to the perforations.

This is a very good product. Buy it if you want excellent baking results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this pan!","review":"I enjoy baking bread - once you start making your own bread, the stuff from the supermarket just won't cut it. I'm especially fond of hearty, crunchy loaves - a good solid crust is an art form. Alas, I'm not anywhere near as artistic as a professional baker, but over the years I've turned out a good loaf now and again.This pan is an excellent aid to get the right amount of crunch without scorching. Heavy construction, well made - feels like a quality piece (as do all of the Chicago Metallic pans I have). The perforations really make a difference - I have a solid french bread pan, and this one consistently turns out a better loaf.It's a bit squatter and wider than other french bread pans I've used, which I find to be a positive feature. But, if you're looking for a pan to turn out a very long loaf, you may want to look elsewhere.Easy to clean - never had any sticking problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectly Shaped Loaves - At Last!","review":"If you are an amateur artisan bread baker, you've probably had the same problems I have had with shaping your loaves. They are either too short, too flat, or just plain wrong! I finally decided to order one of these bread pans, just to see if it would make any difference at all. What a pleasant surprise - the French bread was perfectly shaped, the crust was outstanding, and there was absolutely no problem with sticking in the holes. I would definitely recommend this pan to anyone who bakes bread at home. One caveat - be sure to reduce your oven temperature by 25 degrees and cover the loaves with foil after 20 minutes to prevent burning. I'd also watch and not use a wet dough since that might just stick in the holes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Again","review":"I will never buy a product from this manufacturer again!

I'm trying to decide on kneading in the KitchenAid vs. kneading in the Cuisinart, vs kneading by hand. Each has its advantages and drawbacks. The recipe for the baking pans is a Cuisinart recipe, and is it ever fast!I baked two loaves and they came out wonderfully brown with a crisp enough (for me) crust. Flavor was good.

It is not flimzy and so far, it has not rusted around the edges when coming out of the dishwasher (with a NO heat dry setting).

Having one of them dress up as a woman was very funny. When my sister and I saw the two of them fighting over the wig, we laughed our heads off. Definetly a good movie for those young at heart and even a few otherwise. If you need a good laugh, watch Lilo and Stitch."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best I've ever seen!","review":"I had watched many Disney movies before (a very, VERY long time ago). And I thought I'd see Hey Arnold (in theatres), and and didn't exactly like it. Then I wanted to see Lilo & Stitch, and once I did, \\"HA HA HA!\\" The best movie I have ever seen. The voice and SFX are extremely authentic, and has a perfectly efficient running time. I have had it for about 3 weeks, and I've watched it at least 15 times. I'm also surprised the CC system has the Hawaiian songs well written down. I have the CC on almost every time, and know almost every word in the movie. Closed Captioning is useful though, and is a good way to learn the movie's words and the songs.

Having spent several years in Hawaii, they were able to capture that which makes Hawaii special. The songs written for the movie and the desire to keep the movie \\"true\\" to the Hawaiian way of life provides the great background.The movie itself is destined to become a classic. I can watch it weekly and it is still enjoyable. The additional fact that they didn't try to make all the characters into \\"barbie dolls\\" is an added feature I find refreshing.If you get the DVD, take the time to review the added features. Learn about the Islands (if you have never been there) and watch the children who perform \\"Hawaiian Roller Coaster Ride\\" and the making of the movie. Quite entertaining, also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Disney movie since Beauty and The Beast","review":"Appropriate for all ages is this delightful Disney film that showcases the best in family entertainment that the studio is known for. Drawn with a simpler style of animation than the computer-graphic-enhanced material that they've producing of late, this beautiful film (which looks like a living watercolour painting) centres on a misunderstood little Hawaiian girl named Lilo and her adventures with Stitch, an alien from a planet that rejected it. The two help each other learn the true meaning of family, and along with Lilo's older sister Nani (voiced by Tia Carrere who oddly enough gives her most memorable performance) they make up quite the unconventional clan. Stitch, originally an alien weapon of destruction, is given a lesson in togetherness when he learns that having love in his life is worth his putting his baser tendencies to rest. Very lovingly made, and very enjoyable, with Lilo being a particularly endearing and fun character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hateful & meanspirited trash","review":"I was shocked at the way the Lilo character was dipicted in this sickening film from Disney.First off, Lilo brutally beats a little girl mercilessly simply because she disagrees with her.Then, her older sister jay-walks then kicks a car and throws an insult at the driver for no reason.Next, we see Lilo living in a house of pure filth and her older sister leaves the stove on while she's not at home. It saddened me to see Lilo's older sister threaten violence against Lilo and then Lilo responds with horrid insults against her sister.This is a very disturbing image of what Disney calls \\"an alternative family\\". This film has absolutely no redeeming value can not teach your child anything about life that he or she couldn't already learn from the gutter..."},{"rating":"1","title":"kids don't need this kind of stress","review":"Having seen some of the sequels to Lilo and Stitch which were not too bad, I purchased the original assuming it would be even better. Not so. Far too much family stress present in this film, isn't it bad enough that Lilo's mother, as with so many other cartoon characters in young children's films, is dead? Lilo, a really cute character, seems to solve her problems through violence quite a lot in this film. It's not that we expect her to be perfect but seriously, do kids really need this? No they don't. What kind of people write this stuff? Do they have children themselves or any idea of the most basic of studies on child psychology? Something is really wrong with a society that cannot produce films appropriate for young children. Shame on Disney and Hollywood, and the pathetic bunch of hacks who write this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please do not let your child watch this movie","review":"This movie is not only strange, but it is also yet another let down in mindless entertainment that your child will emulate through bratty and selfish behavior later.I have been having a difficult time with my 4 year old lately and the movie choices that are out there. Disney has ultimately been a huge let down to me with the vocabulary that my child is picking up on. Everything from \\"jerk\\", \\"stupid\\", \\"stupid head\\" and \\"idiot\\"; I have had enough.

That is cool that the Director and the voice of Stitch (Chris Sanders) Made this movie and came up with the idea for Stitch. This movie is way different from all the other Disney movies. The DVD is great, but it doesn't have the part where Stitch says: \\"I'm not soft and fluffy.\\" I don't know what is my favorite part. Maybe the part where Lilo teaches Stitch how to Hula!

The animation is beautiful, the characters are well designed, and frankly Stitch is the Mouse house's best new addition. He matches the temper of Donald and the comedy antics of Goofy. The film keeps things going at a fast pace and never really drags or gets boring. The DVD doesn't fare as well. The menus are cool and some of the featurettes are great but the other extras are just stuff you'd find on a regular direct-to-video Disney DVD. But then this leads me to believe that there will be a two-disc special edition coming out soon! But this DVD is still worth buying for the movie alone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute","review":"The single thing that most impressed me with this movie is the fact that all the characters have REAL bodies. Lilo is this cute little pudgy girl and her sister is normal looking (not mutant as most animated characters are). The movie can get a bit gross at times (perfect for very little kids who enjoy such things) so be forewarned. I liked that this movie is so different than everything else for kids. It's a cute movie that can stand up to the constant replays that are sure to happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable movie for all ages","review":"As any parent knows, when your child likes a movie they want to watch it over and over and over...etc. This is a movie that I find entertaining even on the 12th viewing with my 3 year old--who adores this movie.Some of the sci-fi elements go over her head, but the core message: \\"Ohana means family, family means nobody gets left behind...Or forgotten\\" is a powerful and enduring one."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT!","review":"I loved this movie so much that when it came to the theater i work at i went to see it 8 times. one of those times i took mymother and grandparents. they loved it almost as much as i did.i cant wait for it come out on dvd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Insipid Pap","review":"I'm not sure what inspired this movie, but they forgot the inspiration when they made it. My daughter liked the purposeless violence and dimensionless characters so I guess it must be some sort of a cult college fad.

They don't know how to show the original version of the music video because they only showed bits and pieces of it and that's unfair to everybody who buys the DVD so they can see the music video. I saw the original music video and I thought I was really getting something by adding this to my collection of A*Teens music videos. But no! I get ripped off instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this is trash","review":"to get straight to the point i really dislike this movie the lesseon it teaches is boring and besides, the movie isnt all that moving and uplifting.i think disney could have thought of something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lilo & Stitch","review":"The DVD \\"stutters\\" in several places, for a fairly significant time in one place.

Talk about your bad (as in zero) value. Isn't the oft repeated theme in L & S \\"family means no one gets left behind, or forgotten\\"? That's the one thing my kid remembers most about this film, and excuse me for saying that I don't really have a problem with that. If YOU do, don't fret...Barney is on PBS Mon.-Fri."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disney's Fresh New Look","review":"Personally I loved this movie so much because it's very different from all the Disney stories I've watched since I was a little girl. It offers a contemporary look to issues like science and family values, so important for our society. Also like any of the main characters we can laugh and cry with them while watching the movie. Sincerely it's a beautiful movie full of good things to think about."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS MOVIE IS ONLY FOR KIDS........","review":"As I watched this movie, I kept on wandering when it was going to get better, and weave that magic spell that only disney can do, but it never came. The movie draged on and on, without a real meaning. It did not seem like a disney movie at all. I only hope that they will come out with a better movie. I give it two stars because the kids liked it, although I wish I never bought it, but at least it entertained the kids, but only the kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"The dvd did not work and I was not happy with that at all.

Lilo and Stitch are so cute. Basically, once I heard Lilo use one of my favorite words abomination I fell instantly in love with this Elvis inspiring movie.This is a good wholesome movie for anyone to watch. Maybe the Elvis haters should avoid this pick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun For Entire Family","review":"Super-cute movie!! My daughter is 5 1/2 and we loved this movie. I might have liked it more than she did, actually. The story is about an alien created simply to destroy things, without any other purpose in this world, who ends up on Earth-mistaken for a dog-and adopted by Lilo. Lilo is adorable. She is not all sappy-sappy like some other animated characters created. She is fresh and spunky. Anyway, Lilo lives with her sister and they are having a rough time without any parents to guide them. Stitch comes along and adds a lot of excitement to their lives. The storyline is such that an entire family can enjoy it. The humor appeals to many different ages, and the animation is exceptional. Good movie for adults and kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funalicious","review":"Fantastic movie! Fun for all ages and really sweet without being too cliched. The DVD has some good features on it- worth the extra money just to see the cute trailers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, Love, Love","review":"video is in excellent! my son loves this movie, I love that I can put it on anytime for him. The price is unbeatable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny great family movie","review":"This is one of my all time favorite Disney movies. If you have a small child as a adult you will be able to relate with the older sister oh so well."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an incongruous bunch of ideas...","review":"Let's see...UFOs, Hawaii, and Elvis. Oh yeah, I see the connection now. It's all so obvious!Never have I encountered such an incongruous bunch of elements thrown together on film. Who thought this up? Let me know so I can know what not to smoke.In addition, Lilo is little spoiled brat; her sister is an abhorrent caretaker; and the little UFO guy is more scary than loveable. No thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for young children","review":"I saw the advertisments and thought this would be cute and funny. Big mistake. Disney is counting on their name on this one. There is way too much violence and anger in this movie. Lilo does not attempt to make friends with anyone in this movie, except the alien. She even hits and bites another small child she is angry at. She is being raised by her sister and they are watched by a social worker who threatens to take Lilo away from her because she is not taken care of. How do you explain such problems to a small child. Children like to mimic and act out things they see on TV, so I would not want my child screaming at me in defiance everytime I made a request of him or locking me out of the house. Please rent this first and screen it for yourself before letting any child watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy Lilo & Stitch","review":"This is a very non-Disney movie if you ask me. Besides having a very odd story line, this movie has encouraged my 3-year-old son to hit/punch/bite (because Lilo does) and use the word \\"stupid.\\" I had to hide the DVD so he can't watch it anymore. I definitely don't recommend this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great music, that's it.","review":"I assumed it would be a cute movie for my 3 year old to watch. I found the space aliens looked very much like the monsters of Monsters Inc. ,so no originality there. I also found it to be too violent and too many bad examples for young children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply Disappointed","review":"I have just seen the DVD and I can't believe that so many liked this film. The characters are very hard to like and the constant violent behavior (with no consequences) was shocking. The inconsistencies in the story really ruin it. Please rent this movie before buying it; I wouldn't have it in the house, myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISNEY!","review":"Another bad disney movie. They haven't made anything good since Tarzan. Everything since then has been terrible. Not to mention I am getting tired of disney doing their little take offs on star wars! This movie is long, boring and in need of serious re writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended!","review":"My 5-year-old was really looking forward to watching this but she'd had enough of the movie after just a few minutes, with all the spitting, nose picking and fighting scenes we found it to be a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"a love of family","review":"This movie has the best portayal of family values that I have seen in a movie. It shows the importance of staying together to achieve what is best. The only thing that I found disturbing was that the sister always seemed to be away. No wonder Lilo got into so much trouble, she really did not have very much self control. I also think that the little girls had way to mature attitudes about who could be thier friend and not it just did not seem real to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Disney movie","review":"In my opinion, Lilo & Stitch is one of Disney's better recent releases. My three-year-old son absolutely loves it. So much so that we managed to wear out our first DVD and had to buy a second one. The story is fresh and funny and the characters are quite loveable, despite the fact that many of them are aliens! I think I've seen (or heard) this movie so many times that I have most of the dialogue memorized. That said, it still remains to be funny each time it's played so it has to be good, right? I would recommend this DVD for children of any age."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful movie with a cheap packaging","review":"First off, let me say that i love this movie. It is, without a doubt, one of my tope five disney films of all time, and i am so glad that they released it in a 2 disc format. All of the extras are wonderful, and this edition is completely worth your money. My only problem is with how cheap the company was with the asthetic value of this edition. Both discs have that awfully flat grey cover, and it came with no sort of insert whatsoever. All of disney's other films seem to get the star treatment with their dvd releases, but this one just seemed to be thrown together. I still love it though anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a disappointment","review":"Yes, I was saddened by the first scenes. Lilo fights with herfriends instead of talking things out. Her relationship with her sister is scary too. There are too many \\"nice\\" movies out there. Don't waste your money. Buy a traditional family movie.Disney please go back to good family values."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney's Going Down the Tubes","review":"Okay, so Lilo & Stitch is one of their more original movies lately (as opposed to the current trend to make sequels from their classics), but it was depressing, mean-spirited and just downright sad. What does the Disney Corporation have against two parent families? Why make a movie about a monster whose sole purpose for existence is to destroy? Yes, yes, little girl tames wild beast, but come on. And the scenes with her sister were downright scary. The screaming... yes, it is rather reminiscent of many sisterly fights, but do we need to see that in a cartoon?Disney needs to go back to making the people look real. Why the exaggerated features? Look at Sleeping Beauty and Snow White and Cinderella. Why are those movies still so widely loved? Because of the absolute *artistry* contained within. That would be nice to see from Disney. Move away from the computers and get back to drawing.So, Lilo & Stitch, original, but depressing. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lilo and Stitch","review":"Lilo and Stitch is based on a little girl that just needs a friend. I think That Lilo is a little brat because she just dismissed Stitch just because he did something bad and she didn't even give him a second chance.I do not not recomend this movie to little kids.If you don't like depresing movies you shouldn't see this movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Who wants to show their kids a movie about a bunch of desperately unhappy people? Everywhere Lilo turns there are people trying to make her life miserable. Then comes Stitch from outer space, who is violent and disrespectful, and this is what is supposed to make Lilo feel like she finally \\"belongs?\\" Not only did I greatly dislike the basic plot, I also found the movie to have SO many ridiculous twists and turns it was as if the writers didn't know where to end it. Horrible from beginning to end, to end, to end..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inappropriate for young children","review":"Unless of course you think that a movie whose underlying premise and action all revolve around one alien trying to kill another one is suitable for small children. This movie starts out full of violence, and never gets better. Along the way we see bad family relations, destructive and manipulative behavior, and a pseudo-Barbie-like older sister. What's to love in this movie? Are people so hard up for something to do they love a movie that glorifies violence and hyper-activity as beloved? I was astonished to discover so many 5 star reviews and recommendations as a kid's movie. If you have small children, find something else to do, this movie will only disturb them, it doesn't have enough value to risk it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love IT","review":"I got this DVD for Christmas and I love it.

My young kids love it (31/2, 7,9,10). It is also extremely funny.

In most Disney movies, the characters are too \\"perfect\\" and \\"heroic\\" ... in this movie both Lilo and Stitch were \\"brats\\" and Lilo's sister had problems keeping her life together.By the end of the movie, all of these characters grow in some way and become better beings.I highly recommend this movie.

I am one that likes clean sounding bass rather than tons of bass with the amp turned up to 10 and it sounds like hell. I will say the reason I give this line out converter 4 stars instead of 5 is simply because when the bass of a song is a little more quiet, this converter seems not to bring out the bass as good as a deck with a built in sub out. If im listening to rap or hip hop which is full of bass this thing does great but when im listening to alternative music it seems to not pick out the bass notes too well.

I was wrong...or unlucky. In short, it was a piece of junk....such, in fact, that it almost damaged my equipment. The issue; once plugged into an amplifier this item would send a very high amplitude signal of distortion through the amp and to the speakers...so strong that it would blow fuses in my amp. So I opened it up and just grasped the circuit board with my hands to shield it...sounded great. So, I turned down the gains (on converter) and shielded all the components (homemade style). It now looked like crap but sounded better. However, certain electronics not, even plugged into the system, would cause a loud buzz when on (not a grounding issue) In sum, junk...overall build quality, laughable...I expected that at this price point, but no one should receive a product that just doesnt work.

After I installed it I attempted to make an adjustment to the gain levels and the knob broke off. I returned the part and got Amazon credit, not a credit card refund. I'm sure that the fine print told me that a return would be handled like that, just didn't seem right to me.

I was thinking that the moral of the story was going to be that you can still be nice to others, even though they are not nice to you. And that if people aren't willing to help you, you just try hard yourself and you can do ANYTHING.

For example: \\"wary of England's designs and xenophobic, the Russians outright closed Turkmenistan when they took it under control in 1881.\\" \\"...about which T.E. Lawrence might have romanticized.\\" Awkward phrasing like this is a constant throughout the book, which would be much improved with a thorough editing - perhaps in a later edition?Additionally, Kropf's lengthy descriptions of long plane flights and jet lag are for the armchair traveler rather than the road warrior.

But somehow, the idea of life as we know it ending from something that we ourselves encounter frequently and therefore seems so insignifigant-getting sick with what appears to be the common cold or the flu (except in this story the common cold isn't so common-it has a deadly twist to it, making it the Superflu) is a lot scarier than the thought of aliens attacking earth or an asteroid heading straight for us.

It has the classic struggle between good and evil tied in with an awsome group of well written charecters and plot. if you want to read a book that you can't put down till you finish read the stand cause once you start you wouldn't stop till you finish or drop.-H"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"THIS BOOK WAS SPELLBOUNDING. I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN. FROM THEFIRST WORDS UNTIL THE LAST PAGEI FELT LIKE I WAS THERE. STEPHEN KING HAS A WAY WITH WORDS TO HOLDYOU MESMERIZED IN HIS STORY. THEIDEA OF GOOD VS. EVIL IS A FASCINATINGARRAY OF HUMAN EXPERIENCES ANDMAKES FOR GREAT READING. THIS BOOKIS AWESOME. ONE I WON'T FORGET ANYTIME SOON"},{"rating":"2","title":"King's Finest","review":"The Stand explores a nightmare vision of a post-apocalyptic America and it will draw you in from the beginning. This was a book I read in three days because I could not put it down. The plot and characters are believable enough that you will be left wondering, \\"What if...?\\" for weeks.The U.S. government unintentionally releases a virus on the world that kills 99% of the human population and an empty shell of civilization is left behind for the survivors to resurrect. People are drawn to darkness, embodied by the creepy Randall Flagg, or light, embodied by a 108 year-old black woman in Nebraska, based on the deepest instincts of their souls. The conflict between these camps captures King's vision of good vs. evil in his most powerful way.Can Amazon lend me a few extra stars? I can't recommend this book highly enough with the five I have here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding and Breathtaking","review":"This was my first Stephen's King novel and I was amazed of how he uses every detail to create a believable world while you read it, some people thinks the book is too long but in my oppinion all these added details and descriptions helps to create a very rich and fluent story with very vivid and solid characters, places and actions.I just couldn't help feeling absorbed in this post-apocaliptic word, I was moved by the characters, their backstories and their fates, I've read many mangas and comics and even with the \\"advantage\\" of illustrations I can surely say that \\"The Stand\\" excited me more than any of those works."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most frighting book I have ever read!","review":"This is the most frighting book ever writein! I have never been more frighted!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book around","review":"If more people read books in this country, this one would become a classic for sure. Everything about it is good! I particularly liked how in the end he tied everything together into one. Anyone that reads this book and gives it lower than an 8 for a rating must be insane!"},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzz.......","review":"I have to aggree with the reviewer below who gave the book a \\"1\\". The only thing that kept me reading was the belief that finally something would happen -- it never did. All we get is some needlessly wordy account of people treking across the country only to find out that they have nothing to do with defeating the enemy. What a joke. It has a good premise, but fails miserably in its objective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great disription of death all around you, the smell, fear...","review":"I experienced what it would be like if I was left behind in a world, that everyone but me died. Nothing worked anymore, the smell and rotting carnage, silence, isolation, fear, and then it got worse. I wasn't alone"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!!! Highly recommended!","review":"I read The Stand many years ago, but recently my sister began reading it for the first time, so I found it on Amazon, got it for my Kindle and became reacquainted.I am so happy I did!! This book is well written, detailed and fleshed out. It's so other-world and in-my-own-backyard at the same time, and it doesn't seem so futuristic this time around. That makes it a bit more scary and nightmare provoking, but also freakishly addicting!The characters are so well developed, almost recognizable, it was sad to come to the end of the story again. It would be wonderful if Stephen King felt inspired to at least give us a peak into what the future held for Frannie and Stu!!! Hint, hint!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"Having never read a stephen King book before I was fully expecting a gruesome and/or terrifying novel from one of the premier horror writers of this generation. What I received instead was a well fleshed out post-apocalyptic novel with interesting social commentary on humanity. The book had excellent character development and slowly built up an excellent plot line. However, I was disappointed in the books climax/final ending which felt rushed and lacked umph compared to the rest of the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible read","review":"Could not put it down once I picked it up. This story had me from the very beginning, and kept me with its incredible tale. I loved the struggle between good vs. evil, and the fight for post apocolypic earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic","review":"People seem to behave in unrealistic and incomprehensible ways in this book. America's population is virtually destroyed, and people are wandering around aimlessly, in a daze. If this happened in real life, there would be an infinite amount of food, living spaces, vehicles, reading material, and bathrooms. Why is it that people are always walking so much? Why don't they find cars with dead people in them, take out the dead people, and drive? They can get nice Sports Cars! Why do people have to go to the bathroom? There are tons of places to go. Why do people seem to eat junkfood, when there are tons of restaurants and tons of abandoned grocery stores. And why do people bicker about nonsense? Why do people sleep outside when there are tons of available, abandoned houses? The book does not seem to make much sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pop-culture rewrite of The Lord of the Rings","review":"Stephen King is no J.R.R. Tolkien, nor should he try to be.I gave this book one star because Amazon does not offer an option for zero.One final note: Read chapter 25 of So Long and Thanks For All the Fish by Douglas Adams, and you'll have a pretty good understanding of King's writing style. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Much too long and much too boring....","review":"Stephen King is a master of suspense, but for whatever reason he decided to leave his trademark out of this apocalyptic 'masterpiece.'I'm not sure what all the hype is about with this novel. I found it much too long and anti-climactic. The character development is extensive and wonderful, but if I had to read about one more commitee meeting I was going to throw the book out the door. Near the book's end I was ready for them all to die just so the story would stop.The great parts of this book were much too few and far between to justify the length. In the end I understood why his editors cut it down. I had much more fun reading Salem's Lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Price is out of sight","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read but the price is rediculously high. No one is going to pay $40.00 for this e-book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I won't give too much info of the book but Chapter 58 really MADE ME MAD. One of THE main characters, I won't say his name (he was introduced in Chapter 9) DIES before the climax even started. A character, that we spent over 400 + pages reading about, just dies like that. WHAT THE HELL? Who cares if that woman (Starts with an S) dies, or the others, but HIM?!?!? He was my favorite character and he died like a sucka! This dude was a VERY important character... I just wasted 200-400 pages on a character that dies before the climax even starts.... :( King should've left out (him) so we don't have to waste 200 pages on him. ARGHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If he would've died, AT LEAST in honor or something, or near the end, I wouldn't be so mad. But he does when there is only 260 (+) pages left?!?!??!? WHAT THE FUGG??!??!?!?!?I gave it a 2 instead of one star because up until Chapter 58, the book was fugging great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"$ 40.00 ???","review":"Are you kindding me ? Kindle download of this book is $40.00. Never ever will I pay that much to download a book to my Kindle. I love this book want to read it again but not at that price !"},{"rating":"1","title":"King Fails this time","review":"The Shining is his masterpiece.This novel falls way short of that.Ive read most of Kings published works.This novel starts off great,lots of death,destruction and action.A Plague,dead bodies every where- total anarchy.A twisted pyromaniac who burns entire towns to the ground.People breaking into germ warfare buildings-guns murder and suspense.Thats the first three hundred pages- some of his best writing.The next 900 pages are strait out of a Doonesbury comic book- hippies in Colorodo.Town meetings- free love- guitars and the old black woman they worship as a prophet. This book is obviously 800 pages too long.The Shining is his best book- this is not. I cant believe the reviews on this site that say this is his best book!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not King's best, but gosh it's good!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The characters were very well developed with tons of multiple plots that eventually wind together at some point in the book. The beginning pages were frightening because the plague could actually happen. The rest bepends on your religion. It is definately worth the 1000+ pages of reading, though it did get a little slow about page 500, but it picks up once again at page 800. If I were King, though, I would not have included the last three pages because it seems to let you down once you finished. For those of you who haven't read it, DON'T READ the last two or three pages. That was my only big problem with the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"King's most overrated novel","review":"I've never understood why The Stand is held in such high regard. It is not very original; it is way too long; it is boring; the characters, for the most part, are not interesting; and it has the worst anti-climax of any of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the 5 greatest books I've ever read.","review":"I'm not a big King fan, but this book is great. A cross between 'The Lord Of The Rings', 'The Martian Chronicles' and 'The Andromeda Strain'. I really loved the classic confrontation between good and evil. God and Satan somehow make sense to me now, and they both seem to live in the mind of Stephen King."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Read","review":"This book is simply a classic. I'd recommend it to anyone. Don't be put off by the size of the book, you'll wish it was longer! I am an avid reader of many genres, but I still re-read this book about once a year (I've read it about 15 times so far). The \\"what if \\" factor is still relevant after all these years. It is a fine story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kings characters are outstanding","review":"The characters in this novel are built up with a strength that only stephen king could pull off. Although it's not my favorite king novel, it is right up there with the best of them. Haven't seen the movie yet and don't think i ever will. I've heard that it doesn't even come close to the magic that the novel has produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battle between good and evil.","review":"I really enjoyed this book because as in most of Stephen King's I couldn't put it down. The story took you from saddness to hope and faith in the ability of people being able to begin again. It touched on all facits of human feelings and fears and left you with hope that good will win in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Novel","review":"If you're looking for hours of reading, this is it. I wouldn't say it's the best Stephen King novel, but the fact is, he's an amazing writer so it's still a 4/5. The only let-down with this book is that some of the main characters described in the novel are a little lame. It's difficult for me to describe what I mean without quoting. Let's just say some of the characters are hokey or corny. I hope that's a correct description. It's still worth reading because it's a great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over Tme","review":"I first read this book as a junior in high school. I am now 50 years old. I read this book, the uncut version, of course, at least once every other year. It is just as good (and maybe even more relevant) now that it was when I first read it. I cannot recommend this book highly enough.If you have seen the \\"movie,\\" please don't let that stop you from reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his best ever!","review":"Out of all the books he has written, this is the one I read most often. Uncut version is the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"too long, too perverted, bad ending","review":"I did't dislike all of this book. The first, oh, 400 pages in which King describes Captain Trips, the virus that wipes out the human race, was very entertaining. From then on a long, drawn out saga in which every possible phallic event or symbol has to be brought to the reader's attention ensues. I found I cared nothing for the characterss, i found the story ridiculously unbelievable and I thought the ending was a rip-off due to a lack of creativity from King. I like King's work, most notably \\"apt pupil\\" and \\"it\\", but this one's a loser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, Boring, and Bloated","review":"I would have given this book only one star except I have too much respect for the author. My first problem with the book is that on Kindle I could only purchase the extended version, which is just absurdly long. There is a reason why books are edited!. For a book with such an intense subject ( a man-made plague that descimates 99% of the population)it is surprisingly mundane at times. A good example is how much space is given to forming an ad hoc committee and whether those people should be on the permanant committee. I mean come on! this is what we discuss at my bicycle club meetings!. While they are discussing whether Harold should be on the committee, hundreds of bodies are rotting in the streets. It just seems too unbelievable. Books this long should be sagas that span years if not generation, not a couple of months in the summer. The time you spend reading this book is certainly not worth the payoff in the end. Sorry Stephen :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest cop-out ending ever","review":"I haven't ever had much luck getting through a King book, even the short ones. But I tackled this one because the premise was intriguing (Plague? I'm so there!) and I heard that it was his greatest book. It started out fine and I was feeling pretty good about it. Since I live in Vermont, it was nice to have local places mentioned during the survivors' trip west and the \\"local character\\" was spot-on. It doesn't happen often! But by the 2/3rds point, I wondered if it was ever going to end, and the subplot of The Kid & The Trashcan Man were indescribably dull. Despite that, I'd probably still have given the book 3 stars but for the utterly CRAPTASTIC cop-out ending. I wish I'd read spoilers, because if I'd known that the seemingly invincible Walkin' Dude would be eliminated in such a feeble manner, I wouldn't have bothered picking it up in the first place. With this book, I've given up on King. Long or short, his books ain't for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book in the whole wide world!","review":"This book is amazing! It's like a very long adventure you can't bear to put down. There were a few paragraphs here and there that I had to skim out of boredom, I will admit, but it was only so I could get on to the rest of it. The characters are so alive and so easy to identify with, you can almost see your neighbors in their places. It's such an intricate book, it draws you in to its world. The ending deflates the rest of the book, and in this case, the means justifies the end but it sure is worth it. The movie wasn't too bad, but the book is much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"This has to be one of the most overrated books of all time. There was absolutely no suspense, it was filled with mostly forgettable characters, and it was way too long. I found myself rooting for no one and wishing the book would just end. And end it did, with a big thud. I could not bring myself to despise Flagg, since so little of the story focused on him and and his amazing power. Instead, we have four dull characters headed for Vegas in search of evil. Ultimately, it fails as both a plot driven book and a character study. Laws yes, what a long, dull, pointless pile of trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"I agree with another reviewer. The beginning was good. Then it just gets lost in an extremely unoriginal \\"good vs. evil\\" storyline. Boring characters gather on each side, and then a lot of them die for no clear reason. And of course, good triumphs in one of the lamest endings I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Stand","review":"Having read the book, twice! I thought that maybe the film would be worth a view. Well it does but I doubt I shall ever watch it again. It follows the book quite closely but the final third loses its facination, probably because up to then you feel that there is some sort of 'maybe it could happen' surrounding it. Like the book it then descends into some sort of God and the Devil fight which is fine if you like that sort of thing but if you don't, well don't buy it. I put up with it in the book but it didn't transfer to the screen very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"The Stand was great. The charactors were believable, as if they were people you know in your own life. Stephen King is a master of charactorization, I'm guessing there is at least 300 charactors in the story alone. Don't be intimidated by the 1,000+ pages, it reads very fast. In a few years, The Stand will be read in English classes and be considered one of the best novels on the late 1900's."},{"rating":"2","title":"M-O-O-N","review":"The Stand is Stephen King writing at his best. Mr. King has demonstrated a writer's clinic when it comes to so many well-developed characters in this one book. His description of the plague makes it the perfect \\"diet\\" book. As in one can never eat while reading certain portions of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Stand\\", A New Way To Think About \\"What If\\"","review":"I read this book more times than I care to admit! It is by far, one of my favorite books! I have 3 copies,one of each issue released, and a duplicate issue of the first one released! I highly recommend this book! It made me think!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the longest (and greatest!) books you'll read...","review":"What an epic. What a masterpiece! While this novel might take a while to get through, it's totally worth the effort because you get to know the characters very well and fall in love with them. A good \\"apocalypse\\" story about what happens when a disease kills 99% of the world's population, and a few thousand are left to re-create society. Very eerie, especially during the parts where some of the characters are wandering through the empty cities. Makes you glad to be surrounded by people!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic book - but the \\"cut\\" version is better","review":"this will sound like heresy, i'm sure, but the \\"cut\\" version is better except for some of the added scenes where we see civilization collapsing during the superflu. the rest of the original material really should have been deleted. score one for the editors! that being said, the stand is one of the standards against which all other PA novels should be judged. it has a strong cast of characters. you grow very close to them, even the bad guys. this book starts off nicely and then accelerates hard all the way to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloated","review":"This book was a gift and my first Stephen King novel. The man can write and, at times, he can deliver some brilliant sentences constructed so simply, yet powerful. His characters in The Stand are a little too predictable and become instant stereotypes, like bad After School Special heroes and villians. About half way through I thought, My God, where's a good editor when you need one? I haven't used my speed reading in a long time, but it came in handy with the severely bloated text. Probably would have been a much more enjoyable journey at about half the pages and some characters that didn't come off as templated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh-oh....King has become infected","review":"It wasn't even that King isn't a great author-I love most of his other works, but this one was more of a confused jumble, mixing too many characters with too many differences for you to care about what happened to any of them. The heros whine and whine until you just want them to die. The villains were more interesting. Flagg was, as the other reviews said, pathetic, but villains such as the Kid and Llyod kept the story interesting. Best of all were the parts with the most interesting character, the 'Trash Can' man. Least interesting were the meaningless parts with Frannie and Stu. Many parts of this book are extremely overbloated, the characters are introduced and killed too quickly, and the good characters don't appear much. On the other hand, the villains will keep you rooting for the evil one. How truly sad. If you've read King before, don't read this one, but if you haven't, go ahead and read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, maybe even a classic, but not among King's best","review":"I'm going out on a limb and only giving this four stars because I really don't think it's one of King's best. It is still a really good book, and I dig the whole post-apocalyptic wasteland thing he's got going on. The book even has the makings of a classic, since it's sort of an epic showdown between good and evil, but overall I think it's a little drawn out and boring. The characters are quite well developed and likeable, however, and this is one of the stronger points of the book. I still recommend this book, though I don't think it's King at his best. Avery Z. Conner, author of \\"Fevers of the Mind\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephen King's \\"Andromeda Strain\\"","review":"Michael Crichton's \\"Andromeda Strain\\" has nothing on this book. While Crichton isolates a few scientists and infects a town, King shows us views of a man-made appocalypse. The scope of this story is incredible and has tie-ins with other stories, such as the \\"Dark Tower\\" series. The only real problem I had with this book is that we wait for hundreds of pages only to find that everything is wrapped up too quickly, and there is the final eternal denouement, at which point I wanted to drop the book. (I had the ending, why read so much more after?) While the ending held less interest for me than the first half, I feel this is one of Stephen King's best writings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extra material unnecessary.","review":"I'd read the original stand when I was 11 and loved it. A few years later I read this and it wasn't nearly as good. The extra material is unnecessary, and subtracts from an otherwise compelling story. The epilogue has the sole purpose of tying in with other parts of Stephen King's books (Randall Flagg = Richard Fannin). Read the original and save some time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Higher your standards and read!!!","review":"This book is like Ali, the greatest! Stephen King's characters are so well described and analyzed that while I was reading I started to believe that Larry Underwood is a real singer, that Nick Andros is a real mute hitchhicker traveling somewhere in America. I just started reading leisurely and I am afraid that there is no other book that can compare with The Stand. The miniseries was fine but the complete and uncut novel is a non stop read even if you are not an avid reader. Also recommended by King: The Running Man."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good start to Stephen King","review":"I asked my friend which Stephen King book he'd recommend if he had to read just one and he suggested this. My first King read was LONG but NEVER boring. I loved how he took me all over the USA, which would probably appeal most to travelers like me who've been there and could visit again in their minds. Excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TEN STARS!","review":"I agree, you either love this book or hate it, and I LOVE IT! I especially enjoyed the religious overtone of the book and the unusual way King handled Randall Flagg and the other characters. I too wondered what happened to the rest of the world (aside from the US), but it didn't ruin the book for me. (Of course I live in the US, so...)By the way, the movie wasn't half bad either...for a movie <grin>. I saw it first and then bought the book. I'd never done that before."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME BOOK!","review":"i love this book! its soo good! the characters are interesting and as engrossing as the plot. ive read lots of king's novels and this is one of his best. all these people are talking about how long it is and all that, but i think they must be pretty stupid. dont they realize that its UNCUT and UNEDITED! this was meant to be a descriptive novel. if they didnt want a long one, they should have read the edited one. im so glad i read this one though 'cuz i got to meet 'The Kid'. haha he was so funny. all in all this book is awesome and u HAVE to read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding despite some awkward writing","review":"There's some sappy narration here and King's annoying penchant for dropping pop culture references into his train of thought, but his imagination has never been more vivid than in this near- exhausting adventure. Perhaps the best end of the world story in 20th popular fiction, it's filled with a boat load of memorable characters. (Tom Cullen the mentally challenged man with the mind of a child remains my favorite). Stick with the longer 1000 plus page rewrite for more depth and insight into the cast's motives. You won't easily forget this entertaining and often overly wicked epic. For a large book, the story moves quite fast, tho' you may want to savour the experience over a satisfying two week stretch, to really let it sink into you. An amazing piece of work in what should be just a mindless genre..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am drawn into ...","review":"The characters/people in this story(which could really happen) draw my attention. The involvement of each character/person only makes it seem more realistic. The thoughts of each individual make this book a story onto it's own!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Arguably King's best work to date. Though 1100+ pages may seem daunting, the storyline with its intriguing characters will keep you glued to it until the end. King describes his characters with such detail and life, it seems almost sad when one of them dies. On top of all this, the whole superflu and good vs. evil conflict makes this book worth the time and the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"So very long... so very good...","review":"I have come to love long novels... Ken Follet's are my favorite, but I was interested in the premise of The Stand so I thought I'd take a look. I have not been a Stephen King reader (aside from Misery some 20 years ago). It is so very easy to see why King is such a successful author... his characters are compelling and his writing is impeccable. While I think many-- myself included -- shy away because they aren't \\"horror\\" people... this is a novel I would recommend to my mother. So very tender in places, while filled with action in others. True, there is a great deal of detail in this 1300+ page book, but it's well worth the journey and will leave you thinking \\"what if\\" questions during and afterward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long.","review":"Several people insisted that I give this book a shot. Well, I did and man, I'm disappointed. I'm not a huge King fan to begin with and this read did not improve my opinion on his works.I found The Stand to be long and well... dull. I didn't enjoy it all that much. I know I'm totally in the minority with this review, but that's just how I honestly felt about The Stand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute crap","review":"I'd go into a long erudite discussion of this book, but it isn't necessary. The 1979 novel originally penned by a great author has been pissed on by somebody, I certainly hope it wasn't Stephen King himself. This book is putrid; it stinks.\\"The Stand\\" in its original format was a brilliant book, written by a genius. The version offered here is a piece of cheap trash unworthy of toilet paper. Do NOT, under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES buy this book.Other critics have mentioned the shortcomings of this version in ways I can't improve on. Stephen King is one of our century's greatest authors, \\"The Stand\\" is one of his greatest books. This edition is absolute crap. Go to ABE Books, buy the original and enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A review for those of you that saw the mini-series first","review":"** I qualify this review for those that have seen the mini-series first **I became interested in the book after seeing the mini-series. While I think that the book version is much better than the movie, as I do with most book-movie conversions, I feel that the book was spoiled for me by previous encounter with the story.This is a LONG book. I'm used to long books, but this one has been the longest because I already knew the story. While I did plod through the whole book, from start to finish, I have to say that it takes a strong will and a lot of patience to do so. I don't think it was worth the effort.If you haven't seen the mini-series, then I wholeheartedly recommend this book to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long live the King","review":"What a great book. I wish I had read this ages ago but the thickness of it had me nervous. But wow what long strange wonderful trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good begining that fails to deliver in the end","review":"After reading the raving reviews given by otherreaders, I must give another side to the story. King's book starts out wonderfully, a disease (Captain Trips) runs rampant throughout the world. Though after the disease runs its course, Stephen King was not able to continue in the course of a good science fiction, he turns to mystical powers and magic to finish his story. The Stand would have been much scarier if there was no magic and based solely on the aftermath and rebuilding of society after the disease. The use of mysticism in his stories only exposes his weakness as a writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book for anyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I've been reading Stephen King novels for a few months or so, and they are great. Normally Mr. King's trademark of writing is his ability to make you turn a night light on. When I read The Stand I learned that Stephen King isn't filled with demented thoughts of evil demons, but actually a tale of grief and Christianity. Mr. King touches me so much in his novels. In the Shining he scared me out of my wits and in It I couldn't stand to see a clown(in my moms bedroom the doorstop is a clown). The Stand made me very sad and put me on the verge of tears(ive never cried in my life except as a baby) when Larry Underwood and Ralph made that heroic speech, then when they died from the Atomic Bomb. This is a gripping page turner please read this book whatever you do."},{"rating":"2","title":"An All-time classic of the genre","review":"The first time I read this, I laughed for so long I almost brought up lunch. The second time I read this, 20 years later, it made me cry. That probably says more about me than the book, but this is one great epic novel about surviving through an unimaginable apocalyptic cataclysm. This is a book that only Stephen Kind could write, in a way that only he could write. One of the absolute classics of the twentieth century, and it should be required reading in every school in the United States."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE STAND (The Complete & Uncut Edition)","review":"THE STAND is one of the best books I have ever read by Stephen King. The story is about a super-flu epidemic that is wiping out half of the world population and there are only a few survivors left. The survivors become seperated into two groups: one group is led by a gentle old woman named Mother Abigail, and the other group is led by an evil figure who calls himself Randall Flagg. Soon, the story turns into a classic battle between good and evil. Well that's all I want to give away for now, be sure to check out \\"The Complete & Uncut Edition\\" of THE STAND, because that's the only way to read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An epic","review":"Let me just start off by saying that I'm an avid Stephen King fan. I've loved all of his books up to Rose Madder, everything after that just went down hill.I've read that some don't believe that this is his best work. I have to disagree. This was the first book of his that I read. I couldn't put it down. I was hooked from the first page. I love the plot line, the battle between good and evil. Each character through out the book was somehow linked together by dreams by a woman who none of them knew other than through their dreams.I only gave it four stars because I believe that King overdoses me on description. I like some things to be left up to the reader's imagination.I highly recommend this as a first King book to anyone who has yet to read one of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thriller Masterpiece","review":"Even though this book is reaaaaaaaaally long, I'm glad it was. It built up incredible drama and conflict that made me cheer for the good guy and hope for the worst for the bad guy. It's nothing less than a triumph...it's like I knew all of the characters as I know my friends. It's an epic saga that spans every human emotion, which made it interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Holds Up & Entertains","review":"I read the original version of The Stand in the early 80's and re-read it several times since. In fact, I credit it with initiating a life-long fascination with apocalyptic/post-apocalyptic fiction. This review refers to the updated and expanded edition put out in the late 80's and specifically the Gramercy - Modern Classics edition. I have to admit that I most enjoy the first third of the novel that covers Captain Trips and the human race's virtual elimination. Certainly, the good versus evil stand-off King envisions is entertaining especially as both sides re-organize and re-arm but the folksy religious aspect is not my cup of tea. Having said that, overall it is an incredible tale especially with the 400+ added pages in this version. I do wish King would do a sequel to see how the survivors are getting on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't let the length get you the book is worth reading twice","review":"Not his first, but his best. A definite work of fiction art. The book is based on an event that could wipe out the entire population. A book of this kind has not every been compared to, but the closest was The Andromeda Strain by Michael Crichton back in the sixties. Have you read the entire King collection? I have, and I say that this is the best one. This is a book that brings out the struggle of man versus beast (yes a common used conflict with King) like no other book has. If you enjoy nights of unending pleasure given to you from a vast collection of personalities twisted into a story that King would have to applaude, then I could recommend no better book. Not for everyone, but is any book? But I have a feeling that this book is for you"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very slooooowww moooving...zzzzzzzzzz!","review":"I read the very first version of this book, and thought it was long. Especially when it took me 3 months to get through it. I kepted putting it down because it was so boreing in many parts. Then I found out he added more to an already to long book. I thought there is no way I'm going to read this book again just to see what other tripe he added. He should have gotten rid of the first two-thirds of the book and keep the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best i have ever read","review":"although it has been many years since i read \\"The Stand\\" it remains to this day, one of the best I have ever read.

DAVE SMITH"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book by Stephen King","review":"Three years ago I bought this book, now after reading it over and over again (each time captivating) also by taking it on all my trips. The paperback book is very worn out and bent. If this keeps going I will have to buy anougher copy soon. If any Stephen King fan has not read it you have missed a reading experience of a lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book and favorite movie in two words: The Stand","review":"My favorite book and favorite movie in two words: The Stand. Romance, Action, Prophecy, Horror, Suspense. There was nothing this book didn't have. I loved how it showed the reality of how Americans would react to an epidemic. I auplaude Rob Lowe, Gary Sinise, Molly Ringwald, Ruby Dee and Bill Faggerbakke for their best pieces of work. The book had over 1000 pages, fitting the movie's 6 hours. The book, was of course better and it IS King's best work."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZzzzzzzzzz....","review":"I confess to being a King fan, god knows there are enough of us about so it isn't shameful, but in this case I find myself having to say....... Oi! Stephen, NO! The book is overlong,(Apparently it was originally less of a handful but Stephen decided not to leave well enough alone) and, although it at first seems promising with a good initial premise, it rapidly descends into an overextended yawn-fest. Do we really need to know the history and motivations of every sub-character who has even a peripheral involvement in the main plot? After it's promising start I was disappointed to discover that the book dissolves into a cliched battle between good and evil. Stephen can do much better than this, If you don't believe me try reading The Shining or Christine."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am a Spider Robinson Fan","review":"....I also like Stephen King too. His short stories scare me, the novels tend to end with the reader hanging. Much in the same way The Stand does. you thought you were done with Randdel Flag when the bomb goes off, but he comes back.I read The Stand, i watched the mini series, yet, as one revewer said \\"it leaves you underwhelmed at then end\\". The end of the world sounds like a great story. unfortunately it is the begining of the story and that lead to some great promise. I have never seen Stephen King go downhill from a begining that strong before.Don't get me wrong, it is still a great book and there is great charactor development in it. just he climaxed early and then went flat.If you want a great book that will leave you hanging until the end, Read Needful Things, by King"},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic","review":"I have read this book several times, and never get tired of it. The story is epic, the characters well-developed, and the vision frightening. There is a lot of religious elements, and that might annoy some, but I think it works without being overly-preachy. The story holds up today in our bird flu/SARS/swine flu-obsessed culture. One of King's best, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"His Best. No Question.","review":"This is King's best work, full stop. I have read and re-read it from the time I was a teenager, and was thrilled to buy the \\"complete and uncut\\" version pretty much the instant it became available---and love that version even more. It's a true epic and succeeds on so many levels I can't even begin to describe them. Buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the original version but...","review":"I thought the Original Stand was a great book. Then I read the unedited copy.Yikes.This is the reason editors were invented.As an example, the scene with Trashy and Elvis-guy and a gun. And a violation. Seriously?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum","review":"I've heard of Stephen King for years but I never read any of his books because Horror books are not my cup of tea. But when I discovered he had written a book dealing with surviving after the population of earth had been reduced by almost 98 percent, I knew I had to read it. But first I read the reviews on Amazon.Com and found it appears a large number of readers loved it and an almost even number of readers hated it. I decided I would read it and make up my own mind. Had I not read the reviews I would have quit reading it around chapter 3. But I FORCED myself to finish the book. Boring boring boring. I am presently reading Swan Song and hope it deals with the subject better than King. Very disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"Well to be honest, I'm a big scardy cat so I usually stay away from horror and thus Stephen King. However, after reading The Passage by Justin Cronin and the recommendations of others I was quite excited to read The Stand. Oh, how I wish I had not bothered. The constant referrals to songs and poetry, lots of drivel about too many characters... I just couldn't follow the story and where the plot was taking me. I have always finished a book I set out to read... I just can't finish this one. It's a shame but 3 days of reading and wondering to myself \\"this has got to go somewhere soon!\\" just got too much. Oh we'll not too long until The Twelve arrives. I can wait until then ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I read the same book as everyone else???","review":"I read this in its entirety, and all I can say is I hated it. First of all, the book is way too long, and unlike \\"It\\", progresses at a slow, boring pace. Also unlike \\"It\\", the ending is entirely predictable, so I had to read through 800 pages just to reach a conclusion I already knew would happen. Of course, if you're the sort of person who likes predictable endings, then by all means buy this book. If you're more into edge-of-your-seat excitement, steer clear of \\"The Stand\\". Read \\"The Mist\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWWWN","review":"I could not finish this book. I got to 800 or so and simply could not go any further it was dragging on and on. I still do not understand how people can find this book so wonderful, nor Stephen King. I like very few of his books but if you insist on reading his work I reccomend The Green Mile or The Regulators (written as Richard Bachman)"},{"rating":"1","title":"have not received the order to rate","review":"I am very dissapointed with Amazon because as of today I have not received this order. I am told another is on the way, but have not received it yet. this was a christmas present for my dad, which he did not get. I have ordered before and never had a problem. Very upsetting."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Price","review":"I was looking forward to buying this book once it was available...but I find the cost of this book to be too expensive. WHY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Have Been Great","review":"I haven't read the original version, only the expanded one, so maybe my thoughts are one track...but...after many years, I finally picked up a copy of this and after hearing many good things, was looking forward to it. I was very disappointed. The novel started well, I liked the descriptions of the spread of the plague, etc. Very scary.But then it pretty much fell apart. Most of the characters weren't likable, especially some of the main ones like Fran, etc. The main powers, Mother Abigal and Randy Flagg, where extrememly boring and anti-climactic. I can't see how Flagg is often referred to as the \\"best villain in Kings stories.\\" He was nothing. And the climax of the book....yawn.Overall this was a very long book that had potential, but then basically went nowhere. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bowl-Shaking","review":"I decided to create an account strictly for the purpose of writing this review. I probably will never use the account for any other purpose, but this is worth it.The book was phenomenal. I read it so long ago, but the intense fear I experience just from seeing the cover art is a testimony to classical conditioning.Read it. That's my only review. Forget the other comments, just trust me and read this book. The scene where Stu is running in the empty hospital hallways is like a white light seared unto the back of my eyelids, like a barely remembered nightmare.Please read it. In fact, when I get home, I'm going to read it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deus Ex Machina","review":"Great story...until the end. I feel cheated.Look up \\"Deus Ex Machina.\\" I think the term ought to be changed to \\"The Stand.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"It's more addictive than a drug","review":"I spent roughly a week gorging myself on this book. I was completely unable to put it down. I was so addicted that I went without sleep. This book pulls out that \\"What if I was the last person on earth?\\" thought that we've almost all had and puts it on paper. You know what you want each charachter to do and you have ideas and you want things to happen a certain way but King makes it better than you could imagine. It's a must read for ANY psuedo-SciFi person or heavy thinker. It's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best book I ever read","review":"the stand is the most powerfull novel I ever read it has everything horor drama action religion and above all moral, the ultimate question we all have to ask ourselfs what would we do when judgement day will come how do we act, and stephane king brings up those question in a way that only he can."},{"rating":"2","title":"This IS my favorite book","review":"Its not that it is absolutely the best written book I have every read, or that it is literary genius that a Harvard book club would enjoy. It is because it is an amazing creative story. It sucks you in, it makes you care for the characters, it truly makes you want to stay up through the night to get through another character."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Definitive King book","review":"What can I say that other's haven't said, in this book he show's all his strengh's as and author, his brillant character devolopment, his awsome story telling. People complain about how long some of King's books are, but when you write a story like this and he creates characters that are close to actually being alive and not just on paper, you need some room to work with. King delivers and K.O. with this book, King's stand alone novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"GET THE REGULAR VERSION","review":"Unless you're a fan of King's overembellishment, this release is a complete waste of time. If you're a die-hard King fan, I highly recommend it. If you're a casual reader of his works (like me), who is constantly annoyed by the extra 300 pages that always seem to come after the point any other writer would stop writing, just get the regular version"},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen up insomniacs out there...","review":"I'll admit that this book started out interesting, but then it quickly turned into one of the most effective methods for putting me to sleep. The book was WAY TOO LONG. The characters were utterly lame and stupid. The plot was profoundly unimaginative and uninspired. This 1100+ paged book was so shockingly lame that I fell 100 pages short of finishing it -I simply couldn't do it. If it weren't for The Dark Tower series, I would never have bought another Stephen King book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another battle of good vs. evil","review":"Surprise, Surprise. I am once again dissapointed by one of Stephen King's so called \\"books\\". It is my opinion that while Stephen King may have some good ideas, he's just not a very good writer. The Stand began well; portraying a very possible scenario of a government mistake in a bio-chemical lab. It decimated the Earth's population, leaving only one percent remaining. It is after this epidemic however that the story goes down hill with the introduction of the Terror Element. The story Climaxes at the beginning, has a barely tolerable middle, and comes to a screeching halt at the end. Please Mr. King, spare us more of this crap. Just stop writing or give your ideas to someone who knows what thier doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the Turtleback \\"Library\\" binding","review":"It's a decent enough hard cover binding, but it's the size of a mass market paperback. If you were expecting a full sized book like you would find in an actual library, this isn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"King's best \\"long\\" book.","review":"The Stand was without a doubt the best of King's 1000+ page books, even better than It. The characters were well fleshed out, the description of their dreams were incredible, and it had a frighfully insightful view into what evil is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could have been 5 Stars","review":"The Uncut version of The Stand was so King could put back in a chunk of writing about Trashcan Man. All 80 pages of it. There was a reason it was cut in the first place. What was he thinking about re-adding that in? ugh!But leaving that part out, it is a wonderfull story with great characters that keeps you flipping a few pages ahead to see who the next chapter is about. I was however dissapointed in the end. The long journey the main characters take was basically pointless as we are cheated out of a true climax to this battle between good and evil.Still, I would recomend anyone to read this story, there's a little something in there for everybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"An All-Time Favorite","review":"When I first read this book, I struggled through the first two-hundred pages. It depressed me, it made me hate it, and I kept fighting to just stop reading it. Only a good friend pushing me got me to continue past the hate. I've read this book a dozen times, I've bought it several times, given it away, shared it, had it stolen, and now it's finally on my Kindle where it'll stay forever. It's a book that fits many moods, because it allows me to be macabre and morbid, indulge in my end-of-the-world fantasies when I want to, yet it always ends on hope. The quintessential King experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite","review":"This is my favorite Stephen King novel. It has a bit of everything. My paper copy has been read so many times and is dog eared and taped together. I'm so excited to have this on my Kindle now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read","review":"The story starts off like science fiction but turns into fantasy/horror. I love science fiction but knowing Stephen King's reputation for horror, I can't say I was surprised.I've taken away a star because I would have liked the change to have been more subtle. It's almost like the book was written by 2 people - a science fiction writer who wrote the first half and then turned it over to a fantasy/horror writer to finish it off.But I've given this 4 stars because it is well written and it certainly did entertain me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing but incredible","review":"This book was so fascinating and great. It just makes you think about what you would really do and which side you would be on. I love mind stimulating pieces and this is definately one of those. I really suggest this piece of work if you want to be intruiged too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of his best","review":"Unless you are a die-hard Stephen King fan, this book is not for you. I found this book to be way too long. Although, to the King fan, this book is the typical. My favourite books by this author are CUJO, The Dead Zone and Misery; with Misery being my all-time fave !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"During the times when the world seems to be going crazy it is good to have a story that takes you to a world where nothing exist but a few people who can restart the world, so to speak. King let's us know that in his mind anyway there is a place where a child can play in the street without the worry of being kidnapped.I personally felt that mother Abigale was the hero of this story. She helped to bring the good people together and defeat the evil forces of the world. I only wish I had a mother Abigale to turn to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely an American masterpiece of fiction","review":"I first read _The Stand_ when in high school and make it a point to reread it every year. Many factors combine to make this \\"Kingly\\" book a masterpiece. The characters, so well developed and fully realized , and the plot, semmingly complex as each characters life comes together and entwines, and brilliantly simple as well, the classic battle between good and evil, make this book riveting . However, I find that one of King's most overlooked accomplishments is his use of dialog. His charcacters speak in the real rythyms of our everyday language and each word is true to that character. It is almost as if King is a psychiatrist/psychologist as well as a gifted writer. While reading a King book, particularly _The Stand_, I feel as if I have actually entered that dimension, that reality. If you have not read King, I urge you to start with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his best.","review":"I fell in love with this book 20 years ago and I have re-read it many times since then. Its classic King, you have a bunch of ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. Full of lovable (and not-so-lovable) characters that are the corner stone for King's novels. And just enough creeps to satisfy.I look forward to reading it again and again..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece from a Master.","review":"This is the largest book I've ever read. I was hooked from page one and finished it in 7 days. Thanks for a great read, Stephen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two runs at The Stand","review":"It starts a little slow, so it took me two tries to actually read it. To date, it is the longest book I've ever read and my favorite. The movie was good, but it left out huge chunks of memorable story -- Fran Goldsmith's diary is a prime example."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!","review":"At my school we are required to read a book every 9 weeks. I picked the complete and uncut version of The Stand. I am 13 years old and many of my friends didn't think I could do it. I proved them wrong! It took me about 6-7 weeks of off-and-on reading to finish. I absolutly loved The Stand. I really admire King's style of writing, and would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stand By this Book","review":"I would have thought that a novel this long could become tedious. Admittedly, anyone who is not an eager reader will find it to be a difficult read. But do persist.Whether you enjoy Stephen King or not will not particuarly matter, as this novel is not King style at all. It offers a realism not usually featured in Kings outrageous novels, a realism that makes you stop and think. Itproduces character you will really love or really hate, and is overall a satisfying read. It might take take youa year to read, or in my case, a month. But eitehr way,when you get to the end, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!!! I couldn't put it down","review":"I highly recommend this book. The plot was incredibly gripping and the characters were wonderfully developed. I found myself truly emotionally invested in the characters of The Stand...almost as if they were real-life acquaintances. Some people complain that the book is too long and drawn out, but I couldn't put it down and finished it in under a week...and I was left wanting more. A truly excellent book!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG I love this story!","review":"This is certainly King's best book, as far as I'm concerned. He brings together vivid characters into realistic settings. The ending used to bother me. It was convenient, and perhaps a little contrived, but I read it again recently, and I have to say, it fits perfectly. Any other ending would not have worked, because, at it's heart, this is a battle between good and evil.This is on my keeper shelf for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Might as well be called Apocalypse Now.","review":"This is the most compelling and convincing depiction of an apocalyptic scenario ever rendered in the form of popular fiction. The wonder of it is King's ability to populate his bleak landscape with deeply realized and utterly human characters whose fates the reader truly cares about. It's epic horror, all right, but it's more than that. It's a kind of modern myth that belongs in any collection of end of days writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading for sure.","review":"I got this in the Kindle version, and am very happy with the book. I consider it a book that is hard to put down. The characters are what make the book so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"My name is Vivienne and I am a Stand-aholic","review":"I read the Stand for the first time about 18 years ago. It remains my most favorite piece of literature. I am an avid reaader with a verocious appetite for the macabre. The Stand is the perfect recipe for my imagination. It has everything...romance, action,fear of the known and unknown, love that heals, jealousy, every emotion known to man. What I enjoyed most was man's ability to overcome and survive. It definitely left me wanting for more so I've now read the original version 5 times and the uncut version about 3 times. I was reading it once a year until a friend commented that she thought I might be hooked on it. I went cold turkey and stopped reading it. Now I just watch the miniseries!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OH MAN!!!","review":"The stand is the BEST book in the universe! You can't have a better story than this: deep, strong and complete. The people who are saying that King can't write surely have not read this one. Every fan of the King must have this book. The caracters were so alive that i can still remember their names (it's true that I've read it five times!) If you want a book, a good one, pick this one and you won't be sorry"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad quality- paper too thin!","review":"Started reading it, but the quality of the book is terrible. The paper is too thin, the pages are almost see-thru. Ick. I can't stand it. I suppose that's what you get when you buy cheap! I am going to go buy it in hard cover somewhere else and try again. The book will be great, I'm sure. I just can't stand the quality of the printing. Even the type is small and really close together. Odd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who can beat Stephen King","review":"As usual, anything Stephen King writes is going to be great but there was too much waiting for the suspense to happen for me.

It wasn't worth the time and expanse to reship the book. Very unhappy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Buy Used","review":"The title says it all. The product i recieved looked nothing like the pictures i was shown, and smelled like an attic. The pages of the book were torn, worn, and yellow.

Dont bu used from this site."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book, horrible price!","review":"The stand is definitely an enthralling book and one that deserves more than one read. The price on the other hand is horrendous. Why should anyone pay $40.00 for the kindle e-book when the paperback version is only $8.99. This is a flagrant ripoff considering that the e-book is all profit since there is no production cost besides the initial kindle format conversion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yucky","review":"This book made me nauseous.

In fact, I have still not recovered from it. This book really had all the right elements of becoming a great horror book, but unfortunately Mr King screwed it up. This isn't the first time he did this, I've read Cujo, The dead zone and the half of IT (it was this book that diminished all hope of ever reading a Stephen King book again). Based on my experience of reading King's books, I can predict that his work is not for me. It lacks that rare thing, which I call the scare-factor and I've noticed with The Stand that some of (particularly when the deadly flu spreads around the world) his scenes are very repetitive and, generally, the book is BLATANTLY BORING. The Dark One in the book also disappointed me, because I would've expected it to have more interesting supernatural gifts.In conclusion, this book is more useful as a modified dumbell than it is as reading material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tl;DR","review":"King is the King of Sleepiness! LOL. Seriously, I could not fall asleep, so I read this, and I was out like a light. All he does is ramble on about some kind of apocalypse and their flat surviving characters.

Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pitiful Mr. March","review":"Geraldine Brooks' Year of Wonder was an excellent read. For this reason I bought March.While it was also beautifully written the main character, Mr. March was a total dissapointment. After reading all the adoring and eloquent letters written to his wife and daughters while he was at war, I was very disappointed when he had an affair with Grace. I lost my patience and considered him an idiot when he suggested the sheep should be allowed to keep their wool, the cows should be allowed to keep their milk for their calves and I can't remember what the chickens were supposed to do with their eggs. I went to the last page to see if he got shot during the war but allas, he made it home to his loving family.

Luckily at over a thousand pages it's handy if you have diarrhoea. I can't believe anyone hurled it 18 metres, the best my friends and I could manage was 10.5 It's also handy for getting a good nights sleep. Just take two pages and wake up in the morning. I always find that when reading about characters I wish would just die. I wish I knew which book all these five-star \\"best book EVER\\" people have read as I'd go and buy it. It can't be The Stand can it ? Surely not."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slow-moving \\"epic\\" that doesn't go anywhere.","review":"I bought \\"The Stand\\" (Complete and Uncut Edition) at Amazon. What is going on? How can anybody consider it one of King's best novels?The story is slow-moving, long, boring, depressing and it doesn't make any sense. It took me almost a month to read it.I'll try to comment the story without being a spoiler. King's heroine is even more detestable than the Bad Dude. In the first 50 pages, Frannie is introduced as a silly girl that got pregnant because she forgot to take the pill. Her reaction was to get mad at her boyfried. Frannie can't listen to poetry reading without giggling incontrollably. While everybody is fighting for their lives, she finds time to write a stupid diary. Folks, this is how King introduces this saga's heroine. Unbelievable!The end of this \\"epic\\" adds a new dimension to the term \\"off-the-wall\\". This is a terrible mix of religion and science fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will it ever end?","review":"I know I am in the minority but I did not like this book. The plot was ok, but by dragging it out over 1100+ pages King made it a labor to read (like many of his other works). A man with King's talent could have easily condensed the book to 400-500 pages and not detracted from the story. Reading parts of The Stand was like watching grass grow, but it did put me to sleep many of nights. I think if Stephen King and Tom Clancy would get together they could produce a 3000+ page novel which would be a #1 bestseller and cure insomnia. By the way I expect this review to get trashed by King's beloved followers (Not to mention Clancy readers)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Character driven story of the apocalypse","review":"I read The Stand when I was staying indoors with a monster cold, which probably helped out in setting some mood near the beginning. The plot concerns a doomsday virus that kills almost everybody in the world. The dieing happens in the beginning and then we follow the stories of the members of a group of survivors who join together and try to get by. There are so few survivors that they spend a good bit of time finding other survivors and then coping with a word in which there is no infrastructure since everyone else is deceased. They settle down and become the good in the apocalyptic battle between good and evil that is coming.This is the only book by Stephen King that I've read. I really liked it. The plot made sense and all, but it wasn't the focus for me. But the characters were so well developed. Even though this is a very long book it reads quickly. I recommend trying it out unless the whole everyone in the world dieing is too sad for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Stephen King Novel","review":"This, hands down, is the most eclectic work of horror ever written. The characters are deep, the story lines intertwined, and the situation is described to realistically. A must read of all!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stands on its Own","review":"One of the few books I have read over and over again (~10 times despite its length).This is what got me into Stephen King, and in my opinion, this book, \\"The Shining\\", and \\"Salem's Lot\\" are his best books.At first it is pretty confusing because there are many characters, and each chapter switches to a different character in the first person, but once you get over that, its hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"All about Story","review":"Stephen King is one of the best writers currently writing - I've pretty much convinced myself of that. He has complete command of language and form, and writes so well that you don't notice the writing. Which is good, because he is WITHOUT A DOUBT the best storyteller out there. He writes so that the story becomes all. The Stand is a story of apocalypse and aftermath, but oh, what King can do with that setup. There are ties to other books in the Stephen King universe throughout, but this one can stand on its own. It is scary, funny, thought-provoking, entertaining, and epic, but most of all it is GOOD. Take a chance on the Shining (which is shorter)-- if you find you like Stephen King, read The Stand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Among the living","review":"After you read thiss book you can't stay passive, either you hate it or love it (like I do). This novel has characters you care about (Tom Cullen is my absolute favourite) and scenes that leave you breathlesss.\\"The Stand\\" is a fascinating book and one should read it no matter what anyone says, the book will speak of herself in a best possible way."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you read any King book, read this one!","review":"After reading The Stand, i completely understand why its a love/hate response from readers. An extremely long book filled with a lot of character dialog and development. But that's what makes this book truly a must-read. I've read many of King's novels, but in none does he reach the level of intimacy that he does in The Stand. I found myself envisioning what these people looked like, and seeing through their eyes. Aside from the intriguing characters such as the Trashcan Man and Harold, this book has a plot that keeps you coming back for more. You'll find yourself putting the book down, and ten minutes later needing to continue to see where the story and its characters go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essentially the best book ever written","review":"People can complain about the length of this novel all they want, all I have to say is it's too short! (1143 pages) Stephen King is a fantastic storyteller. (Warning...if you have a summer cold, don't read this book, it will make you paranoid!). King fleshes out his characters and creates a world that you really believe exists. You will find yourself wishing you hadn't read it yet--I re-read it at least once a year. The scary thing is that this could conceivably happen. What would you do if it did? It makes you think. And for those of you who saw the mini-series (there was no way it could compare, but nice try), \\"Don't Fear the Reaper\\" will always invoke them memory of Campion starting the whole thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book Ever!","review":"The Stand is by far the best book that I have ever read! The characters are very real and It keeps your attention up to the very end of the 1141 pages. Do your self a favor, read this book! The only problem is that the writing gets a little sloppy at the end of the book (Like in many other King Novels that I have read), but overall, it is GREAT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most brilliant books written in any genre.","review":"This is a highly plausible book looking at not only the classic struggle of Good vs. Evil, but also a book about hope. This book was very disturbing on many levels, which marks it as truly great horror. Most disturbing was the whole idea of bioweapons destroying all of civilization. But ultimately this is a book about hope. This is shown by the fact that Stephen King gives humanity another start and that life does go on in this epic novel, despite the horrible tragedy portrayed by this book. The plot and characters are beautifully crafted, and Stephen King proved what a great author he is. The only regret I had because of this book was that there are so few authors of this caliber currently. If you consider yourself a fan of great literature, you MUST read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Stand","review":"This book is the best book I have ever read. It is the first book I read that Stephen King had written. It entertained me for the week it took me to read it. I have read it maybe four times and it just gets better every time I read it. I had to put it on my Kindle Fire so I would have it in case I needed to read it again. I have the hardback book of The Stand and now my Kindle Fire has it so I'm all set. I love the book and was so glad I could get it for my Kindle Fire."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Stand","review":"The stand is long and dry and in some places even a little boring ... that being said if you can get through it, if you can push through the parts where you just can't handle the story anymore. Then The Stand becomes from the perspective of someone who finished it a beautiful work of art and possibly on of King's best novels. It is both intense and descriptive and tells a desperately interesting story. If you are looking for a run of the mill horror then you will be sorely disappointed. The stand is about people and good versus evil , not death and slaughter and it is that which makes it a story which is ultimately worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmm..","review":"An author accustomed to being under a center spotlight like Stephen King would usually have one day, his dream of writing a long novel of apocalyptic scope. He realized this dream when he produced The Stand. All throughout it must be said the book is a masterpiece of darkness. However, nothing is flawless. How about the several hundred pages of ad hoc committees written in the diary of Frannie Goldsmith? That is plain boring, in my opinion. Not relevant in the leastest to the story. Not wishing to be unkind or anything, but then, how about the ending? Talk about far-fetched!! Deus ex Machina to the rescue! Gee!! That damaged the book's reputation. If that hadn't happened, the book would no doubt have to have been awarded AT LEAST a Bram Stoker award. Mr. King, do us a favor. Write a good novel, but write it all the way through. Dont just let it all go at the end. Your millions of readers thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"In good condition? Are you kidding?","review":"The book came from the seller in deplorable condition. It was supposed to be a used book but in good condition. It was anything but that! Cover very creased and wrinkled, pages loose and falling out, and looked as if it had been dipped in water and then dried. I am very disappointed with this transaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Long Drawn out potboiler!!!","review":"Good GOD! This book is stupid. It's long, drawn out, boring and totally contrived. Like the majority of his work it's populated by the typical Stephen King stock(blue collar village idiot's) character's and a cheesy redneck devil like villian. Stupid and predictable...tedious and incondite!!!! and a total waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does King waste our time?","review":"I cannot understand the popular appeal of this book. The first 200 or so pages of this book are OK - about what one would expect from a mediocre science fiction writer. Then the story develops into a rather trite and heavy-handed morality tale, with the 'forces of good' settling in Boulder and the 'forces of evil' settling in Las Vegas (hmmm...). The characters are neither endearing nor intruiging, and the subplots meander in a frustrating way. The conclusion, however, is very possibly the worst ending to a book that I have ever read. It reminds one of a third-grade creative writing assignment which is due the next day.I read this book at the suggestion of an acquaintance, and have no intention of picking up another King book.The only explanation I can offer as to the rave reviews given to this book is that, after 900 pages, people will claim to like it just as an excuse for having put so much of their time into wading through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the worst book I've ever read, but close...","review":"The beginning was good, and that made the ending so much harder to take -- like a broken promise. I kept expecting the characters to transcend their destinies and do something unexpected or at least interesting, but they just plowed on like donkeys tied to a mill wheel. And the ending -- after all that build-up, the whole thing is resolved with an accident?!? This is exactly the sort of deus ex machina ending that would get you flunked in undergraduate writing classes."},{"rating":"1","title":"1,141 pages of sheer boredom.","review":"Well it's true what they say...the book's always better than the movie. This should only indicate how bad the movie was since this 1,141 page bore-a-thon has absolutely no redeeming characteristics except that it does eventually end. Unless you're in jail and have virtually nothing else to do, don't read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"greedy and shameful","review":"Sorry Stephen King you have ruined a great original. You got greedy with \\"IT\\" and now you have destroyed one of your better efforts. I loved The Shining and The (original) Stand and The Dead Zone, etc ... but beginning with Pet Sematary (with that cheap shot little kid getting obliterated by the 16 wheeler scene) you have lost the MAGIC. Summary: you did some very good work and now you are nothing more than a long winded, egomaniacal, money grubbing hack."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your time","review":"This is was my first Stephen King novel and it will certainly be my last. I'm not sure why so many people recommend this book!To begin with, King takes 3 pages to explain something that he could have said in a sentence. To make matters worse, most of the details that he spends an ardously lengthy amount of time on are pointless. It is disappointing because the concept for the story has so much potential. Relative to other long books that I have read such as Les Miserables and War and Peace, The Stand is a simplistic and bland novel. The characters - who are all rednecks - as well as the plot of the story are completely uninteresting. To top it all off, the ending will leave you even more unimpressed. Overall, a terrible book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"The Stand is definitely one of my favourite Stephen King books and I have to say I loved the extra content!!

I only want to add that the characters are so memorable that even 20 years after reading the uncut edition in dead tree format, I want to shout joyful greetings at them. I also think that when Stephen King stuck to writing stories of the forces of good versus the forces of evil, he was at his best. I love this journey. The Kindle versiom is so much lighter a load to bear as I travel this long highway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Hot!","review":"As with most authors, More is not necessarily better. Stephen King grinds out a meandering tale which I've been unable to finish (as yet!) Other books I've purchased from Amazon for my Kindle are taking precedent over this, at least so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Night Stand","review":"This book is about a western sort of gunfighter and sci-fi mixed in. I really thought that I would like the pictures in my head more than illustrations. I also liked the concept behind it. I think that this book could change the way sci-fi horror novels are presented to the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Stand","review":"The many characters in this novel are all very different and kept unique. As you read through the story you grow to realize just how well the subtle touches give the characters such depth.I find my mind wandering every so often as I read this very long story, though. Some sections I don't feel add anything to the story (such as the \\"No great loss\\" chapter).Overall the story is engaging and I find myself reading for hours without noticing.I am reading this on the kindle and there are enough typos to be irritating. An example is the frequent replacing of r n with m. These take you out of the story as you have to sit and think about what it was supposed to say for a few seconds."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book I've Ever Read.","review":"Nothing in this world matches the pure brilliance you'll find in these 1,154 pages. Stephen King is often unfairly dismissed as a simple horror writer, but The Stand proves he is one of the best writers of all time. The characters in this book are so well done that I think of them as real people. The way Stephen King takes stuff everyone takes for granted and turns it upside down is totally brilliant. The book isn't dated at all, though it was published in 1978. The expanded version is only better, making the greatest book ever even more compelling and interesting. No review in this world and no word in the dictionary can describe and do justice to the book; you just have to read it. You will be very, very happy you did.13 stars out of 5.13/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stood and Delivered","review":"The Stand is a large novel, perhaps the largest one of the latter half of the 2nd millenium. At no point does Stephen King reveal his hand. He is relentless as always up until the bitter end. People die. The end of the world is HAPPENing, not theorhetical. With drunken allure to a religiously unsatisfied working class and positive props from scared Sunday school students, King keeps his audiences in check. The Dark man has entered the world and is working his dark magic as everyone falls under his spell of plague except the fortunate few who have some chromosomal indifference to death. The characters have a choice which is more closely linked to a calling pulling them either for good (GOd) or evil Dark Man. We jest at ourselves unbelieving that his identity is the same as Satan's. Will good champine over evil? Let your previous King experience be your guide, or better yet, pour through this oft poetic text of mayhem until the bitter/beautiful end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh boy...","review":"I'll make this quick because the book was so long. The book is good for the fist couple of hundred pages. After that, you will be amazed by stupid characters who die pointlessly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great plot with lots of details.","review":"As an occasional Stephen King reader, this book is pretty much what I expected. I knew that it would have both a great plot and at the same time, too many details. Often times King will spend an entire chapter developing a character just to kill him off in the next chapter. The same plot could be conveyed in half as many pages. At some points in the story I couldn't put the book down. At other times, however, I couldn't keep my eyes open. Nonetheless, I enjoyed reading this book. Stephen King makes readers think and allows their imaginations to run wild."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Stand","review":"So this is how the world ends- when a rapidly mutating, man- made disease known as Captain Trips is accidentally released from an army facility.The 'superflu' is highly contagious, and it has a mortality rate of 99.4%.Within a matter of weeks,it spreads from person to person like a chain letter of death,killing everyone it infects.The entire country-and presumably the world-begins to collapse,as civilization falls.Soon enough,75% of the world's population is extinct.With the exception of the other percentage,people who are miraculously immune to the virus.The stage is set for the final battle between good and evil."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY long, but worth the time","review":"This is probably the longest book I ever read, and it certaintly took a very long time to read, but it was enjoyable all the way.It is a very interesting topic, the idea of a desease clearing out 95% of the population, and King decides to take a very epocoliptical good vs. evil, \\"magical\\" type look at it instead of actually thinking about the logical course of action for people. That being said, the book still does a great job developing charecters and relationships, as well as exploring some of the interesting facets of a small city run completely by survivors, for survivors, like a new chance at starting the country over fresh.Certainly worth the time it takes to get through 1150 pages, interesting, inciteful, if occasionally far-fetched.

From the plague ridden Earth to the rise of evil. King manages to turn an old trope of good vs evil into something much much more. The telling of the encrustations on the face that reveal the 'inner' self when they break away was horrifying and imaginative. And the walking man, was always menacing running as a thread right throughout the tale. This is why King was always the best. And now... the book goes back on my shelf to be read agin in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the great man's best","review":"My favourite King book of all time has to be Misery which is such a classic page-turner it kept me up till well into the morning. This book however took me two months to read, with a three week break included. It struggles to get going, struggles to maintain any narrative pace and finally struggles to a \\"so what?\\" ending. Astoundingly it is not as bad as Salem's Lot which I refuse to ever read again. Maybe I'll try this one again but not until I've got a good month to kill, or if I'm stranded on a desert island with nothing else.

If you like reading novels that unfold with all the speed of growing grass, this book is for you. I got half-way through and had to put it down. These characters are not nearly interesting enough to sustain 1000+ pages! A frustratingly slow read that is both self-indulgent and ultimately uninteresting. I would have given it one star, but it did keep my attention for a little while. The Shining is so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought it couldn't be better!","review":"I actually read this book as a freshman in high school. I then saw the tv-miniseries and back then I just thought the book was boring and the movie was better because there was more action. Now after re-reading the book and seeing the movie as I go.

His best qualities are all here: his amazing ability to create realistic characters and take us inside their minds, his way with a scary scene, his really great villains.Unfortunately, all of his worst qualities are here too. The pretentiousness, the over-writing for the sake of filling up pages, the too cute characters (If Tom Cullen had told me that M-O-O-N spelled anything again, I was going to throw the book across the room!), and a delusion that he has Something Serious To Say About The Struggle Between Good And Evil.The sad thing is that King really does have something serious to say about the struggle between good and evil. He just says it better in his shorter works like The Shining, Pet Sematary, and Dolores Claiborne. The Stand, however, is just page after empty page after empty page after empty page after empty page."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ending was terrible!","review":"The beginning was good. But it led into a religious heaven and hell war. At the beginning I thought it had potential to make people think about the diseases and chemicals we contain on earth and how dangerous they are. But in the end all it amounts to is divinding the world into worshipers of God and Satan. The outcome of this story could have come about with out there ever being a disease. It sounds like King got a little bored with the story and made a bad end cause he didn't want to write any longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"King of the Hill for SK","review":"The Stand is probably the most recognizable novel in Stephen King's massive literary repertoire. It is the book of all books: The mammoth story of classical good vs. evil delivered within 1,100 plus pages in this \\"Complete and Uncut Edition\\". In this special edition of The Stand, King leaves no stone unturned as he woes his audience, \\"Dear Constant Reader\\" with an apocalyptical prose about the fragility of human life and the free will in which God provides us to chose our own path. This book is very well written, as most of SK's earlier work and will certainly be pleasing to both the avid Steve King fan as well as the recreational reader. Pick this one up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My All-Time Favorite Stephen King","review":"\\"The Stand\\" had me hooked from the first sentence. It was mysterious, touching, scary, confusing, and sickening. I read this book late into many nights.As the book begins, a virus is being spread throughout the U.S. (unbeknownst to anyone). People begin dying left and right, and the rest of the book follows the travels of those who survive. The survivors wander around looking for others like themselves. This was the most interesting part of the book.The last part of the book becomes a quest for good vs. evil, as the survivors try to make some sort of \\"law system\\" for themselves and run across evil that is not from this world.Bottom Line: This is one of the best books I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great novel","review":"Great story, imaginative, funny, just like the rest of Stephen King's work. I haven't read the shorter version. Some reviewers say they liked it better. I did find this one a bit long; some of the passages don't add much to the story. I thought, for instance, that the character called the Kid was a waste of time.Nevertheless, I love Stephen King's books. What impresses me the most about him is his mastery of English and the way he throws in an unusual word here and there, while keeping the tone of the book light and casual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better a second time","review":"The amazing thing that I love about kindle is that it reminds us of those favorites from when we were kids. I originally read this book over 15 years ago, then was at a used bookstore and saw it sitting there. I had to pick it up. I couldn't put the book down. It is just as thrilling a second time reading it, if not more. this is one of those books that will forever go down in history. Stephen King has always been an idol of mine and this book is by far my favorite story he's written. Don't get me wrong, I love all of his stuff, but this book has so much. There's good and evil, and apocolypse of sorts, end of the world. Its just amazing the imagination this author has, and the amount of years he's had it. I loved this book, and if you haven't read it, you will be missing out. This book and Under the Dome are my two absolute favorite Stephen King books. Love it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An apocalyptic novel flavored with Stephen King's brand of horror","review":"The Stand is an apocalyptic novel that perfectly blends Stephen King's brilliant brand of horror with science fiction. When an outbreak of a government created flu strain wipes out most of humanity, the survivors split into two groups, one is basically evil, led by Randall Flagg, and the other represents good, led by Mother Abigail. The stage is essentially set for a showdown between good and evil, a battle between the dark and light.It's a very compelling read, particularly because of the fundamental religious, social and psychological themes it addresses. I will say the reader must be patient--the beginning is focused on the plague itself, so it's different than the modern day dystopian novels which tend to start in an already post apocalyptic world. The book is very detailed, but hardcore readers will enjoy that element."},{"rating":"2","title":"a tale as old as time","review":"This book is wonderful. It is not a story specifically about a superflu bug that wipes out a large part of the population; it is not about the stuggle to survive when all those you love are gone and you are alone; it is not a story about love, or life,or human relations either, but, it does have all of those things in it. It is about good and evil, god and the devil, the light and the dark, whatever you would like to call it. Stephen King manages to write an epic that never bores you and will make you laugh out loud, cry outloud and want to cover your eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"It is great!

Despite David Murray and the late Don Pullen's avant-garde reputations, they understood the African-American gospel and blues tradition, and with Pullen playing a Hammond B-3 instead of his usual piano, the whole record is infused with a kind of soul jazz feel - sort of like what those old Blue Note records would have sounded like if they had absorbed the subsequent 25 years of developments in jazz. The highpoint is the closing track, Pullen's \\"Milano Strut\\" which he originally recorded as a duet with drummer Don Moye on an obscure Italian label. Here it gets a fuller reprise with the addition of the sax and guitar."},{"rating":"2","title":"I agree one of the best cd's ever.","review":"I wish more people knew about David Murray and this CD. I found out about it from a friend. This CD gets played a lot in my house. I would go so far as to say its one of the best jazz cd's of all time. I was surprised to read a glowing review of this by Robert Christgau, the Dean of music critics. Please go to his web page ... and check out his review. He mainly reviews rock/pop music, but he listens to a lot of jazz too. I'm not a reviewer who can do justice to this amazing cd , but his review of Shakill's is perfect.

Like it did when I read it as a 14 year old girl, it still makes me feel like I had just been in a emotional whirlpool. It'll make your heart ache when Meredith and Matt hate each other so much - and also when they love each other so much! It'll make you feel like crying at one moment, laughing in the next second, literally! That is what McNaught's books so wonderful. I don't want to spoil much of the story so this is all I'll say - after all these years, this book still remains as my one of 3 favorite ronamce novels (all by McNaught, I'm afraid), \\"Whitney, my love,\\" \\"Something wonderful,\\" and this, \\"Paradise.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"I found something out about myself!!","review":"First of all I want to start out by saying that I will NEVER pick up a book this thick (thick to me) AGAIN!

Guess I'm a slow reader since someone on here said they'd read it in one :\\\\ (wow) If the story hadn't been so wonderful and exciting and powerful...I would have went at a more peaceful pace lol I have read books thicker and enjoyed them just fine. However, this book was TOO good and I couldn't put it down. I couldn't WAIT to get to each page!! Now, the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because there is a portion of the book that has a lot of corporate mumbo-jumbo..(some is expected, but that was just too much!) I had to skim for a while and STILL didn't feel I missed anything. I cried and laughed and got dizzy with anxiety!! What a roller coaster ride with Matt and Meredith lol"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Read!","review":"I've enjoyed McNaught's historical novels and rank her among the best of fictional romance authors. I was hesitant to read this contemporary work of hers, but I am so glad I decided to read it! This novel has now become my favorite among McNaught's works. I enjoyed the rollacoaster ride Meredith and Matt took me on. It is so full of heartfelt emotions. Needless to say, this is one book I'll definitely read over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite contemporary romance!","review":"Normally I don't read contemporary; mostly I read historicals. However, I made an exception with this book because I absolutely love Judith Mucnaught's work. Put simply, I couldn't bear to put this book down! The relationship between Meredith and Matthew kept me completely enthralled! If you are looking for a fabulous read, I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a fast-paced heart grabbing never put me down page turner","review":"The characters are larger than life, the dreamy, handsome man with little wealth meets an a beautiful, warm heiress. Even though there is chemistry and huge bond that brings them together, they are torn apart by their different worlds, by their differences, and huge misunderstandings. Now fate has brought them together again, its so painfully sweet. Great ending! There is closure for all the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE!!!","review":"PARADISE was the best story I have ever read!! I am an avid fan of Judith McNaught books and this book was my absolute favorite! I enjoy many other authors but Judith McNaught is my personal favorite. This particular story about Matt and Meredith's unbelievable love have captured my heart and tears. I believe Judith McNaught has an unmatched talent for romance and storytelling judging from PARADISE and many of her other titles. If you love this book, you will also enjoy other Judith McNaught works such as: SOMETHING WONDERFUL, ONCE AND ALWAYS, PERFECT, ALMOST HEAVEN and WHITNEY, MY LOVE."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, but enjoyed perfect better","review":"recently, i read and thoroughly enjoyed perfect by judith mcnaught . . . so i decided to read another book for her, paradise, which contained some of the same characters . . . (the latter was written first; you don't have to read them in sequence, but if you do, you might enjoy them a bit more) . . . at any rate, i liked paradise; however, not nearly as much as perfect . . . it is definitely a \\"women's book\\" and while i like them at times, this one dragged for me a bit . . . story of a woman who turns to her former lover when her family empire is threatened by a hostile takoever attempt . . . . there's a good ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hated To See Book End","review":"What can I say? Except I LOVED this book. It was funny, sad, interesting and much more. I had a hard time putting it down for any reason. Meredith and Matt were one of the most sexy, exciting couples I've had the pleasure to read about. Buy it, read it...you won't be sorry. It's a keeper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"I was excited to read this book after all of the glowing reviews. I love romance novels about a couple's love that lasts a lifetime. Unfortunately, this story did not live up to expectations. I was taken aback at how quickly Meredith and Matt slept together. They only met each other five hours before! Of course Meredith got pregnant and they entered into an ill-fated marriage. I have no idea what books the other reviewers were reading. I felt no chemistry between Meredith and Matt considering how short they knew each other. Meredith became very annoying after awhile with the anatagonizing relationship with her father. I was expecting the best and instead got a really long book that went nowhere. If you are looking for a romance that stands the test of time and is beautifully written, I recommend Honest Illusions by Nora Roberts. Definitely skip this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Paradise for Everyone","review":"I LOVE Judith McNaught's historical books so I thought I'd try Paradise due to the average 5 star rating. I just couldn't get into it. Too long winded and a female lead character for whom the world ends when mega wealthy daddy won't pay for University. What does she do? Drives off in a Porsche (which she received for her 16th birthday) rather than do a basic job like waiting tables or cleaning so she can pay for Uni herself (even if she has to do it part-time). Right from the start this book had me off-side and it didn't get any better. Definitely not a book for everyone and I'm afraid it ended up in the garbage. I'll stick to Judith's historical novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, boring, lifeless....","review":"I have read tens of thousands of books in my life and never have I voluntarily not finished a work of fiction. A few chapters, a pregnancy, and a marriage in and I threw it aside. The father is horrible, Meredith is unbelievable and boring and Matt is not my idea of a hero. I don't even care what happens to them, so I'm giving the book away. If you're looking for strong, interesting, characters, try another writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"It would have been \\"Paradise\\"...","review":"It would have been \\"Paradise\\" if I never would have read this book. I have read every other novel by Judith and I have noticed a certain trend; Judith's historical romance are far better than her contemporary ones. Paradise is just another example of the aforementioned trend. It seems that there is so much detail in the contemporary stories that the romance is lost. So the stories end up bland, not quite like Paradise."},{"rating":"1","title":"STRETCHED UNMERCIFULLY","review":"Inspite of a good and strong storyline, there are atleast 200 pages in the book which were absolutely not needed. The book pulls and pulls till the very end and leaves you wanting for something more from an author as good as Judith McNaught. Her other books are definately much better. The past here is too in depth and the scenes corny at best. A real dissappointment......"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 1st McNaught Book!","review":"I am a VERY picky reader. I only read this book because it so many great reviews. I have to say I am sooo glad I did!! This book was terrific. I am a HUGE JUDITH MCNAUGHT FAN now. I have read most of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"paradise","review":"this was a good book, but it failed to be great for me for several reasons: eleven years was too long a time for these two to meet again, it was too sad that they lost so much time together. matt was a great character, but meredith was annoying the way she kept doubting matt and not being able to trust him, even though he did nothing wrong the first time around. and she should have been furious with her father for costing her 11 years of happiness with matt, she forgive him way too easily. all in all, it could not compare to Perfect in my eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paradise Found!!","review":"I love JM's historical romances which is why I chose to read Paradise. It was a good book with well developed characters. The book is a page turner although I did feel the book could have been a bit shorter.Meredith and Matt have a once in a lifetime love that all girls wish she they could experience, especially with a handsome, rags to riches guy like Matt. Also, the chemistry between them is hot.One thing I didn't like was how easily Meredith forgave her father for all the things he did to keep Meredith and Matt apart. It was just too much to stomach for me. In that regard, I felt that she could've had a bit more backbone. Overall though, this is a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paradise","review":"I absolutely loved this book! It was smart, funny, and the characters were very engaging. It's a great read! Judith McNaught is one of my favorite romance authors and this book is an example of why that it is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It has everything","review":"This will make you laugh, cry, smile and throw stuff.

The characters are so real that I could easily relate to them. A beautiful romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book really hits the romantic spot in everyone.","review":"When I read this book I cried and I laughed. It was fantastic. I have read many books and I have yet to find a book that equals the portions of this book and the love felt between Meredith and Matt."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read!","review":"This is an absolutely superb novel. I have read a few of Judith McNaught's novels, but Paradise was the first and I still think it's the best so far. I couldn't put the book down until I discovered what happened to the characters in the end.... This is a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Fantasy","review":"Imagine living a sheltered life in Chicago, if you can't than you have not read Paradise.

I still pick it up and read it cover to cover. This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. Great characters and a very interesting plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is absolutely amazing","review":"This book is truly captivating and one that touches your soul. I'm not usually a fan of typical romance novels, but I saw this in a drugstore and took a chance. I loved it so much, that I haven't been able to get it out of my mind and I was sad that I had finished. I'm not one to read books again and again, yet I will gladly relive the story of Matt and Meredith. The characters were extremely well developed and felt like old friends by the end of the novel. I found myself crying and laughing out loud with them. I also like that it is set in the present day. This book is inspiring and one that encourages you to take more chances in your own love life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Judith Mcnaught is Simply the Best!!","review":"Paradise is the book which a woman can find everything that she wants.Combinations of love,jelousy,sympathy,hatred,lies, truth and so forth are so perfect for the plots.

(check out PERFECT... matt and meredith have a role in it)"},{"rating":"2","title":"impulse","review":"I dont usually write reviews, but after i read this book i was compelled to express its impact. i have never, in all the hundreds of books i have read of all genres, been torn between the desire to throw the book onto the ground and stamp my emotional frustration onto it and the almost otherwordly inability to let go of it. she created a world inside of her book, and i felt as if i were living in that reality- sometimes as an irate observor, but there were also times when i knew about as much as the characters did. i suppose the word im looking for is real.it was REAL."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book you won't mind reading again and again!","review":"This book is NOT just a typical romance novel. It offers so much more that it's hard to know where to start. This is a read that gets you so involved that it will outrage you, make you laugh out loud, smile, gasp in disbelief and fall in love with the characters. Over the years, I've read this book so many times, with the story never disapointing me, and loaned it out repeatedly that I finally had to buy another copy. If I ever meet JM, this book is the one I would want her to sign for me. It's amazingly well written, intellectual, complex and satifying. Don't miss out. It's well worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"McNaught never disappoints","review":"Ms. McNaught is my favorite author, bar none. I read and reread her books.

I belonged to four book clubs for years. I lost interest after it became a chore to read book after book without one special moment, without invoking emotion. I picked this one up on a whim at a corner store, after not having read a book for over ten years, I was skeptical. After the first three chapters I was hooked. I couldn't put it down. The romance is unbeatable. As my title says, I have read it seven times and I love it more every time I read it. My collection now consists of three hundred and nine books, collected in three years. Paradise is still my favorite. I wish I could find another that would make me want to hide on the couch all day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh! WOW!","review":"I so love this book!

You won't want to put it down. It's that good. It will make you laugh, cry, angry, sad...You get so involved in the storyline, that it feels like you're a part of it.Matt and Meredith were just great. I'm really partial to Matt as I think that he is just perfect. When he loves, he loves completely and with such passion. Although I hated the fact that Meredith doubted him at the end, when she actually thought he could have done all those horrible things, you can actually feel that she has doubts about her doubts, and in the end she trusts him completely without any proof and she chooses him above all else (the presidency of the company, the one thing she has always fought for and her father, although he was a dispicable)."},{"rating":"2","title":"paradise","review":"Paradise the first romanise novel that was introduced to me by my friends.. and after reading it , I fell in love with reading. i would say it is one of THE BEST romanise novel around !

Of all romances I have ever read, (and believe me, there have been many) I have yet to find one as perfectly written as this one. Matt and Meredith are perfect for each other in every way. The character development is superb. Even the secondary characters seem like old friends by the end. Judith has yet to top herself on this one (even with \\"Perfect\\", please don't shoot me because I love it, too *smile*). This is J.M. at her very best."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL/FABULOUS!!!!","review":"I have read all of Judith McNaught's books. My first one being 'Whitney, My Love' (which I reread about every year or every other year)!! I read 'Paradise' as soon as it came out in hardcover and was not disappointed.!! It made me laugh,cry and go through all kinds of emotions. After I read it, I thought it would make a wonderful TV movie, but in writing to JM, she sent me a reply stating this could not be done. I have loaned this book to at least 10 of my friends and I get the same comments: GREAT, WONDERFUL, FABULOUS! I love all of Judith McNaught's books and am now starting a library of the audios. Now I can listen to her wonderful stories while commuting to and from the office - the best of both worlds!!! I am eagerly awaiting her next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Plesantly Surprised!!","review":"I am a huge fan of McNaught's and have read her historicals (which I really enjoyed), but am generally hesitant to read many contemporaries. I decided to venture out of my comfort zone a bit & was very plesantly surprised at how much I loved it. I found myself having a very difficult time putting it down once I started it & would highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Story!!! 4.5 stars!","review":"Paradise was an amazing story, and i have enjoyed reading it alot!!!!!! i fell in love with Mathew!!! i especially loved the beginning of this story when Meredith meets Mathew, and then when she finds out shes pregnant and goes to tell him about it, and when they get married! I enjoyed the character of Mathew more than Meredith, but put together, these two were very suited!! However, the reason i gave this story 4 stars instead of 5 was because i read Perfect right after Paradise, and i thought Perfect was a little bit better than Paradise. Judith McNaught went into a lot of detail in Merediths business, that it got a little boring, but the rest of the story was amazing!! i recommend this story to all of Judiths fans, and they should read Perfect (the sequel of Paradise) too!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"720 pages and it still manages a rushed ending","review":"This genre is not usually my pick, but it was for book club so I read it. The fact that it took me two weeks to read it is the first bad sign. If you like the slightly conflicted with misunderstandings romance genre then this is a decent novel. I can do with some misunderstanding and conflict, but after the 20th one and everyone assuming stuff instead of actually talking to each other I doze off quite frequently. It is also too long in my opinion. The book spends 600 pages drawing out the storyline to wrap everything up in the last 100 pages and some things don't even get proper development just to be resolved in 5 pages.Other than that, I liked the style the book was written, but sometimes I was more interested in the business lingo than the actual relationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Paradise","review":"I loved this everything about this book.

Yes, the author's exploits are sometimes amusing, sometimes dramatic, but by the end there is so much repetition that I started skipping sections. This book is not comprehensive, but merely conveys the impression that the author's interviews with \\"leading\\" Islamic figures were haphazardly organized and that he was invariably scared beforehand and relieved afterwards to have survived. It's hard to believe that this author also wrote for first class journals and newspapers. He never managed an interview with Bashar or any (alleged) leading JI figure, his coverage of the Bali attacks was incidental and threadbare, and his background analysis was absent in many cases. The only good thing I can say is that I am glad I borrowed this book from the public library and did not buy it; it's not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnifico is right","review":"I have never hear of this guy before but I took a chance and well it was a damn good decision.

I forgot about Alex Cortiz for a few years, then found the album on Amazon, and ordered it by listening to some of the 30s samples. It all sounded fine so I picked it up.Big mistake. I really don't play this at all - it's just so boring... I suppose my tastes changed or something, but as far as I can figure out, downtempo has moved on (or I moved on from downtempo) and the \\"music isn't there\\". it's just 4 sets of a predictable loop, followed by another 4, repeat for a duration of 4-5 minutes... You get the picture....And that's a big shame as I really did think highly of Room 404. I still dig it, but the rest of the album makes it, somehow, tainted...Still, 2 stars since I don't hate it, and rather listen to this than most radio channels :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A little tight on my foot","review":"This is a very good looking boot, but the style and fit was not for me.

Other books deal with different aspects of individual operas in more depth, but this is still one of the books to start with. Everybody interested in Wagner should - well, the first thing to do might be to listen to excerpts from \\"Die Walku:re\\", \\"Tristan\\" or \\"Parsifal\\", say, and be awed by the music - but once you've heard the music, if you're still interested, you should get this book.Laon"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best so far","review":"It is a bit small but a very good size for small quantity baking and it takes up less space.One thing I don't like about it is the sharp edges.

Some of the ingredients may be hard to find, but we have a large hispanic community in our area and I went to one of their grocery stores and found most of what I needed. I had to substitute Jamaican hot peppers for Scotch Bonnet, but they're about the same. I had to go to another store for shallots. I adapted the griot a bit from the author's recipe and fried it rather than fixing it in the oven and next time I won't fry it quite as much. But I will vouch for the flavor as authentic.

Well, first of all the language was so bad that no one underage should be watching it. The characters consisted of every negative stereo-type in the book and the writing stunk!!

I am somewhat surprised that many people did not find the film funny or maybe I am surprised that I actually found it to be funny. I have to agree with the reviewer's comments that the film is stereotypical but I have not found one comedy yet that is not. As I previously stated, I am not much for comedies but this one did make me laugh and I think that all of the characters were pretty funny.

I had high hopes for it for a couple of reasons. National Lampoon Christmas Vacation is one of my all time favorite Christmas movies. In addition, there are simply not enough Thanksgiving movies - the whole holiday seems to get skipped over between Halloween and Christmas.The story was not a bad premise. However, it is the kind of movie that I kept watching thinking that I would laugh at any more moment. The story just keeps wandering with not much humor weaved in. The lack of laughter lead to a boring movie. I think I actually, and painfully, finished watching the whole movie.

I bought it because I read another one of Babson's books, \\"In the Company of Cats,\\" and I loved it. This one, however, was very much lackluster in comparison. It just seemed to drag on forever, especially with needless details. Do you really need to know what the coffee tastes like, down to the very last milliliter? Or what color every flower in the garden is? Are these clues supposed to help the reader solve the crime? It just felt like the story was trudging forward with few real plot twists. It wasn't exciting and definitely wasn't a \\"couldn't put it down\\" sort of book. At only 192 pages, it took me forever to read. Also, one of the reasons I wanted to read this book is because I love cats, and the cat in the book had no real role. The story wouldn't have lost anything without him.

Some of the foods are puzzling to this clod, but one of the author's hobbies is apparently cooking so I didn't mind. But a whodunit this is not.In a \\"real\\" murder mystery the reader is offered clues along the way so if observant and able to winnow the information at least can make a guess as to what has happened. No way in this book as all the critical facts are dumped on the reader virtually at the end. And that's where the killer openly confesses for no particular reason -- other than there's not an iota of evidence for an arrest, much less a conviction.

Rhine engages the reader by telling a number of tales; for example, the puzzling discovery of a body that looked female, but wearing male clothes, and how he determined the sex of the individual. He even tells us in a quite funny essay how he made enemies of the museum staff by boiling off the soft tissue of a body and causing people to vomit on the museum floor.All in all, a very practical view into the field. Rhine does not attempt to romanticize the profession; he merely tells his stories the way they should be told- very matter of factly.

A woman inadvertently distracts a bus driver into running a red light and kills a woman, and somehow believes that this was just his fault, and wants him to get fired from his job. She originally lied about what happened, and later tries to change her story with the police. The police do nothing, and I don't blame them. It was still an accident that she in part caused. She gets a lawyer with the help of the dead lady's friend. They somehow manage to get money from the bus companies insurance to a person that was related to the deceased but had nothing to do with her until money was mentioned. The bus company will not fire the bus driver which was her main intention. She gets angry and then the show ends. 90% of the characters in the movie have NOTHING to do with the plot, and is confusing to what part they even played in the movie.

And the fact that in the end nothing was even accomplished, the guy didn't even get fired, made it so much worse because there wasn't a \\"end product\\" that I could enjoy.

Avery's 5\\" binders (which I've purchased a few) - and other sizes they carry, in my opinion, are the worst binder construction of all manufacturers that I've experienced. This is mostly the case with their larger capacity binders. I have had to replace too many as, after short time, the clasps don't close or line up properly and sheet protectors get caught - it's a mess and very aggravating (which is what prompted me to write this scathing review after being aggravated by yet another defective Avery large capacity binder). Until they show that they care about the quality of the products they manufacture and sell for a hefty profit - and build a better quality binder, I will not purchase another Avery product - again, based on my own experiences with this product (had to add this so I'm not accused of libel)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty solid and secure","review":"I bought this for my expanding collection of song lyrics since I outgrew the 3-inch binder I had been using.

I like that it has the fold on the front cover to allow for over-capacity. My only complaint is that the rings don't line up perfectly, so when I'm flipping through the binder the pages catch on the partially exposed ring tooth. It's not a major problem, and I'm sure they don't all have this flaw, but I can see that it's wearing on the pages in my binder, so I'll probably eventually replace it with a new one of the same kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must-read for anyone who works in groups","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was very readable and well written. I appreciated how the viewpoints and examples used were neutral and usable regardless of the reader's perspective on any issue.Some of the more interesting points were: (1) an explanation of the pressure to conform, and why this pressure is surprisingly high even among those who consider themselves independent thinkers (2) the power of being first to speak in a group and the efficacy of a firm and confident tone (3) the two types of dissenters: contrarians and disclosers; and the importance of disclosing one's opinion and reasoning (4) discussion of \\"groupthink\\" and how group opinions form based on the group's members.I appreciated Sunstein's frequent reference to psychological studies.

It was a little difficult to understand, but the information in it is wonderful. I am still using it for apologetics in my college classes, and in my personal life. I'd recomend it for the person who wants to understand how their Christian beliefs are true, and how to present them to the public."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing study","review":"Doc. Noebel did a vast amount of research to put together this book. Everything he says about each worldview he backs up with quotes right from the people who are significant in that worldview. Much of what he says about, say, secular humanism comes right out of the humanist manifestos 1 and 2.

It sets the roadmap to where these three worldviews lead. Firmly establishes how humanism and Marxism have set the U.S. on a splippery slope to an immoral, socialist society. I understand why liberals don't like this book, it exposes them for what they stand for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Understanding The Times","review":"I ordered this book for a college class. What I found was that the book comes in numerous editions both unabridged and abridged. The main difference between this version and the current unbridged version is number of pages and that the author has separated out the New Age movement into an Appendix in later editions. Overall I think the book is good for a basic classroom setting. It does go into the basics of beliefs on Humanism, Marxism, the New Age Movement, and Christianity. This would be a good read for someone who just wants to learn about how each group views the world. Keep in mind though that the author writes the book from a Christian worldview."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought prevoking and wonderfully written","review":"I never understood exactly how world views fit together, and where my religion fit in.

Very good. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book clearly talks about all of today's religions","review":"After taking a course in school based on this book, and David Noebel's ideas, I feel more prepared to face the \\"real world\\".

H. Carr provides an overview of international relations theory at a time when it was not a defined discipline. The real value of this book is seeing just how far sighted E. H. Carr was. The book itself is a basic overview of the tenants of international relations theory using the twenty years between the two wars as a case study. It looks primarily at the realist model but also brings in ethics and international law into his discussion. For those who are looking for an entertaining and fun read of IR Theory this is a great place to go. It has several updated introductions for the more serious scholar but Carr's work itself is a great study for those interested in IR and has a real love of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realism Lite","review":"When we talk about realism, we often think about Kissinger or Morgenthau, both of which are awfully boring when one really tries to keep focused on their work.But E.H. Carr preceded both these fine gentlemen, and Carr is at his finest here displaying a sarcastic wit and overall nasty tone in ripping apart the overly idealistic liberal position adopted by Wilson, Kellogg or Briand, who really thought that world peace could be had through ineffectual action via international organizations and lots of talking between nations.Carr, in true realist guise (pre-Morgenthau, at least), doesn't elaborate on any principles that could be used to form a coherent theory. But the strengths of this book are in helping those who don't fully appreciate why WW2 came about understand the failure of liberalism, and in entertaining those of us in IR who are bored with the standard IR readings. This book is hilarious, and is certainly worth reading. Just don't expect it to be terribly profound."},{"rating":"1","title":"only another scholar can love","review":"This book can only be appreciated by other historians. The writing style is plodding at best. Reading this book requires too much time and concentration. I do not believe the great effort needed to get through this book resulted in my gaining much historical information.

This March, 1997 event has to be in the Top 5 most publicized, yet totally unexplained UFO sightings of all time. Interesting, too, that it occurred within a few months of the 50th anniversary of Roswell. And, I'm not convinced that Roswell wasn't of earthly origin - I can't say the same for the Phoenix lights.

Nothing flashy or overdone. A good DVD to have for those of us interested in this stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was expecting something different from this DVD. Practically the entire movie is just interviews with just a little bit of footage actually added in. The special effects are horrible, and don't really add anything to the simulated videos that are shown. There's very little actual footage here. To make matters worse, the interviews seem so biased. Every single person has the same opinions, basically stating they think this event was alien related. There's no skeptical point of view at all. It just would have been nice to see a little variety. After watching a few interviews, you start to predict what the next person will say cause they are all the same.

Frustrating. It only arrives at night, moves steadily in a relatively straight line; I hear no one mention which direction or at what speed the wind was blowing during this event.I think I heard that a few days ago someone in the Phoenix area put together something involving fishing-line, flares and balloons and wasn't too far off the mark as far as presentation.And why, just because it is unidentified does it have to be extra-terrestrial in origin?

However, this one is not good, to put it mildly. I mean, here Mallory is with her favorite author in the world, and she gets mad at her. Why? Because-and if you are reading this and you have never read this book, I promise that this is true- she found out that the author had a really horrible childhood, and all of her books are really cheerful. So Mallory gets mad because she says that an author is SUPPOSED to write about her own experiences, not something different. HeLLLOOOO? Does Mallory think that Jules Verne REALLY went 20,000 leagues under the sea, or that Agatha Christie REALLY murdered someone, or that Mary Shelly REALLY brought back someone from the dead? I kind of doubt that someone in real life would actually act like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with the other two readers...","review":"In this book, Mallory meets her favorite author, who writes generally uplifting books about a happy family. When Mallory finds out that the author (sorry, I forget her name) actually had an unhappy childhood, she accuses the author of lying in her books, which are meant to be fiction. Mallory should have understood that fiction can be sincerely written by an author without actually being based on the exact events of their life.This book just didn't have enough of a plot. There was very little action, and Mallory seemed to be a lot more disturbed by the fact that the author's books weren't based on her own childhood than a real person would. This idea could have been used as part of a much more complex storyline, but not as a \\"plot\\" on its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Biscuit Pan","review":"Love this pan.... easy to use.... easy to clean.A heavy duty feel to it.I bought it to make my buttermilk biscuits and cornbread recipes.I make my dough and spread it in the pan then when baked, cut into squares for serving.It is an easier way to make biscuits than rolling and cutting and the taste is marvelous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"i would like some information about the boomerang cd.","review":"hey my name is laura and i am a big fan of hansons. i was just wondering if i can get some information about the boomerang cd. i have been wanting that cd for along time. and if anyone have any why that i could get that cd. then would they please email me. thanx alot"},{"rating":"1","title":"A switch for Tina Leonard","review":"I have no qualms rating this book a \\"1\\".

Hence the Eye-Toy. It's basically a super cheap alternative to investing in a Wii and you can use it with you already owned PS2. It works pretty well too. Just make sure you have enough space and light in the room you place it, and have at it. Granted, it doesn't have as many games or the same distinct features as the Wii. And it has a couple kinks.

What brings this game down is the Eye Toy itself. In order for the camera to catch your every move, you'll need very good lighting.

Although they look like they could be nice pans, they arrived bent and very scratched."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chicago Metallic Logo Imprint embossed on sheet surface","review":"The pan I received seems to be of fairly high quality. It's going right back to Amazon unused, however, as it came with a feature not shown in the picture: a logo imprint upraised in the middle of the cooking surface, 1 1/4\\" x 3/4\\" x 3mm(approx height).This means that it's not perfectly flat in that area--scraping might be problematic. You can probably place some baked goods in a way that avoids the issue, but others might not have that option (I'm a novice baker so I don't know). Worst case, your baked good will be branded \\"Chicago Metallic.\\" Why bother when Lincoln / Vollrath makes perfectly good half sheet pans that avoid the issue?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice pans. How to remove the glue.","review":"The pans are good quality and heavy but not as stiff as I had thought.Glue is annoying but I got it off in a few steps:1) Take the label off. Some paper and glue will remain stuck.2) Wash with hot soapy water using soft sponge to get paper off and use finger to push/peel off as much of glue as possible.3) Dry thoroughly with paper towel.4) (Optional) Use nail polish remover and cotton balls to remove most of the glue.5) Use a good quality packing tape (e.g. Clear 3M Scotch tape) and stick the tape over the glue area and pull off to remove the glue. Do this under good light so you can see the dullness of the adhesive layer on the surface. Repeat as many times as necessary until the surface is uniform (no more trace of glue). Give it a final soapy wash.If step 5 is not satisfactory, do step 4 then 5. (Repeat as needed).My pan surfaces are pristine and I can't tell where the glue used to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves grey metallic powder on everything","review":"I don't understand why these sheet pans have such glowing reviews (they are the reason why we bought them). These half sheet pans are terrible!The good news is that they are sturdy with rolled edges and feel very substantial.The bad news is that the surface seems to flake bits of itself all over your hands, food, and cooking surfaces. After picking them up with bare hands, my hands are completely coated in grey powder that takes some serious scrubbing to get out. Our oven mitts are stained badly with it. Any food that comes in direct contact is covered in it, and I don't know how safe it would be to eat.We've only had these half sheet pans a short time, and they've been used less than maybe 20 times, but they are going in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I'm disappointed that it darkens with use and the insert actually states that it gets better as it darkens and improves the baking. Actually, dark utensils absorb more heat, therefore, it will indeed not improve the baking unless constantly monitoring and adjusting the heat....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"This pan begins to corrode as an alumunium pan would after a few washings.

Overall, i would not recomend this book because it's one of those books, that you'll just look through one time, and one time only!

And another thing, there are a lot of positions that are not even posible, and some only with a giant swing, or how about a horizantal or verticle pole...yeah many people have those in their houses.

First off, unless your into guy on guy, woman on woman, or multiple partners, this book might have no interest to you. The positions in this book are redundant, and most of which everyone has tried. The harder ones require great flexibility, which can be fun but there's not enough of them. They have half the book as the above mentioned, guy on guy, girl on girl and more then two people. This is definately not for just couples. if you're a couple and looking for a book to get hints from, this is not the book. Also, if you don't have horizontal and veritical poles in your house, that takes away another quarter of the book. So basically you're only left with the same positions everyone has tried numorous times."},{"rating":"1","title":"A joke book","review":"Most of the positions in this book are not humanly possible. The authors' intro to the book says it was written simply to catalog as many positions (with clever names) as they could think of. If you are looking for a book that offers sincere advice for positions, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Fun positions some a bit odd","review":"This book has some fun new positions my spouse and I never would have thought of but at the same time there are some positions that are just plain odd and impossible to do if you ask me. Also, it's supposed to be position of the day for each day of the year but after about 40-50 positions, they repeat with different names. Also the book combines hetero and homosexual couples which seems a bit odd for the opposite type."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feminist Conspiracy","review":"This book, authored by women, illustrates 21 positions in which the man goes down on the woman and zero positions in which the woman goes down on the man. (Unless you count the single illustration of 69, in which case this book illustrates 22 positions in which the man goes down on the woman and one in which the woman goes down on the man.) To add insult to injury, in a few of the illustrations in which the man goes down on the woman, the man appears to be licking the woman's anus. In short, as a man I don't feel that this book has my best interests at heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cartoonish","review":"Book would have been an exciting add. Unfortunately pics were cartoonish and positions were not described adequetly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of variety","review":"I would not recommend this to anybody. About 30 percent of the postions are repeat at least once, there are some that are repeated three or four times, just under a different name.

(none of which is going on in our house, or ever will). The rest of the positions are pretty average and nothing too interesting. There are a few, but not worth looking at drawings of three dudes all plugged into each other like game of leap frog gone terribly wrong. If I had known that I wouldn't have bought it. Save your money, try a different book, unless your horizons are that broad, then go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what i was expecting..","review":"The majority of the positions are completely crazy and unless you are 100% bendable you are unable to do them!

I should know that a white ribbon in a horse show is 4th- I have 2 of them! Still, good idea. ALSO- riding instructors should NOT let their riders pick what horse they want to ride; that could be bad for all 3, and maybe even cause fights. The horse and rider's bond wouldn't be as strong, either, and it takes at least a month to get to a canter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice writing style, poor information","review":"I usually enjoy Ann M Martin's books very much, but I'm not too impressed with the information in this book. A previous reviewer pretty much said it all- also I would not be happy to see an instructor that would let a collision almost happen. I know I didn't begin cantering for a few months after I began riding, as did most of the other riders my instructor trains. But I must say that the book has a wonderful writing style for that age group. =O)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poorly Written","review":"I'd have to say that I am VERY digusted with this book. An avid horse lover and reader, I have been riding since I was 6. Mallory's riding instructor shouldn't have called Mallory's mom--she should have made Mallory get back on unless she was broken or bleeding badly. And it dosen't take 3 lessons to canter. I think the writer should have done a little better job of doing research, even if she dosen't like horses. Some kid isn't gonna get the right information when they read this book. And Thoroughbred and Quarter-Horse are supposed to be capitalized (they are names of a breed)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good pan for breads","review":"I bake a lot and love this pan for baking loaves that require 8x4 pan.

It is otherwise a most excellent bread loaf pan."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite bread pan!","review":"I've owned it all, from department store pans, to stoneware and this is my favorite bread pan! I bought it on the recommendation of my most used \\"healthy\\" cookbook. When baking with whole grain flour (no white flour mixed in), your bread doesn't develop as much gluten as white flour and tends to fall in a wider bread pan. This pan is a good 1\\" narrower than the average bread pan size and it works absolutely fabulous with whole grain bread.This pan has a strong, sturdy construction and a great nonstick finish. I haven't had any trouble with my bread sticking to corners as was previously noted. The pan is lightweight (much lighter than stoneware!) and very easy to clean. Just a quick swipe and run under hot water and it's good to go.Buy this pan if you bake a lot of bread! You won't be sorry. I need one more to make my own kitchen complete."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fans of non-fat powdered milk, rejoice!","review":"The recipes in Frank C.

It's a shame that one can't give a book a minus star rating because this one certainly doesn't rate any better.For the first four chapters it was nothing but long boring descriptions of what people looked like and what they were wearing, and long boring conversations with a lot of characters that were too numerous to keep up with. Descriptions and conversation are necessary for a book. After all, an author is an artist who paints with words. But this was only descriptions and conversations. The chapters' scenes never left the chambers of the \\"heroine\\". There was no action, only conversations. She never went anywhere else. There was no action, no interest. Very dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweet & Savory Whimsical Little Tale","review":"In a reversal of roles, Lucrezia Borgia, synonymous with the use of poison, plays a detective to clear her name and find out who is killing the people in her court using a poison in medieval times called The Mother of All Poisons. Her buffoon of a third husband triggers Lucrezia's desire to play a detective by accusing her of killing a supposed mistress. All's well that ends well, the killer is found out, the husband, Alfonso, becomes enamoured with her while playing Watson to Lucrezia's Sherlock Holmes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucretia misrepresented.","review":"Lucrezia Borgia is one of the most misrepresented (and unfortunate) figures in history. She was never a poisoner, as anyone with knowlege of this period will know. The making of her into a detective to clear her own name is banal and unhistorical, which is not generally true of Gellis' other novels. Lucrezia lived happily, and in considerable affection with her third husband, who certainly never accused her of murder. This book is not one of Gellis' best and is not typical of her historical novels, which ususally take history seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow characters and thin story line","review":"First, it is only fair that I state that I am not a huge fan of \\"whodunnits.\\" However, I am a huge fan of historical fiction. I found this book to be boring and uninteresting throughout. The characters aren't well developed, the daily routines of Lucerzia Borgia and her two close ladies in waiting and the rest of the court are uninteresting and repetative, and it seems such a shame considering all of the real life drama, mystery and intrigue which surrounded this woman's actual life. The mystery element was uninteresting as well - I felt I was reading a book written for an adolescent audience. I was sorely disappointed in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miss Fannie's Hat","review":"I love everything Jan Karon has ever written. This is my favorite children's book.

I've finally gotten that smooth, almost crumbless texture that is a joy to frost.

The second part is about his accidental involvement of being the candidancy of the president of Peru. These two parts are twisted together.It is a clever choice.We do not follow his life in just a chronological way. The two distant parts of his life echoed in my mind. It reminded me that the sensitive child and the determined political figure are the same person.The part interested me most is his start as a professional writer by writing love letters and eroctic novels cor his classmates in cadet.But for the second part, if you are not so interested in politics in Peru, you will find it a little bit hard to read.If you are his loyal reader, you must find the book interesting.

A long time ago I was a Smashing Pumpkins fan (after listening to Adore... no wonder I dropped the obsession soon enough), but I have rediscovered the passion for their (or rather... Billy's...) music and lyrical sense. The only songs I didn't like on this CD was Sweet Sweet and sometimes Luna. Those two songs got a 3.5/5 from me, but the rest of the CD is perfect.

I used to attribute the success of this album, along with others, to the bands that played the music. But really, it would seem it was Butch Vig's involvement that really produced the popular sound of early 90's alternative rock. The heavy use of the Big Muff and other vintage 70's effects such as the Mu-Tron Bi-Phase...all of this contributed to some hugely successful albums. As soon as the Smashing Pumpkins changed producers, their popularity diminished, and their sound changed. This album really represents great studio work, and an understanding of what simply sounds good. Vintage analog effects will always surpass modern digital equivalents."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The killer in me is the killer in you...\\"","review":"Siamese Dream by Smashing Pumpkins really brought this indie rock band into the limelight. Frontman Billy Corgan has an unique voice and his songwriting is pure heart even when he sings about nothing profound. Songs like Today, Rocket, Maynnoise, and the song that got me hooked, Disarm (still one of my favorite songs of all-time). This is a great album from the early '90s and this cd was produced by Butch Vig who went on to form his own band, Garbage. Get this classic today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite album of all time","review":"This is the best album that I have ever listened to.

Boy, he was right...... \\"Siamese Dream\\" is a nostalgic, mellodic, well distorted and high-phased piece of grungy alt-rock music wrapped in Billy Corgan's poetic lyrics. Butch Vig's touch is highly felt in here, adding all those cute crutches and quirky guitar effects from the band. Favourites on the mellodic side of the album will be \\"Disarm\\", \\"Spaceboy\\" and \\"Sweet Sweet\\" whilst the favourites on the more distorted side will obviously be \\"Geek U.S.A.\\" and \\"Silverfuck\\"; Those two songs paved the way and (I'm pretty sure in this) influenced American aswell as British musicians to go on the same style. The Smashing Pumpkins are definately a band who makes artistic music, not artificial music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sophmore album","review":"so after the great Gish it was going to be hard to back it up. but Siamese Dream quickly establshes smashing pumpkins as a versatile band. i could already tell they are not going to do the same things over and over. this record was good and bad. some of the slow songs i wasnt too much into but some of them were great. And i thought the overall hard songs this time billy kinda shied away from the mike it seemed like he wasnt as into it. I know he has a timid voice but i still think he should gone into it more.

People give Billy grief for leaving shows early but I have to say that being a true fan of the Pumkins you either get it or you don't & I'm glad to say that yes, I GOT IT!!!!!!We even sent them flowers the last time they played Memphis & my 11 year old daughter loved every minute of the show & has seen them again after that in Dallas."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Grunge Album","review":"This is the best of the Smashing Pumpkin albums and is undoubtably one of the best albums of the 90's.

Other great songs include \\"Rocket\\", \\"Disarm\\", and heavy hitters like \\"Geek U.S.A.\\", \\"Quiet\\", and \\"Silverf*ck\\".

I cleaned it off as good as I could with some gruve glide but that's not really what that stuff was made for. It plays but it makes horrible noises when the it plays the parts of the record that had the goo on it, now I have an open LP that is un-listenable hence the one star rating.

My sister got it like 5 years ago and we listened only to the popular songs. But, I started listening to it again about 3 years ago, and I just can't get tired of it. I just got Gish and Mellon Collie, and they're both really great, but Siamese Dream just has something they don't. You know a band's good if you can't get tired of their album. Cherub Rock and Geek U.S.A. are amazing moshers. Soma is very heartfelt and emotional. So is Mayonnaise. But, I'd have to say that Hummer is probably on of my all time favorites by SP. I love the jam session at the end. So, this is their best I'd have to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"I will never get tired of this CD . . .","review":"Of all the Pumpkins' stuff, this has to be their greatest creation.

I owned the original CD and now many years later, I purchased the deluxe, digital edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Smaching Pumpkins album!","review":"This is without a doubt Smashing Pumpkins best album, I mean Meloncoly, Ador, Gish were all good but this blows them away. THis record is very Distorted, and very heavy Corgans Vocals, Lyrics, and Guitar playing make this band what was. Not a bad song, 'Geek U.S.A.' contains one of the best guitar solos of all time. 'Today' is the best song if their is a best song on the record, I mean all the songs are insanly good. The band is at the top of their game, though Corgans lyrics are not as good as on Meloncolly, this is the better album. This is really one of the top 10 albums of the 90s and top 100 of all time, if you like rock music you will like this so please pick it up"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sprawling, clever, essential pumpkins","review":"Any fan of Smashing Pumpkins who does not already own this needs to own this album. Any fan of late 80s/early 90s rock should own this album. Most music fans in general really should at least hear it. Siamese dream is slightly bolder than its predecessor, and therefore is a more sprawling view of the band's overall talent and Corgan's musical genius. I could go on and on about the album's intricacies and subtleties but ultimately it is just a well arranged, well played, well written, and well produced album showing a unique take on developing form of music for its time."},{"rating":"2","title":"DESERVES TO BE THE BEST IN 90S'","review":"when people just turned their attention to NIRVANA's never mind,they missed out an album which is a true legend in 90s',not because of the new sound they're having like OK COMPUTER or ODELAY but because of its soul & power & love which grow deep inside yr mind & last forvever ever since!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best album theSmashing Pumpkins have put togethe","review":"The Smashing Pumpkins started out pretty weak in the beginning, however, this CD is excelent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a kid. Too Lazy.","review":"This album is ok when you first hear it, it's one of those that grows on you as you listen to it more and more. I can really find a single flaw on the cd, it's perfection in itself. It doesnt really hurt music if it's simple. the question really is, is it good? yes it is good. buy this cd, if you dont like it at first, listen to it some more, it will probably grow on you. if you don't like it after that, give it to sombody, because somebody will like it. it doesnt deserve to be thrown out, like some music does.It isn't as good as some stuff out there, but it's good enough to be worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best, but..","review":"Easily a 5-star album, one of the best to come out of the 90's. I just need to point out something that's been bothering me and why it's been knocked out of my personal all-time favorite album position. Many have said SP is one of the most original bands out there. But this album ('93)is so derivative of My Bloody Valentine's \\"Loveless\\" ('91) that it's almost depressing. Don't get me wrong, it's brilliant and has moments of great originality musically, but the production and guitar tones sound like Kevin Sheilds, and Billy sounds unmistakably like Belinda Butcher, which he didn't on Gish. That said, this is still one of the best albums ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUSIC FROM ANOTHER PLANET?","review":"NO WAY THIS WAS MADE BY HUMAN BEINGS! I am simply in love with this record. This is definetley one of their greatest moments. Every thing about this record is fantastic - from first to last bite. Beauty, anger, love, hate, all the emotions are there. Folk, rock, psychadelia, over the top guitar solos, all the different musical elements/genres are there. I've had a copy for five years and it NEVER gets boring. I can't say enough good things about it. Buy this record and your ears (and mind) will thank you....again and again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"the album as a whole is very good, very easy to get hooked","review":"the album is very emotional, very true,it's very relateable to my life and many others.

When i watched the videos to this group it just seemed satanic and the visuals were like a timeless deformity had swallowed the universe. one of their videos was about the 70s.

Alot of this was experienced in my ears those first few months in Hell...I mean Florida. The first song I heard from this was \\"Today\\", and I thought it was good the first time I heard it as it was only a 30 second snipet that I heard, but then when I heard the entire song it was depressing, and then there was \\"Disarm\\" which I hated from day one, and the same with \\"Cherub Rock\\". I just felt like I shouldn't have even bought this at this particular time in my life, but I guess I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt. However, with one song barely tolerable which is \\"Mayonaise\\" I'm ready to dismiss this as one of the worst of the 90's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Layered Guitars and Bass upon layered guitars and bass. This album is the soul of my CD collection, it is simply awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joined At The Hip!!!!","review":"Not since Steely Dan and Boston has a group used the studio as an additional instrument along with guitar,bass & drums.The attention to detail is amazing and even the songs tempo shift and key changes make this required listening for three chord Charlies everywhere.Each song stand on their own merit from the build up opener Cherub Rock to the sweet open-ended closer Luna(which they improve upon on MCATIS'sGoodnight).Disarm uses cellos and acoustic power chords to unbelievable effect while Quiet's unexpected time signature change feels instinctual.Silver**** the one chord 8 minute jamfest is the epitomy of grunge improv while Mayonase was composed due to a junky guitars tendency to emit a wailing sound.Soma goes from dreamy to screamy and back.Like other visionaries of music Billy's not the greatest singer,but like Dylan before him,it's about what he's conveying than how he sings it.One of the greatest albums of the 90's Siamese Dreams has yet to be preceded."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite CD","review":"This is the CD that introduced me to the Pumpkins and it is by far their best CD! If you are a true fan of the Pumpkins, you must get this! Sure, Mellon Collie is good, if you just like what is \\"cool\\" but this is the CD that made them who they are today. Everything on this CD is p e r f e c t ! ! ! my personal favorite is Geek U.S.A."},{"rating":"2","title":"same as unedited","review":"for one, the song listing for this cd are wrong. the songs are the same as that on the unedited version. the change beween the two cds is so minute that it is hard to tell a difference. only a die-hard fan of the pumpkins such as myself could tell the difference and this is after listening to the two cds a couple of times. hence if you already have a copy of this cd, be it edited or not, DO NOT buy both copies. why wast your money on a cd you for the most part already have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Artistic Incredibility","review":"The Smashing Pumpkins are the reason that people like grunge/alt. rock. Every song on this album has a different feel, yet they all blend together to create a beautiful musical experience. For those that like their heavy guitar riffs and searing solos, Cherub Rock, Today, Geek U.S.A. and the absolutely amazing Rocket will satisfy that appetite. For those that like the mellower side of rock, Disarm, Soma and Spaceboy are quite fulfilling. Some songs blend both qualities, like Mayonnaise and Hummer. Corgan's vocals are amazing, all the guitarwork is poignant and creative, and the whole atmosphere of the album is one of technical beauty. This album shows that good songwriters can write good songs without watering down their abilities. Buy if you like music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sonic Triumph","review":"this cd really cooks. the sounds on the songs are just incredible and the passion is unmatched by SP on any other release that they will come up with. The songs have a great catch to them, and SPACEBOY is just icing to a great cake. This is worth anyones time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange, Beautiful Music","review":"After listening to Siamese Dream for the first time, nearly ten years after it's realease, I couldn't help but wonder why I had never heard of this album before. Siamese Dream contains some of the most imaginative and innovative guitar riffs of it's time. Songs such as \\"Cherub Rock\\" and \\"Hummer\\" have riffs the listener will always remember. Each song is a different musical experience. From screaming guitar solos to \\"Disarm\\", with an orchestral arrangment, Siamese Dream is one of the most melodic and diverse cd's to ever be recorded and will always be one of the best ever. If you like any kind of music at all, you will like this cd. Believe me and get your hands on this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great anytime gift for that special someone(your kid/teen)","review":"I am thirteen and a half, and i want to let everybody know that this album STILL rocks! You may have read the other reviews by now that say \\"this song is great!\\". im not going to do that because... well, they are all great! My favorite song on the album is Disarm because when i was little my dad would play it and tell me what they were singing about (although now that i am older i forgot it ;-) This album comes a little bit over my like of MCATIS, which is regaurded by most SP fans their best album. This one has harder riffs and doesnt make you need to skip a few of the boring songs, because every single one of them is highly enjoyable. This CD is a GREAT buy for any fan of Nirvana, Smashing Pumkins, or 90's rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my very favorite albums","review":"Siamese Dream is the best Smashing Pumpkins album. Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness is a close second, and is also a classic, but Siamese Dream is special. Every song is amazing, except for the last two, which are just there to allow your mind to recover from being blown 10 times. The album is full of infectious melodies, layers and layers of guitar fills and solos, intros, outros, interludes, and amazing drums. Even the lyrics are great (they actually seem to have a point unlike with some other alternative bands of the era), and Billy Corgan sounds better on this record than on any of his others.I would put this one in the top ten albums of the nineties, which is saying something."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best ever made","review":"together with adore, siamese dream is the best CD made by the pumpkins, and one of the best ever made. mayonaise is my personal favorite. the record has a light sound with some rock every now and then. the soft songs are most enjoyable to listen to though. the lyrics and the melodies are simply ingenious. nothing more to say, just: well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Modern Rock Masterpiece","review":"This is, in my opinion, the greatest Smashing Pumpkins album there is, followed by a very close \\"Melon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\\".From the first riffs of \\"Cherub Rock\\" to the beautifull \\"Disarm\\" to the purely wonderful \\"Mayonaise\\" the Pumpkins take us through a world of adolesence, rage and appretiation of beauty. Every song on the album just gives and gives with all of their joy, anger and beauty.Technicly, it is a mastered album, wonderfully produced and full of great music. It goes from pulsing rock on \\"Cherub Rock\\", right to a string quartet wonderfully playing on \\"Disarm\\". Every song is unique and the album as a whole is an innovation.Quite possibly the greatest album of the ninties, it plays with such sorrow and such interprative lyrics it should stimulate, intrege and soothe any soul. A must have for any Pumpkins fans or just anyone looking for a break from the shallow, meaningless music of most of the bands of the ninties.Thanxs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Dream\\" come true.","review":"As much as I like \\"Gish\\", I consider \\"Siamese Dream\\" to be their best album. The 2-disc \\"Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness\\" is amazing as well, but it's almost too much, and isn't solid front to back like this one is. This disc is power, and art, and beauty, and the epitome of alternative rock. Included is the excellent opener \\"Cherub Rock\\", \\"Today\\", \\"Spaceboy\\" and \\"Disarm\\". And as good as those are, I actually love \\"Soma\\", \\"Rocket\\", \\"Luna\\", and \\"Geek USA\\" even more. Track after track is incredible, and is what makes this one of the top five albums of the 1990's. Casual fans might get by with the \\"Greatest Hits\\", but this is a must for everyone else. It's so \\"Sweet Sweet\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! (Recently discovered this classic)","review":"I was never a big Pumpkins fan when I was in school. I was 11 when this CD came out and I never got into it. Recently though I've discovered just how excellent all of this album is! My favorites are: 1) Today, 2) Disarm 3) Cherub Rock 4) Spaceboy and 5) Silver***k."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite album of all time","review":"I bought this CD in 1996 when I was 12 years old. When you are 12, you are not a complete person, and your personality is not fully formed. You are still easily influenced by the things around you, and they help decipher the person you will become in adulthood. Along with the toddler years, preadolescence is the most vulnerable and easily manipulated time of one's life. I bought Siamese Dream in Chicago, and I have not looked back since. Basically what I'm saying is that this album shaped who I am today. It is the most important music in my life. Billy Corgan will always mean something to me, no matter what he does in the future. He's my John Lennon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smashing","review":"If you can't fully appreciate the music of the Smashing Pumpkins then you don't know what your missing. Although their music has developed and changed a lot over all their albums, any true Pumpkins fan will like all their music. As stated in another review, a lot of their music is not music you just play in the background, you have to play it loud and sort of feel the music. Being a 14 year old, the instant appeal songs attracted me at first. Songs such as Today, Disarm, 1979 and Tonight, tonight. But also, being a 14 year old, I am impulsive, so I bought all their albums. At first I just listened to the songs that I liked after listening to them once. Now I like every single song by them, except maybe one or two on the album Machina. Unfortunately when songs such as Today were big hits (1992-1993), I wasn't particularily interested in the Pumpkins, so I haven't seen the music videos for a lot of their songs. The Smashing Pumpkins will always be my favourite band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have album!","review":"This is, in my opinion, Smashing Pumpkins' best album. \\"Gish\\" and \\"Mellon Collie and Infinite Sadness\\" are also good, but this is their masterpiece. Still has a unique sound to me- imagine how unique it was then..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some people just don't know what they're missin'!","review":"The Pumpkins' Siamese Dream is a lovely rock album with its fuzzed-out guitar wanderings and beautifully-bizarre lyrics that only us Pumpkins fans can appreciate, and dare I use the L-word... Love? Of course, the same can be said about their debut Gish, but Siamese Dream has a slightly delicate edge to it that makes it more dear to me. \\"Today\\" and \\"Disarm\\" are my absolute favorites, but there are quite a few gems in there alongside material that sounds like a massive wall of noise to an unfamiliar listener. The person below who only likes the Siamese Dream singles is missing out on more than they realize when they say they aren't going to try listening to another certain Pumpkins album. That's a hint to run over to a place that lends out CDs (like your library) and borrow \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\\"! It's such an amazing double disc set! \\"Bullet With Butterfly Wings\\", \\"1979\\", and \\"Tonight Tonight\\" are nary impossible to not enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Right Up There With Mellon Collie...","review":"This is one great frickin cd. Every cd the Pumpkins ever put out was a masterpiece in itself, but this one and Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness right after are the two best. A lot of my friends don't really like these songs because the singles like \\"Today\\" and \\"Cherub Rock\\" are too happy. He uses the word honey in Cherub Rock and in Today he sings \\"Today is the greatest day I've ever known\\". Well I just have to say each song has a dark undertone to it, making you have to dig in to each one. That's what I liked about all the Pumpkin's songs. In Today you have to listen to ALL of the lyrics because one line is \\"I wanted more than life could ever grant me\\". That's not very happy. Oh well, the millions of fans out there know all this, and everyone should own this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"1993 would be dead without this album","review":"and there's plenty good to say about \\"siamese dream:\\"the band was on the verge of some kind of implosion when this was worked on, thus there's plenty tension in the way they play together. factually, billy did a lot of work on this baby, so in essence it's his album alone. oh boy, but those pumpkins... my god, they rock on this album. quietness and rockinness abound."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums every made!","review":"Well, I have to admit that I am a bit biased because my favorite band is the Pumpkins, and because several of the other \\"best albums ever made,\\" in my eyes, are by the same band. This album gave birth to the Pumpkins as we know them today with such hits as Today and Disarm. There is a bit of everything on this CD, starting with the hard in Cherub Rock all the way to the other extreme in the melodic Mayonaise. This is a fantastic CD! A definite must-have for anyone's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dense, complex, striking album","review":"Siamese Dream is an outstanding album. Its strengths are not immediately apparent, for the album is so thick with sound that it takes some time to pick up the melodies and lyrics. But after a while, it becomes almost addictive. The songs are complex and moving. \\"Cherub Rock\\", the opener, is a loud and catchy rock ballad; \\"Today\\" is one of the greatest songs of the decade, and \\"Disarm\\" is a haunting acoustic number that seems to be a metaphor about losing childhood. Though those previous three songs were the album's big hits, there are other phenomenal points, especially \\"Geek U.S.A.\\", which shows the Pumpkins knack for contrast, alternating between various \\"songs\\" (think Queen's \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\"). True to Pumpkins' nature, most of the album has a melancholy, angst-ridden feel, though there are some glimmers of positive to be found. Overall a truly remarkable album, the one that really launched the Pumpkins' career."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is pure musical goodness . . . the world needed this","review":"This is an excellent CD if there ever was one. Possibly the best Pumpkins CD ever. I am a huge fan of the Smashing Pumpkins, and I love this CD. It's solid gold."},{"rating":"2","title":"devastating","review":"It would only let me pick up to 5 stars out of 5, the person who came up with that idea obviously hasn't heard siamese dream.This album is the best in history so far....and I doubt I will see it toppled from this position in my lifetime (with Mellon Collie taking number 2). With the pumpkins its like ultimate extremes, you love em or you hate em, but if you love em, it truly redefines music.My picks are Cherub Rock, Disarm, Spaceboy, and then there's Mayonaise which is just in an entire leage of its own. This song is beyond description, just listen to it every day without fail for 7 years like i have and you'll see..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A current rating for an old album...","review":"I broke this album out a few weeks ago, after not listening to it for awhile. Wow...perfect doesn't even describe it. There isn't an album like it, and there never will be. It strikes all cords, runs the gammut, and delivers all the time.Want an album that soothes, thinks, speaks, helps, can wish a life into the world, and can satisfactorally let one leave it in peace?This is the one. You always hear about 'what album would you want on a deserted island'?I know of a few, and this one definitely works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album, nice vinyl reissue","review":"I bought the new reissue of the album on vinyl and it is nice. It is a double LP. Plays well. Album is great, of course.The LPs are in thin paper inner sleeves, but together with them included additional inner sleeves made of thicker paper. These have writings on them (names of the songs etc). I don't know why they did that and if we are supposed to get rid of the thin sleeves. The problem is that if you want to keep everything as it came, it is really hard to take out and then slide back in the LPs.

After hearing them perform live a few times, I was impressed that their c.d.'s performance matched their stage performace, a feat I never deemed possible. The guys put the same amount of energy, talent, and fun into their songs as if they were performing live. The guitars are tight, the synth is awesome, and the drums are kickin'! The band comes together on every song and pours out raw emotion, which,in a world where the excessive teenie bopper junk has permeated the once halfway decent music scene, is something you don't see too often nowadays. Veronica is a breath of fresh air for music lovers everywhere, myself included."},{"rating":"2","title":"Treetops Oustanding Classic Sound","review":"The song writting and production on this album are excellent. Good music from start to finish. The group had a great sense of melody with each song they wrote, and the production is a pleasing, and interesting mixture of instruments used to back up these excellent gems.

Johnny sings from the heart and soul when singing about the great railroad lines of times past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey, Netflix got it!","review":"What a delight! Just got a copy of this from Netflix! Wow, does this bring back memories!!! As a child my father made a tape recording of the audio from this show and we would listen to it again and again...Johnny Cash brings to musical life the rise and fall of the American Railroad Experience. Each vigniette is framed by the Man in Black singing his own classics like, \\"John Henry\\" and (of course) \\"Ridin' The Rails\\" and covers such as \\"The Night We Drove Old Dixie Down\\" and \\"City of New Orleans\\" At over 30 years old, it's pacing feels a bit strange and rushed compared to modern documentataries - but viewed as an extended music video, it is great fun.Can't wait for Amazon to have it in stock and own a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"American railroad history as told though legendary musician Johnny Cash","review":"Few musicians loved the railroad as Johnny Cash did, and that love shone through in this film production from 1974. Starting with the development of the steam locomotive, Cash guides the viewer through major events in American railroad history up through the creation of Amtrak. At a time when few would have believed so, Johnny Cash knew that the railroad still had a future in America.As for the video itself, while it may not be remastered like other cinematic classics have been, at least it is still enjoyable to watch. Fans of Johnny Cash and Railfans alike will enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"ridin' the rails with Johnny Cash is real fun","review":"i watched this video yesterday night and i was surprised. it's really a good combination of a country music video, people used to say a \\"concept album\\", and the history of the transcontinental railroad, the locomotives, and the stories told about it by Johnny Cash. also contains some good reenactments of the whole stuff.the main title \\"ridin' the rails\\" has some very fine harmonies of the instruments and it's truly another great song of Johnny Cash. every fan should have listened to it as i did several times. today this song was still on my mind while i was ridin' the rails to get to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of features, good price, ... pathetic picture quality","review":"I purchased one of these sets ... because of the excellent price and feature set.

But like anything new it took my time and effort to install it. Within weeks it was getting bad color halos on the screen. I called and Target said it was my cable - it was loose and maybe not coming in right. OK I checked out everything and all aspects with the cable were OK BUT the set was still not looking right! BUT this all took my time! So I kept it a while longer and then just like one of the other reviews the TV started cutting off. At first this was infrequent and then this got worse! It is so bad that I decided to look at this site and make a report before I returned the set. Hopefully, since it is within 90 days they will give me my money back. This set obviously has a number of defects and makes me think that for whatever the price it is NOT WORTH the hassle!

I was very happy with it for the first 3 months I owned it, then the picture quality started to deteriorate and has rapidly grown worse.After 6 months of use, the TV had a pink semicircle band on the right side of the screen and a green semicircle band on the left side. At the moment, there is still an hourglass shaped area down the middle of the TV that is showing real life colors. This problem can be caused by placing speakers too close to a TV (this is the customer service response which I have recieved), but I didn't have speakers in the same room as this TV.I have been following up with Philips and Best Buy, but at this point the customer service from both has been poor.I recommend avoiding Philips products, especially this model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"FRONTIERS is Psycho le cemu's second major album, and it hit Japan with quite a storm of popularity. The 14 tracks that it comes with are all very good in my opinion, having an upbeat feel for the most part. Psycho le cemu is basically Japan's only pure 'visual' band, and they portray that very well! Their music isn't really rock-like at all, but has more of a pop, dance-like feel to it! If you are a fan of Plc, or just JPop in general, then I greatly suggest this album. If you're into more Dir en grey sounding things, then this album is not for you.

The book reveals the origins of the criminal organisation and social phenomenon that is ruling the world and very sadly shows why that is never going to come to an end.Deeply rich characters, charming descriptions, explains our society in a way I can hardly recall anyone doing in the recent past. Sequel to the Godfather? No, it provides the perfect background.Brilliant job Puzo !"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Welcome Change of Pace","review":"This novel is almost a segue for Puzo. It introduces a new story, with the help of well known plot lines and characters, namely Michael Corleone being \\"exiled\\" in Sicily.Although the novel has very little to do with the Corleone family, it is a fantastic story, and very well written. Through a clever plot, the reader constantly wonders who the \\"bad guys\\" are. The reader is likely to flip flop several times, which makes the novel excellent for group discussion.In any case, I'd give the story 5-stars, and the writing 3 1/2 stars. Although the story is fantastic, Puzo often relies on cliche terms and phrases, which drag on the story in my opinion. However, it is a must read for any Puzo/Godfather fan, and a great stepping stone into his other novels"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sicilian","review":"Mario Puzo had one good book in him. this is definitely not the one! stay away from this book there r too many better ones"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mario Puzo's epic tale of friendship, deceit and love","review":"90 out of 100 have heard of \\"The Godfather\\", but not many people know of \\"The Sicilian\\", Mario Puzo's epic tale of friendship, deceit and love and follow-up to \\"The Godfather\\".

Once I was almost finished, I couldn't stop.The book is a fantastic mix of mafia, Italian and Sicilian history, and a fictional story of twists and turns in which the good guy doesn't always win. Puzo does an excelent job of describing the terms that apply to the mafia lifestyle, as well as his wonderful descriptions of the towns and places that the story takes place in. On top of that, it is an outstanding story that keeps you guessing as to what will happen next. I'm not sure anyone could predict the the outcome of the various sub plots that take place throughout The Sicilian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Masterpiece of Puzo!","review":"A great story of a legendary hero's fight for justice and for the poor of Sicily in a web of deceit, treachery and corruption of the Mafia."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"Oh, this book... I can't begin to explain my love for The Sicilian. Guiliano is a character you want to root for yet can't help being shocked by at times. The insertion of Michael Corleone just gives a little more insight to all that we didn't see while he was away.I think this about most everything Puzo has written, but I think it's so sad that this was published too late to have a young enough Al Pacino play Michael.

My expectations were up, and I was let down. The novel is about a young Sicilian revolutionary who fights against the mafioso establishment and police corruption that keeps his family and fellow countrymen perpetually indentured.

Since I do a lot of cooking and baking I find myself using it a lot. I am able to pour boiling hot water into it without any problems. It is best to not use it to measure oils since you tend to leave some behind. Also I find the lid that comes with it to be pretty much pointless. I just leave it sitting in a drawer and have not used it once since I purchased the beaker. My major problem with this is that over the years cracks have begun to develop along the bottom and sides of my container. It hasn't caused any leaks but I am sure I will need to buy a new one eventually. Until then it still serves it purpose well.

It just seems like it should cost $1-2, not $8-10."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting shape, great measuring","review":"I really like the unusual shape on this measuring cup. The only downside is that you can't fit a whisk in down to the bottom to stir together the wet ingredients before adding them to the dry, which you can generally do with the standard 2-cup measuring cups. I love that it has so many different options around the sides for measurements, including 1/8th cup marks. I have also been somewhat annoyed by the tendency of the base to collect water in the dishwasher - I'll have to try that recommendation to drill a small hole (but why the manufacturer couldn't just do that for us...)

Simply drill four holes in the base (~1/8\\" does nicely) just below where the bottom of the measuring compartment meets the base. The plastic curves such that it is would actually be hard to drill into the measuring volume.

I'm going to get right on that. Since we purchased this our pyrex measuring cups have sat unused in the cupboard.Maybe one made of glass would be nice in some instances, but this is a great \\"Perfect Beaker\\".

Although the plastic is durable and high quality, pyrex would hold up better in the long run.As for its practicality, it's hard to beat this little beaker. The graduated measurements make it extremely easy to read and to fill. It is very well balanced and doesn't tip over when liquid is poured into it, which was a fear of mine when I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"too fragile for daily use.","review":"At first this seams like a great measuring cup. It can measure in just about every measurement and is more accurate for small measurements. The dissadvantages however show up pretty quickly. It says dishwasher safe but the dishwasher will quickly scratch it and it will appear very cloudy. It is extremly light and you will drop it sometime as a result. This thing is more fragile than glass and the base especially can break rather easily as the quality of the plastic leaves something to be desired. There is not spout and pouring sucks. In reality if it wasn't made from cheap plastic this would be just about the best measuring glass possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice design, defective printing, don't trust plastic","review":"I love the design. Very nice. The plastic seems too weak. I'd be afraid to put anything warm inside it. Need to be able to measure hot items in cooking. I'd never put it in the microwave. It would be a great design to melt butter for recipes, but I wouldn't trust it to survive the heat.Mine was defective also. The printing up near the rim was missing. It was some printer error. The labels that tell you what each scale refers to didn't print. There was one that printed about half way (pint) but all of the others were completely missing. I'd have no idea what I was measuring with each scale: ml? oz? grams? cups? no way to know what the scales refer to.I'm returning it to Amazon. Maybe I'll find a glass one in a laboratory supply."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect beaker.","review":"The reason I like this is it has the potential of not needing to use multiple measuring tools in one kitchen session. Saving some cleaning time and less clutter. Around the beaker are many units of measurements. Pint, ml, oz, tablespoon, cup, etc. Alas, I am looking for the line where it says 1 tablespoon, it doesn't have any, it starts with 2 tablespoons (but fine, that's a no biggie). It is small at the bottom but the base is very stable.This beaker is made of light and thin plastic. If this is made of heavy duty material like lexan or the one they use for making football helmets, then I have no reason not to rate this 6 stars! It has a lid. In fact the reason I picked this even if it was unavailable during the time I placed the order was because the other item in consideration did not mention if it has any lid.

It's easy to read and is easy to use since it's not glass. Unfortunately, inside of six months of regular use, the plastic began to crack all around the beaker. I'm not sure if the issue was the dishwasher or the microwave or what, but I wouldn't buy one again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as expected","review":"I've only used it a few times, and it works as expected. I wish there was a glass version, though. I don't like how plastic tends to get scratched. I haven't tried the lid yet, so I can't say how well it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as perfect as it claims","review":"One of the best parts about this (and actually draws some fire from other reviewers) is that it's plastic, which means no meniscus when measuring water. It's actually easier than a glass measure because of that.There is, unfortunately, a downside. It doesn't matter how easy it is to measure when it's not accurate. Because it IS so inaccurate, this piece is almost worthless for being more than a decoration.It's a 6-star concept.

The clacker on the maraca doesn't work nd the maraca itself doesn't shake like a regular maraca. It is more like aplastic rain stick. I recommend getting $1.00 baby sized Maracas somewhere else.

However, when I tryed to play the sd card, it crapped out. I found out through numerous experiments that is only plays a 1 gb sd card. The 4, 8 and 16 gb cards did not play. So this essentially makes this player a 2 gb player. The other thing that I found annoying was the controls on the player.

Also, the audio level is low enough that I could barely hear the music at all in a busy office. You can turn it up higher but then the audio drops out on musical peaks.

Certain scenes were also rehashed from earlier books, such as the scene in the sauna/ bath house, and came across as very repetitive and unimaginative. The romance with Irina was very sappy; I mean, the two haven't seen in each other for years, she treats him coldly, and then a few days later (while he's bleeding from a near-death experience) they have sex and decide to stay together?

I really felt like this book did a good job of letting you into the personal lives of these firemen. I really felt like I had known each man my whole life.

Too often he attempts to create symbols with nothing to back them up. The book is clearly forced. The publishers should have allowed him not to publish it rather than force an embarassment onto the market. There was little or no coherence or meaning in each story, and less in the connection of all of the stories. Some nuts may say that this is a work of pure litereary genius, but I urge thos people to disregard the author and his reputaion as a genius and focus on the text. The reader must not assume that there is something to the words just because Dylan wrote them. Dylan should stick to writing song lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real treasure","review":"For the Dylan fan this book is a real treasure just as is his music.

It is one of the most important primary reference tools for the study of scripture available. The writing style is rich in language and challenging in the application of exegetical principles. Schnieders also provides the standard by which most theology schools and seminaries structure their understanding of sacred scripture within a historical context. Her language has now become the common form of expression in theological conversations today. The only difference between this re-printed version of The Revelatory Text and Schnieders' first edition is the second preface. Since Schneiders wrote a classic the first time, she now only needs to comment briefly on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 stars for effort...","review":"Sandra Schneiders has in this work provided students and theologians alike with an invaluable resource on hermeneutical study, and post-modern Biblical scholarship. Her attempt to work with the text from an existentialist experience is refreshing considering the complete secularisation of Scripture by other authors. However, when engaging her example hermeneutic of suspiscion, I asked myself, \\"Is this Christian existentialism or is it Feminist existentialism.\\" Once again, infant Christianity appears as the butt of a scholastic enterprise that projects current ideology onto ancient text, and what makes this all the more difficult is that it involves at times imaginative reconstruction. Despite its reflection of popular white middle class ethic, this book is a handy resource, if only for its dealings with 'scientific methodology', and Schneiders' immense notions of spirituality refreshingly engage Sacred text, filling a vacuum in modern academic theology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book, must have for poets, poetry readers","review":"An invaluable aid to anyone interested in reading or writing poetry.Arranged alphabetically, as you would suspect, the book covers forms, poeticmovements, the elements of poetry, and rhetorical devices.

I doubt that it has recorded 5 DVDs and certainly hasn't been used more than 20 times to watch movies.It is still covered under parts warranty but I don't believe that its worth getting fixed.

However, a few months ago it just stopped reading DVDs -- and I just got this for Christmas '06!

I replaced the old OEM 256 K with the new 1GB side by side with a previous 1 GB upgrade. Result - 856K total - less RAM! So I swapped all three around to see if one was a culprit. Both 1G units only gave 856K alone. The Kingston unit would not combine with the old 256K and both only gave 856K.

The product worked really well for a few months...This is why I was so disappointed when the exfoliating beads disappeared only within a few months! I have half the bottle left and all I have left is the cleanser. I am so disappointed that this happened after paying for the product. I don't know if mine was a dud, but be wary that you might end up with disappearing beads within a few months!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!","review":"This microdelivery exfoliating wash has become part of my morning routine. I absolutely love the way it makes my skin look and feel. It's not rough on your skin at all. I've tried many different exfoliating washes and have noticed they either use large, rough shells or grains that irritate your skin or they have a heavy, oily feel. This one is different. The consistency is gel-like, and the grains are very, very fine. When you massage it into your skin for 30-40 seconds, it feels like getting a facial. When you wash it away, it just leaves your skin feeling clean without leaving redness. The more I use it, the better my skin looks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Example-A-Thon","review":"I was expecting a book which showed you how to draw beautiful plans and explain the techniques used to produce these drawings.

Let's stop making heroes out of these Zionist colonizers. The reader would do far better to read an honest work like \\"The Holocaust Industry\\" by Norman Finkelstein. As a Jew I'm offended by the whole rotten history of Zionist ideology. Our great religion calls for \\"tikkun olam\\"--the healing of the world! This great compassionate and humanistic teaching is inherently contradictory with Zionism, which is pure and utter racism. Zionism is is also simply just a replay of European colonialism in a thinly veiled disguise. How can we practice \\"tikkun olam\\" while we savagely repress the legitimate rights of the Palestinians to their national aspirations and their land? Let's stop making heroes out of generals and thugs.

Check out this site for instructions on tuning your bow to your broadheads: [...].The number 1 thing I like best about Muzzy Broadheads is the fact that they have practice blades. Practice blades will extend the life of your target by up to 10 times, they are much easier to pull out of the target, and you do not cut yourself while using them. Plus, if you feel the blades on your broadhead aren't sharp enough, you can put new blades on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, don't waste your money","review":"I bought these because I thought they were a good deal for the money.

Unfotunately on this particular Cd I got the quality on that song isn't the way I remember it, the cd must be worn over the years, although it looks like new it no longer sounds like new. Maybe the person who owned the cd previously played the song over and over, its such a special song.

It rained today, and the spotlights collect water if you aim them upwards (for instance towards a tree). The rubber seal is designed to be water resistant but not water proof. It is not designed to be immersed in water. As a result, the water leaked past the seal where it was now trapped inside the semi-sealed compartment. Light bulb wire will rust out in a matter of a couple weeks under these conditions. I did a search on other review sites and sure-enough, people are having to replace the bulbs every few weeks. Fortunately I identified the problem quickly. I am now considering whether to return them or attempt to fix the design flaw myself. Malibu: Hire an engineer. On the plus side, the light sensor works well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rugged set of Low Voltage lights","review":"I bought these lights several years ago (four or five years), and they are still working perfectly well. I have gone through a couple of bulbs, but the floodlights and the power pack continue to work as designed. Rather than mounting these into the ground, I mounted them up in the rafters of a covered patio we had built. They play down in the 4 corners of the patio onto drapes, and they create the perfect mood at night, making the patio more of an extension of the living room than some outdoor space. These lights and the drapes help to create that perfect mood."},{"rating":"2","title":"misunderstood in St. Louis","review":"The review from St. Louis is misleading because the reviewer doesn't understand that this CD actually contains music from both Great White and April Wine.

Evidently, #ICF-C143 comes with two different LED display colors: green & orange. Don't bother to look for something else.Pro:Small-sized cube (similar to #ICF-C121, but more edgy & stylish looking)Large LED display with adjustable background lighting (3 levels)Power backup {my old one never had this}Very fast forward/backward clock adjustment {great improvement}Digital radio tuner (15 presets: 10 FM & 5 AM)Strong-radio-signal-reception antenna - Sony electronics is usually bad at this!

This unit has surprisingly good sound for being mono. I like the nap feature and the direct tuning buttons. Reception is very good, as I have been able to pick up a station in Charlotte, which is 90 miles away. I agree that it is odd that the alarms are limited to one being buzzer and one being radio. I listen to the radio when I go to bed, and keep it at a low volume. Luckily, I am a light sleeper, and the volume is enough to wake me. While shopping for clock radios I noticed that the majority of them have a traditional &quot;dial-type&quot; volume, even though the tuner is digital. If the volume were digital as well, then the user could set a preferred volume level for the alarm. I also thought it was unfortunate that Sony did not include a battery back-up."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Green Light that wouldn't die!!!!","review":"Great features, love the digital radio tuner/presets and one-touch daylight savings time button .

Kuehnelt-Leddihn separates the values of liberty fr om democracy, laying out a detailed, well reasoned argument for why democracy not only not the best for of government for ensuring liberty, but in fact the worst. Not necessarily utterly convincing to an American reader, but fascinating nevertheless. The second half of the book deals with the historical trends and political developments that lead up to the formation and rise of the National Socialists in Germany and Austria. Written in the 50's, it offers a different, more holistic story of the rise of the party, and links it firmly to the (Non-National) Socialist movement of contemporary Europe.

After contacting the compnay, I was told that it is no longer under the warranty (90 days), but that I could send $85 to have it replaced (plus cost of shipping broken one back).

From the easy rhythm of \\"New Kid in Town\\" to the soaring \\"Mary Did You Know,\\" the songs enchant and enfold the listener in the spiritual dimesion of the season.

There are many other versions of \\"Mary, Did You Know?\\" but this one is so moving that, after countless listenings, it still makes me cry with its lovely warmth. Two of my other favorites on this CD are the old folk hymn \\"Brightest and Best,\\" which Ms. Mattea delivers with simple beauty, and the equally gorgeous \\"Emmanuel.\\" \\"Somebody Talkin' \\"Bout Jesus\\" is a fine song with a gospel feel. This is an album I have recommended to many friends, even those who normally dislike \\"country\\" music, and especially people who are dismayed by the commercialization of the holidays. This is simple, homey music that celebrates Christmas in moving, honest emotion.

The author, who recieved her Ph.D from the University of Minnesota, was inspired to write the text while working for the Hazelden Treatment Center. She recognized that a woman's recovery can be based on other factors than those that apply to men; and wrote a text for a womens audience. In the book, there is an essay on recovery for each day of the year. These essays are preceded with an appropriate quotation and followed with a suggestion for meditation. I have used this book successfully with many of my clients and highly reccomend it for professional libraries and for the general public."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written for 12-Step Programs","review":"When I purchased this book, I was looking for a daily reader with strong, inspirational stories for women. I did not realize the book was specifically a 12-step book. Although I appreciate the 12-step traditions, I find this book actually reinforces some of the things I was trying to get away from, including extreme emphasis on accepting things as they are. Again, I appreciate the 12-step traditions, including the concept of serenity. However, many people seem to accept things that they actually can change because they do not acknowledge their power to make those changes. In my opinion, this book promotes such a perspective. The other criticism I have is that it is somewhat heavy on God, and even though it may not be explicit, it is clear that this is from a traditional religious perspective. If you are looking for a 12-step book that is God-focused, then this should work for you. If not, I would recommend continuing your search."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cyberlink PowerDVD 7 Full Version from OC Tech Deals","review":"I purchased Cyberlink PowerDVD 7 Full Version from OC Tech Deals and received a OEM bundled version that was labeled \\"not of resale\\".

Everything we've ever put in it has come out burned. Even toasting is also impossible. Bread comes out partly burned, partly untoasted. The timer is useless, because you can't set it to a small enough time to avoid burning whatever you've put in the oven.Ours hasn't exploded, like those of some other reviewers, but steam comes out of the door while it's on. The instruction manual said not to worry about this, but it's a little hard not to, now that we've heard about the exploding ovens. The escaping steam seems to have discolored the handle of the oven, too. The interior of the oven may be easy to clean, but we haven't been able to clean the handle.We're afraid to donate it to a thrift store.

To perfectly sum up what goes on, our hero is traveling with a totally clueless girl blathering on about nothing; a tiny monster appears out of nowhere and the hero kills it; the girl does not notice.Completely forgettable and a chore to watch, especially if you have any kind of expectations for action--ACTION?

If you are even vaguely interested in language theory, you will like the interesting twists the author gives to the ideas in that field. In terms of developing these ideas to their full potential, the book is not so good. It makes a v fine start but leaves you a little dissatisfied in the end. If you like SF for ideas, this is a good choice. But if you are looking for characterization or action, there are lots of other far better ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slow read, confusing at times.","review":"This book tells three stories about: an experiment involving children, to find out if they can develop their own language with the aid of computer altered English; a secluded Brazilian tribe of people who speak two languages, one which is a drug enhanced version of the other; aliens who are discovered orbiting Earth in a ship while taking an extraordinary interest in the English language. Throw in some politics, and you have a story with much potential. Unfortunately, I found some of the ideas and details a bit hard to follow at times. The overall pace was mostly slow. These factors made it difficult for me to maintain any interest in the ultimate connection of the stories, and I'm certain the author's intended effect escaped me. Interesting at times, though finishing the book was an exercise of discipline. I hoped it would pay off. It didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor science and poor fiction means poor science fiction.","review":"I haven't quite read every book, but this could possibly be the worst book ever written. The story focuses on linguistic theories about embedded language. The problem is that if you don't have a background in linguistics (universal grammar, embedding, recursiveness) then you will have trouble understanding it. Either way, the book is horrible. The characters are shallow, the action is forced, and the plot is unbelievable. At some points the writing is so bad I had to put the book down.

He went on a journey twenty years earlier and never returned. These boys felt it their responsibility to find out what happened to their father.On their journey to uncover the mystery they have many encounters with different people which causes some problems. In this book it shows the love of a family and how a family works together. It'ds hard to put this book down because you don't want to be left hanging.I would recommend this book to anyone who loves mysteries and suspense. If you want that excitement while reading I would recommend that you read Treasure Mountain by Louis L'Amour. I'm not a big western fan but I absolutely loved this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better material available","review":"I am returning this book for several reasons.

Whoever compiled it had very little actual pharmacy knowledge. For instance, one question implied Valium is a C-II.Mistakes like that are easy to pick up on, but what of questions where you're not sure whether they're right because you never saw the information elsewhere? It's hard enough to study for this exam, because there are no good test prep books on the market, but to be misled by a company that obviously put out a quick, unedited book to make money is just terrible.

He makes the reader aware of how various laws of statistics influence our decisions and perceptions - and gives some guidance on how to avoid getting hoodwinked by screaming headlines or too-good-to-be-true sales pitches and offers.The book is written for the general public and covers a wide range of statistical areas - from game theory and probablities to chaos and randomness - without sounding academic. People already familiar with statistics will find this an entertaining read to see how theory applies to real life, including the interpretation of medical studies, election results and crime statistics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun way to use statistics","review":"This book uses statistics to demonstrate that \\"truths\\" that we often site just are not proven when we look at the numbers.

The center of the waffle baker towards the handle was dark, and the corners very light. The waffles were on the soggy side, and not crisp on the outside like they were with the GE. If we let them cook longer, they became dried out.

The font is rather large, and there is quite a bit of space between entries. Plus, some strange, irrelevant pictures scattered here and there. And (in more than a few cases), the EXACT SAME IDEA is repeated under different titles.It's almost as if the publishers downloaded their text from the Internet, didn't bother to edit for content, then slapped Roger Ebert's name on the cover.

Artwork is sketch with watercolor, so expect softer lines and details than Kevin J. Taylor's work. Personally I liked this title better than Doctor I'm Too Big, which had a pretty blah story, and too few panels per scene (important for any graphic novel to provide continuity and flow.) This title \\"Ship of Fools\\" does have single cels of the aforementioned bestiality and bondage, but I'd consider them NC-17 rather than X (similar to the difference between a Hollywood murder on film, versus a snuff film) - there are paperback reading books far more graphic in those areas than this title. Contrary to other reviews, I considered the action scenes depicted in Noe's titles to be much tamer than Taylor or Belore illustrates, but that may be due to the limited number of continuity frames per scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than George Winston","review":"I understand this was mostly extemporaneous playing by Bill, but it's truely great stuff.

Although this \\"story\\" is loaded with colorful illustrations (which is ordinarilly wonderful) it's filled with pictures of scary-looking monsters (even the good guys are scary looking).

In theory that might make cooking faster and more efficient, but this may be marginally true (it takes 18 minutes to hard-boil 6 eggs).

I use the ice from my refrigerator ice machine and have no trouble with ice jamming. The machine is quite tall, but the plastic ice chute stores in the drawer quite nicely so it fits under my cabinets.

Seems like a solid product."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite kitchen appliance","review":"I always had a blender on the counter, but I used it for two things: crushing ice and making margaritas. It did a poor job of crushing ice. It either left huge pieces or snow. It was hard to get anything inbetween. I only get a taste for margaritas a few times a year.So I decided that I wanted an ice crusher and the reviews made this one the best in my price range. I've found that I like crushing ice. I like the sound of that slow-geared motor crushing the **** out of those cubes. It's almost as cathartic as pounding nails, without all the work.I took away one star for two reasons. Sometimes it jams if you put large cubes through too fast. The jam is easily cleared with a chopstick - but turn the power off first. It'll eat chopsticks. The other reason is the name which includes the word \\"professional\\". When you open the manual, it says \\"for home use only\\".

Mine quit after three months of very light use. The motor still runs, but it doesn't crush any ice. For a product this expensive, I expected a lot more. Also, given the \\"professional\\" tag, you'd expect it to be able to crush gallons of ice daily. I have crushed maybe a gallon in three months.Update: I took mine in for repair with the local service center. They determined it needs replacement. Four (!) months later, I still have not received my replacement. I finally got a call from Waring asking me if I would accept a refund since they don't know when the product will be back in stock.

After cleaning it still didn't work. We ran hot water through everything, dried it and re-tried: no affect.Finally after allowing it to sit for 2 days (certainly no ice it in now) we noticed the motor was running - but the blades didn't spin.After reviewing on-line a bit - this is a fairly common problem with this model. Sadly - we returned it.If we find a reliable ice crusher - we'll get it - but so far the field looks barren."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Ice Crusher","review":"This Ice Crusher works very well. The machine, itself, is quiet.. only the actual crushing makes some noise. The crushed pieces are a bit larger than I expected (not fine at all like sno-cone ice, which I didn't want anyway). This is the type of ice you'd see at a restaurant buffet with the cold salmon sitting on it). It's great if you like to chew ice. I make double-strength sugae-free drink mix (I use raspberry lemonaid),freeze it into cubes, and crush them. I pour it into a tall glass and eat it with a spoon. It's become a favorite treat in our house... great for losing weight if you're on a diet, but probably not so great for the teeth. It's easy to clean by just pouring a couple of glasses of warm or hot water through the feed tube. then dumping out the tray.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that occasionally a very large cube gets stuck. I've always managed to get it going again by stopping and restarting the machine a few times, and maybe giving it a little tilt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money......","review":"This is my 2nd unit. It shows signs of failure after a month. These things have 3 teeth on a shaft driven by the motor. The link between the motor and the teeth is a stack of nylon or plastic cams. Once the shaft spins under the middle tooth a few times, the middle tooth no longer chips ice, but hangs on the cube, trapping it. When this happens ice won't migrate to the remaining 2 teeth because the back side of the middle tooth holds the next cube away from the remaining teeth. The drive train should be sufficiently strong to stall the motor when the cube is not crushed. It isn't. My first one lasted about 6 months. This one maybe 2 months at the most. The fix would require a design improvement; specifically better material selection. When the stuck cube melts, it works again until a cube sticks again; a pint of ice if you are lucky"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be mislead by other reviews!","review":"This machine does NOT produce small pieces of ice like most of the other reviews indicate. I admit that re-reading the description, Waring does NOT indicate the sizes of crushed ice - all the indications of this were in the reviews. This machine will NOT produce quarter inch or smaller chips of ice. See the uploaded image of ice chips to get an indication of what this unit REALLY delivers. Most pieces are 1 inch or larger, hardly qualifying as crushed ice. Some of my ice cubes (from my automatic ice maker with the refrigerator) go through the machine WITHOUT being crushed at all! This machine WILL DEFINITELY be returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Ice Crusher","review":"If you love crushed ice but don't have a refrigerator with a built-in dispenser, this is a great option.

A new refrigerator replaced our old ridiculous side-by-side model, where the ice crusher was it's only good feature.

I crush ice from my ice maker which makes those half moon shapes. I do this about once a week, crushing up one of those ice maker bins full. This ice maker gets plugged up all the time. It doesn't matter how you load it, it will just stop crushing and you can hear the ice working up and down. You can poke the cubes down with a long plastic spoon and get it crushing again, but sometimes this doesn't even work and you have to pour water through it. When I bought this machine I thought I could pour in the cubes and let the machine do the work. Think again. You have to baby this poorly designed machine along constantly. It's better than putting your cubes in a towel and beating them with a hammer, but not much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take Your Chances On This","review":"After three and a half months the product quit working.

When it works, it really works well. I used it to crush four trays of ice, once a day. The first one died after about three months for absolutely no reason at all. It just stopped working, period. So, I got another one that came in June '12 and this just makes a squealing noise and doesn't crush the ice. It's obviously not old and not overworked. When you label something as 'Professional\\" it should be a heavy duty item. If a small piece of ice gets caught under the middle blade, it just gets hung up and won't do anything. This item is very poorly designed. By the way, It was sold by a third party through Amazon and neither one of them will not give me satisfaction because it is older than thirty days. I contacted Waring through their web site hoping they could help me, but that was about three days ago and I haven't heard anything. Great customer service, huh?

Other than that, the crusher performs well and far better than chewing ice, or using a manual crusher!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crushes ice, but getting there requires some work","review":"First, this device does what it says - it crushes ice. However, it is very frustrating feeding ice cubes through the machine. I use ice from standard sized ice cube trays purchased at Wal-Mart. When feeding these through the detachable hopper, the ice cubes choke up the hopper. When feeding cubes directly without the hopper, the crusher still chokes up and I must use either my fingers or a wooden utensil to push the cubes around before the machine starts crushing again. This choking up occurs at least once every two trays that I crush - unacceptable.Update - after seven months of usage, it broke. I have so far been unable to determine any warranty information either on this site or in the owner's manual. Hopefully, amazon.com will reply to my email with this information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned Product","review":"Returned the product.

I find the vintage ice-o-mat, vogue model, hand crank ice crusher to be much more effective. It requires moderate strength but never fails to finely chop the ice.

And who will admonish Thomas when he becomes too cheeky?To be more serious, I was not at all sure what my son (just turned 3) would think about the addition of these ladies, but now I can't imagine how he would play without them. He just adores Annie and Clarabel and everywhere Thomas goes, they are sure to follow.

Several tracks focus more on beat than melody, giving them more texture without resorting to ballads. This album shows a different side to Belinda, a back to her roots type of style. An excellent addition to any Belinda Carlisle collection. As with Runaway Horses, the album is capped with a terrific track, Here Comes My Baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissapointing album","review":"After an array of excellent albums Belinda came up with this, a dreary collection of songs that never quite pick up.

From her Go-go's-like \\"Goodbye Day\\" thru her \\"Lay Down Your Arms\\" with Bangles diva Vicky Peterson, Belinda shines like the jewel she is. It is so sad that we have to endure countless trash like Britney Spears or Paris Hilton today, when we have true pop goddesses like Belinda, all of the Go-Go's, the Bamgles, Madonna, Cyndi Lauper, Annie Lennox, ect. who have real talent, and true voices to capture our hearts, over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"A REAL disappointment","review":"I am a big Belinda Carlisle fan, ever since her days with the Go-Go's. I loved her first 3 solo albums, \\"Belinda\\", \\"Heaven on Earth\\" and \\"Runaway Horses\\", but starting in 1990, Belinda seems to have lost it. \\"Live you life be free\\" was terribly weak compared to her previous solo efforts, and \\"Real\\" is worse. The only song I vaguely like is \\"Big Scary Animal\\", which resembles one of her classics, \\"Leave a light on\\".

I will read it many times, and I will give copies to friends. I couldn't have been more diappointed in reading this random collection of essays. I guess I should have been warned by the long sub-title, but I don't understand how this collection, which is largely rants and complaints, made it to print. Being personally committed to and heavily involved in water and fishery conservation issues in California, a state which like Montana has huge problems, I share much of Duncan's frustration. In spite of probably being in sync with him on many issues, I found his writing to be unnecessarily strident and preachy. Overall, I found these essays to lack the humor and sparkling prose of his first book. I also purchased The Brothers K and promise to give it the aerial burial if it doesn't, from the very beginning, remind me of Duncan's wonderful first book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rant by any other name","review":"I found much too much rant in the first 2/3 of the book and would have put it down except we agreed to read it for a book group.

As someone who's work and life is submerged in environmental, water use, and preservation issues I find this type of stereotypical ranting more detrimental to the issues that concern me than most G.W. policies. Duncan preaches to the choir, but his preaching is so over the top it is a turn-off. While I agree with virtually every theme and policy he promotes, his pompus diatribes push me in the other direction. If this book were written 40 years ago it might strike a radical tone and inspire action. In these times it is merely a rehash of the new-age mumbo-jumbo that is so easy for the opposition to tear down.This book will apeal to two audiences: new-age sheep, and right-wingers looking to bash environmentalists. The rest will find it harder to wade through than Columbia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse Product Ever - Don't Buy","review":"Where to begin?1.

His mother has raised him on her own, cooking for wealthy elderly clients and \\"tarting\\" (as she calls it) for several selected men, to be able to provide him with the same upbringing she had. She is smart, fiercely independent, and vulnerable (although she doesn't realize it).One of my favorite things about this book is Wesley's wonderfully quirky and complex characters.If you enjoy other authors such as Barbara Pym, Laurie Colwin and Jane Austen, I think you will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!

There are numerous typos on each page which makes reading difficult to enjoy. This is also not a page-for-page reprint, so page breaks occur mid-page. This also makes reading this book much less enjoyable.

It purports to be just travel by an army man at liesure, and wanting to see parts of the world. Since we are in the \\"Great Game\\" era, when Britain and Russia were contending for the countries around India, I have the feeling that it was more than that, and that the author's mission was somewhat akin to \\"checking out the land\\" in the case of an impending conflict. Anyway, it's extremely well-written, and the descriptions of both the places and the people are first rate!

I'm sure Grp Captain Billy Drake had a fascinating career in the RAF, but one would never know it from this bare-bones collection (104 pages) of reminiscences. No details are given of his 24+ aerial victories beyond the aircraft type.

The tortillas don't get real soggy like I have heard that bread does. Cherry pie filling with milk chocolate chips is great. I have never had cherry pie with chocolate chips baked in, but it is fantastic.My only compaint is that the pockets are too shallow to hold a lot of filling. I think they are all designed that way though.Cleanup was not bad and if you don't overcook or overstuff then the filling should not leak out.If you are tired of buying expensive frozen entrees and desserts, then give this a whirl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skillet, please","review":"This is an odd little gadget.

Most didn't come close. Makes you wonder where it was designed. I now have a breadmaking machine that makes really large slices, so I might dig the Snackster out and try it again.

This part of the tale is placed in the hands of Peg, now 11 years old. Peg's desperate to be like her older siblings and longs to be treated like an adult. She is granted the chance when the mysterious Violet comes to stay with Peg,and her mother and stepfather. Unlike in A Place to Belong, the action builds naturally as Peg and Danny suspect that Violet is really a spy for the Confederate cause. Unfortunately their quest for answers yields tragic results. Peg is a likable narrator, however the characterizations of her, her mother, stepfather, and Danny are much too one-dimensional. Historically, Nixon is not at her best nor is the writing as good as it was in A Dangerous Promise and In the Face of Danger still Keeping Secrets is a book worth reading if only because it add to the overall arch of the series.

A massive Big Bubble on the scale of the Greenspan 1994-2000 and 2003-2008 blunders had crushed their corporate balance sheets. Japan was awash in debt. They went asea in what Koo identified as a Balance Sheet Recession -- similar to our 1929 and 2008 disasters.Richard Koo is a genius. His book does ground itself, here and there, with references to personal details.

Johnny Winter made his name primarily with blues rock, with his name getting wide recognition through his Columbia releases. But this album is a quintessential title for any blues collection. It gets dirtier with the second song, \\"Tribute to Muddy,\\" and Johnny Winter would go on to have a few collaborations with Muddy Waters. One of my favorite cuts is \\"Mean Town Blues,\\" which appears elsewhere on his Woodstock appearance (and not a really good example either) and a few other albums, although his other recorded live performances of this song didn't capture the rawness of the title from this album. And that is what makes this album such a classic; it's rawness, the dirty sound, like it's all one take and there it is, take it or leave it. But after listening to it, you won't want to leave it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Album Liner Notes","review":"This is an awesome album. It is probably the rawest thing Johnny ever recorded.I happen to have the original release vinyl in my collection, under Imperial Records, and the album cover is a gas.The back of the album contains the song credits, along with several pictures of Johnny in an unfortunate purple cape and the following: \\"Winter is hard and heavy in his hypnotic blues bag.

The Maxim \\"Profesional\\" seemed to be the best of what was available in the market. The first one I purchased had a visible surface coating defect in the bowl. After taking that back to the original store purchased for exchange, the new one looked fine. The first time we cooked in it we had a rude surprise. The non-stick coating was flaking-off. Keep in mind it had only been washed with warm/soapy water and used once. I noticed several areas where the coating had bubbled above the heating element in the cooking bowl and any rubbing at all would remove the coating. Calling Customer Service at Salton USA, I found out that because they don't make or have that wok anymore, they can't repair or replace it per their \\"warranty\\".

My mistake. The positive reviews this book has received are no doubt deserved, but this copy is unreadable. It is, as far as I can tell, a print-out of the public domain text, cheaply bound and so minimally formatted that italics are represented by _underscores_ and the right-hand margin is not even justified. The cover image isn't even correctly proportioned, which, given the original image, is pretty shocking in and of itself.I can't believe Amazon are even selling this thing. It's a disgrace. I could have produced a better copy myself for less money! The text is in the public domain, so if you don't care what format it's in, just download it for free and print it out. Otherwise, go for the new edition which got such good reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"This was a real disappointment. Nowhere, on the Amazon site, or in the book, does it indicate that this edition lacks all the photos of the original - which of course are crucial to the book.

This cd is the musical souljourn that Gwen Stefani tried to get to with her cd. L.A.M.B. Anyways, Esthero is back with yet another classic cd. What I like is that the cd is still underground and genre crossing without trying to sound like \\"Breath from another\\". She complete blurs the lines between trip hop, hip hop, rock, soul, and jazz, which is the sign of a true artists.

I'm so disappointed. As much as I love Esthero's voice, I wonder if it was Doc I liked so much considering my favorite tracks from this album were produced with him.Breath From Another had a certain depth I can't find on the new album - slightly cryptic lyrics that told an interesting story open to interpretation. The new album sounds like the same self-promotional crap I hear from everyone else these days. \\"I'm the baddest bitch to ever hit this town\\"? Please.I understand artists evolve and change - but I can't get into this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"A Musical Extermination\\"","review":"\\"We are in need of a musical revolution...I'm tired of the same old...I want something more.\\"I couldn't agree more with you on that. But I have to tell you this isn't it. I will tell you what this is. A step above Fergie, a bit more creative but still a huge disappointment. A little bit of Jazz, a little bit of dance, and a lot a bit of hip hop. And while it does still sound like Esthero. It doesn't. She rehashes the same old same old superficial topics that appear on every hip/hop and pop album out there. The depth is fleeting. Sadly this album is not unique as much as it tries to be. One thing she does have is an amazing voice, I hear a bit of Bjork in there but much more polished.What happened to the harsh reality that slapped you in the face, the style, the essence that was born out of \\"Breath from Another\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow-very different than debut...","review":"My brother and I got into Esthero after her debut release, \\"Breathe From Another\\". That album had some of the best, ambient, mellow electronic (sorry about the vague description, its hard to classify) music around. A great CD that I used to pop in on a Wed night when I was entertaining a few people in San Francisco. Great music when you want somewhat background music but also great for walking around the city, car rides-basically its an album where if you wanna play attention to it and really enjoy a CD or just keep it on for background.Which leads me to \\"Wikked...\\", which is raw, bold and very sensual/sexual. She goes from this soft, mellow, ambient girl to this harder, raw and sexual artist, just like that. Don't get me wrong, tunes like \\"My Torture\\" are refelective of \\"Breathe...\\" but others' like, \\"If Tha Mood\\", \\"Wikked...\\" and \\"Fastlane\\" are clearly a growth in Esthero.Overall, its nothing like \\"Breathe...\\" but its still vintage Esthero. I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical revolution, just in time.","review":"Well I agree with one of the other reviewers in that it isn't completely new style-wise, but it's very new for Esthero. She still sounds like the old Esthero... a wide eyed, hand in your face, with a hand on her pants.The closest comparison would be a Gwen Stefani hip hop type CD, but it's so much more. (I hate reviewing this since I can't do it justice with words.) Esthero still has her trip hop sex appeal songs, but also has hip hop.I could do without some of the cussing though since it at times seems it's just for shock value. Don't get me wrong though some of it happens at just the right moment.Of all my reviews on here, this has probably been the toughest for me to articulate the true nature of the CD.Let me just say this. If you like hip hop, but also like her Trip - Hop Breathe from Another CD, buy this, as it's basically Breath From Another 2010: better, stronger, faster..."},{"rating":"2","title":"WIKKID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I just got back from seeing Esthero live and can I say that I love this album even more now.In my opinion this album is better and a bit different than her 1998 breath from another album.There are many tracks to jam to and the lyrics are sexy and smart.I'm not sure if the album is truly a musical revolution but I will say that it's pretty damn close. No harm in trying though."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Truth","review":"The first track 'We R In Need . . . ' is the only real 'song' on this CD.

While Esthero writes lyrics that bashes pop music, she seems somewhat ignorant to the fact that her very own sound has (sadly) drifted towards the genre she criticizes. Not to say that this whole album isn't salvageable. But almost. 'Beautiful Lie' may be the only song that is reminiscent of the talent that she showed in her debut. I was getting a little concerned when she started working with the likes of Black Eyed Peas, Nelly Furtado (which is somewhat forgiveable)and the worst of all the short frat boy from Crazy Town (what the heck?!)Esthero has the voice and sensuality to make real music, but as long as she is striving for commercial success, I don't see Breathe From Another being made again anytime soon.First Gwen Stefani, now Esthero. What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best.....and utterly BORING !","review":"You would think that this is an exciting release at first sight, containing not only a CD but a DVD as well - however, I was thoroughly disappointed !14 trax \\"off the rack\\" which have been released time and again on just soo many greatest hits compilations etc.The DVD contains interviews with 4 \\"musical enthusiasts\\" who tell the story of Dionne's career from the early 60s up to the present but with only 5 or 6 still pics and some 30 secs of live footage it quickly becomes boring as it lacks any kind of distance to the subject.Definitely a discount product which is utterly dispensable - such a pity when you contemplate that Ms. Warwick is undoubtedly one of the greatest stars of the last 40 years.In stead turn to David Nathan's fabulous book, \\"The Soul Divas\\" which is much more informative, not only on Ms. Warwick but on a dozen or so other Afro-American singers."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP OFF","review":"When I saw the SAME songs on the cd, I wouldn't have left it in the store, even at a going out Business sale where I paid about $5 for it.

The repulsion is strictly visceral, but so what? Isn't music a visceral experience (unless you like to listen to John Cage)? Like when Clint Eastwood dubbed Charlie Parker, it is just wrong in my book. The pops and clicks can go, the treble can be boosted, but somehow this overdub steals from the work of the original artist, who was expressing his art in context with the medium at hand. I would rather hear a Caruso impersonator playing with a modern orchestra.But heck, I'm the kind of person who can't (won't) listen to Wagner because I am Jewish."},{"rating":"2","title":"My order for Picasso's Picassos","review":"The condition of the book I ordered was exactly as represented on-line (very good, except for slight wear and a few tears on the book's dust cover).The speed in receiving my book was about 1/2 the time promised me.I had no problems at all, and will surely use Amazon.com again when I have the need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tubes 'Love Bomb' is a blast!","review":"This 1985 release and last recording with all the original members, in my opinion was one of the band's best efforts and very underated and underplayed by radio stations at the time.'Love Bomb' produced by Todd Rundgren was definitely not as radio friendly as the bands earlier hits such as 'Talk to Ya Later' and She's A Beauty' but it still has a lot of great songs on it.

Whats NOT here is the patented Tubes humor ,social satire, and amazing memorable hooks that they used to do so well up until this point.'Love Bomb' is , sadly, the sound of the Tubes out of ideas and giving up.

I used the machine for about 4 months, making about 25 loaves of bread, none of which ever came out exactly right. They were all mishapen, sometimes grotesquely so. It often failed to incorporate ingredients from the corners of the pan. The motor sounded like it was about to die during the kneading cycle, suggesting to me that it was severely underpowered. Finally, the \\"add ingredients\\" feature ceased working, and I took it back to the store where I bought it.I'm an experienced breadmachine user and know the importance of accurate measurement, etc. However, this machine seemed unduly sensitive to the moisture content of the dough.

I figured I'd treat myself to a new one. Same buttons, same model number etc. Identical.Bought one at a local store. Hmm.... it burned everything on the sides. And this was using Breadman's own recipes, as well as some of my own. Exchanged it. Same thing. I tried making the crust as light as possible, and even using a custom program to reduce the baking time. This just was not right.So I just got my third one today, this time from Amazon.com. This one seems OK, thank goodness.Anyway, I wish I could give the product 5 stars because when they work right they are fantastic.But having two defective machines in a row is unacceptable. Therefore, for now, it only gets two stars. If I have any trouble at all with this third Breadman, I will be switching to the Panasonic bread machine instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"I purchased this breadmaker almost 1 year ago. I bake 2 to 3 loaves each week. I have not bought any bread since buying my machine. I use the full cycle (almost three hours) and use the recipes that came with the machine. I have made adjustments to a few of the recipes. The results are spectacular. However, it is important to check the appearance of the dough while kneading, and I usually use a spatula to remove some of the dough from the sides of the pan. I take the paddle out just before the third rise, thus reducing the size of the hole left in the bread by the paddle. I am not even reducing the score for the paddle that began losing it's coating within the first three months.

I was a little concerned about learning something that, for me, was a smidge more complicated than my old one, but it was on sale so... It arrived, and I immediatly made my first whole wheat loaf with it. It was great. I have made batter breads, rye breads, whole wheats with sprouted grains, and every single loaf has come out perfect. It has capabilities I'd never used before, including programming your own recipe into it. I've done experimenting with it also, and each and every experiment came out great. This machine is spot on for both beginners, and those that like to program for recipes that they have created themselves. A highly versatile, and highly recommended machine.

I tried a couple loaves in the Breadman -- one using a recipe I'd used several times with good results in a Westbend machine I bought used. In the Breadman it came out mis-shapen, doughy in the center and nearly burned on the outside. I tried again, using a recipe that comes in the totally overwhelming booklet that comes with the Breadman. This recipe called for more flour and water to produce the same 1 1/2 lb. loaf. It was packy. The total time to produce a loaf is 1 hour shorter than my used Westbend, but that means the dough doesn't rise as much. I also noticed that the Breadman wasn't powerful enough to properly knead, and the dough would get \\"caught\\" in one corner and the motor would whine. For the amount of money invested, I was DISGUSTED with the performance and the product, and returned my machine. Buy a cheap one -- you'll be happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend $50 more & buy the Zojirushi","review":"Our Zojirushi kicked the bucket after two years of hard and faithful service (3 times a week, every week).

Not only are the loaves very tall so that they are hard to cut and make huge sandwiches, but they do not taste as good as our Zo loaves (same recipe!). The crust is harder and rubbery tasting. Furthermore, the machine smelled like a skunk (even when not in use). Save yourself the grief and buy the Zo! It's great!

Bread made in my old Oster bread machine never failed! This machine is completely disappointing! The oblong bread pan does not adequately mix in the ingredients (you have to remember to stop by and stir in the ingredients after the machine has been going for awhile). Bread has come out with large internal holes in it, and very oddly shaped using the recipes provided with the machine. The bread pan is very light weight...but I can hardly wait for it to fail so I can get a different machine. I shouldn't have to wait long.The first one shipped had a defective beeper.

Contacted them by phone and was told it would be best to find a local repair shop since the product was made in China and they had no way to repair it. The Breadman TR2200C was good for about a year.

From the first time attempting to make bread I found that the product container would not stay securely seated in the unit. It continually kept popping up during the kneading cycle making it impossible to walk away from the unit. Also during the kneading cycle, when the dough formed a ball, the unit would bog down and stop repeatedly. I only used the oven cycle once during a dry run as suggested in the owners manual. I used the dough making cycle 4 times and the problem above continued and appeared to get worse. Then while sliding the unit back under my cabinets on the counter after use, the unit beeped and went electrically dead. After that it would not work in any electric outlet.

Costco said that the manufacturer didn't want to send me another because they think that maybe it is a UPS problem with how they handle them. and i had called the tech support to make sure it wasn't something i was doing wrong. anyway, costco said maybe ordering from amazon would be better because of direct shipping method, but i am afraid to get one that works for a few weeks and then have to send it back and possibly not get credit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breadman Machines","review":"These are good machines when new but the company does not support the products with spare parts.

The Breadman made excellent bread when it worked. It mixed the dough well and baked the bread thoroughly. However, the spindle that turns the paddle stopped spinning. It appears that this is a common problem with this machine.Pro's: Good mixing (when the paddle spins) and baking, many baking options to choose from, battery backup, great recipies included.Con's: Motor is underpowered. The machine would get stuck from time to time when making a 2 pound loaf and I would have to manually push the paddle to get it moving again.

It has been a very frustrating experience and I feel perhaps other people can use this precaution. 1) The fact that the manual cover page has instructions for customer with incorrect parts could be an indication that this happens quite often. To me, it tells me that the Breadman products may have a serious production problem, parts are often mispackaged. 2) Customer service level is not acceptable.It is a shame that this is supposed to be an excellent machine.

This thing is super easy to use. The timer option is great. I can mix up the ingredients the night before and wake up in the morning to the smell of fresh baked bread. So far the over all quality of the machine seems pretty solid, although I've only had it for two months. I would also highly recommend the Progressive International Clearly Fresh Bread Keeper.

Since I use the machine only to prepare french bread dough - not to bake it, my demands of a breadmaker are limited; I simply want it to knead the dough and let it rise in the machine. Whereas my old Sunbeam did the job without a hitch, this machine represents a step or two backward, in my opinion.First there are the digital controls which are overly complicated and counter-intuitive. Next, and most irritating, is that the paddle/pan size are such that it doesn't mix well. I had to use a spatula to get all the flour into the dough.

Here is the problem. There is a large plastic gear in the under body that will deteriorate over time because of the heat. This gear is very easy to replace and you just need a Phillips screw drive and an adjustable wrench to replace it. The problem, they will not sell you the part, thereby making the product useless when, and not if, the plastic gear pulley begins to break apart.

After about 20 different modifications to the program I was still unable to make whole wheat bread rise very well. I was quite discouraged and after reading more reviews, I realized I was not alone. I read something about ambient temperature in the reviews and tried to raise ambient temperature. I used a heating pad under the oven, then wrapped the whole oven with towels throught the whole cycle. Results were great and now I can do no wrong with the cycles.

I woke up, and sniffed and got a pleasant scent, instead of the feared burning smell.The programming was easy. The functioning was logical. The bread was great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality and service","review":"I bought this machine thinking it was a fairly good quality machine that had good features. I found that within a month the non-stick coating wore off of the pan despite being gently hand washed and not abused in any way. When I sent an email about it I received a rather rude reply saying it wasn't his department, he was sales, and I needed to send my email on to another email address. FOrwarding to that address twice got me no reply. I also found that the company making this is actually Salton which I had a bad experience with previously. I have since decided that this company no longer needs my business, and probably doesn't need yours either. Save your money for another brand, because breadman and toastmaster arent worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb, reliable machine!","review":"I have had my Breadman for almost two years and have never had a problem with it. Whole grain breads, fruit and vegetable breads, using the dough cycle-all completely reliable. It's so enjoyable to have fresh wholesome bread at my convenience. Try the Breadman Ultimate. You won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two out of two did not work","review":"Purchased the first one of these because of ratings on Amazon. It stopped kneading on the first loaf. Called Breadman and was told the machine was defective and to return it. Did this and ordered a second one ( I don't seem to learn very fast) The new one made one loaf of bread just fine. The second loaf would not knead. On both machines you could hear the motor running but the part that turns the paddle did not turn. I've had a Panosonic for about 8 or 9 years and it works fine. I may buy a new one of them. The Breadman machines were a birthday present for my mother-in-law."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent bread maker, and great dough maker as well","review":"I've made bread with other bread machines for years. Usually I use only the dough cycle and form loaves or rolls. I had found that other bread machines made an inferior textured loaf, mainly due to the inability to mechanically duplicate the forming process in a simple machine. But the variety of complete cycles on this machine makes it possible to bake a loaf that is as close to acceptable as you'll find in making bread with a machine. I use both full cycles and dough cycles. Whole grains, and added ingredients work well in both processes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Machine is broken after light use for three months!","review":"While I bought the machine in July, it was not used until October or November.

Each machine made between 10-15 loaves before failing.Not recommended. Poor electrical systems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second Breadman Broken and No Way To Repair","review":"Breadman machines are the best until I have used them for a couple of months and then the basket wont keep where it has to be for the dough to be kneaded OR the rotating mixing blade doesnt work quite right OR something else happens. Then, try the help line because the manufacturer wont reply to emails and the website is useless for anything other than product promotion. On the help line, some person who could care less will tell you that there is no repair for any of the problems. My theory? PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE, a fine American manufacturing tradition.So disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breadman = noise maker","review":"We received the Breadman for Christmas and were surprised to find out how noisy it is. The kneading cycle amounts to 20 minutes of loud knocking sounds. One cannot sleep through this cycle and wake up to fresh bread. Perhaps all bread makers are this loud (in which case we'll stick to hand kneading). The dough was also insufficiently mixed together. Lots of dry pockets of flour. Stay away from this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Drive belt and drive of the pattles leave much to be desired","review":"When my wife was making jam, the cycle created a over boil, and quite a lot of the sticky mess was easily caught in the gear and drive section of the machine. On subsequent use the cheap drive belt broke. You can't get a belt replacement, hence the machine is compleatly useless. Unless I want to spend 65.00 for a non-warented unit, instead of about $3.50 for a belt."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 machines later and still NO bread","review":"Imagine a home with two accomplished cooks. Imagine the convenience of a bread maker. Imagine eight months and three replacement products later. Imagine a Catch-22 between the manufacturer (Salton) and Amazon denying responsibility to refund our money. Imagine our outrage. Imagine the smell of warm rosemary wheat bread with English butter on a lazy Sunday morning. Well, keep imagining... we've got the third in a series of defunct Salton Breadman Ultimate setting on our kitchen counter, useless to us as anything but a paperweight.

Also be sure to soak the bread pan in warm water for 20-30 minutes after each use if the kneading paddle gets stuck, you should be able to wiggle it right off the spindle after it is done soaking.

I think it's time for a design change. My son made me a cardboard disc to put at the back of the wheel, larger than the wheel...it stops the belt from coming off...now it bakes wonderful bread...contact me for more information!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bread!","review":"I got this bread machine a couple weeks ago and have used it almost daily. Initially I was disappointed that all the recipes in the companion book (as well as Breadman's Healthy Bread cookbook) called for powdered milk because we do not use dairy products. However, I tried using non-dairy recipes from other cookbooks and had poor results. So I replaced the water and milk powder with soy milk (water and soy milk powder would work too) and have had wonderful results since. I recommend this machine and the cookbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Frustrated with bread machine because it couldn't handle whole wheat recipes with molasses.Also, extremely noisy and I now have to return this as the side clamps do not hold pan in place during knead cycles.

No longer can make bread because of defective clamps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead in six months","review":"Six months after we bought the Breadman and had been using it with great satisfaction about twice a week, it died while baking. Because it was still under warranty, we are sending it back to Salton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of JUNK","review":"I owned a West Bend for many years and always got a good loaf of bread, howerver the bearing went out and I was told a replacement was no longer available. I purhased the Breadman TR2200C I tried 6 times to get a satisfactory loaf of bread and finally got one with my old receipt from the West Bend. The next loaf didn't make it as something broke and the paddle would not turn. I returned it for a replacement and got it yesterday. Today I tried to make a loaf and it came out terrible. THIS is definately a very poor quality unit. I would return it but the penalty to me is too great. DON'T buy one, get a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst purchase I ever made...period.","review":"I just scraped the dough out of my third unit (brand new unit, first loaf of bread). The paddle stopped turning during the second kneading cycle. The first unit made it though one loaf of bread before the paddle stopped turning. The second unit didn't even work out of the box (same problem--paddle would not turn). Likely, a persistent problem with the belt coming off the shaft. Unable to get through to manufacturer. So long, Salton. You'll never get my business again. I couldn't be more disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"great, love it","review":"This Bread Machine makes great bread. It has many different settings and is very easy to use. I can highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent breadmaker","review":"I have this machine for 2 months now and I am absolutely happy with it. It makes perfect bread, very easy to operate, even more easier to clean. I have not used Jam option so far, but breadmaking features are satisfactory.

That being said, this is an old book. The edition is from 1982, and Arthur Corbin died in 1967. The fundamentals of this book are strong but I worry that, for newer law students, this book is going to be a little inaccessible. On top of that, it won't have many of the modern developments in contract law. It is still a great book for students and practitioners both, but if you are a first year law student I think that you would be better off getting one of the newer contract treatises, or even the examples and explanations book on contracts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it for your Mac","review":"I had the same experience as the previous reviewer.

But the story itself was pretty good. Sure, the hero and heroine took and instant dislike to each other, there were complications along the way, and the ended up in love...but there was a lot of 'side' interest too, in the sisters, the former lovers, accidents, etc. Good character development.

The pan heats up quickly and even has a pre-timed light which goes off when your crepe is ready. I have purchased this model myself and am more than satisfied.

I love books that bring science and metaphysics together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serpents and spirals","review":"Jeremy Narby has written a truly engaging account of his experiences with the ayahuasqueros, and with himself. He decides to be honest both with himself and with his readers, something terribly lacking in the world of science. As a trained scientist myself, I understand the leap of faith he took when deciding to get subjective with his research. We are trained to measure, not use our intuition. His own journey into the related discipline of biological chemistry makes his \\"subjective\\" analysis all the more valid. A must read for anyone open to new ideas about our existence."},{"rating":"2","title":"about time!","review":"Fantastic.

Innovative theory, well researched. Not some bogus conspiracy, but open and persuasive. Radical but based in science."},{"rating":"2","title":"ballin' connections","review":"The narbster makes some interesting connections with this book that were both refreshing and intriguing. The 3rd or 4th chapter is when it starts to get interesting. The book as a whole changed the way I look at both modern science and shamanism ! He drew alotta neat parallels.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blending Western and Indigenous knowledge","review":"I read this in Peru and highly recommend it to anyone interested in indigenous knowledge and culture. This is written by an anthropologist who, during the course of his career, came to believe that indigenous knowledge created in the Amazon rainforest is legitimate and even advanced beyond Western science. This book informs the reader about how Western science is verifying indigenous knowledge and, especially in the realm of biomedicine, seeking to obtain and uphold more and more of it. Also, the author demonstrates the value of \\"defocalizing\\" ... stepping away and loosening your mind's focus in order to foster breakthroughs. Just like a magic-eye sometime things are more clear when they are viewed in a fuzzy fashion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quetzalcoatl's Return","review":"When I first picked up this book, I was amazed. The author has done an excellent job of reconciling indigenous belief systems with modern science. In this book, he attempts to give us an idea of where man fits into the universe and what it means to be human. His defense of indigenous people from western exploitation is wonderful. From indigenous socieites he has taken the Shamanic trance state and uncovered universal archetypes like the serpent, which appear in societies throughout the world, from Australia to South America to Egypt and beyond. He then filters it through the lens of science to gain his own unique insight. In general, if you have an interest in Shamanism and Neo-Shamanism, then this work is definately worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panpsychists, Animists, and Shamans Will All Enjoy This Author","review":"If you have an interest in panpsychism, animism, shamanism, the question of consciousness, or transpersonal psychology, then this author and his books are for you!The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge is a unique look at the question of consciousness, intelligence and knowledge as seen through the eyes of an anthropologist who opened himself and his mind to what some would consider \\"primitive\\" or radical means of \\"knowing\\".The text truly makes one wonder. It is not-as I had supposed by listening to some individuals-a book about hallucinogens and New Age fluff, but rather a truly agnostic inquiry into alternative and very ancient ways of knowing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, tedious.","review":"I'm surprised that no one before me has mentioned how poorly written this book is. It sounds like it was written by an eighth grader with no imagination. For somone who is discussing hallucinations, he would have done well to have been more colorul in his writing. It reads like a technical brochure. Half the things he talks about are of no consequence to the point he's trying to make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good.","review":"I will be brief. The book has no scientific or logical foundation. I will not bother to denegrate shamanism, but would say that while avoiding Western-centrist thinking may be meritorious, abandoning logic and sound evidence does the argument no service. The author's professional identification crisis is amusing, and his abandonment of methodology makes this a good read for \\"Visionary Shamanic Trance\\" and \\"Chills & Thrills\\" (see reviews/personal testimonials below). I have to think that your average English major with a leaning toward mysticism will think this book \\"far out,\\" while any person who is serious about science and/or logic will only be seriously annoyed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedantic, overstated science fiction","review":"I am a fan of naturalist books and theory ala Steven Jay Gould, Charles Darwin, etc. I have also read anthro-fiction like Carlos Castaneda and his gang (Donner etc.) and I was so surprised by the lack of true knowledge of things scientific in this book. If we are to make the leap that Narby asks us to, in a scientific sense, then he should present more thorough and well thought out arguments. If he wamts us to make a leap of faith then allow us. Do not preach science, science is not a pulpit from which to preach, it is merely an accumumlation of empiric evidence that points one in a certain direction. This book was balderdash. I sure hope it wasn't his PhD thesis...back to the drawing board"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cosmic Serpent","review":"The first couple of chapters were very interesting, more like a novel. As I got into the middle of the book it was like reading a science textbook. There is obviously a lot of discussion of DNA and how the author tries to relate it to the Amazon medicine men."},{"rating":"1","title":"Modern Mythology","review":"Apparently countless civilizations have recognized the serpent or other double-helix like shapes as of primal importance, and consumption of hallucogenic drugs induces similar visions. Narby has taken this information and declared that humans are, and always have been, somehow aware of the DNA that underlies our existence. He also believes that DNA has intentions, can communicate with us, and it not of this world (he does not believe in natural selection, etc). As a geneticist with an interest in neurobiology and consciousness myself, I am aware that he has butchered much of the science he presents (for example, claiming that the circularity of natural selection makes it untestable). However he writes well, and I enjoyed reading about the anthropology (which appears well documented to my admittedly inexpert eye) that led him to derive this new mythology. I certainly don't agree with his conclusions, but I appreciate his intellectual creativity and sense of discovery."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lucid book on how we've \\"created\\" nature - and outlaws","review":"Crimes Against Nature is written by one of America's foremost new thinkers on the environment.

It's an awesome mix. The surround doesn't detract from the music at all, rather it highlights things differently than the two channel mix. The added depth that the DTS encode brings is also very welcome. It kind of makes me wonder what Deadwing would sound like as a fully lossless, DTS-MA encode.It's a shame that this is out of print because if you're a Porcupine Tree fan, you owe it to yourself to listen to this at least once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"I couldn't wait for \\"Deadwing\\" because I believe \\"In Absentia\\" is absolutely amazing. I can't stop listening to it - even popped it in this morning. The drums are stunning. But I believe \\"Deadwing\\" is appropriately named. And PT must have a new drummer, because they're now very weak - at best. I can't think of a single track that's worth mentioning - maybe Shallow. But even that is shallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Pretentious","review":"This is the type of prog-rock that I find extremely boring and pretentious. The singer is average at best and the pace of the album is rather plodding. If you want to hear some creative prog-rock, try Spock's Beard or Umphrey's McGee instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"This aint prog...","review":"I bought this cd because every time i came here to Amazon.com and looked at shredding, prog-rock/metal i would get a Porcupine Tree recommendation. Well, prog-heads, this isnt prog. Far from it.There are very few guitar solos, not much riffing (there is a bit, tho) songs sound like angst-radio oriented hard rock, almost nu-metal, but not metal. No prog here, some slightly off/wierd bits to be sure, but that doesnt make it prog. To be fair, the album is well produced, musicianship is good though there is no shredding. I didnt care for the lame songwriting, could almost pass for Staind or some such lousy band, just somewhat different.Fans of shredding bands like Dream Theater, Symphony X, Spiral Architect, etc should stay away from crap like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, maybe I shouldn't buy albums on an impulse","review":"This was the worst peace of plastic i have ever bought. The first time I listened to it , I only heard the first track...which at the time sounded promising. Now that i had to erase it off my computer (every time it came on i was wondering, \\"what is this crap\\") I feel robbed. Makes me almost wish I downloaded music as opposed to buying it.It's pretty sad when I have such an appreciation for music and this can't find a place to in my collection. Please carefully consider reviews before you support this group. It seems like this band has some fairly good support @ amazon, maybe I am just too old that i still enjoy for depth and musicianship in my music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still loving this album after 100 listens","review":"This album deserves 5 stars. No doubt. Sure, Porcupine Tree fans will debate which album is best: In Absentia, Lightbulb Sun, Signify, or even The Sky Moves Sideways. All have something great to offer. The bottom line is that this band makes music for people who LOVE music. And this album is another classic. Yes, Deadwing takes risks and is somewhat different than previous albums, but it still weaves that now classic PT sound into each song. And for that I applaud Steven Wilson and his crew. In this era of bland and uninspired popular music, Deadwing is amazing, and makes me look forward to what PT will dream up next.P.S. Be sure to see the band live! They are incredible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"I've come to know PT only over the last year. What a joy! Actually their last two albums-In Absentia and Deadwing are clearly the best, with selected songs from older work also excellent (Evenless, Dissapear). The best band I've heard in over five years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Gavin Harrison...Sir,..you are a genuis!!!","review":"With everything said about Steven Wilson, there is nothing more I can really add. However, after carefully listening to PT's Deadwing, I can only shake my head in utter disbelief at the virtuoso technique demonstrated by PT drummer Gavin Harrison. His talent places him within the pantheon of the all time \\"greats\\" of \\"rock-drumming\\". Simply spectacular!!!I am awaiting with baited breath the arrival of the DVD-Audio version of Deadwing. The expectation that I may be able to delve even deeper into the inner recesses of the percussion on display on Deadwing literally makes me want to weep in joyous anticipation.Thank God for Porcupine Tree as a band, Mr. Steven Wilson and the other members Mr. Colin Edwin and Mr. Richard Barbieri. My faith was renewed 2 and a half years ago with In Absentia, and now has been cemented with the release of this masterpiece. Thank you very much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"On the right track,but a long way to go...","review":"I think they need to balance more of the heavy with the moody,to break it wide open. I like were there at so far.but they need to grow up alot more on there music. Its a good start into getting in to them.I feel there best is yet to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"It needs to grow on you","review":"I'm a fair weather PT fan. I like their music, but I don't really LOVE it. Signify remains my favorite so far.Deadwing, like In Absentia, was hard to listen to at first. All my friends SWORE these were the best albums, but I just wasn't hearing it. I just didn't \\"get\\" it.But persistence pays. After many listens, suddenly I hear the genius and beauty in many of the songs (Arriving Somewhere but Not Here comes to mind). PT plays up the \\"fungus effect\\" where they write music that might not sound so great until you come to KNOW the songs. Then you realize they're so complex and intricate, that they'll never grow old.PT may never be at the tippy top of my list of faves, but they'll never be far behind. Deadwing is almost as good as In Absentia, and in some ways, might be better. Maybe I need to listen to it some more. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deadwing is missing some tension","review":"Deadwing is not a bad album at all. The first time I was exposed to it, I was somewhat disappointed. It took me a very long time to appreciate it. Compared to In Absentia, Stupid Dream, Signify and Lightbulb Sun and other PT albums Deadwing seems flat and uninspired. Comparing Deadwing to the entire field of music put out at roughly the same time is easy. Deadwing is clearly better.With Deadwing, I miss the beautiful fusion of very hard rock and light airy music playing off each other in perfect harmony on so many other PT albums. Deadwing seems a bit flat to me. Deadwing should not be the first Porcupine Tree album for new Porcupine Tree fans to listen to, because that would give the wrong first impression of the band.The point is, Porcupine Tree has put out much better stuff than Deadwing. If Deadwing is all you've heard from Procupine Tree, I have a piece of advice for you. Backlog! You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ARE YOU KIDDING ME?","review":"This album is too good to put into words- I just couldnt believe my ears when I 1st heard it- Heck, I still cant- this album is so fresh, catchy, amazing, wow---on and on I could go...just get this-- un freakin believeable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Instant Classic, Most anticipated album ever!","review":"This could be the album that gets PT the worldwide fame they deserved 10 years ago. Being a fan of only their earlier releases up through Signify(and Recordings), I was plesently surprised at this release. It continues with the formula that made In absenta so popular and touches on their early albums.For some reason, this album reminds me of Live's \\"Throwing Copper\\" and Dream Theater's \\"Awake\\".I don't get why everyone is picking on \\"Glass arm shattering\\", it is simply amazing. So is the rest of this album.You must let this album grow on you cause it is very different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deadwing","review":"I really enjoy this album, especially some of the more mellow parts of this Progressive Rock CD.

The CD covers everthing from breezy pop to crunchy metal, introspective ballads to industrial grit. The songwriting and playing is first rate througout, with many spine-tingling moments. Favorite tracks include the pop/metal title track, the lovely ballad Lazarus, the extended-yet-focused track Arriving Somewhere, and personal favorite Start of Stomething Beautiful. This is a powerful showcase of the band's strenths and a good introduction to their music. Don't let the backhanded snarkiness of the Amazon \\"editorial reviewer\\" put you off. The CD does not sound like Yes. Or Rush. Or the Mars Volta. Nor does the CD show signs of of the band worshipping at the feet of anyone. Nor is the average age of the band relevant. You can safely ignore the buffoon and get the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"I rarely get so excited about an album. I think the last time I felt that way about an album was when MARILLION released MISPLACED CHILDHOOD.This album gets to you as soon as you listen to it for the first time. You just can't stop listening to it. It's the lyrics, the amazingly well crafted music, indeed the whole atmosphere...You just can't get enough of it. Those who have been listening to progressive rock for a little while may feel that some pieces of this album sound a lot like BARCLAY JAMES HARVEST (specifically Love On The Line). Get it, you will not be disappointed. If, like me, you did not know who Porcupine Tree was, you will be a lifelong fan after you hear this album. Guaranteed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Progressive, Baby","review":"What happens when Tool, Dream Theater and Pink Floyd suddenly meld into one? You get this awesome album. This platter has the production and \\"vibe\\" of the best Tool, the musicianship of Dream Theater (Tool and Floyd are right up there with DT, don't get me wrong), and the pathos of older Floyd. Or something like that. Seriously, this is one killer disc and definitely in that \\"audiophile-quality\\" category for those that care. LAZARUS may be the best song you'll never hear on the radio. Love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but bad","review":"From one side, it is not bad. The production, sound, playing are amazing. On the other hand, probably the worst PTree album up to date, dull and lacking really good melodies.You can easily confuse the title track with any track on Opeth's Damnation, while Lazarus seems to be Robbie Williams' song.I love all PTree albums, including Metanoia, except Deadwing. Commerce and mainstream are killing Steven Wilson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I was so excited to hear about the new album and even more so when I actually picked up a copy. Unfortunately, I was so disappointed. I tried to be fair and gave it a long time thinking that maybe at some point it would sink in and I would start loving it. Not the case. The more I listened, the less I thought of the album. Immature heavy riffs and plain silly lyrics... I just felt that very little effort was made on this album.Secondly, I do not understand people that group this album with In Absentia! They are so distinct! In Absentia is full of pure \\"Wilsonism\\", strange ideas and fusions of various styles and heart felt music. Nothing like Deadwing.I guess it depends. I fell in love with Porcupine Tree because of Lightbulb Sun, Stupid Dream, and Recordings. This album just does not compare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"The wonderful LMcMB here presents, as collected by a fan, some juvenilia and Yet Another Copy of the Mountains of Mourning.

No more jealousy, ownership or even marriage as we've known it, and no divorce or romance as we've known them, so what kind of lyrics will we have? Is it really feasible?Personally, I found myself agreeing with the Monogamy Inorganic and I think most women will feel the same way. There is nothing more intimate than sex, when two people are \\"in\\" each other, naked, exposed. both body & soul, showing all your weaknesses, lies, frailties, egos.

What's the deal with the old VFW dude wearing shorts that are way to short for him, hanging out with some other closeted idiots, while some washed up waitress looking chick (presumably trying to look interested and sexy) stares on? It's a total joke, and looks as if some fool snapped it up at a local Starbuck's, or, probably more realistic, visiting hours at a nursing home.Then you get inside the book itself. Kind of like a geeky junior high kid's version of Dale Carnegie's book if you ask me. You didn't, but I told you anyway. It's a complete and total travesty and those people who are, in any way, lead by this treatise need to seriously get out of the house more and develop some taste (as well as social skills).Avoid.

The author is advocating that it is not right for women to expect them to be faithful and monogamous as this is simply the way they are made. He does not believe in marriage and relationships should not be expected to last. This is a bleak scenario where hedonism, selfishness and immaturity reign but the author does not adequately tackle the inconvenient existence of children or sexually-transmitted diseases such as AIDS in encouraging promiscuity and the right for men to do whatever they please.

Darnton must think the reading public are all a bunch of fools. With his credentials, he should be ashamed of himself for cheating us -- his readers. I'm sure that after the undeserved success of his first novel, NEANDERTHAL, that he is laughing all the way to the bank and really doesn't care about entertaining his readers. We're not morons, Darnton. Don;t ever do this again to us. You've forever lost me as a future reader of your fiction.

I then realized how far fetched this book was. To top that off with Tizzie & Jude being childhood chums was just TOO much.I wish someone would write a book about some evil scientific topic, and then have the protagonists GO TO THE MEDIA and see what happens. This could have been pretty cool--but instead everyone was unintelligent...Tizzie was a DOCTOR and it took her forever to figure things out, Jude was a JOURNALIST for crying out loud--yet he never goes public.Plus: Tizzie says that \\"significant others\\" of twins NEVER fall for both--and then she does!

He doesn't understand very elementary aspects of laboratory work. When his female lead is fixing slides, and then observing them under a microscope, she can see the cells moving and dividing. Well, fixed cells are dead cells. They don't do much except sit there.Mr. Darnton had a character state that scientists are logical and organized. As someone who has worked in a research lab for many years, I have met very few scientists who are either.I won't even mention the many other logical inconsistencies.Many reviewers have praised this book's ability to present scientific theories in an understandable way. Please, do not believe any of the science presented in this book. It is not science. It is not credible. It is simply made up."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dud","review":"An awkward thriller with no suspense.

John Darnton's books is so similar in many ways to \\"Spares\\" although \\"Spares\\" predates \\"The Experiment\\" by at least three years. The ideas and concept of \\"The Experiment\\" are admirable and it could be worthy of five stars but sadly, John Darnton's sluggish prose and lack of range lets the book down, which is a suprise after the excellent \\"Neanderthal\\". The idea of cloing is not a new one for techno/sci fi literature and with the hype surounding \\"The Experiment and Wes Craven's novel \\"The Fountain Society\\" on the way it looks like the cloning genre is set to repeat itself again and again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"You gotta be kidding!","review":"It is amazing that there are writers who seem to think that it is no big deal for, say, two clones, separated since 'birth,\\" to happen to meet each other in a country of 280 million people and become friends. Oh, did I say their girlfriends were also clones? Must run in the family! Then, in this whole country, they kinda find out where they were cloned, etc., bad guys after them, yawn, and so on.Lots of words, little action that makes any sense, tired theme, scientists are all evil, yada yada.

I'm not a science fan AT ALL, and I hate blood and guts, so I was very wary of this book at first, but, much to my surprise, I absolutely loved it! It was incredibly fascinating, and the best sci-fi book I've ever read.

A winner!","review":"I stayed up all night reading this book --not because I wanted to miss sleep, but because I simply couldn't put it down. It's rare to find a book that's so much fun to read and so educational all at once. At the same time you are enjoying the thrill of the story and the author's wild imagination, you are also learning so much-- about cloning, life extention, the science of aging, etc. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Exciting, Fast-Paced Thriller","review":"Darnton does a good job of creating likeable characters in a scientific thriller that makes you take a stronger interest in genetic testing and cloning.

Overall, a great read, and thoroughly entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging and instructive","review":"This is the perfect book for your holidays or a rainy weekend. The narrative is very fast-paced and engaging, something like Crichton's style.

This one even has two journalists donning surgical gloves to help the campy coroner with his dissection! Unbelievable. From here, the plot keeps slipping until the laughable climax -- young people running amuck like some game trying to outwit the befuddled mad doctors. No danger, no thrills. Just pure pulp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-Concieved","review":"I read this book when I was 13 years old (I am now 16) and I found it extremely entertaining. The scientific jargon was not too advanced for me to understand, but it was still adult enough to keep the plot from sounding cartoon-ish. I thouroughly enjoyed the little plot twists that kept cropping up, and I am planning on reading this book again.The new movie coming out, \\"The Island\\", has a plot that sounds strangely similar; I can't wait to see it and see how it compares to \\"The Expirement\\". (It probably doesn't hurt that I am completely in love Ewan McGregor, though!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderfully fun, topical and well written book. I loved it","review":"This book has it all. Its fresh and topical, painstakingly researched and so well written. It deals with some very important issues in a fun and entertaining way. Its the perfect book to give to a friend who is interested in the way science influences our lives, or just wants a thouroughly enjoyable book to read. The writting is intelligent and fast paced. You will care about the characters and want to stay up all night as you follow their adventure. The writer has a gift for getting the reader involved from the first page.I am already looking forward to John Darnton's next book.Just a pleasure to read. I loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Sloppy","review":"I finally forced myself to finish this plodding tale, which is written on a fourth-grade level. I haven't read any of Darnton's other works (fiction or non) and I can't imagine I ever will. He has a very bad habit of giving pages of detail at certain points, only to dismiss crucial revelations in a sentence or two -- the technique of an amateur, which I abhor. There's plenty of blame to go around for this mess. Besides the sophomoric writing, there's no evidence that Dutton provided any editing to help clarify the story or pick up the dull pacing. A sloppy job for everyone involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frankly, it stinks","review":"I'm amazed at the positive reviews of this silly, boring, and poorly written book.

Yes, it's over 500 pages, but every page is crammed with action and detail. Not too detailed, though. Darnton tells you just what you need to know.

Really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too plain silly to be gripping","review":"Given the author's journalistic ceredentials, I expected quality in this thriller: some insights into the future or the science, or at least a believable plot. Sadly 'The Experiment' delivers none of the above. Its positions on the genetic science are obvious, overblown and unoriginal. The plot - mad scientists on secret private islands - is pure 1970s James Bond (or should that be Austin Powers?) and, most unforgivingly, the writing is clunky and ridden with the most awful cliches. I admit, I didn't get to the end. Not good."},{"rating":"1","title":"It had hardly any plot and was confusing.","review":"Please don't read this book unless you want to spend 24 hours a day 7 days a week for the rest of your life trying to figure out who the bad guys are.

Oh yes, it caught on fire. Anyway, after searching all over for a bread machine, I found this one in the least likely of places. Value City. It was $19.99 and I figured that I needed it badly enough that I could deal with a $20 waste if it died too. I have to say that I was VERY pleasantly surprised! It works a LOT better than my old machine and the bread turns out GREAT! The consistency is superb! I LOVE the shape of the pan. It's not too thin or too wide. I also LOVE how EASY it is to use. You dont need a PhD to program this machine. Anyone can do it.I only have a few nominal complaints. It is HEAVY! It's not an issue for me because I use my bread machine daily and it lives on my counter. But it is HEAVY! And the other complaint is that it is a little louder than my other breadmachine was. That doesn't really bother me, but I am told it bothers some people.I figure, for $20, this is the best investment I've made!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It burns everything","review":"I bought this as a replacement for my Oster bread machine, which I literally wore out.I'm not a fan of this machine. Evey loaf of bread I makes burns , even recipes that were tried and true in my old machine. And when I use the recipes in the instruction manual, there seems to be too much liquid or too little flour, because I never get a nice ball after the mixing cycle is over. It's always a loose gummy mess, no matter how carefully I measure.For the price, you can probably find a better machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Veteran Bread Machine User","review":"I was HIGHLY disappointed in this machine. I got this machine last October, had it for 2 months and it died after making horrible clunking noises for a week. I took it to the certified repair center who had it for a month and said they fixed it, but when I took it home to make pizza dough it died the same day. I was FURIOUS and shipped it back to the company. I will say I got very prompt service from them and had a new one (they couldn't fix mine) on my doorstep in 10 days from when I had sent it. I was happy until the new one started doing the SAME THING after 4 months of use. It just died 2 days ago. Needless to say I am looking for a different brand. To be fair I will say that I use my breadmaker 5-7x/week. However the Welbuilt machines I had previously took that kind of workload for 6 years without a problem. So Don't buy this machine unless you are only using it on a rare occassion!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy Toastmaster!

I will never buy their product again and I most certainly suggest you don't either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best little bread maker ever","review":"If you don't mind the horizonal shape, this machine does it all. It's very simple to use. Regardless of the type of bread you are making, there are only 2 buttons to push to start the process, 3 if you want to delay the start time. The only drawback is the cooldown time between loafs. I have found you can make 2 loafs back-to-back, but it needs to rest (about 30 minutes) before making a 3rd. It's the next best tasting to the honest labor of love effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have two of this machine!","review":"I used to have really expensive Panasonic bread maker(model SD_-YD 250), but after 1 year of use it stopped working completely Soo..

The best thing of this machine is definetely 3 things. 1. price 2. durability 3. simplicity. Since I bought this machine I am using everyday for my 3 kids and bread loving husband. Last week we decided to buy the same machine as 2nd bread maker( I have 2 of this breadmaker now!) since I can't keep up with my family guys' eating bread speed.

This was my least favorite.The biggest problem was the connector between the neoprene fabric and the rest of the strap. I gave it a bit of a stress test by giving it a sharp yank and it came apart - the stud that went through the neoprene ripped out of the fabric. This probably wouldn't happen if you were being careful, but I could see the strap ripping if you get the camera caught on something accidentally... or if someone tries to rip it away from you. I've never seen that happen with any other straps, including the cheap nylon ones that come with most cameras.Moreover - this may be personal preference, but I found that the strap was too long. If I let the camera hang, it would dangle a few inches below my fingers - making it difficult to reach without using my other hand, and making it more likely that it would banged or caught on something."},{"rating":"2","title":"great design and reliable","review":"Manufacturer's straps always get in my way. This one works like a Wii remote strap. I put this strap around my left wrist when I go to parties or other gatherings (leave your right hand free to shake hands). If you need to shoot, just raise the camera up and shoot. If you need both hands free, drop the camera and let it swing. If you need to hand the camera to a friend to shoot a portrait of you, use the quick disconnect, hand them the camera, then snap the camera back onto your wrist when you are done.

At the beginning of each of these pieces, one embarks on a voyage, and one is staggered by the passing \\"scenic\\" display of colors, textures, and melodic brilliance. His tranfiguring harmony sounds like that of no other composer. And as always with Dutilleux, motifs heard early in each concerto recur several times later, but each time within a new context. The result is an exquisite \\"triggering\\" of memory.Sound poetic enough? In truth, Dutilleux is our most \\"poetic\\" composer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Practical Book","review":"This book gives down-to-earth, simple advice to anyone thinking about starting their own firm.My favorite part was his treatment of investors and other people who \\"want to help.\\" His stories of how new businesses had been micromanaged to death by investors, particularly lawyers, were priceless and not to be found in other advice books of this type.If you think you have a chance in starting up your own business in an economy which is, slowly but steadily, getting better, read this book first."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Place to Start","review":"Bobby Burg's(member of Joan of Arc and Make Believe) Love of Everthing may seem like it'd be eclisped by Joan of Arc, but at times LoE seems as powerful if not more than JOA in the sense of a catchy pop song. Bobby's voice may be an aquired taste for some though. He's descrbed as boy-ish by some or toy instruments with adult themes and situations. Lyrically Burg comes up with some cool one-liners with some druggy themes, sexual, relationship, anger, and who even knows(like early Joan of Arc). Though the lyrics hardly matter with the melodies and atmospheric keyboard that seems to go beyond atmospheric as a back bone like in the two opening tracks. There's a lot of great hooks in this lo-fi pop album that reminds me of GbV a little bit.The album has a great cohesion to it starting off with fun keyboard tunes(Hotel Parties) and the middle is more mellow experimental ballads(Possible Possibilities) to rocking at the end (I Love All You Guys fast)."},{"rating":"2","title":"More artwork, please!","review":"I primarily purchased this book because I love Dame Darcy's artistic style. I wish there had been artwork accompanying the text. That being said, the story and plot of In the Garden of Poisonous Flowers was interesting, it simply felt unfinished. Too many questions were left unanswered, too many back stories were left unexplained. The writing is gripping, and the art work is exquisite. Perhaps if I continue with the Threshold series, my questions will be answered."},{"rating":"2","title":"History revisited","review":"On Trial for my Country is a novel which I have read with interest as it has given a new way at looking at Zimbabwean history. What impressed meis the way Samkange make members of the family meet after death for a trial. The relationships Fathers and sons are interesting to explore too. The objectivity of the historian and the craft of the novelist is well at work in this novel. Stanlake Samkange rewrite history from the point of view of the African. He tries to show how the Africans have been mistaken by the British and how they tried to understand what was happening to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The cure for the Summertime blues","review":"I'm a huge fan of Roy Meriwether (other than Jesus Christ, Superstar). It's so sad that his early work for Capitol and Columbia in the 60's hasn't been reissued. I just picked up the vinyl copy of Opening Night, Volume 1, which includes the first five tracks that are on the CD. Oh my God. Buy it. This was first issued in '87 on Gemini, and it's amazing to hear that, though the gospel influence has not as much in the foreground, his playing is still as compelling. The way he shreds the piano on Summertime is simply unbelievable and incomparable. Then, as the other reviewer mentioned, he literally does whip the crowd into a frenzy with After Hours. Mad props to a Miami Valley boy and one of the greatest musicians I've ever heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"block n roll","review":"not a good product. falls apart easily and doesn't have many pieces to it...wouldn't reccommend this for any age group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inferior \\"Second\\" quality item","review":"The perches made by BOODA are always well made, this did not seem to be a manufacturing defect. The item sent was frayed along the edges of the rope near where the four sections \\"cross\\". I did not see the fray until 2 weeks after delivery when I fully extended the sections and began manipulating it to install in my parrot's cage. Had I better inspected it upon arrival, I would have returned it immediately, but of course would still be out the cost of shipping. This vendor apparently deals in \\"second quality new\\" merchandise and I will not shop with them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teen Idols for a Moment CD","review":"Product was delivered on time and in excellent condition. While the few songs that I wanted were in this CD, it was worth the value to get these hard to find songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good for import","review":"I guess it's fine if you want to do a lot of data input by hand and from scratch. But if you have data in a database like Access that you want to import you will be frustrated. Constant error messages and it seems like it would take longer to find all the errors in the import file than it would to do the data entry! I gave up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I received this machine for Christmas last year. My husband thought it would become a \\"fad\\" gadget, but we use it all the time. I really like the delay start cycle. We can wake to fresh, warm bread. The machine is a little noisy. It sounds a little like a barking dog, but the final product is worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am returning mine","review":"I bought the Breadman TR800 from another catalog. I have owned one other bread machine in the past. This one baked fine, but was SO NOISY we couldn't tolerate it. It's getting shipped back today.I came to Amazon to check out what else is available and what others have said about those machines. This machine, besides being noisy, only has 1 blade which I guess is no longer the standard. It sounds like 2 is better. I am considering the one that starts with a Z, but I can't go back to that page to learn the spelling. I hope this helps you in your decision making."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bread and jam!","review":"I've had my breadman plus for exactly one year. This machine has seen a lot of use! The bread is very good and the jam is even better. We've treated ourselves to breakfasts of fresh-made bread, using the timer device, with delicious homemade blueberry, blackberry, raspberry and strawberry jams also made in the breadmaker. We also enjoy making our own pizza by making the dough in the breadman, then baking it with toppings, on a pizza stone in our oven.The only downside to this machine is the noise the paddle makes. I may have to move it to the basement for those early morning loaves!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breadman TR 800","review":"If your thinking of buying this machine, be warned about the noise when it is kneading the dough. When we first turned it on we thought the machine was broke. We looked in the instruction book and nowhere does it mention the noise.I will say however that it does makes great jams and bread!Oh my! It has finished making a racket and the dogs have stopped barking!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed w/breadman plus","review":"my husband used their recipe for whole wheat bread-2 pkgs of yeast and added gluten flour(which adds a great pop to the rise). This was the 2nd time we added the gluten-using their recipe for 2lb whole wheat-was a big door stop-both times. I love my kitchen aid mixer-heavy duty-could handle heavy dough. so far we are so sad and disappointed.cheryl"},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC","review":"This is the first bread machine I have ever used. Just got it yesterday. I was skeptical that it could be that easy and still make a good loaf of bread. Well it IS that easy, just put in the ingredients, turn on the machine and in 2 1/2 hours, a fresh hot loaf of bread! And it tastes as good as it looks :) The only complaint I have is that there are coupons in the back of one of the recipe books for ingredients but they expired in 1999! I am extremely happy with this item! I'll be making bread for everyone I know. Home baked bread, great christmas gift for friends and neighbors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunk Of Junk","review":"Noisy first of all!The first machine worked for a while and then went dead.They sent us a new one and it had problems too.The part that turns the turns the paddle slips on the motor shaft making a loud popping noise every few seconds.Weare sending it back for a refund and getting something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy this product","review":"I applied this product exactly according to the instructions, early spring slightly before the first mowing. Four months later and my backyard is full of crabgrass. I had a crab grass issue in the backyard in the past but NEVER seen as much as this.. It completely has taken over and its not even summer yet. I've always maintained a nice lawn besides last summer when my lawn burnt up in July when I went on vacation and crabgrass emerged. This product did absolutely nothing. In fact over the last couple years I havent had much luck at all with scotts seed or other products. Needless to say I will not be purchasing scotts products anymore :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Save your money. The crabgrass preventer does not work. Straight fertilizer is much less expensive and will accomplish the same thing.

I did not read the fine print on the back of the package stating \\"Do not use on St. Augustine grass.\\"I am contacting Amazon for a refund now.UPDATE: Amazon promptly refunded the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"READ THE PACKAGING","review":"I went to HD today to buy this product because I figured I'd get a head start on the crabgrass this year. The packaging states that you cannot plant any new seed for 4 months after placing this down. If you are someone who likes to overseed the lawn every year, you cannot place this down beforehand. It also states you cannot rake for 4 months afterwards otherwise you will disturb the crabgrass barrier it creates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Well i thought the hat was going too come in a box but that wasn't the case the hat was in a bag and when i got it it wus bent out of shape and i couldn't fix the problem"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another flier who sadly cannot write","review":"While the author may be a delightful man and a capable pilot, this book goes on the growing heap of failures in writing about flying, so far as i am concerned. In fact, it goes fairly far down even that heap, since i am one of those who can see most books to the end, but finally could not be bothered with this one.I have learnt that fliers who can write are very rare birds indeed.I am now learning to carefully ignore the reviewer star ratings here when making my own selections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good combination of voices","review":"I love this CD. All of the songs are great. Pat Benatar and Blondie have really different sounds, but they also sound similar. All of the songs have similar themes- the ups and downs of love, though it concentrates more on the downs. My favorite songs are Heart of Glass, One Way or Another, Hit Me With Your Best Shot, and We Belong. It's a great CD, so go ahead and get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One cruddy appliance....","review":"I purchased this mixer a while back and it didn't last me a week before the motor burned out.
