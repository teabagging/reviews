Although some of these type movies can and are very good, this one is not all that good. As you would expect, the kids happen upon a gas station where they are warned of impending danger. Although I must say that the opening scene where the chick gets killed by a man with a hook for a hand was cool. The kids happen upon inbred killers who kill some of them with the rest worrying for their lives. There is gore and some good killing scenes, I have to say. But I'll never understand the comparison to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies! for no movie can come close!! I would maybe compare this film to Wrong Turn if I had to compare it to another film but I must say Wrong Turn was a Great film compared to this one. Just OK in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steer clear of this Detour!","review":"This Movie was a huge let down. I knew from the start that it was going to be a low budget rip off, trying to cash in on the moderate success of Wrong Turn. I still thought it would provide an evening of mindless entertainment. The script did not give the actors and director much to work with. It was full of lame dialogue and had a weak story. There was really no background or explanation for the cannibals that I could find and the setup was about as unoriginal as you can get. The acting was pretty lousy as well. Plus the picture quality was very poor even for straight to video. The worst thing about it was the ridiculous main cannibal. What was going on with that big guy's eyebrows...if it were not for the laugh I got from that this would have been a total waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort","review":"Though not a 'B' movie, this just about scrapes the bottom of the horror barrel. An extremely elementary effort, I found myself endeared to no character, so I wasn't frightened about what might happen to any of them. I was also bored. No character development, no background information, a predictable storyline and ridiculous gore cheapened this film effort. I even wanted to turn off the movie about 30 minutes into viewing, but I figured I'd stick it out. Not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"What Up, Yo?\\"...","review":"Oh dear, not only is DETOUR a poor HILLS HAVE EYES clone, but it also contains one of the most annoying, idiotic characters I've seen in any horror movie!

As for the film itself, it has your typical stick-women and young dweebs in danger.

They looked like everyday people that you would see on the street. Well, they didn't look disfigured is what I mean.

You are as likely to come across his books in the local supermarket or drugstore as in the bookstore and he knows how to churn out topical volumes and market them effectively and often regionally.As in nearly all of his books, FOR CUBS FANS ONLY is a collection of entertaining and diverse stories on the topic at hand-in this case the excruciating yet lovable baseball team. Although Wolfe largely serves as the collector and presenter of these stories, you may occasionally find him inserting the odd joke or funny quip. What one is left with is an enjoyable volume for the dedicated sports fan and light reader.

At night it is still very pretty, but darker.It was pretty simple to put on, just make sure you have a good squeegeey to get out all the bubbles so it will be nice and flat on the window, and make sure the windows are freshly cleaned with glass cleaner prior to application.It does a good job of blocking the view from the other side because it is opaque, but i suppose you might be able to see a slight amount of shadows from inside if you are super close to the outside of the glass, but really there are no discernable figures you could see.During the daytime it still lets in a lot of light and the picture looks beautiful as the sunshine illuminates it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely beautiful for my needs","review":"This product really gives the illusion of stained-glass in my kitchen window which looks out to a very white wall. It minimizes the glare while providing the illusion of natural outdoors. Friends and family have walked in my kitchen and not even noticed it because it looks so natural - and when I point it out to them they say how beautiful it is. I plan to order more in other patterns for other windows in my home. Also, the photo posted online of this particular is washed out and does not do the product's natural, jewel-toned colors justice.NOTE: I suggest you create a slight beveled effect by leaving at least a quarter- to half-inch space between the film and the window panes on all sides .. that way you can still \\"see out\\" the window, yet the pattern still looks seamless."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"i've used window film before, so i had high expectations going in. the picture is pretty, but the film itself is just printed with the photo of stained glass. there is no texture to add realism as with the clematis/water lily print and the frank loyd wright-esque film. it does let light filter through and is very simple to put up, it just looks much cheaper and less like stained glass than the films that have the variation and texture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed and Frustrated","review":"This product was very difficult to apply. I had a sharp utility knife and a 90 degree ruler and followed the instructions completely, but it was still very difficult to get an even cut and to get the dimensions exactly right. I only knew I needed the 90 degree ruler and the utility knife from reading previous reviews, these items were never mentioned in the directions. There are no grid lines on the back of the product. It was a wet mess until it dried the next morning and then I could see all the places where it hadn't cut evenly. I had to go back and try to patch all the little spots which was very difficult. I was applying this to a window that was divided up into little squares so that complicated the process. I have read that other similar products on here are much easier to deal with and I would recommend trying one of those instead. I still gave it two stars because it is very beautiful when completed, but if I had to do it over again I would try something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Beautiful!

I must note that many of the songs are the 45 versions which are generally shorter and the mixes of some of the songs are markedly different from the actual albums they're culled from. Most notably are Cold as Ice, Waiting for a Girl Like You, and Long Long Way From Home. Also disappointing to many and maybe interesting to others is the omission of the studio version of Hot Blooded. A live recording from the \\"4\\" tour is presented instead. Sadly, Blue Morning Blue Day isn't featured on the record. Leaving at least one hit off a best of has always seemed to be the thing for record companies to do.

Volume II was superb, with a horror ending! So of course, Volume III is now sharing the shelf. If you want to hear the insights, the story, the people behind the engines, then these volumes simply have no equal. This volume III is perhaps a little drier than the earlier volumes, perhaps not quite as captivating, but still a cracker of a read about a fascinating company and its rebirth. Get all three as they really are a well written and cohesive set."},{"rating":"2","title":"rather good","review":"criticisms of this book as being plotless or \\"a novel of ideas\\" make little sense to me. so far as i know great art is often unconventional, and i personally found this to be a very intelligent and entertaining meditation on society and human nature wrapped in precise, beautiful prose. sharp observations and a sadly humorous sense of absurdity permeate each page as huxley examines various facets of the human condition through his characters thoughts, pretensions, and actions. the book never reaches any conclusions about it's subject matter and is structured as a loosely interconnected series of vignettes, but there's nothing wrong with either unless you have very narrow ideas about what a book should be. enjoyed it immensely."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had to put it down.","review":"I usually get drawn into Huxley's books, but this one is his first--and thankfully only--attempt at comedy. It is dreadfully unfunny and unstimulating, a contrast most of the rest of his body of work. One thing I noticed was that half of the dialogue ended with exclamation points, and that is way too much! Thus, I don't recommend that you read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huxley's Early Novel Antic Hay","review":"Antic Hay is Huxley writing in a heavy, self conscious style, where characters are like Greek characters on stage. Pared down, it would be a great play, but Huxley's need to press upon the reader his social/political ideas isn't the easiest to wade through. What is it about? In early works, Huxley struggles with dead Victorian values in the face of a new young 20th century leisure class, and the new modernism of the political and social change of the post WWI era. There is a class of educated idle rich, but they do not affect meaningful, permanent change in the world like the idealized Socialist upstart. Huxley over analyzes the world of the character in this novel. Antic Hay observes from a distance the new world order. It is a tornado of a novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Hip Hop Albums Ever","review":"This is hands down one of the best hip hop albums of all time, and one of the best concept albums ever.

Todd Gitlin's essay regarding modernism and postmodernism is very good for an historical -but broad account. Also, since the book covers a lot of territory (e.g. ranging from pomo-architecture to themed environements in malls)it helps one get a sense of the way postmodern ideas are infused throughout cultural practices. Some of the essays are reprints or versions of other works (e.g. Jameson's essay on p.m. architecture looks like part of his arguement in The Cultural Logic book). All in all I found it helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whodunit?","review":"I read this book when I was in the 5th grade, and didn't quite understand all of it.

The characters are quirky and somewhat interesting, but there are too many of them- it's distracting and doesn't allow for much character exploration. I don't know what else I can say except it just wasn't engaging - the plot was not that mysterious and I didn't really care if they solved the mystery or not.I gave the book to my son and he couldn't get through it. Every day after his assigned reading time he would complain, \\"But it's sooooo boring!!\\" and beg to be allowed to stop reading it. I finally agreed to stop torturing him, so he never finished it.

Yes, this book is extremely confusing and at times your not gonna wanna read it because its a little frustrating. But you have to play along with the book. Maybe you'll figure out the mystery!

Too many charaters have primary roles and too many subplots are going on, and soon, the young reader will become confused and give up. The actual Westing game is also a little confusing. Readers (along with the characters) never really know what the game is or how to play/solve it. So for youngsters, I don't recommend this book.But if you're an adult or teen looking for a quick, entertaining read, you can't go wrong with this one. There are some funny parts, and the characterization is surprisingly good, considering the number of characters involved. The book seems a little choppy at times, and a few plot twists take a little rereading to understand, but you'll enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather Disappointing","review":"I'd heard of this book for a while, knew it was a puzzle book, and thought I'd read it because I enjoy puzzle books. However, the main puzzle about the clues left by Westing went on far too long, especially when it was pretty obvious where the clues were leading. I found the race, sex and disability stereotypes very off-putting. Maybe the ideas were cutting edge for the time in which the book was written, but the stereotypes made the book seem very dated to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for Young and Old","review":"I first read this book over twenty years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it.

The writing, however, is atrocious. I don't understand how it received a Newbery.

She also switches from 1st person to 3rd person erratically and mixes tenses frequently. I would never give this to a child, as I would be afraid they would believe this is what good writing looks like.I tried to make allowances for the publication date, and I'm certainly not one to quibble about political correctness, but even I was offended by the way she handled certain characters' race, occupational potential, and physical and mental handicaps.

The book has very little details, and the plot is oh, so boring, and I never like this before. The characters names are pointlessly appropriate such as \\"Crow\\", \\"Turtle', and \\"Uncle Sam\\". The scenery is bad, and I could imagine better places. The ending was also absolutely terrible in all ways ever. I would rather drink tea from a gutter then read this book again.The book starts as a pointless scenario and progress to a field of writing horror. I think the author had a huge writers block, and wrote down what ever she could think of first. I don't now how, but Newbery Award. I would have slapped a biohazard sticker to the book just to so how I really think of this book. My summary is that this book is extremely terrible, and should be destroyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not worth the time.","review":"I was very disappointed with the book The Westing Game at the end.The book is about a man named Sam Westing who supposedly died but was really playing games with other characters' minds.

The author makes you feel like you are their watching it happen like a play. I highly reommend it if you like mysterys.

You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Westing Game","review":"I liked this book. It was really interesting because it was not like most mysteries. My favorite character was Turtle.

I think every kid should read this book. This was a really good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Westing's Mystery","review":"The Westing Game is the best book I've read this year! My favorite part is when Turtle and Chris cracked the clues, but the confusing part about the book was there was too many characters, so it was hard to keep track of who did what in the story.

Towards the end of the story, people start to confess who they really are and everything everyone thought was going to happen, didn't. the person who they thought was their friend, wasn't who they said they were.

I never get tired or this book. As a high school student I have a lot of hard reading to do and I always need a good no brainier book and trust me it is almost always this one. The Westing Game is an intriguing story about Same Westing and his will. I suggest it to anyone who enjoys children's books as it is one of the best. I would buy it any day if I needed a good children's no brainier (I still have my first copy; it looks about a hundred years old.) I do wish I had kept a notebook to write down the clues in but I didn't, but it would be fun (though now I know the book to well!)Hope this was helpful, but one more time it is a fabulous book!P.S.

So many characters and you won't want to put it down. Moving into a new apartment called Sunset Towers on Halloween night a girl is dared to go into a the Westing House . A dead man is found and so 16 people are trying to figure out just who murdered Sam Westing. Four explosions accour.

I liked how Sandy McSouthers was Turtles friend who she never kicked, but I think when she said she kicked Barney Northrup and Sandy had the same bruise in that spot, that gave too much away in the story. Also, there were too many heirs in this book, making some of them not even important in the story very much.

The Westing Game is about Mr. Westing, who plans a game for all of the people that live in the Apartment Building he owns. The winner receives a large sum of money. The book has 30 chapters, but it is still a good book. It is the best book My Humanities teacher read to us. I like the book because it is a mystery, with good characters too.

After realizing that, I was a bit disappointed, because I was looking for a light read after reading a thoughtful book(Sorceress, by Celia Rees), but I didn't mind after reading a while.This book is impossible to put down, but I won't tell you the whole plot.

I love this book. I love the tone, I love the characters, I love the plot, I love the plot twists. If there is a perfect book in this world, this is it. It's quirky in its humor, catchy in its suspense, drawing the reader right in and refusing to release them. There's nothing typical about this unique Newbery winner. The Westing Game takes the phrase 'diverse characters' to a whole new level. The mystery itself is so absorbing, the clues are there all along, but they're hidden so well and laid out so subtly within the text, and you're so immersed in the story that you, along with the other characters, suspect everyone. The format is great, too, short, snappy sections that are the perfect length. Everything comes together for a satisfying resolution, but the novel and its contents never leave your thoughts.Rating: 5/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"I was assigned to read this book for school.

This is a smart, funny, moving story. The main character is a heroine you can root for and the supporting cast is interesting and engaging as well. Since it's a bit of a mystery I won't give anything away about the plot, but it has some great twists and a perfect ending. The slighly dark cover might be offputting to some, but it's not at all disturbing and actually a much lighter read than the cover would suggest.

And if you care, you'll get positive comments from anyone who sees it, but that is no reason to buy it in my opinion!The bad: yes, the keys are small. But am an average size guy and you will get used to it and be texting super fast in no time. It is certainly no more difficult to text with than an iPhone.

No deer ran further than 100 yards, but in the thick bush, a blood trail would have been helpful. May have been my shots, but I am convinced it was the lack of exit wound size.

I'd recommend going that route if you're interested in the other stories by him, if you truly want just this book I'd say go for it, you're likely to re-read it enough times to make the cost worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definitive Batman title","review":"Take one of the most compelling villains of all time - the Joker - and one of the undisputed gods of the comics world - Alan Moore - and put them together: you get one giant piece of awesome.Brian Bolland went back and redid the colors for this edition, which make the exemplary artwork stand out even more. Alternating between an origin story and an unforgettable confrontation between the Dark Knight and the Clown Prince of crime that shows both how utterly alone they are (think the interrogation scene in the movie \\"The Dark Knight\\" but friendlier), \\"The Killing Joke\\" pulls you in and never lets go, leaving you with a satisfying but inexplicably (but purposefully) troubling ending.This deluxe edition also contains an original graphical afterword by Bolland, which is a nice extra but ultimately forgettable. \\"The Killing Joke\\" may be two decades old but is no less a classic now as it was then."},{"rating":"2","title":"ilustraciones y textos al máximo nivel","review":"ha cumplido las expectativas que tenía, y tras leer varias obras de moore, decir que esta breve, dura, y magnífica historia es la que está mejor ilustrada de todas, sin duda. una pieza para colección."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moore/Bolland...? Can't miss...","review":"One of the best Batman stories ever, followed by the hand of one of the masters in comic book art. The best drawings of Batman I've seen. Great quality of this hardcover, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Twist on the Joker Origins","review":"What with the hype coming for The Dark Knight next year, I was interested in how this comic inspired actor Heath Ledger to take a different stroke on the Joker.Twisted and sarcastic, Moore's Joker offers a true psychotic version of the infamous Batman villain. He shows no mercy, and the classic drawing of the Joker emerging from the chemical waste for the first time is priceless.A definite must-read for anyone wanting a twisted and fresh version of the true psychotic Joker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome.","review":"I bought this for my 26 year old husband and he adores it! The graphics are superb and the story is just amazing. I would recommend this to any Batman fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best.","review":"Ever read a review and say the best, yeah, sure.

If it's cheaper and you aren't the biggest fan then just go with the regular edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's keep this short - this is just a great, short read","review":"I am a comic book nerd and whenever people give me that smug look this is the comic I lend them. It takes about thirty minutes to read and the story is grown up enough to make people realize that comics aren't for kids, they're just about story telling. This is fast paced and so emotional; only Moore could create a story that actually has you feeling sorry for a bad guy. Read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing Graphic Novel!","review":"Now that everyone has seen the Dark Knight, Twice. For those interested in comics I would recommend checking the graphic novel out. It is a look inside the mind of the joker. Crazy, demented and twisted mind. This is not a comic for kids. It is more adult oriented and shows how a real joker would react in a world like Gotham. It is a good launching pad for understanding or at least getting an idea for what Heath Ledger portrayed in his performance in The Dark Knight. All in all if you're a huge comic fan you probably already have this, if you're just getting into or want something related to a comic movie this is a good start."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Killing Joke","review":"I expected more from this reading. Alan Moore did take it another level with what he did to Barbara Gordon in this issue. I found the ending anti-climactic. The art and coloring were good. I guess I've been spoiled by all the Batman cartoons and other Batman comics."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST COMIC STORY EVERY WRITTEN","review":"While previous reviewers may only state that this be included as one of the best comics ever written.

The artwork and coloring are nothing short of amazing as well. If you are looking for some great Joker quotes this contains some of his very best."},{"rating":"1","title":"That's not funny, Batman.","review":"I get it. This book is a classic, role re-defining story. I love Barbara Gordon as the Oracle, so I do have a sort of appreciation of this book. But I don't understand Batman's complacency and compassion toward the Joker. It seems so out of character. And maybe its just me, but the writing totally had me confused-I mean why the Hell is he laughing it up with the Joker after what both Jim and Barbara Gordon had just gone through? Why did Joker get such a lame back story? I would rather not know than have read that. I buy a lot of books off amazon based on reviews, but this is one that I disagree with the majority on. Not a great story at all in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"How do you turn an acrobat into an oracle? Sic a vampire on her, of course.","review":"Voyeurism as rape. This novella was ahead of its time and often referenced as a favorite amongst Chinese American fanboys because it expresses the violation of the more vulnerable female close to the threatening hero, Batman. This was written by Alan Moore and the art isn't pretty at all but it does the job of communicating the emotional impact of the story. I recommend this one without reservation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit overpriced","review":"I payed for it of course, but I still find it be a bit overpriced.It's one of the greatest Joker tales ever told, and an important one for any collector to have. Yet, for the sheer depth of the story arch and the amount that I was charged... It was just a bit pricey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read, probably not groundbreaking if you're younger.","review":"After hearing so much about Batman: The Killing Joke, I had to give it a read. I've always been more of a Marvel fan but admittedly haven't ever been an avid comic reader. That said, this is a quick and interesting read that is very much worth the time. However, although this novel changed the character of the Joker, those of us younger readers (I'm nineteen at the time of review) that grew up with the criminally insane Joker probably won't find this as groundbreaking as long-time readers, especially after Heath Ledger's portrayals. The Killing Joke is definitely a great story and I'd recommend it to anyone looking to get a better understanding of the Joker or to read this to understand the influence of this story on later generations of Batman stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short But Good","review":"After I finished this for the first time, I was ready to dismiss it out of hand as being too short and simplistic. But as I thought it over, the more I realized there was some real depth to this story. Seeing Mr. Moore's suggested origin of Batman's nemesis suggests--at least to me--a reason behind Joker's apparent madness, and that adds the aforementioned depth to this story. And the last panel certainly doesn't hurt it either."},{"rating":"2","title":"... it's everyone else that's mad!!!","review":"This chapter in the Dark Knight's life was as grim as the events which spawned him. There is death and rebirth here - the Joker's history, Birth of Oracle and a wake-up call for the Hollywood writers of BATMAN: Year One.!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Well-Written Drama for the Genre","review":"Moore makes the Joker so unlikable in his actions, yet so vulnerable and, dare I say it, HUMAN, that you almost forgive his unspeakable attrocities before the climax. I felt manipulated and confused, delighting in his long speeches about morality and the confines of \\"order\\" and \\"sanity\\" Batman, doing his usual brooding and stomping around, is secondary in this story acting almost as a force of nature. At a moment where the Dark Knight reaches out for some connection, some understanding with his arch enemy, the Joker perpetrates acts against his closest allies that prove that the two are always going to be connected; two opposites locked against one another until one or both are destroyed.It is a moving and intelligent story of how we deal with the loss and injustice this world sometimes loads on us. One of Moore's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cool One-Shot","review":"There really isn't anything I an add that hasn't already been mentioned by other reviewer's: the comic looks great, the story is entertaining and provides (as far as I know) an unprecedented look into the origins of The Joker, and The Joker is just an awesome character in here. It is a bit short (you can probably finish it off in less than an hour, though I spent quite a bit of time examining the artwork) and a bit cliche (Batman and The Joker are the same) but still very enjoyable.Check it out, it's well worth the $10 and the hour it takes to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Joke to end it all","review":"a Perfect tale of laughter, and saddness. The Killing Joke is one of the few origen storys that made the character more developed and still keep the same greatness that makes a character such as the Joker still really cool. The story is dark and very powerful, moving at times and makes you think about just what is it that makes a man a Figure head of crime in Gothem City. It does a amazing job at telling the Jokers past with still that hint of \\"Is it REALLY what happened?\\" If you ask me it is one of the best origen storys I have ever read. The Art work is amazing, the story is perfect, it turly is a moment in Batman History anyone would be happy to have read, and by the end of the story you will have a new found respect for the Crawned Prince of Comedy with a ending that will have you saying \\"Perfect\\" once your done. If you are not a Fan of Batman then this is one of the best Comics to read to get you into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"haunting and masterful","review":"it may be short, but man this is one heck of a read. $10 is a killer price for the content here. the horrid acts committed by the joker are horrifying and its worth it up to the very end. if youre a batman fan you should already own this. if you arent, you still should already own this. one of the best graphic novels ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best origin stories!","review":"If you haven't read this yet and you're a batman fan, you are doing yourself an injustice...

The book was practically over once you really get into it.Also, If you love Alan's work as much as I, then some of the afterword and stuff like that will kinda annoy you.Bottom line, If you like Alan Moore, BUY IT.I'm not sure how true Batman fans like it, so I would look into that if you love Batman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great joker story","review":"This was a great graphic novel,and was one of the firsts i have ever read.I was a bit dissapointed with the joker origin which seemed interesting at first but it was not what i expected it to be in the end and really could have been much better and more interesting.Overall it is a great batman vs the joker story ehich anyone can enjoy and love with a okay joker origin but Nevertheless a great joker and batman comic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Fun","review":"This is wonderful to read and a joy to look at!

Featuring one of the coolest villains out there, this book has the perfect personality for the Joker. The is for very mature readers because it may disturb some. In the Jokers most brutal campaign of horror he shoots Barbara Gordon, paralyzing her waist down, in three panels with no word balloons or sounds. It was completely unexpected and Alan Moore made it even more disturbing with what he did to Commissioner Gordon afterword when he tried to make Gordon go insane. The only bad thing is the Jokers origin. It's not that good, well at least I was expecting a little more story than that. Overall, a really enjoyable book!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A possible origin of Batman's greatest enemy is revealed.","review":"This book finally attempts to give a history toone of comicdom's most famous, yet most engimatic, villians. The two parallel plots in the book of the Joker attempting to drive Commisioner Gordon insane in a manner similar to how he had, as displayed in the parallel plot. This book manages to convey a true humanity to this character as a man who had a real life and family and how it utter collapses around him. This culminates in the desperate crime that lead to his chemical scarring that marked his descent into madness. You will be left with a very different impression of the Joker as you finish one of the finest superhero stories ever written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review for HARDCOVER Batman: The Killing Joke","review":"The hardcover is not the The Killing Joke as originally presented to comic readers. For the original, you must buy the original GN one-shot, or DC Universe: The Stories of Alan Moore (Paperback) which reprints the original, as it was originally.It should be noted before buying the KJ Hardcover that:1) Brian Bolland radically recolored the entire story2) Batman's yellow oval is removed from the entire story (even though the story still takes place during Batman's \\"yellow oval\\" period)3) there is a subtle change to the cover; instead of just having the word balloon saying the word \`Smile' with no punctuation, it now reads \`Smile!'"},{"rating":"2","title":"good graphic novel","review":"The Killing Joke is one of the more significant Batman graphic novels. It is a little on the short side and feels rushed but the art of Brian Bolland combined with a quality Joker origin story makes it a winner.

Asolid piece of work"},{"rating":"2","title":"batmans equal","review":"This is the one book about the joker every batman fan should have it has a great story wonderful artwork and lots of ultra violence it also has the most haunting scene ever with barbara gordon getting shot and paralysed. the mind games and conversation between batman and his number one foe are a step above what others have done with these two over the years highly recommend a fantastic read"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Condition","review":"I bought the product, and it said the condition was new. I don't tolerate companies that say the product is new, but in reality its really not. On several of the pages in this book, there were multiple green pen marks. I was going to keep this book as a collection after reading it, but not anymore.On a side note the story is really good, which I would rate a 5/5. The past of Joker is revealed, and you learn much more about him. This is a must buy for Batman, and Joker fans. Just don't buy from this company!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brooding and mean-spirited addition to the Batman myth","review":"Please don't call me a \\"wimp,\\" but I am tired of the current trend in comicdom to turn Batman (and his enemies) into sympathetic and oh-so-neurotic souls. The Joker, while always a fruitcake, gets a makeover here, and is revealed to once have been a family man. OK, so what? Is that supposed to elicit a tear from the reader?Then, in the same story, he commits a crime so heinous to both Commissioner Gordon and daughter Barbara that the empathy one may have had for the fiend evaporates almost as soon as it appeared.Mind you, I don't like the non-Tim Burton-directed movie versions, either. And the 60's high camp of Adam West's series didn't add much.Only did the 90's animated version get the characters correctly.I, honestly, didn't find the \\"joke\\" worthy of my expenditure.Obviously, the majority of others represented here have different opinions...but, to each his own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy the HARDCOVER!","review":"This hardcover is the Star Wars Special Edition of comics. Brian Bolland destroyed a great comic by re-coloring it on his computer. The Killing Joke had that great 80s color palette that you can find in Watchman and some of the best Vertigo Comics like Sandman and Preacher. Bolland defaced a work of art. In his remorseless forward to the hardcover, he acts as the comic's success belongs all to him and not Alan Moore or John Higgins. Higgins coloring on Hellblazer and Watchmen are some of my all time favorites. Thank god Bolland didn't go in and destroy those with his computer too. Bolland's lack of respect is sickening.

Cited as one of the influential novels read by the late Heath Ledger as inspiration for his role as the Joker in The Dark Knight this is a pretty solid story. The writing as you would probably expect is brilliant and did nothing short of solidify Alan Moore's place in comic book history.The art is great and very recognized as archetype Brian Bolland. The short novel is very dark and twisted, things you will never forget, and created one event in DC history that changed the Bat-universe forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Story","review":"This was really incredible. The story was great, but what really made it so memorable was the terrific art and the way panels mirrored each other as we shifted from the Joker's tortured memories to the present day.

I DON'T THINK SOOOO!!","review":"If anyone callously dismisses \\"comic books\\" as juvenile reading material, I would direct them to this as a fine example of how wrong they are. When I read this upon its initial release, it sent chills up my spine. It is genuinely disturbing in parts, but utterly compelling. It's nice to see a stand-alone story that grabs you by the throat, takes you along for a chilling ride and leaves you with something to think about. A marvel this story is and a modern Batman classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A blurry line between sane and insane?: An interesting book!","review":"I am not a big comic book reader, but this novel looked interested and I like Batman, so I took a chance. I'm glad I did because the story was riveting. I don't know that much about Batman, and to be honest, the story confused me a little, but after reading it several times, I decided the book was a keeper. This is a story about a man, the Joker, who commits several senseless acts of violence in order to try and drive Batman insane. To me this is a story about humanity and the quest to make sense out of an often senseless world. Read this book if you like Batman and the Joker. Or read this book for the reason I did: You like a compelling story about a hero in an imperfect world, a story that makes you think about who you are and where you fit in this imperfect world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shriek Show does it again with another outstanding pack.","review":"for the price you can get this for (under $15 including s/h) its more than worth it. as with any of the shiek show 3 packs its an excellent deal on quality released classic movies. buying these seperately would cost you a lot more. if you do not own any of these or own one of them than this is worth getting. jungle holocaust is directed by ruggero deodato of 'cannibal holocaust' fame, this came out prior to CH."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 great movies 1 low price","review":"i love italien movies and they dont make them anymore like they used to back in the 80\`s.If you love cheap effex,blood and gore,bad dubbing,porn music then go buy it..... + its cheap !! thank you shriek show"},{"rating":"1","title":"Westinghouse TVs break","review":"We bought a Westinghouse flat screen TV about two years ago.

It has a great picture through both my Comcast digital cable box and my ReplayTV (DVR). DVDs look awesome and my Xbox (original) does too. I read the reviews before purchasing and was hesitant based on the reports of poor service support, but for the price I figured why not give it a shot. I've had the set for a month now and other than the few gotchas listed below, I really enjoy it.The 'gotchas':1. It's HD-Ready versus having a built-in HD tuner.2. My Comcast universal remote would not work with it. Westinghouse seems to have poor support for universal remotes.3. The remote sensor on the tv seems to be very weak. The remote that came with it and my universal remote take several attempts to power it on and off.

We don't have it hooked up to cable or satellite, it's used only for watching DVD's and is connected to a computer for watching streaming movies. Shortly after the warranty expired it began having problems. First it would not turn on or off reliably with the switch or remote. We'd occasionally have to unplug it to turn it off. Finally, it failed to work all together.Westinghouse customer service was terrible! They suggested it was unlikely to be repairable. Best Buy won't help unless an extended warranty was purchased. This TV was used less than 10 hours a week so it's very frustrating to trash it after such a short time.

If you want to spend hundreds of dollars on ink cartridges and replace them every other time you print, then this is the printer for you. If you want to wait minutes for the wireless connection to see and then print your documents and then have errors half of the time, again, this is the printer for you. If you want something that actually works well consider something else. This is not an \\"all-in-one\\" it is an \\"all-for-nothing\\" waste of money. Designed by HP to suck money out of your pockets and into their coffers after you bought the machine by charging you exhorbitant amounts for ink."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many problems with ink cartridges","review":"When I bought the HP 3310 printer I thought the multiple ink cartridges would make printing costs much more economical since you could buy the color cartridges individually. However, I didn't realize that they had a built in expiration date regardless of the amount of ink left and that this would stop the printer from functioning. In addition, my printer hit an error when one of the cartridges still had plenty of ink and 4 months until expiration. It would not let me print until I replaced the cartridge. After an hour online with the service tech, his solution was to take the printer to a service center or upgrade to a new one. I told him I probably would upgrade but it wouldn't be to an HP. What a ripoff. I won't be buying HP again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be a nice printer, if it worked","review":"This machine has been nothing but trouble for me.

I purchased the 3310 new, used it 6 months and it stopped scanning and copying. HP immediately replaced it which was not what I wanted. I preferred having mine fixed. Instead, they sent me a refurbished 3310. Soon afterwards, I had various problems with the refurbished replacement but it kept working for about 9 months. It now won't scan anything and to make multiple copies, I need to power down and power up the machine before making multiple copies. It won't print photos anymore. The only thing it does is print from my computer. I called HP service who told me I am out of warranty. Their answer was for me to trade this one in on the purchase of a refurbished, newer AIO model. No thanks. I will only purchase separate printing components from now on. No more AIO printers for me. Had to admit I was disappointed in HP's service for their AIO line. They are no longer the HP company I've purchased from for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well for only 5 months","review":"This printer only worked well enough for 5 months and than got a paper jam message.

First I had good experiences with HP Laser Printers in the past, both at home and work. They proved to be unstoppable workhorses, pumping out thousands of pages of crisp documents over years of use without fail, and using very little toner per copy. Second, the clerk sold me on the advantages of an \\"all-in-one\\" device.I have been continually frustrated for three years with constant error messages, a scanner that never seems to work without 6 or 7 reboots, and even then it simply won't do the majority of the tasks HP claims it will; and of course the ink cartridges are OUTRAGEOUS. I will never try an All-in-One again, at least not an HP."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most annoying printer I have ever owned","review":"Although the prospect of having the many features supplied by this printer was its selling point, it is by far the most annoying printer I have ever owned. This is due to the chronic problems with the printer not printing until you press a button acknowledging its warning that one of the many ink cartridges is getting low. Right now it will not print anything for me as one of the color print cartridges is empty, even though I only want to print in black and white. This is definitely not the printer for you if it is networked and you are not sitting right beside it to override the relentless print cartridge messages. I will never buy an HP printer again, as I waste too much time pushing buttons to get it to print, when it wants to tell me to buy more ink."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I have had this printer for little over 4 years.

Why spend so much money and then have to relyon Internet/social forums to get any help, but not from the company that made the printer?I am shopping for a Canon after my HP Photosmart 3310 gave me the Ink System Failure error message.

It's basically a board game version of the traditional scavenger hunt, and there are instructions as to what objects to find (which are basically items one can find around the house). The game is educational too as players are requested to find objects beginning with certain letters of the alphabet, etc. The little timer (a plastic hourglass) could have done with some tweaking as a timer which buzzes would have been better - especially when players are at the other end of the house. Be prepared for a major clean-up as objects from around the house start piling up in one corner (we play the game in our family room), but it is good fun and provides exercise for the players, so no complaints here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So much fun for my 3 and 5 year olds!","review":"Made this purchase upon reading other reviews. I must say, they're right! Finally a game that's simple enough for all of my kids to play. My 3 year old does not like it when the game is over. My 5 year old is discovering his competitive side. And my 9 year old is having fun being in charge of a game. There are no complicated game pieces, so if something ever goes missing (with kids like mine, that is bound to happen sooner or later) it can easily be substituted so the game can remain in the family for years to come. NOTE: You may want to look through the cards in advance and pull out any that you know you do not have in your home.

It's a creative game in which the kids get items throughout the house that meet certain criteria (such as, get something that starts with the letter 'H').

It has a \\"Captain Cleanup Round\\" to help ensure things do not get too messy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of money","review":"This was the worst idea for a game. The kids have to run around as fast as they can to bring back items like \\"table clothes\\", \\"ugly shirts\\", etc.So, when my 9 yr old twins were trying to quickly get an ugly shirt they destroyed the closet. Retrieving the table cloth was a even bigger mess.It was a nice try having the final round be the \\"clean up\\", but how is a nine year old going to re-fold a table cloth as fast as she can. They hated it. Maybe this idea would be okay if it was an outside game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Idea for a less messy version! :o)","review":"We played this game the other day and I almost had a nervous breakdown because of all the STUFF that was being dragged out by everyone and plopped onto the living room floor! I'm okay with normal everyday kid messes, but this was just too much!!! LOLAnyway, I came up with a fun idea that my kids love just as much, and I thought I would share it here. We all sit down next to my kids' large bookshelf full of kids books, and we play the game exactly the same except we flip through the books to find the items! (You could use magazines too if you have lots of those, but we like the children's books) It actually made it much easier for my 3-year-old to play and he loved when he found things faster than his big brother!"},{"rating":"2","title":"kewl","review":"this game is so much fun i want to play it again and again! now some of my friends want one too"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good way to burn energy!","review":"My 4 kids absolutely love this game. It is a game that needs supervision but watching what the kids came up with was so much fun! Some of the cards are outdated. Who really has a cassette tape or yellow pages anymore (to name a few). To fix this I just looked at the cards to omit the ones we didn't have before I put them down on the board for the kids to find. I also had a clean up round between each round to make less mess for us and give the kids a few extra reasons to run around. My kids are ages 4-9 and the 4 year old even wins quite often! The only thing I hate about this game is they now ask to play it ALL the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you have a lot of (your own) kids?","review":"If you play this game at home with your own kids, some cousins, some neighborhood kids...your own kids will win big-time.

I think it is shameful that this Slipform Stone Masonary exists and it should be withdrawn and remade. It is so bad, I recommend that anything produced by Thomas J.

Thats one thing to keep in mind when buying this game. So I absolutely reccomend this game especially for Kids. Kids and Family members will love playing this game. There's only one downside to playing this game, and that being it only allows up to two players. That is rather disappointing but with older games that's just what it is and that is unfortunate.

Those with a numerical background invariably use columns (unless they are doing funky stuff).The description of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is based on eigendecompositions rather than a singular value decomposition. Apart from being a numerical no-no, it is also a nice description of the data.Every 10-20 years a statistician reinvents a minor variant of PCA (often without obvious knowledge of the previous ones). It would be nice if this was made more explicit. The connection with factor analysis is mentioned (and it has a good chapter of its own), but it would be nice to mention at least the Harkunen-Loeve and Hotelling-transform."},{"rating":"2","title":"vocal x10","review":"betty carter--a true innovator for vocal music. the whole album is wonderful, but her version of 'round midnight is absolutely breathtaking. carter takes this beautiful standard and melds it to something of her own--with new lyrics, time signature and a crazy melodic line. must have for that tune alone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks for the tip","review":"I just bought a brand new granite counter top for my kitchen(Blue Peral) and I am so glad I read Mr. Hueston's book first.

I was impressed at how convinincingly he presented the passion with which scientists approach their work, from the excitement/anticipation of discovery to the often monotonous and meloncholy process of experimentation.

There is a civil war that impacts the story, but much of it concerns chimpanzees, who have names just like humans and are studied carefully by the main character, a British woman who has left her husband, a brilliant but troubled mathematician, to start a new life. As Hope Clearwater uncovers riveting new info about the chimps, that they are warlike and cannibalistic, like humans, she reminisces about her relationship with her husband, John and her new relationship with an Egyptian MIG flier who dreamed of being an astronaut. The events of her life combine with the philosophical and intellectual musings of her characters (mathematical theorums and more)to accentuate a story that is full of interesting characters and an authentic African setting from the 1960s."},{"rating":"2","title":"brazzaville beach","review":"I read this many years ago and loved it.

Why and how she got there; what happens to her while she's there is the crux of the plot. Boyd brings in knowledge from math, physics and the animal world to illuminate the human world. My fave of Boyd's (of the 2 I've now read) remains The Blue Afternoon. I really like this author and the respect he has for the intelligence of his readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually Four and a Half Stars","review":"I won't waste space--or your time--giving yet another synopsis of this book. I'll just say that I loved the plot, the characters, the setting, etc. The only reason I don't give it five stars is that the author does a strange thing: He keeps switching back and forth from first-person to an omnicient, third-person narrator. The book goes back and forth a bit between Hope's past and the present. It would make sense if the past were told by an omnicient narrator and the present in first person. . . but that's not the case. Perhaps this only bothered me because I'm an English instructor.But don't let that dissuade you--it's a great read!

There's lots in this book: love, sex, ego, war. Boyd very effectively portrays both the sciences and the scientists of primate research and advanced mathematics, as Hope learns what humans and chimpanzees have in common."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it - intelligent, well-written and funny","review":"This is a must read.

He is charismatic and enthusiastic in the beginning, passionately advocating his plans to various potential backers, all of whom turn him down. He is undeterred, as is director Werner Herzog, who matched his character's insane passion by actually transporting a steamship via block and tackle during the making of this film. The result is long and loosely structured but often hypnotic, another Herzog portrait of the frightening power of the human will to overcome all obstacles, even when its object is completely foolhardy. Nobody embodies that mania better than Kinski."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest stories ever told","review":"Herzog has taken on many grand ventures but none so dramatic as this one. The great German director was drawn to the history and myths of the Americas, using opera as the basis for this grand film. Herzog tells the tale of Fitzcarraldo, a real life character, who had the audacity to pull a steamship over a small mountain to prove he could ford two rivers. Kinski is wonderful as the \\"big dreamer\\" who is obsessed with bringing Carusso to the Peruvian hinterland at the turn of the century. Fitz puts together a crew that has all the trappings of the ill-fated Pequod, but somehow manages to pull this great adventure off."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Folly of Man","review":"This is a beautifully orchestrated tale about the delightful absurdity in all human endeavor. It is also a story of cross-cultural misunderstanding of the highest order. Kinsky was a madman in the film and in real life and therefore perfect for the part. The scene of the steam ship spinning out of control in that waterfall is one of the memorable in the history of the cinema. The cinematography and editing are a masterpiece. Unforgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idiotic beyond description","review":"The ongoing popularity of this loser of a film as an underground cult classic is clear evidence that some people will like anything if it's pointless enough to appear profound. From the ridiculous underlying conceit to the vapid performances by the European characters ... to the awkward, poorly synced voice dubs ... to the interminably sloth-like pace of the scenes ... to the low-budget production values ... to the by-now-well-documented exploitation of the indigenous people (the only true talent represented in this film) ... Fitzcarraldo is a classic example of the type of narcissistic navel-gazing posturing as avant-garde art that is currently in vogue. The sooner this entire genre joins the heap of once-popular duds that wiser generations deem unworthy of veneration, the better.

But it's worth mentioning just by itself. There's a scene in the movie where you can see the Amazonian Indians standing in back of Kinski, looking angrily his way. Kinski was famous, or infamous, perhaps, for his bad temper, and he'd lost it more than once working with the Indians and had harangued them several times. So It's hilarious to know that only the day before they had gone to director Werner Herzog to ask his permission to kill Kinski. Apparently Kinski got the Indians so [angry] that they wanted to do something about it. Well, I guess Herzog didn't give them permission, since Kinksi managed to at least stay alive long enough to finish the movie.

This book to me is stripped free of pessimism towards India for which Naipaul seems to be criticized all over the place.I would recommend this book to anybody who knows fairly well about India.

I have finished chapter 1, Bombay Theater, but so far there are no earth shaking ideas or fundamentally new analysis.

These inaccuracies made me question the accuracy of the entire work. In addition, much of the information is available on the PTO's web site for free."},{"rating":"2","title":"fine product","review":"product arrived in fine condition. it is wonderful to return to witty, intelligent dialogue and finely dressed characters. a wonderful visit to slower paced times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lavoris going down hill.....be careful","review":"We have used Lavoris as the best mouthwash for many years. The last two bottles we bought were terrible. They taste more like Listerine. I checked the label and found it was a new label. The ingredients and the sequence had changed. The writing on the label has also changed. The words claiming to have the least alcohol of any mouthwash have been removed. Also, the address for the distributor in Wisconsin has also been removed. I have written several times to the company to find out about it, and they do not answer my requests for information.If you are expecting the old great mouthwash you are accustomed to getting, make sure you get the old label, or you will be very surprised. I don't know what we will do when the supply of the old formula runs out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cinnamon, BAM!!!","review":"This mouthwash is definately cinnamon and that is a plus in my book but my wife says it is to cinnamony for her taste. I will say that it kicks bad breath for a good long time so if you can handle the minute or so swishing then this is definately the mouthwash for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mouthwash","review":"I really like the cinnamon flavor. Learned to like this many years ago when my dentist gave a cup of it to rinse your mouth out with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing","review":"Love this mouthwash! It tastes good while it is taking care of my teeth, and I use it every day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lavoris Is Ruined - What a Shame","review":"I just bought a bottle of Lavoris and the formula has definitely changed. All the recent reviews are right, it isn't nearly as potent as it was before. The cinnamon flavor was much stronger in the older formulation. It doesn't seem like the same mouthwash anymore. Don't buy this until Lavoris decides to go back to the original formulation. It just isn't as effective as it was before (the formulation I tried two years ago).I used to LOVE this mouthwash. Now it's well below average.The bottle says: \\"Distributed By Greenbrier International, INC Chesapeake, VA 23320\\" .... \\"MADE IN CANADA\\"... SKU: 10667 ... UPC Code: 870929003501 ... and on the backside of the bottle about 3/4 the way up the bottle it says 1209/N263AC in black lettering on the plastic (kind of difficult to see).I hope that info helps. Maybe we can figure out when/if they decide to go back to the original potency."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected!","review":"I was looking for an explosive cinnamon mouthwash, but this was not it. It tastes like it is diluted with water. It actually left a poor taste in my mouth instead of giving me fresh breath. I feel bad throwing it away because it is such a large bottle, so it is sitting on a shelf. It may be OK for some who do not want a strong mouthwash, but it is not for me. Sorry Lavoris! By the way, I love ordering from Amazon and will continue. This was just not the product I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"cost","review":"Lavoris mouthwash is great. have used it for years. but be aware who you order from. i thought by the price that it was a box of 4 bottles for $13.25 but it turned out to be for 1 bottle. my fault for not checking closer but the seller is really cheating you at this price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"I was disappointed by this book. The writing was good, but it went nowhere. Unfortunately, I had not realized it was a \\"literary\\" book. Going nowhere seems to be part of the definition of literary.I can tolerate some ambiguity in an ending, but not this much. I want to know if the main character is crazy or sane OR if any part of the story really happened or she imagined it all. I don't require both, but give me one or the other. Publishers Weekly's review as summarized above ends with, \\"...subtle and chilling portrait of that much scrutinized figure, the postfeminist wife.\\" Give me a break! It wasn't postfeminist, it was POINTLESS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"This book is terrible! No story, no sympathetic characters, no ending. If anything,this should have been a short story."},{"rating":"1","title":"reader thrown under the bus","review":"Like many others, I was confused by this book and disappointed in its ending. The plot did not move. I was glad the book was short so that, at last, I would know what was going on. No such luck. My own conclusion was that kids (Katie and maybe Charlie?) will go to extremes to get their parents attention and bring them back together. On a common sense level, if you suspect that your child is not your child, you don't just adapt to it. You try to find out unless you're a little or a lot messed up yourself. Maybe this was an attempt to get inside the mind of a very disturbed woman. I couldn't wait to get out."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bus Should Have Kept Going","review":"This is one of the least valuable books I've read in my life. My Book Club hated it. It was another non-story about a whiny, middle aged women who could not deal with the life she created and take responsibilty for fixing it.As you read the story, do not expect anything to happen ...nothing ever does. The story goes no where; the characters are minimally developed. Any deeper meaning was lost in the boring thoughts and feelings of lead character.At best, this is a poor attempt at imitating the style of \\"The Metamorphosis\\". If you like this type of challenge to your reality, read the real thing, Kafka.I'm sorry I wasted my money to prosper such a bad novelist. She must have paid the people who said good things about this book.If you must read this and I don't know why anyone would, borrow it from your local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - premise more interesting than actual book!","review":"I didn't really care much for this book. The premise was more interesting - that of a woman who doesn't recognize her own son getting off the school bus - than it actually turned out to be. It was a very short novel - more of a novella than a novel, really. Ht narrator's flights of fancy became dull and rather cliche after the first fifty pages. The stylized writing was solid, but the lack of real characters and an actual moving plot detracted from its strength. The resolution was hardly satisfying - but really, the most frustrating thing was the lack of believable characters. There wasn't enough credibility created for some of the actions that took place. In the end, its only saving grace was that it was so short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't finish it","review":"It's unusual for me not to finish a book, but after reading the first chapter twice, I had to admit I just \\"didn't get it\\". At least after reading some of the other similar reviews, I'm comforted by the fact that it wasn't only me who had this problem. I felt like I came into the book in the middle of the story; possibly that was intentional, but I was more confused than intrigued, and I just didn't feel like putting in the effort required to figure it out. I admit I skimmed through it, looking for clues, and even read the ending, but still decided to give it up. It just wasn't for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird and disappointing!","review":"I bought this book because the premise sounded fascinating. As I began to read, I found the style very difficult -- nothing seemed to flow. I kept reading, though, hoping that some really amazing ending would justify my time. Boy, was I wrong! Maybe I'm shallow and not bright enough to understand, but I never could figure out whether it was supposed to be about a sick child, an evil child, or a just-plain-nuts mother. This is, without a doubt, the worst book I have ever read. A complete waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"No, not every question has an answer","review":"If you like your books with neatly tied ends and simple answers to all your questions, perhaps this one isn't for you. But if you pass it up for that reason, you will have missed an eerie and mind-twisting book that will haunt you for some time after you turn the last page.Other reviewers have outlined the basic plot, so I won't bother with that. Let me just say that this book will hit home for any parent. Like Meg, we send our children out in the world and can be startled by the ways in which they change...the people they turn into. Haven't we all had days of wondering if our child is a changeling? Deborah Schupack takes this feeling and runs with it, crafting a story that gives us a new look at identity and parenting and may leave you wondering how well you know your own child.This is a wonderful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn","review":"This book was such a waste of time. After pages and pages of reading about the mother worrying about her son and nothing else I had to stop reading it. I would not suggest reading it unless you are in the mood for a great bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"shattered union is not what it could be","review":"You know, I really like turn-based strategy (TBS) games. I really get into the tactics of holding territory, using lines of sight, and planning out my offensives in painstaking detail. Maybe that's why I hate this game so much. Shattered Union really does do an amazing job- of taking all the worst parts of the TBS genre (butt-ugly graphics [reminiscent of an early PSone game], rage-inducing menu-driven controls, and unnecessarily complex rule structures) and combining them into a giant pile of half-assed gameplay. What completely destroys any remaining worth that this title might hold for me, though, is the ridiculously large emphasis on scouting. (How am I supposed to annihilate enemy troops and conquer a nation when I can only see what's happening on about 20% of the area of a map?) In conclusion, gaming giant 2K Games has really given their fans something to scream in agony about this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only good for a few times","review":"After about 3 or 4 uses the unit stopped working.

The rotating carriage sometimes gets stuck and then it no longer rotates, leaving one small section to become overly dry and the rest undried. The rotating carriage squeaks as it turns. The bottom tray has a different design than the other trays because it interfaces with the motor axle to turn the whole stack of trays. This means the bottom tray cannot be switched with any of the other trays and thus you will not be able to shuffle it with the other trays to get even drying among the trays. I also own 'The Food Dehydrator' by Mr. Coffee (~$40) that does not rotate and it works better. The Aroma consumes 165 Watts and the Mr. Coffee 275 Watts so the Aroma comes up short on drying power. Perhaps the rotation system was implemented to reduce the amount of power needed to dry, but it may have also been implemented to be annoying. It does not dry very well but it is pretty good at being annoying. I sold this unit on Craigslist and kept the Mr. Coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"I've used this unit maybe 5 times since I purchased it and now I think it's broken. Seems like it just overheated and died. There are no troubleshooting instructions. The dry times listed in the \\"manual\\" are far from accurate. Most took triple the time listed in the book. Squeaks while rotating. Must rotate trays from top to bottom in order to get even dry time since the top does not get enough heat and air."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful art and storyline","review":"This book has beautiful paintings that make you want to dive into the pages and experience the natural world.

I'm on my 3rd machine in less than 2 months, and that is going straight back to the store tomorrow, still in the box, for a refundYes, there are some glowing reviews for this machine, but, and call me a cynic if you will, I can only imagine that they must have been posted by HP public relations staff.

It has been the most frustrating printer I've used in my 25 years of dealing with printers. The paper never had fed correctly so you have to practically sit there and feed it manually. There are 5 dinky color cartridges of which at least 1 is constantly out of ink and it won't even let you print in black and white if one of the cartridges is low.There have been so many times that I wanted to smash this thing with a sledge hammer that it isn't even funny.

Note I have changed paper stock several times and with only HP paper. I have maybe ran 1500 sheets of paper and maybe 80-100 photos. BUT and I mean BUT a good 1/3 of the paper were paper jam. WHEN this printer works, it works well; BUT TO MANY PAPER JAM. I believe for the amount of paper ran through it; it is not old; just by the age. DO NOT BUY!!!!!! AN FOR YOU HP I WANT A NEW PRINTER!!

I cannot begin to convey how much I dislike this printer, which had all the features that I really wanted. It sounds like most of you have been luckier than I have, because right off the bat mine had a paper jam. I never, I mean Never, print even one page without pressing the O.K. button once, twice or even three times. I always have the paper tray full, so until I read all the customer reviews, I thought I must be doing something wrong. It is very slow, loud, and even vibrates at times.

The web site acknowledges that my machine is defective and needs a special kit for fixing it.I called for the fix and it took almost a half hour for them to jump me through their hoops until they acknowledged that I should get their kit, \\"at no charge\\" as of they were doing me a favor!

Even after following advice here.ok..so my 3-in-1 printer is now only a 2-in-1. I long since put this piece of crap in the closet only to now need it's scanning abilities. So I pull out my HP 3210 printer. Go to HP and download the correct drivers..plug it in and hope to start some scanning with my 3-1..*cough*...no 2-1 HP.Guess what? Drivers lock up system. HP application locks up and repeatedly crashes. CNTL-ALT-DEL wont even work while this HP crap is on my computer. 5 trys..5 reboots..I give up. I deleted the HP crap software and Windows XP system is running perfectly again.I hate this HP 3210 printer. I detest it. I hate the HP software.

This is hard to believe since it looks to be a hardware issue. Regardless, my unit pass the return date at Staples so they offered to send a refurb, but then realized there is a 42 day back order on refurbs (a lot of complaints). The manager then called me back and offered to send me a new unit within 5 days and this was acceptable.

When you buy a printer you expect to be able to install it after opening the package, isn't that right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"not up to expectations","review":"Scanning and printing photos is much lower quality than I expected for the price and features of the machine.

I am in the industry and have had about every brand or deal with them all the time. HP simply last longer than others. Other brands can perform great like Canon but they simply don't last.Everyone is trying to have the greatest do everthing software, this is where HP and most printer companies fail. However, this software seems especially \\"buggy\\". Nothing I couldn't overcome, but geez I do this stuff for a living. I can't imagine some nightmares others might of experienced. Like most companies they short change development have it coded overseas and we the customer are the software testers.

It's very quiet and easy to use. I had to download a driver for my windows vista but that took just minutes and it was good to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable Drivers","review":"I won't go into details on my specific experiences, but I'll chime in with those that have complained about the software. It's bloated, containing about 5 different programs that all pretty much get you to the same place. It's unhealthy in that I often find myself having to kill HP processes while I'm shutting down and they take entirely too long to start up. Worst of all it's unreliable. I want to print when I want to print. I don't want to have to reboot or futz around with configurations to get the printer to stop giving me errors.The hardware is solid which is the only reason it gets more than one star when I'm going to throw it away while it still works just to get rid of my software problems. It's a real shame.Oh yea, and the replacement will probably *not* be an HP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, very nice","review":"Setup this printer with a wireless router and installed the software across a mixed (3 Macs/1PC) network and it was immediately up a running.

My old Epson had to be fed photo quality paper individually or it would jam...with the HP I can put 50 pages in at once and print away!While my Epson ink catridges were cheaper, these seem to last much longer. My Epson would also clog after a day or 2 and have to be cleaned frequently. No problems like this yet from the HP.While my Epson printed photos every bit as good as the HP, it was just more costly and much more of a hassle to use"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good all-in-one printer","review":"I have to wonder if maybe a bad batch of these printers was sent out by HP. I have been using it with great results Since December of 2006. I would agree with several other reviewers that the software is garbage, and that the paper tray is small. However, these don't warrant bad quality from the printer.I have printer networked via a Linksys wireless router so that I can print from anywhere in the house. All computers (laptop and desktop) have zero issues printing to this printer. I have send CAD sectional drawings, tile layout drawings, large PDFs, large docs from both 2003 and 2007 Office (various apps), and some light photo work all with no issues.As with any printer your paper choice dictates your quality and success printing. I only use high grade paper, and will continue to do so.I can recommend this printer to those willing to shell out for the quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"very unreliable","review":"1. Printer started scrunching the paper. called HP and they sent me a kit to fix the problem. (overnight service, great!). Anyway, I re-installed the drivers in windows XP, and the problem went away, so I never tried the kit. Their support has no clue.2. Printer won't print and says there is no yellow ink. (All the other inks are still around 100%). I don't believe that the yellow ran out so much faster then the rest. Now, the printer won't print/copy at all. Even in black and white, since it needs the yellow ink. Also, I can't just buy yellow. According to the support, the stuff they sell as replacements is different then what came with the printer, and I can't mix them. So, now I need to spend almost $80.00 on 6 new ink cartrages even though 5 of them are at 100%!!!.

I treat it pretty rough and nothing has broke on it.-Paper Tray doesn't hold too much paper(less then 50)-Prints EXCEPTIONAL color pictures...I have had it for 4 months w/o any problems.

But the results are unacceptably bad:Printing: Printing black text with a colored background results in extremely dark and fuzzy text, almost as if the ink is bleeding. This happens whether I print a PDF or Word document.Exact same PDF, printed from a Windows XP machine, looks perfect. So the hardware is OK, but the Mac HP sofware is giving the printer bad instructions.Scanning: Scanning at resolutions above 300dpi results in a \\"stair step\\" effect, as if the data stream got out of sync. Several calls to HP finally resulted in the suggestion to set the \\"Dust and Scratch Removal\\" scanning setting to \\"Medium\\". This eliminates the \\"stair step\\" effect, but the resulting image looks as if it was smeared and there are weird smudges.Again, scanning from the Windows machine works fine.So, if you have a Mac, I would stay away from this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this printer!","review":"Do you want to print photos?

It constantly wastes paper by printing a document halfway several times until it decides to finally correct itself. Also, I was excited about having the separate ink choices.

Usually opening and slamming the paper tray back in will allow one print, but same problem every single time I try to print a page!?!@?!.Only good thing to come out of purchasing this is the knowledge that a $100 printer works much better then a $300 one.Only positive thing I can say about this printer is that it is fairly rugged.

I logged around eight telephone hours trying to get this thing to work. It will not and no one can fix it. It turns out that this is a known problem.

He was sort of a poor man's Batman, with a not very interesting lead-villain. I watched a few episodes until I couldn't bare anymore. The only sad thing about its quick cancellation was that the show was another waste of the very attractive and spectacular Summer Glau.In conclusion, this is one sci-fi show that will not be very well-remembered.

I wish shows like this were given more time to find an audience, or at least get a second chance on cable. as NBC cut the original order of 13 episodes down to 10 mid-season (and only aired 9 of them) the finale doesn't get a chance to offer much in terms of closure. that said, if you're looking for a solid super hero show, pick this up or check it out on Netflix."},{"rating":"2","title":"trop et pas assez","review":"il y a presque tout mais trop peu sur chacun des instruments décrits. pas de couleurs et on trouve plus souvent l'intéret financier que l'intéret technique."},{"rating":"2","title":"Presents an accurate view of the adolescent","review":"There is an incredible developmental difference between a fourteen year old and an eighteen year old.

The first problem is that even though you can watch the theatrical version of the film, where ever the added scenes were put in, there is a slight pause before going to the next scene! This is inexcusable and it distracts the viewer every time it happens. The extra scenes are worthless so now either version is ruined. This should have been recalled. Great movie worthless DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amusing spoof of basic training","review":"This movie is one of the funniest spoofs of the military aside from \\"Private Benjamin\\" that you can get. My father used to be a drill sargeant so he finds this movie to be a real scream. He always shakes his head at the recruits singing that do-wadd-ditty song on their way out from getting their uniforms. And Warren Oates performance as Sgt. Hulka isn't such a far cry from the real thing...my dad would attest to this. All in all, this movie should be viewed on cable to save yourself from unneccessary nudity and a few foul words...while this movie would not make it on my top 100 list, it does rank up there with amusing comedies of all time.

It's just........THERE. If you're DYING to see a good Bill Murray film, see Groundhog Day or Scrooged. Skip this.

The story is essentially about an iconoclast who enlists in the Army to get structure in his life but finds himself running afoul of the authority figures. Murray is surrounded by an excellent cast(Harold Ramis, John Candy, Judge Reinhold, Warren Oates, P.J. Soles, Sean Young, John Larroquette, and John Voldstad a.k.a Darrell from the old \\"Newhart\\" show in a speaking part no less) but this is essentially Murray's show. What is interesting is that this film does not take a particularly anti-military stance and was instrumental as a recruiting tool for the military much like \\"Top Gun\\" was in 1986. At the time this film was released in 1981 it demonstrated that the sixties were over and the Age of Reagan had now begun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!","review":"While the original DVD extended edition gave you the option of seeing the original classic movie the blu ray does not. The additional footage adds absolutily nothing to the movie and changes it from a wonderful comedy to a movie that becomes bogged down in scenes that should have remained on the cutting room floor. SONY/Columbia Pictures should be ashamed for not releasing the original classic movie first on blu ray or at least having the original as a part of the extended blu ray disk. While I give the original moive five out of five stars this extended edition in my opinion barely holds on to two out of five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The cold war comedy that ended the cold war.","review":"Bill Murray fans have to see this movie!

If you just wanna see John Candy mud wrestle a couple of women.

The Army never sees what's about to hit them.What ensues is a wonderful movie that is a spoof of the military.They tear through basic training, much to the dismay of Sgt Hulka(Warren Oates strives as the tough as nails commander). Then, they get assigned to a super secret new weapon, much to the dismay of Capt. Stillman (played by John Larroquette,who gets to continue his womanizing that he carried onto television shows, like Night Court).The whole gang, which includes the likes of John Candy, and Judge Reinhold romp from the U.S, to Italy, to Czechoslovokia, causing trouble wherever they go.Also watch for the poor happless Russians at the guard tower who seem to get the worst of it numerous times. Just when they assume that they are safe they get it again.A real winner that even some from the Army said was realistic to a point with the basic training."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny movie, HORRIBLE Blu-Ray transfer (one of the worst i've ever seen)","review":"This is a review of the Blu-Ray reissue of \\"Stripes\\".\\"Stripes\\" is a really funny movie (one of the funniest of the 80's), but if you want to see it (or somehow managed to never see it in 30 years), don't bother paying extra for it on blu-ray, as this has an absolutely HORRIBLE transfer - some of the footage (and i'm talking about footage that was in the original movie in the first place) looks so bad, i'd have sworn it must've been sourced from second and third generation prints. On a lot of scenes, there is a ton of grain, and other footage simply looks out of focus. REALLY disappointed in this transfer - this has to be one of the worst Blu-ray transfers i've ever seen. (FWIW,the extra/extended footage doesn't really add anything to the story, and it's easy to see why the jungle sequence was edited out of the original film)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Akjack","review":"One of the best. for those who served in the Army and took their basic training at Fort Knox, They should know that the movie was shot at Fort Knox.

I had the misfortune of watching it recently and there's not a single laugh to be had. Also, if you believe the two ugly douchebags (especially Ramis) get the hot MP girls to love them...yeah right. Its interesting to see the mentality of this time: \\"were gonna be so clever and outsmart the military, and hilarious antics are going to ensue.\\" Watching this movie is about as funny as a jimmy carter speech and is about as depressing when you deconstruct what its saying. There's something slightly grotesque about movies that mock the military. I couldn't help but imagine Bill Murray's character being shipped off to a real war, freezing in a foxhole and having one of his limbs blown off by a landmine. Ive never been in the military, and Im not a hawk, but there is something ugly about the subtext here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does anyone think the military is anything like this?","review":"I don't know how this movie has so many 5-star ratings. I happened to watch this movie from the beginning on TV, and it was so bad that I had to put a review immediately. I am in the Marine Corps, and I feel even for the Army, that military training was portrayed very unrealistically. The Captain and the other \\"soldiers\\" show a sense of unprofessionalism and disrespect to superiors and the country. The graduation day scene is unbelievable. They all seemed to get it all together in one night and add their own twist to the drill. Bill Murray is horrible along with the rest. He clearly keeps his sarcasm even after basic training. How can he talk like that to a General? I don't know, but there is no structure or discipline between the Army soldiers and officers. I know this movie is a comedy, but it makes me wonder if they were trying to make the military look like a joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic, the ultimate Bill Murray flick","review":"Absolutely one of the funniest movies ever made. It would definitely have to be highly ranked, if only for the fact that it is possibly the most quoted movie of all time. Who among us has never said \\"Lighten up, Francis\\" or \\"You can't leave, all the plant are gonna die! \\". Bill Murray is at his best, and Harold Ramis is the perfect straight man for him. Add in a supporting cast that includes John Candy, Judge Rheinhold, John Laroquette and Sean Young, and you have something pretty special. Also, gains points for the fact that it doesn't start to fade out at the end, like many comedies do when the decide to get \\"message-y\\". It just keeps up the energy and humor right up to (and including) the credits. To this day, the only movie I have ever enjoyed so much that I went right back to see it the very next night."},{"rating":"2","title":"great classic movie!","review":"If you like silly funny movies, this one is for you.

He plays John Winger, a lazy deadbeat who out of boredom joins the army and convinces his pal Russell (Harold Ramis, Murray's then real-life pal at the time) to join with him....and the fun begins.The two of them have clashes with Sgt. Hulka (Warren Oates), especially John. They do bond with the other soldiers and get into hilarious hijinks and mischief with them....but when the whole platoon ends up getting into hot water due to one of John and Russell's 'vacation' it's up to them to come to the rescue.The movie is a classic....my personal favorite scene is the mud-wrestling scene between John Candy and the gals.

The top, back heating element is also slightly bent. Nothing extraordinary ever happened to this appliance, and we're not sure what caused the bowing of the top heating elements.

The pink is a purplish pink.The darker blue pen flows faster and thicker than the others and I've smudged it a few times because of that. But other than that, I like these pens. They are colorful and fun. I don't think I would want to pay more than $6 for them, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally found them!","review":"I used to use these gelly rolls in high school and thought they weren't being made anymore.

I have started coloring geometric designs, and using these in the middle of bold colored pencils really adds to the art! They are real eye catchers. I was lucky enough to find these on sale at Joanne's (a while ago!) for .25 each, and I bought multiples. They have lasted me several years. My only regret is that I didn't buy every single one they had left!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Copy Cat","review":"The story is poorly written. Lame characters. Besides a few good fighting scences, the whole movie is boring. The director is a copy cat.Sung-su Kim was copying all the ideas from The Gladiator, The Lord of the Ring, and etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss this move","review":"Musa The warrior is a top of the line action movie and shouldn't be missed by any action fan or history buff or any movie fan. The actors are top of the line as well as the camera men. This movie tops \\"Braveheart\\" and \\"Gladiator\\" for the shear realism and to me the reason it is 2 years late reaching America is that Hollywood didn't want to be put to shame. Once viewed this movie will stick in your mind. I watched the Chinese version and was blown away. The realism is so good that Koreans speak Korean and the chinese speak Chinese. While it has a no rating do be warned that the violence is graphic. And for less then 20 bucks such movie making is a steal."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this movie","review":"This is an movie of epic proportions. I bought this movie off of ebay, and was blown away when I watched it. Featuring Zhang Zi-Yi, this movie is upwards of 2 hours in length, but is involving for the whole length of the film. For novices of the Asian cinematic experience as well as for seasoned veterans, I believe this is a must see. This movie does not feature any wire effects or flying as is typical of the wuxia genre, as seen in crouching tiger, but has realistic fight and battle sequences, with some of the best fight sequences put on film. Although this film may not be groundbreaking, it makes for a very exciting and enthralling movie, very much in the same way Troy is entertaining (minus Brad Pitt, I suppose). A great flick, just be prepared that it is a long movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"The last thing this film is is\\"boring\\", as one reviewer wrote. That person must have been watching some other film!This film has all the magic and epic drama of \\"Seven Samurai\\" and \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" combined. I just could not understand how this film escaped American viewers but this movie is a keeper for sure. 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"Wow, in consideration of the previous reviews, I feel really bad. But here's why this film never made it into mainstream American cinema... I have to say that this was one of the most boring films I've ever seen. Sure, I like an epic story, but this was hardly it. The scenes just dragged on and on and on. And the cinematography was really bad. The colours in general just blended together into blah. Perhaps I was disappointed because I thought I was getting a kung fu action movie. Anyway, I'm sure that the money I spent on this film could be better used elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very long and pointless movie","review":"I'm a huge fan of such movies as crouching tiger, iron monkey, house of daggars, hero, fearless, etc. However, this movie is not on that level. In general it was a waste of my time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"Great cinematography sometimes, but the movie doesn't make sense. The action is not well filmed and there's not much in the way of choreography. The plot is so-so. Not explained how a slave can be such a fantastic warrior. Who, by the way, behaves dishonorably to a couple of messengers under the flag of truce. Also unbelievable (since we don't see great fight choreography) is how they stand against superior numbers; how a Mongol cavalryman can be bested by a civilian who picks up a spear for the first time; how the Mongols break off their attack to honor the death of one of their VIPs. Finally just glad it was over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped","review":"I saw this movie on the big screen in Korea.Not good. Melodrama to the max. The storyline is nothing we haven't seen before. Perhaps it's another exotic Asian movie that appeals to the audience here, but that's all there is. A bit of action, normal stuff, nothing special. Storyline especially is nothing big. Use of multiple languages is a novelty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are White people blind? This movie was awful.","review":"It's obvious to me the positive reviews here come from White people fascinated with Asian culture (anything Asian must be exotic and intriguing). Just look at the review entitled \\"multicultural Braveheart with Kim Chi.\\" I don't see any reviews for Braveheart entitled \\"multicultural First Emperor with Haggis.\\" There was no Kim Chi in this movie. There was also no \\"love\\" here, either. The movie had the potential to have a love triangle, but love was neither talked about nor seen. The closest that came to \\"love\\" in the film was an obsessive-psychotic guy who threw a spear at anyone who dared come within a foot of the princess. The princess was an annoying primadonna who wasn't worth anyone's time. There was no character development, and there were too many fight sequences. If you want to see a good Asian movie with a war epic and a real love triangle, see Hero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bit too melodramatic, don't you think?","review":"As far as a martial arts movie goes, Mushoo doesn't contain that much martial arts. I think if I got all my clumsy buddies and me together, we could pretty much cook up something like this too.By the way, doesn't that bow-wielding sargent look a lot like Fred Ward?And I think Zhang Ziyi will always be typecast as the pouty, spoiled, over-sexed female that everyone will want to #$%! but never marry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh man, this rules.","review":"I'm really surprised a domestic studio didn't scoop this one up for a theatrical release in the US. This movie is simply incredible in its production value, realistically graphic battle scenes, and an extensive cast of engrossing characters.A silent Koryu slave freed by his dying master joins the remaining Koryu warriors in an effort to free a captured princess in hopes of using her influence to regain passage into their homeland. The story quickly shifts to chivarly and honor as the warriors struggle to make their way to te edge of the Gobi desert. A masterpiece of Korean cinema that should not be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"At a time when Hollywood keeps coming up with crummy movies. Its really good that some other places are producing some first class movies.This is a story of a Korean diplomatic mission that goes wrong. The action scenes are really good. The acting is reasonable. The story is good. If you are interesting in a film full of action. This is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good action flick","review":"I liked this movie and the mongol/ancient chinese/korean costume and ambiance.

From the personal and varied fighting styles of the characters to the great cinematography and coreography of the small to large battle scenes are amazing in their thrill of action. I love the characters, richly diverse and intriguing.One of the great things is- I still don't feel like I've seen it all. I've watched it a few times and I still get details, more levels of the story, more development, and more wonders each time I view this film.In the heart and passions of Hero or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, this epic brings forth a more gritting, harsh, and earthy feel of people against all odds and the wonder that is human compassion and determination. I love this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it...","review":"I don't usually write reviews, but I saw so many positive reviews that I had to write this...This movie is painful to watch. The characters are one dimensional and as some of them die you are actually relieved that you do not have to suffer through the actors' performances any longer. The music is awful! Imagine a really bad action movie from the 1970's...yeah, that really bad one that was recycled from the depths of B action movie hell circa 1976 and played on TV late at night in the early 1980's...that is what this movie sounds like.The only good part of this movie is the costume design.I don't want to waste any more time writing about this crap movie other than to warn everyone...don't waste your money!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Come and See Wonderful Red Wagon Folk Art Quilts","review":"I love the Red Wagon Books, especially 'Red Wagon Originals'.

At the end of the album, this makes your ears tired."},{"rating":"1","title":"House of Fallen fell short!","review":"I was very disappointed in this movie. The acting was second rate and it looked like some senior project made movie. Very low budget and it was obvious. It took all of my strength to watch entire movie.

I bought it for my children, but was VERY disappointed to see the both the text AND the pictures had been changed! How can they get by with saying they are \\"featuring the finely crafted oil paintings by George Hinke along with the original prose story\\", when both have been altered. I still have a copy of the original so I can compare. They also reduced the picture size and put in big fancy lettering.

I would sit for hours staring at the artwork oblivious to the actual story. After my grandmother passed away we lost the book. I found this newer copy a few years ago and at first was very excited until I got a good look at it. The artwork is the same except the original version had full page illustrations without all the extra colored text and the black lines outlining ragged edges of the artwork. I feel this ruins the book for those of us who remember the original copy. Can't someone simply reprint the original version without all the updated goo-gunk??? I'd buy a few copies of the orginal re-print in a heartbeat!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gold castle in the sky?","review":"Unlike the rest of the reviewers, I did not have this book as a child. As a child, I was told that Santa lived in the North Pole, not on a floating golden castle in the sky! Why does he collect trees and make \\"Christmas balls\\" on Christmas Eve? Did he deliver decorated trees with the presents then? And apparently Santa had to provide his own cookies. And who the heck is Whiskers?

The book became part of Christmas for our family, and to me what the real Santa Clause and the North Pole were truly like. Since the book was given to me; upon starting my own family, my mother packed the book along with several of my Christmas ornaments to start my own traditions. Now that I have the only copy, I wanted to get copies for both my brother and parents so they would not miss out on Christmas. I was so dissapointed with the 2nd eddition that i did not buy it for them. I will just have to share my copy with them. Shame on who ever did this to such a wonderful book, they have my pity. \\"Jolly Old Santa Clause\\" has been lost and should not be published in this format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a worthwhile collector's piece","review":"I grew up begging my mom to read this to me several times over the Christmas season, and she obliged. As a teen, I latched on to the original copy and still have it. When I saw this hardcover book I bought because I thought the hardcover would keep better.I was disappointed. The story was great, but it was the ARTWORK that made this book a place of magic for me. Unfortunately the publishers--I guess in a bid to save money on publishing costs--did NOT keep to the original format. Even if they had placed a page of text next to a page of artwork, it would have been better. Instead here the text is place ON the picture, taking away from the enjoyment of the artwork. And the pictures have been reduced in size. The original had much larger reproductions of the gorgeous paintings.I'm highly disappointed in this so-called Collector's Edition. I still have the original soft cover and I treat it with kid gloves. That's my collector's edition. Definitely not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"deceptive marketing","review":"This book is marketed as a \\"Collector's Edition\\" of the original 1961 George Hinke classic, one of the most charmingly illustrated books ever published for children. It was read to me as a child. I was thrilled to discover it on Amazon, but deeply disappointed when the two hard back copies I ordered arrived. The text has been altered significantly (we don't forget what we read as children, and I have an older copy with a closer-to-original text). And some of George Hinke's illustrations have been eliminated, or are reduced in size, not to mention being washed out which has taken the richness and magic out of the paintings. This patched-together edition is NOT the original book. Corners were cut with the size of the illustrations to save money, the hallmark of so many current products. How stupid do they think we are? I wish I'd read the customer reviews of this book before purchase. The people like me, who knew this book as children, all have the same complaints."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"very disappointed when this book arrived.

Odyssey 5 tackled some fascinating topics: Artifical life, Non-human sentience, Time-travel of one's consciousness, Can the future be changed?, What it's like to work in space with one's son?, and last but not least - world-wide goverment conspiricies.This was also a cutting edge sci-fi drama that captured the creepiness, and sense of impending dread, of a typical X-Files episode. The casting was pretty much spot-on, especially in the casting of Peter Weller as the weary but seasoned Astronaut and crew commander.It felt like the plug got pulled on this show, just as it was about to reveal some details as to how the government was implicated in the events that led up to the end of the world.

Granted, I will probably never have the washboard abs of these women, but I do come away feeling a little sexier."},{"rating":"2","title":"HipHip Hooray","review":"I bought the four disc set, and decided to review them separately.This was the first one I chose to try out. So, I pried myself out of bed first thing in the morning and put this in. At first, it seemed just a little too easy, but by the end, I was just about done for. For someone who has at least a little experience with bellydance, the moves are simple to understand. Having not been able to really dance in several years, this reminded me just why I fell in love with it from the beginning. I worked all those muscles again, and it left me feeling sore the next day, but fantastic for the rest of that day.I would not recommend this to anyone who doesn't know anything about bellydance, however. The moves, while not complicated, are mostly ill-suited to absolute beginners. I know I could not have made it through this workout if I tried this back when I started! I would have gotten frustrated and given up.Otherwise, this is an incredibly fun workout from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really fun and easy!","review":"I got interested in bellydancing a month or so ago, but there aren't any classes in my area right now. I was so sad. ;_; But my mom bought me this video to cheer me up. It's really, really fun! The only real complaint I have is that sometimes the camera will point at the dancers' feet when I really need to see what their hips are doing, and I get all confused and end up tripping. ^_^ But all in all, it's a great workout. I'm really out of shape and like 50 pounds overweight, but I was still able too do all the moves, after a few rewinds. This tape made it fun and easy! So if you're looking for a workout that isn't boring or too difficult, you should check this video out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Fun!","review":"I LOVE these workout videos. I have the entire Rania collection and I cannot complain about any one of them. You will use muscles you didn't know you had.I hate the \\"dime a dozen\\" Pilates, Yoga, and run of the mill aerobic videos. They are so BORING! Not these videos...give me dance workout any day!I just had a baby and I am looking forward to getting back to the bellydance workout. I am sure it will tone up my ab muscles quickly. I highly recommend these DVDs to anyone with \\"powerhouse\\" problem areas. Your belly will thank you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"First of all, where is the hip-hop? The music used in this video is definitely new agey and not hip-hop at all! I also disliked the voice over during the workout and much prefer when the instructor is actually talking to me rather than staring at me with a strange smile. The moves are not explained well and even though she's a great belly dancer herself, teaching doesn't seem to be her forte in this video. Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the hip hop?","review":"I must agree with others. I was very disappointed with this video. Not only is the technique only adequate but the music is less then exciting- and certainly in no way \\"Hip Hop\\" or anything close to it. The instructor provides instruction as a voice over and often goes off beat which is very distracting as well as the frozen look on her face. Many of the background dancers have personality and the filming is good, but overall I would not expect much from this video- the name is the most exciting part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exotic fun..!!","review":"The title says: BELLYDANCE Fitness for Weight Loss; which was exactly what it delivered. I don't understand how people can rate this as a dance video and expect some super-crafty moves from it. This is a dance workout. A DANCE WORKOUT. Not a dance recital, not a performance for other dancers, not a guide on how to master bellydancing..! W-O-R-K-O-U-T.Okay, that being said, as a WORKOUT video, I find it awesome and great fun. Rania's gorgeous and her smiling face kept me perked up from the beginning and the choice of dancers in a variety of sizes should be applauded. There's a slim one, a curvy one, a little plump one and even a super pale one who looked like she could use a tan badly. Not that it matters of course as this is a bellydance video and not some kinda beauty pageant :DIn short, great video; the routines are simple to follow and are sexy enough to make you an exotic goddess for your boyfriend :DEnjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not my favorite, but a decent workout.","review":"i can see why people do and don't like this one. first, this is not really bellydancing. if you go in expecting to learn how to bellydance from this tape then you will be disappointed. now, if you want an exercise tape that is different than most and gives your hips a run for their money, you will find that here. the music isn't great, its some hip-hoppish sample of the x-files theme... played over and over and over again. there is a lot of repetition but you will feel it the next day. i gave it four stars instead of three because it is a really good exercise tape, but they should not market this as bellydance. it isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was okay","review":"The video was okay but it just wasn't what I was expecting. When I read the description on the back of the box I was expecting somewhat of a workout. At no point did my pulse rise during the workout. I felt that the video was slow and way too repetetive and I got bored. I realize that she is a dancer and not an instructor, but I do feel that the words should go along with the moves.I'm not saying that the video was terrible....but it just wasn't what I needed. It wasn't aerobic at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting at first, but becomes boring very fast","review":"I bought this tape because I not only wanted to add something interesting to my workout routine, but to also hopefully learn a little bellydancing. I was very dissapointed. Althought you'll feel the result of the workout the next day, the moves were very repetitive, stiff and boring. You will basically be doing what seems like a low-intensity dance routine, but broken into segments. After doing a segment three or four times, then you move on to a new segment. Once you've learned the new segment, you will then start over from the beginning, but this time incorporating the new segment that you just learned. The entire workout is set up this way. If you are looking for a challenge that will have you sweating, this tape is not for you. I used this tape for maybe two weeks before tossing it into my closet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dancin in LA","review":"I bought this video hoping to learn something new to spice up my routines. It was not Hip Hop and not Belly Dancing. I thought Rania's entrance and intro were very phoney as well as when she tried to force a smile. The routine and music were dull and boring. Her moves were stiff and not did not have the fluidity of an experienced dancer. I think the beginners may enjoy it because they don't know better- yet. However, I feel that Rania has a lot of learning to do to transform from an aerobics instructor to a seasoned belly dancer. She is trying to hard to fast. With all these videos of hers flooding the market so quickly, I can't help but think that someone is more interested in cashing in on the craze than in helping students learn this beautiful, sensual dance. The best way to learn is to find a really good class where you can get first hand experience. Learn the basics really well and then you can supplement with the videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy it","review":"waste of money it shows the same moves over and over.

Perhaps part of my disappointment in the book is that I assumed it would provide a history of the Caribbean. There are few useful dates or events covered in great detail, and important figures in Caribbean history are mentioned almost in passing as the author describes his interactions with local architects and local gov't figures. I feel there are better books for those looking for a solid Caribbean history, and how that history shaped local language, culture, and government.

That was a Krups ToastSupreme Compact.To look at the other reviews, I'd guess that Oster is having significant quality control problems here. My toaster has a darkness knob that doesn't appear to do anything, and toasts so light at the highest setting that I have to toast everything but Pop Tarts twice. The lifter needs too much force for the weight of the toaster -- you'll lift the toaster itself instead. A good portion of the time the element doesn't turn on when I push the lever down; it requires a good sharp motion to work. And once, when I accidentally pushed down too hard on the toast trying to flip it out -- the slots are a little too deep for my favorite bread -- one of the things the bread rests on got knocked out of its track. It was easily fixable, but it shouldn't have happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost caught fire","review":"Buyer Beware----Warning to all: if you purchase this product and the lever is sticky immediately return the item. Ours was a little sticky--we thought it would sort itself out after a little use--it did not turn out that way. The lever sticks and the toast will just stay in the cooking section and not pop up--thereby creating the possiblity that your toast can catch on fire--which ours did! Glad I caught it before the house caught on fire. We only used the product twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect toaster for odd shaped breads","review":"After years of jamming oversized bread into a regular sized toaster, I broke down and bought this unit and couldn't be happier. Simple controls with a \\"cancel\\" button that works great. The larger slots allow odd sized breads to be toasted flatly and evenly. Regular size breads also toast evenly and are not a problem getting out of the slot, don't know what other reviewers are having problems with. Have yet to use a fork to get a slice of bread out of the slot. If you like odd sized breads toasted, this is one of the only options and it works just fine.Eight months later, the dang thing stopped working, the slide that holds the bread down stopped working, have to hold the slide (or whatever it is called) down manually. Bummer..."},{"rating":"2","title":"good toaster but with limits","review":"I bought this toaster because it can take thick slices of bread. In that manner, it does very well. I also trust the Oster brand for the most part. The toaster works well but the metal skin does get very warm. My last toaster could not do thick breads but the plastic body never got hot to the touch.All in all, I do recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for a while","review":"This toaster worked OK for about 4 months but now it will not toast at all.

This was the second brand of toaster I had to return - also returned a Black & Decker - both would only toast one side! Seems like they'd have it right by now. I finally bought one of the refurbished Cuisinarts (an $80 toaster for $30), thinking I could put a spotlight on it and use it as a display piece if it didn't work, but the Cuisinart is a great toaster! I guess you get what you pay for (unless you buy refurb ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this one!","review":"Of all things weird - I felt strongly enough about this toaster to write my first review. I checked on a lot of toasters and this seemed to have everything I needed - or at least I thought so. I ultimately chose it because it had the longer slots that would work better for the organic and oval-shaped breads that I toast. Longer slots - yes, but the bread falls down into slots and there is no pop-up button, so I've burnt my fingers a number of times. I thought my old cheap toaster was bad, but this thing is really irritating. I'm not terribly picky about toast, but the bread is never toasted evenly. Some spots will be quite dark and others will be untoasted. Yesterday two slices were dark and two done right after that were barely brown. One last thing - the toast cycle takes forever. My pot of tea or coffee is ready before the toast is done. I guess the only advantage is that it looks nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junque","review":"Out of the box, toast would not eject; even on the minimum setting, bread begins to burn.

It takes 2-3 minutes for a piece of bread to toast. It does seem to toast evenly, though.It features a removable crumb tray, but the \\"shell\\" of the toaster is one piece, so there is still a solid bottom beneath the crumb tray. If crumbs fall off the crumb tray they are trapped at the bottom of the toaster. I have a couple of large crumbs stuck in the bottom of the toaster that I cannot get out.

I am a follower of the avalonian mysteries and as such do not question her previous incarnations. I do however question her disregard for history. It seems rather incredible that she alone has portrayed Gwynnefar as she has. (I am still to find documentation that would authenticate her claim that Ambrosius and not Uther Pendragon sired Arthur, among other erroneous claims.) For me, from the first pages of this work, the author lost all credibility due to her lack of research. Perhaps had she depicted this work as fiction rather than the retelling of a previous incarnation, it may well have been an enjoyable read. In the event, I found myself at times angered, at other times amused, but mostly I felt that she insulted the intelligence of her readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sadly disappointing book","review":"Perhaps I should start by saying that I did not finish reading this book as I could no longer stand reading what was supposedly non-fiction, but cannot be anything else but fiction.

The first chapter was fairly basic, but is probably a good introduction for someone not familiar with this flavor of LVM.The rest of the book dealt with tasks one would typically need to perform on LVM and HP-UX filesystems. Fortunately, no time is wasted with lengthy man page reprints. Each chapter is broken down in to sections, each of which addresses a particular task. A lot of attention is paid to using the command line to optimze the placement of logical volumes, and to specifying the best options depending on what the logical volume is being used for. It provides just enough detail of the inner workings of LVM for someone who needs to build well-planned storage systems.I would liked to have seen perhaps another chapter dedicated to more philisophical issues, like opinions from HP's LVM experts on best practices, etc.Still, the best source of LVM information out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best reference on LVM I've seen","review":"This is an excellent description of LVM, with technical details.He covers a lot in a short amount of time, and presents the reader with details on problems that you may encounter.

They said the square \\"Recco\\" tab on the back of the boots was to find you if you were caught in an avalanche and it had nothing to do with attaching the battery packs (wrong).

The arrangements, the choral work and his duet with Elaine Paige (a major English musical theater star) are simply thrilling.With just the first listening even though it is now October, this has become one of my very favorite Christmas albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like Michael but this album is mediocre.","review":"Michael Ball has a great voice and his version of \\"O holy night\\" is worth the price of the whole CD - however this is not a great Christmas album.I do not consider Bette Midler's \\"From a distance\\" or ABBA's \\"Happy New Year\\" - Christmas songs.I love some of his other albums but I would suggest you buy LINDA EDER'S Christmas album. Its the best"},{"rating":"1","title":"How depressing","review":"This has to be the most depressing Christmas Album I've ever heard. I love Michael Ball's voice, but there was not one upbeat song on the album. This one is either going to get donated to the library (others may appreciate it more than I) or collect dust at my house."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Christmas for All Year Long","review":"I quickly tire of the Christmas music played everywhere during the holiday season, but this CD is different. I bought it last night and have listened to it all the way through four times! And not just because I'm a serious Michael Ball fan. It has a tremendous range of music from \\"Ave Maria\\" and \\"O Holy Night\\" to the lighter \\"Driving Home for Christmas\\" and \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.\\" Joni Mitchell's \\"River,\\" \\"From a Distance,\\" and \\"A Winter's Tale\\" are unusual and fresh Christmas choices. Tears came to my eyes over \\"When a Child is Born.\\" I haven't been able to pick a favorite track because they are all so good. It's gorgeous! You'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, except for...","review":"I agree with everything other reviewers have said, but I must say that I am quite disappointed with the first line of Ave Maria, where Michael fails to roll his \\"r\\" and swallows his \\"a\\". Oddly, he remembers to use the \\"proper\\" accent for the rest of the song, thus saving it. Otherwise, the rest of this CD is beautiful -- Michael at his usual best, and orchestrations which stir the heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Christmas Music","review":"I bought this cd some months ago in preperation for the Christmas Season, and I'm glad I did. It has instantly become one of my favorite Christmas albums. ( And notice I didn't say the word \\"holiday.\\" How I've grown to hate that word!) Michael Ball's beautiful voice and the excellent arrangements make each song a joy to listen to. Along with a few beautiful more traditional Christmas carols, there are some more modern selections. I particularly liked \\"Driving Home for Christmas \\" and \\"Happy New Year\\" (the Abba song). Really nice. All in all most highly recommended.

It works great. I put a few drops in a polish that's gotten thick and clumpy, and this restores it to a usable state. However -- the next time I go to use the polish, it's generally thick again. Not a big deal. After a year, I've barely made a dent in the bottle of thinner, and my clumpy polishes are generally the ones I never use anyway. My biggest lament is really that this doesn't come with one of those sucking syringe things, so that has to be bought separately. Otherwise, good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"This sucks","review":"This so called nail polish thinner actually doesn't work.

With the good reviews on this thinner I thought this was the cheaper option to my costly problem. WRONG! This thinner sticks. Both literally and figuratively. It has a very strong scent to it, but as it's a chemical product that was expected. What I didn't expect was for this thinner not to work -- at all! I tried fewer drops; I tried more drops. Nothing. My thickened polish gets this watery wet look to it as the thinner settles over it, but it stays thick and gooey. The thinner just doesn't seem to penetrate the thick polish no matter how much rolling or shaking I do. I tried this in one of my polishes that was just starting to thicken and managed to get some of it on my nail, but it just caused horrible bubbling. It's a complete and total waste of time, polish, and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"nail thinner","review":"I bought this thinner and left it in my nailart bottle. it came to the top and when I went to do a nail design it was horrible.

I pour a tiny amount into the polish bottle and shake. The gummy polish immediately thins up in a few seconds, and then it applies on my nails smooth as fresh new polish. The polish also dries better when it's thin and smooth. I have been using this brand for years because it's economical and works as well as others. The 4 oz. bottle sold here is very much larger than the ones I have bought from the drug store. I did comparison pricing and this was a good deal per oz., even with shipping added in, so I bought it here. I also save money not throwing gummy polish away. The thinner lasts me a long time, since I only use a tiny amount each time. Now my daughter uses it too, after she noticed me using it and how well it works. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, children's music that doesn't drive adults crazy","review":"We bought this album for our baby after hearing about it on NPR.

In the image, the watch face appears black. It is not. It is gray. And I also like thin watches...low profile I guess. This one is a little thicker than I desired. I'm not one to return things, so I'll keep it. I like watches. Simple watches. Watches without numbers that are thin.

If you have very large, fat, or arthritic fingers this might not be a good watch for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low battery life","review":"It sure is a nice looking watch, but the battery lasted less than a year. I bought it at Target last winter and it just died in August. After countless tries, I was finally able to pry the back off. I have never seen a cover so stubborn, I have always changed my own batteries in the past and never had a real problem. After I finally found the battery, getting the cover back in place was a real problem. I resorted to squeezing and mild pounding with a hammer to no avail. Finally, I used a C-clamp to force the cover back on. I did use two pieces of wood in between the watch and the C-clamp so there was no direct pressure on the watch, but the watch is now essentially broken, the hands move in all crazy directions. So, if you do buy this watch and the battery goes, have a pro change the battery for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's alright (2.5 Stars)","review":"However, it's no Breathe.

Cain was raised on a hippie commune in Iowa but as a college student in California feels estranged from her background. This spurs a decision to move back to Iowa to rediscover the little girl she was. It's a simple enough premise but it is very well written. Her mother's bout with melanoma is the impetus for the journey. Then there is the search for a former friend thought to be dead which adds texture to the tale. The road trip is a great American motif and Cain handles it in her own unique circumstances. This is a tale about self-rediscovery as Cain attempts to bridge a hippie past with the current gen X values. It is cliché at times but very personal and honest. There is a lot of universal soil in this book. It can be appreciated by anyone who enjoys an honest account of dealing with illness and loss of innocence."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Quality","review":"This wrench actually measures 21cm length, 31.5mm jaw opening, 295g weight,made in Spain.1&#12289;SAE and metric markings;2&#12289;Thick handle,grip firmly;3&#12289;Knurled worm gear spins smoothly.The jaw wobble is about 0.50mm,if the jaw wobble is less ,I'll like it better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank You Guys!","review":"I just bought this blender last night and decided to look up reviews before using it.

I have not had any of the previously mentioned problems with the hand blender. The suction is quite strong, as previous reviewers had mentioned. I find that it works best by using short bursts, and repositioning between bursts.It is not a heavy duty appliance, so for regular/daily use or high performance use, perhaps consider purchasing a higher end hand blender. Consider this comparison, if you purchased a $60-80 hand mixer, you might not get the same durability or longevity as you would with a $200-300 kitchen aid stand mixer.

The seperate high and low buttons push into the housing to activate, and the surrounding housing has sharp edges, so it was uncomfortable. My second impression came when I tried to use the blender on a bean soup. I felt it was ineffective, that is until I realized that the blending blade had fallen off. After sifting through the soup, I found the blade, and tried to thread it back onto the shaft, but that didn't work -- the threads wouldn't hold.I did like the idea that the blender portion was seperate from the motor unit, and could be removed for cleaning."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give it no stars METAL SHAVINGS ALERT","review":"Purchased a couple years ago and used twice (gently!) on pumpkin butter.

I unlocked the shaft and at the gear point, there were metal shavings.Disgusted that I had to throw away food AND a barely used appliance.

I actually think it's not badly MANUFACTURED, but a very, very poor design."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's JUNK","review":"It may work for smoothies and shakes, but it does not work well to puree food. The inlets on the bottom are too small for chunks of food to pass through. Consequently when you set it on the bottom of a pan of hot food, it sits there and cavitates. You must tip it to the side a bit to let the chunks enter the cutting chamber. Tipping it this way, puts a side stress on the plastic piece that holds the drive shaft tunnel to the handle. This in turn cracks. Mine broke after the second use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud As A Freight Train!","review":"I picked this up at Target as I needed one quickly and this was all that was available. There are a couple of positives including that it is very powerful and I like the feature that the mixer detaches for cleaning.

I have to go to another room and close the door in the morning or I will wake the whole family when using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not international","review":"I'm a Dutch costumer and had to return the device because it was a 120V only version.

As others reported, the plastic housing that connects the metal shaft of the blade to the motor unit broke after 3 or 4 uses. A vertical crack that means you can't connect the parts. I managed to make the soup for my friend's 50th birthday by holding the two parts together while blending. What a mess. I hate to throw stuff in the landfill, but that's where this one is going."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get what you pay for...","review":"I bought this a few months ago to make homemade baby food for my infant son. While it did do the job intended (granted, it was only used on well-cooked veggies, so it didn't meet much resistance), I had a couple of problems with it.First, you had to constantly hold the button down to keep the blender on (there is no locked on position). After pureeing veggies for about a minute, my hand would begin to cramp.Second, after washing the removable blade attachment, the attachment began to rust on the inside, and would \\"leak\\" rust into whatever I was blending.You definitely get what you pay for with this item. There were several other more expensive hand blenders available, but I chose this cheaper model because I'd never used one before and wasn't sure it was going to do what I needed it to do. Now that I know a hand blender is so useful, I'm going to invest in a much higher quality brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy!!","review":"I bought this blender because the only other option was the KitchenAid immersion blender that cost $49. To me, that seemed like a lot to pay for such a small piece of equipment. I didn't even pay that much for my hand mixer. However, I quickly learned that in the world of immersion blenders, you get what you pay for. This Oster blender was used maybe 8 times. It didn't work well out of the box, but after only 8 times using it it no longer worked at all. I just went out and spent the $49 to buy the KitchenAid immersion blender, after having wasted $20 on the Oster blender. Don't make the same mistake I did. I've now spent a total of $69 on immersion blenders when I could have only spent $49 to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful and not worth it.","review":"This blender costs ~$20 for $29.99 you can get the Cuisinart.Cuisinart CSB-76 SmartStick 200-Watt Immersion Hand Blender, WhiteThis blender doesn't handle anything tougher than ice cream and it's almost as expensive as the vastly superior Cuisinart.

On my first one, the plastic cracked shortly after the first use. I assumed I had merely over-tightened it. On the second one, the connection was never good and the shaft would occasionally fall out while I was blending (I only use this to cream soups.) and the blender did not blend well."},{"rating":"1","title":"a whiny blender","review":"The motor is more noisy than the Braun and GE immersion blenders, and it gives a sad little whine as it starts up and winds down, so I think there is a problem with the interface between the motor portion and detatchable blender portion.

After reading the previous review, I suspect the gulk must be the cheap plastic wearing off!! Beware! This product can be a health hazard. Don't buy.

I was trying to make a milkshake using liquid and formed (but not solid) ice cream, and the blades came off the shaft. I tried to screw it back on as I could see that there were threads, but it would just fall off again. Two uses and it's done, not worth buying.Aside from the fact that it broke, I do not like the power buttons. You have to press them down so far past the plastic housing, that it was uncomfortable and difficult to press. I could only hold it down a couple of seconds at a time before it would stop. I think my finger would rise up very slightly, just enough to shut it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy way to puree your $20","review":"I bought my Oster hand blender at a retail store in 2007. It quickly developed a hairline crack in the blender attachment housing, probably the same crack many others seem to complain about. Mine still minimally \\"worked\\" after the attachment broke, but has been a real pain to use due to the attachment coming apart. Furthermore, the blending/measuring cup that comes with it doesn't seem dishwasher safe. Mine eventually developed cracks and had to be thrown away. I can't find replacement accessories (attachments or cups) for sale anywhere, not even Oster's web site. It's not worth the trouble to call Oster for replacements, since they will probably break the same way. I'll just buy one of the higher recommended blenders of another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk!! Broke Twice!","review":"I purchased this blender, used it once, and it broke around the housing that holds the metal rod. I returned it, thinking it was a fluke, and the second one did the same thing after the 2nd use! It's not like I was mixing concrete, I was just mixing a cream soup. Do not buy this machine. I have contacted Oster and demanded that they send me a new one, because I'm not driving all over town to replace this every single month. I am very disappointed. I will not buy another Oster. I would give it negative stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke during second use","review":"This product is not worth a dime. It makes a lot of noise and cannot handle any serious blending. The second time I used it I was trying to make a smoothie in the cup provided with the blender.

I returned it (luckily) for a full refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"as if they need another one star review","review":"I'm being redundant here, but have to add my two cents. I bought this for travel and vacation and used it probably about 12 times before it broke.

But the metal spike that fits into the motor started to wobble and will no longer fit into the housing. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"REAL taco seasoning!","review":"This taco seasoning is wonderful on so many levels.

The depths and freshness of the seasonings really show and livened up our ground chicken perfectly. There is a very mild spice to this mix, but no real \\"heat\\".

Mike's company has plans to build a high-rise on a beach in Australia. Bobby goes down to Australia to make sure things go smoothly.If you have watched movies before then you probably could guess what happens. The locals don't want some developer coming in and ruining their beach community. Bobby falls for one of the local women. He slowly comes around and helps them to fight the development.How many movies can be made like this? It seems like an infinite number.

The book fell far short of that. It left me disappointed and longing for what I had missed. It was difficult to connect with or enter into the story primarily because the author failed to portray a personal intimacy with the subject. As an example, she tells us that moving within Paris was a bigger event than imagined but the description lacked emotional depth.

The Chegal-esque illustrations are vivid, and layout is well-paced and support the unfolding of the story. I like that there is a section of discussion questions at the back to support conversations about the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indistinguishable hero, but still a good story","review":"Much as I love Douglas Reeman's war-at-sea stories, it's probably not a good idea to read too many of them in too close a sequence. Many of Reeman's titles feature variations on two or three stock characters, and after a while, it's hard to tell Keith Drummond of this novel apart from John Devane of 'Torpedo Run' or any number of Our Heroes from other titles.The real centerpieces of Reeman's stories, though, are ships and battles, and when it comes to this, the various titles stand out much more clearly. In 'The Destroyers,' Commander Drummond has to lead a group of tired old tin cans (did the British call them that too?) on a special operations mission in the North Atlantic. The story is a lively one, and demonstrates yet again that what truly distinguishes Reeman is his ability to weave an engrossing tale of naval combat. This one is worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most action-packed, adventureous book ever read.","review":"This book was fantastic.

We all kept looking at each other as if to say, \\"Are we really hearing an opening act this good?\\" (All the women fell a little bit in love with him ...). People were shouting \\"You're awesome!\\" and the like. The songs are a bit corny, but the lyrics are sweet and smart. His voice is beautiful. His guitar playing an accordion playing are excellent. It's a shame it doesn't really show through as much on the album, but it's certainly worth the $12. If only you could have a signed copy like I do ... :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Album","review":"Love the creative music on this album. I like all different genres of music as long as it's creative. This one fits the bill. Love every song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sprite","review":"My daughter recommend this CD to me. The acoustic-based arrangements offer some soft-rock gems. The opening track \\"Sleeping with the Lights On\\" has a lovely melody with Teitur's voice gentle and reassuring, \\"Our love was strange in a strange land; We got broken wings; We were bound to fall.\\" \\"You're the Ocean\\" is another lovely tune with strings bolstering Teitur's guitar sounding like it's played by a sprite, \\"I'm energy & you're the rhythm; Love is somewhere in between what you believe and what you dream.\\" \\"One & Only\\" slows from the midtempo tracks to a slower pace with the chorus in a child-like melody with Teitur's voice hitting the high note, \\"only love.\\" This CD has been out for six years now. I'm so glad I've tuned in! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"His words, his voice","review":"This cd makes you fall in love with the idea of Teitur.

I highly recommend this beautiful, musical poetry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"I picked up this CD after a friend shared an mp3 of \\"I Was Just Thinking\\" - one of my favorite tracks on the album. trust me, though, there is not one song that is lacking here. from the lyrics to the melodies to his incredible, crystal clear voice, i have not been able to stop playing his album since november. do yourself a favor. pick it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I love this album. Rarely (of late anyway), do I hear an album and immediately love it. This is just a beautiful album. Very deep, introspective lyrics. I'm sure in the future there will be comparisons to John Mayer (merely because it is a thoughtful album) Frankly, I don't get what all the hoopla is about John Mayer. He's okay, but he has nothing on Teitur, he (Teitur) is on a completely different level. Teitur has nothing to fear Mayer will be long gone and Teitur will still be around. I hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"unexciting","review":"I would call this album pansy pop. Teitur does have an interesting steel-guitar quality to his voice, but his sound is akin to David Grey or David Grey crossed with John Meyer. I guess his fans don't want you making that comparison, but it's impossible to avoid when listening to \\"You're the Ocean.\\" Title track is definitely not worth writing home about. The album tracks are \\"different\\" but they're not -- it's not a risky album. I just couldn't get excited about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"are we talkin' about the same album?","review":"I recently got a free copy of this. I can't stand this album.

My opinion is that this is a waste of time. I wouldn't recommend this album to my worst enemy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peotry & Aeroplanes","review":"This is a must have for anyone who appreciates the relationship between a man and his guitar. Folksy and touching. His live performance with John Mayer had to increase the sale of this album. If you get the chance pay to see him perform. Their are definite tones of Paul Simon within his writing and singing on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"FABULOUS CD!!!!","review":"I arrived at John Mayer's Mandalay Bay show a little disappointed, seeing that his opening act Maroon 5 was not appearing, and was being replaced by a man named Teitur. My disappointment soon subsided after hearing Teitur's amazingly beautiful songs. His lyrics are real, his voice is amazing, his melodies are catchy, without being cliche. Everyone was amazed by Teitur's quality, and the crowds loved him! I rushed out of the concert, bought his cd and luckily, scored an autograph as well. My advice to you: Buy the cd. You certainly won't be disappointed!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sublime Beauty","review":"I've heard Teitur compared to artists like John Mayer, but I have to say that, with all due respect, Mr. Mayer has NOTHING on Teitur.That means no disrespect to John Mayer, who has some real talent hiding beneath his poppish sheen. Check out some of his earlier, acoustic work before 'Room For Squares' - it's really darn good.But anyway, Teitur. This album is one of the greatest I've heard in the past four years, and it's one of the only new albums I've heard that I still listen to over and over again over a year after I purchased it. From the very beginning of \\"Sleeping with the Lights On\\", I am hooked - and I stay that way throughout the album. (with the exception of the uninspired 'Josephine' that acts as a real mood-killer.) You're the Ocean is an utterly phenominal song, and I recommend this album to anyone who likes driving at night and just letting the music take them along for the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very original...","review":"Teitur is a wonderful artist and very, very original. He plays soft music...I especially love his song, Josephine. The lyrics to \\"Josephine\\" are just heart-felt...If you like artists such as Ben Jelen or Ryan Cabrera, than check this CD out. (he is my fav out of Ben and Ryan...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Thrilling!!!","review":"I would have to say that Teitur's style rolls off a bit folksy with a tinge of eclectic flavor, but nonetheless exciting to hear. I do have to admit that the reason I bought the CD was because I had heard a sample clip of \\"Josephine\\" at Borders mixed in the folk category with Damien Rice and Eastmountainsouth, artists who I also want to hear more of, and everything seemed to annoy me, but then as I kept listening, I was starting to enjoy all of his songs. I'm the kind of person that has to warm up to an artist's music, because the first listening of their music never penetrates deep enough with me. So I always keep listening to see if I bend to their music. If I do, do I rarely not get their music! Teitur is very mesmerizing in his music. There's a certain eclectic -ness of his music, kind of like Kings of Convenience, who I also like!Nonetheless, his music is very promising!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetry at its very best","review":"This is the very music you want to listen to if you are far away and longing home to your love ones.It's music from the heart of one of our very finest new poets. This is the album you should't miss. Relax and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fortune","review":"We had the good fortune to catch Teitur as the opening act at John Mayer's London, Ontario show-- what an amazing performer. My fiance ran to purchase his cd as soon as the set finished. His work is understated quiet filled with charm and grace. This cd is a masterpiece of emotion and purity. Each song tells a story as clear as a Faulkner piece. Simply brillance set to music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective disc","review":"This disc was defective, only part of it worked.

It was the inimitable Alban Berg Quartet recording, and yet, despite the seminal influence of this moment into my appreciation of chamber music, it has long since been superseded by the Caspar Da Salo. The slow, plaintive tempo of the 2nd movement drips with pathos. I take my pathos in enormous, Lear-esque, almost indigestible chunks, and this lashes it about with maudlin largess. Each note of the irresistibly divine violin solo that leads this movement from about 2 mins in drips with deliberate and tortured anguish. Each note a sharp laceration. I love it. It is medicinal and regenerative in its embrace of gratuitous affliction - like a weeping open wound. If you need to purge the inexplicable agony of your existence and you like it slow and drawn, unleash the Caspar."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed with Oster","review":"I got this as a holiday gift and was excited to have a larger processor (we've had a small Cuisinart chopper and love it). Used it once to make a bean dip and was disappointed because it didn't seem to move the ingredients around very well. The blade spun and chopped what was in its path, but it wasn't able to keep everything moving to really smooth things out. I ended up transferring my mix into the chopper, but my mix was so dried out from the Oster, it wasn't really edible.The second time I went to try it, it wouldn't work. My husband said he got it to work but had to press a button in using a the end of a chopstick.I'm either getting a KitchenAid or Cuisinart.

Buy what you know!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Subtitle: Yes Sells Out!","review":"When I first heard 90125 back in the early 80s, I was appalled at its \\"modern\\" nature: Generic rhythms, cliched guitar riffs and a pop feel that is a far cry from progressive classics like Close To The Edge. While the only positive thing I can say about the CD is sound quality, 90125 now sounds embarassingly dated in the same vein as most 80s one-hit wonders.Of course, this grossly overrated album was without the talents of Bill Bruford -- who must have gawked when he heard the opening to the lame disco-ish \\"Leave It\\" -- and Steve Howe. Here, Howe's touch is missed, as Trevor Ravin either throw in unoriginal solos or rips off Howe himself (the solo in \\"Changes\\").I'm sure that there are those who will defend 90125 to no end, but to those accustomed to Yes when they were taking chances and following their own lead instead of succumbing to the pop music fads & trends of this period, to this day, I still cannot call 90125 a YES album without wincing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A loudmouth progressive rock fan with an arrogant opinion.","review":"This should have never been a Yes album. Chris Squire and Alan White had the right idea when this project was started as a new band called \\"Cinema.\\" Unfortunately, things got ugly when this turned into a Yes project. As such, this is a parody of Yes' glory days, when they were a band that was once known for their brilliance and their originality.I like intelligent pop music, but 90125 is too cheesy for my tastes. The album waxes insipid lyrical subjects and corny keyboard sounds that gave 80's pop a bad name. The rocking songs have no hooks, and the ballads lack the beauty that made tracks like \\"Turn of the Century\\" so pleasant. Strictly on a basis of musicality, the album is average (thus banal) adult pop. I have to admit that a few of the tracks of moderate interest, like \\"Leave It\\" and \\"Changes,\\" but the rest - even the 'classic' \\"Owner of a Lonely Heart\\" - leaves a bad taste in my mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop music.","review":"If you're a \\"pop\\" fan, buy this album. If you like Yes' \\"hits\\" the best, like Roundabout, and Owner of a Lonely Heart, get this. If you love synthesizers, this is the album for you.

If you liked the original, you'll like this one because there is more of it, including extended versions and alternate versions.This was a turning point for the band.

Trevor Rabin completely took hold of the music, and the band followed, but it was no longer YES. By the end, Trevor Rabin's head had inflated to the degree that HE was playing keyboard on stage and not Tony Kaye- the ultimate insult.Every song reflects the new technologies generating at the time, and exactly what the REAL YES loved to avoid- shorter precise cuts that were good for a larger, radio-distracted audience! HOWEVER, had Jon NOT decided to do vocals and the band kept the name \\"Cinema\\" (the original idea), I think the effort would have been listenable. But to hear Jon singing \\"Owner of a Trevor Rabin heart\\" is just pathetic. The album, now over 22 years old, has stood the test of time because it had a major market impact.

This, while the albums other radio friendly songs like \\"It Can Happen\\" and especially \\"Changes\\" happen to be songs I'm very fond of. \\"Our Song\\" and \\"Hearts\\" were also standout tracks, in my opinion, each with a very pleasant prog-pop sound and memorable melodies. Some of the less fascinating songs on the album (\\"Hold Tight\\", \\"City of Love\\") missed the mark with me, in much the same way that some of the material on the Asia debut did.

He was already dead, but someone threw him out of a plane he had supposedly rented.

I mean, I'm a woman, and the last thing I want in a workout is the instructor coming on to me. I just don't swing that way.I have done Veena and Neena's workouts. They are much more down to earth are more graceful dancers. Their music is better and their workouts are more fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun workout!","review":"My bellydance experience includes one short class and the Mara/Neena & Veena videos. I really enjoyed this set. My favorite is Cardio Shimmy cause it makes me sweat. The other workouts are not as intense, in fact Bellydance Boogie is fairly mild. I have fun doing the workouts and I don't even notice the time passing. It did take me a bit of time to get the moves down. I also enjoy the bonus workouts included. The low point is the music, but I'm able to look past that. In fact, I don't know of too many workout videos with good music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Bellydance","review":"Let me start by saying I think Rania is an excellent dancer; her performances at the end are fantastic. But her instruction left a lot to be desired. She looked uneasy and stiff and the background dancers were stiff and cheesy. The music was just plain awful, especially in Pure Sweat and Cardio Shimmy.The workouts are boring, but I still enjoy her performances. The bonus workouts are OK. I will stick with Neena and Veena."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout!","review":"As a non-dancer type person, I found this workout quite challenging and very efficient at getting the heart rate up. The extra workouts are great as well and I really like the ability to work out my abs without getting on the floor. And the Cardio Shimmy - I only did it for a few minutes and my abs killed me the next day.I also like the fact that there are four other people doing the same workout so that I can see four other different ways of performing the same move. I find myself watching the tall blond with shorter hair on Rania's right quite a bit and copying her moves more than Rania's.I also have Too Hip and Rania's version of My Personal Trainer and highly recommend those as well. Too Hip is a bit more advanced overall than I'm ready for right now but I do like the warmup a little better than some of the others. Using the DVDs makes it easy to tailor my workout to my preferences.If you're looking for something fun that will get you moving, I highly recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"All disks are the same","review":"I bought this box set thinking I would have some variety with 4 DVD's. But all the disks are the same. It's the same location, same people, same costumes, same music and very slight variations in the moves. I like the workout, but I would recommend buying only 1 video."},{"rating":"1","title":"this will not get your heart pumpin'","review":"if your looking for a heart pumping cardio get you into gear workout this dvd set isnt for you. but if you have patience to over look the faults of this set you'll find that your hips are slimmer and your abs are tighter.the voice over is creepy and the cuing is off but i have to say i really like the repetition. once a move is introduced you do it numerous times before it is put into sequence. the camera moves around a lot and shows all the dancers doing the move but they all do the move differently. i really wish they'd just focus on rania doing the movements.i really like the bonus waist scupling and ab isolations. OMG they work. i've been doing them every other day and i can feel the difference. like i said before you'll need some patience with this set of dvds not the greatest out there but they get the job of slimming the hips done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad for learning dance, not bad for fitness","review":"I agree with the majority of the reviewers: Rania is NOT a good dancer. But I'm surprised that some reviewers believe it's ok or even good (!) for beginners. This is not true at all! You will pick up bad habits that you will have to unlearn! Some of the backup dancers are actually better than Rania (but none of them are really good).As a workout it's not bad though. It's still more fun than going to gym. Just don't expect it to be very inspiring. The music is not only inappropriate for bellydancing; it's so bland that it doesn't motivate you to move at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for anyone seriously interested in belly dance","review":"I received these DVDs for my birthday, and was disappointed to find that Rania wasn't all that I expected her to be. She wasn't that bad of a dancer, but the women in the background were horrible. They lacked in technique. When belly dance is about isolating movements to certain areas of the body, these girls were bobbing up and down like jackhammers. If you are looking for a good beginning foundation for Belly Dance, there are many other products that will help much more than these DVDs. If you are only looking for an aerobic workout, then I suggest only buying Cardio Shimmy, because it is the only one that will really make you sweat. Otherwise, the videos move at a slow pace, teach incorrect technique, and you have to perform two in a row to get even the slightest bit of a workout. Save your money and time and buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Belly dance fitness for weight loss featuring Rania","review":"excelent teaching methods with various workout speeds for people at all levels. very good work out I would recomend it to anyone, the special features are amazing and breath takingly beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good dancer, good workout, but very very boring","review":"If you are interested in her style and the DVDs, I recommend you buy only one of the four. The rest will be all the same. Many repetitions, and little creativity of movement. The bonuses are good, both the performance and the workout. I bought all four, and now I'm selling them all on ebay. I could not even do all four at least once, since I realized after three that they are all the same. Save your money, there are much better belly dancing videos out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a Scam","review":"This review for the specific bottle of Princess I bought on Amazon from Trendsetters, not the perfume in general. I've purchased 2 bottles of Princess from the department store and I love it. I found it on Amazon for half what I pay at Macy's and thought it was worth a shot. The perfume itself should be pink in color; the bottle I received contained a clear liquid with a slight bit of pink (only if you hold it to the light). When I sprayed it, it had no scent whatsoever. Nothing. The nozzle on the perfume bottle smelled sort of like black pepper. Basically, its not perfume, its just water and food coloring. I wanted to return it, but perfume is on the list of non-returnable items because its a flammable material. I filed a claim with Amazon and contacted the seller in hopes I can get a refund. Don't waste your money and don't buy anything from Trendsetters; they're only here to cheat you. I assume most of these positive reviews are from people who work for Trendsetters."},{"rating":"2","title":"lovely fragrance","review":"I really like this fragrance. It smells soft and sweet but not overly sweet like cotton candy or anything like that. I must admit that even though this fragrance is marketed for a younger crowd (im 42) I really liked it and will make it a staple in my perfume collection. The only negative is the staying power is not that great I found that after 4 hr it was fading but thats probably because its a toilette, overall I will continue to purchase this fragrance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet and Light","review":"I completely disagree with the other reviewer. I am NOT a teen, and I LOVE this fragrance. (I'm 25 if you must know) I like sweet fragrances, and this one is similar to others I use. It's close to the Betsey Johnson scent, but with more vanilla. It's also close to Juicy Couture if you took the spicieness away. It's very simple and sweet. Reminds me a little of vanilla. It is not over-powering, and is great for every day wear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!!","review":"I usually buy this same product from sephora for about $20 more!! Its exactly the same!

The bottle wasn't secure in the box as it would be if purchased from a store. The perfume wasn't the same color as the original perfume is. It should be a lilac color, instead it was a strange grey color. The smell is similar but does not last as long on the skin or clothing as the original that I had purchased from a department store.

Thoroughly Italian, it's amazing there are individuals standing at the end. But they do, and it is fun to watch. Led by a cast that includes the terrific actor Stefano Accorsi (his face is a map of Italy) and Stefania Sandrelli, who struggles through a mid-life crisis, the film produces a riotous wave of emotion. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's hot.","review":"First, watching arguments in Italians is so much more entertaining than watching them in English: It is musical and poetic. Second, not knowing Italian has its advantages: I chose to watch the Italian version over the English version for the reason that I can ignore the actors and focus on the characters. Third, this is not a comedy, but neither was \\"I Heart Huckabees\\" or \\"Star Wars\\" (I'm just saying). Fourth, as a dude who's about to hit 30, this movie brings some stuff to light that was always there, but I didn't think about. Fifth, regarding the reviewer's opinion: \\"The viewer is left with no warm feelings about life's decisions[...]\\" As if anyone makes only warm and happy decisions in life. Also, this reviewer's opinion is not true: At it's most basic level, this film showed how some people's perceptions change over time, while others simply do not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps You Thinking Even After You've Finished Reading...","review":"First off, this book is a very easy read and I got finished within in only a couple of days. The book is well written, though some parts seem repetitive and a bit too selacious (yes, even for the subject matter). But, the author does a wonderful job in presenting the day the cannibalism takes place. We are presented with a brief history of Armin and his mother before we are introduced to the victim and his life as well. The events culminate to the meeting and the \\"feasting\\" and everything that went through Armin's mind (we are told). This book does a good job making you think even after you've read a book as to how someone can do such a thing. Even today, days after I've completed this book, I still think about what transpired between the two willing participants. Overall, a simple read for the casual reader like myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"writing in the margins","review":"Higgins provides an extremely detailed account of how the life of an individual, Peter Caulder, otherwise lost to history, is shaped by the trajectories taken by the history of a nation.

Caulder clearly leaves his mark on society and Higgins ingeniously teases that out of the historical record.

It is also cleverly told with parallel plots so that you never get bored.And for all you scardy cats out there (like me) don't worry it isn't scary at all. But it didn't need to be scary to be enjoyable. It was as good as Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. After I saw it I was very surprised that it wasn't directed by Tarantino himself.The acting was also great if you just wanted to know.

It is composed of two movements: a short straight story that is really scary and is resolved by an \\"act of god\\", and a second very weak part which transforms one of the characters from an innocent nerd into a minor Kayzer Sosze. From the moment the second version of the story appears the script starts to tumble down the stairs until it get wrapped in muddy waters (literally). This \`crazy-mastermind' part is unbelievable and is left unresolved with a wink to spectators that don't ask for much. I would let this pass and consider this film as a minor effective entertainment if not for the fact that the final scenes between the psychologist and the crazy student which reveals the truth are badly managed and fail to produce tension or lasting horror."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thriller fans need to take this dark ride","review":"This was one cool flick. Pri - tee darn horrifying what takes place down in that hole, especially as the truth unfolds. There's something extra poignant watching the priviledged lose control of their magic kingdom and suffer the worst by way of some malfunctioning mind's doings. The plot builds as the clock ticks and you become aware you're not really sure of just what happened down there. As you figure it out, you are introduced to one warped a** psyche. If you're a fan of disturbing fare, dig in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Dark \\"Hole\\"","review":"I have to say I was rather impressed with this film...one of those that didn't really appear in theaters that I recall, but that I caught on cable one particularly drab weekend afternoon a few years ago and to this day I remember it well. It's a dark tale of teen love, err more like lust and sex, the neediness of belonging, and what people are willing to do or allow to happen when confronted with the opportunity to have what/who they want. You'll recognize a few faces including the one of the cover on the dvd, though her's isn't the main character. There are moments of poor acting/dialogue, however, the emotional reactions fuel and continue to feed into your paranoia and concern for all the characters in some way. All unravels as it should and in the end all you want is the guilty party to be put into the bunker to suffer for their selfish crime."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only hole in this movie is the plot!","review":"I don't think i've ever seen a movie this bad! So bad, i was angry at myself for watching it. I think the only thing i've discovered by watching this movie, is that Thora Birch really annoys me! Go figure! Another clue to how bad this movie is, Keira Knightly is the main focus on the cover, implying she is the central figure of the movie (as if that would lure more people to see it) well, she wasn't. Sorry folks, the only thing your gonna get out of this is an expensive beer coaster. If you looking for suspense, don't go for this one. If your looking for gore, not here either, pretty minimal. No heart was put into this plot, you will only feel less intelligent for watching this tripe! NO STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"zero stars if could.","review":"This film is a pile of (....)!!!!. Absolutely crap.

I was writing a review and then started thinking about the movie and fell asleep again. If poorly directed adults pretending to be teens with phoney English accents, and moronic plots involving bait and switch \\"twists\\" that are supposed to be creative are your thing, check this one out. Otherwise, there is not much meat in this turkey sandwich."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Boring!!!","review":"When you look at the cover of this film you think it's gonna be great! It's not. Definitely not!!!Four private school students sneak off for a couple days to an underground World War 2 bunker. When the holiday ends though they find out that they've been locked inside the bunker with hardly no food, no water and no means of communication to the outside world. But one of them is deceiving the others and is to blame for all of this!The film is just . . . well . . . TOO ENGLISH!!! I'm from England and I think that it's so rubbish! Most of the actors playing British people are American which could be an explanation. American people always make British people sound really snobby when they try and do the accent! People say that somehow this film explains the mystery of The Blair Witch Project. I have no idea how?! Anyway personally I think it's completely rubbish and feels more like a BBC special length drama rather than a movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"First of all, keira should thank the casting person that put her sorry @ss in that soccer movie in England. She is plain, boring, flat-chested, and eerily identical to Natalie Portman- I can't tell them apart. I hate preformers and actresses like that- look just like everyone else, very no-identity so often play good girls. The annoying kind.And Thora! This is why you aren't getting good roles in good movies! Toplessness and non-stop sex scenes do not an actress make. Use your talent and throw away porny scripts!So anyways I hate when the end of a movie starts at the beginning and then proceeds to play backwards. Why show things that didn't happen?? Why make a movie half in the past , half in the current time?? It was too much; made me nauseous. Reccommended for teenagers and empty headed early-twenties. If you want sex scenes, rent a porno not a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie","review":"This is definitely one of my favorite movies.

Maybe if you've seen every movie ever made and are going to compare it to some other random movie and go into watching it with a closed mind, you may not like it...But I'm not a huge movie buff, and I loved it, not because it was action packed or anything, but because it was so twisted that when it ended I thought about it for days. Even now I just remembered about it and I'm here reading these reviews because I want to see it again.The bunker scenes are freaky, every last one of them. The whole atmosphere created by the director is amazing. Birch is an amazing actress but she is downright freaky/scary in this role, all the while still sexy in some insane way.Just ignore the tiny issues with it that you may find while watching, and enjoy the show for what it is - an awesome mindf--k!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"absorbing and scary","review":"The most terrifiying movie I have seen in a long time, psychological and absorbing, it stayed with me for weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"When Control Trumps Life...","review":"Liz Dunn (the magnificent Thora Birch!) is the only survivor of a group of prep-school kids' secret gone horribly wrong. The four (including the delectible Keira Knightly!) decide to spend their time partying in a long-forgotten, underground bomb shelter rather than go to Wales w/ the rest of the students. It was supposed to be a fun way to get out of a class trip, but it turned into a lethal dungeon of suffocating madness. Liz and her friends are changed from free-sprited youths into starving, thirsty, utterly desperate prisoners. A police psychologist (Embeth Davidtz) attempts to unravel the mystery behind what actually happened in THE HOLE, only to find out that some things are better left buried. Ms. Birch is as understated as ever, carrying most of the movie herself. Some of her character's words are chilling, not so much for what she says, but for what's going on around her when she says them! Buy immediately..."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a GREAT movie","review":"This is a really neat, dark movie. The acting is great as well as the makeup. The cinematography is sooooooo amazing. It creates an atmosphere that has yet to be matched in cinema today...alright maybe not but it's is still pretty spiffy. The twists and turns are fun and the scenes between the teenagers are interesting to watch as you laugh and cry and become terrified. As I said before, the acting is great. Thora Birch is one of the brightest stars right now and this movie doesn't take anything away from her resume. Keira Knightly is gorgeous and this is a fairly shallow role for her but it got her noticed.It's a complex plot, with three or four sides of the story leaving the audience to decide for themselves before their own theories are blown out of the water. I'd highly recommend this if you are a fan of, especially Thora Birch, any of the cast members or if you like psychological thrillers that are geared towards a younger audience. It's slick and fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not fit my small 9 yr old","review":"I was excited to find a child sized sleep mask for my son, he is 9 but it was too tight for his head.

The story of a little boy who carved a little man in a wooden canoe, and the adventures encounterd by the little man just captured my imagination. I never knew the Great Lakes until after feeling as though I had been there with Paddle to the Sea. H.C. Holling books are works of art packed with wonderful facts from science and geography.

He places this paddle person he has made so that the Spring melt launches it on a voyage that takes it through the length of the St. Lawrence Seaway and even out into the Atlantic. There are two reasons why this story is still popular after well over half a century. Holling's artwork is simple and well detailed, realistic and always a complement to the text. The second reason is that it resonates deep inside, calling up dreams of taking bold voyages to faraway places. Like the boy who carved Paddle-to-the-Sea, my own heart wants to go on that voyage!

Since when does Batman want to quit being Batman. I know Christian Bale was tired of doing Batman and so is Nolan and they reflected it with the story in the movie. Anne Hathaway as CATWOMAN was pure Brilliance.For me she saved the movie. She nailed Catwoman perfectly. Tom Hardy as Bane was another excellent choice. His back story was also better than the comic back story. They dropped the ball with Talia AL Ghul big time. I enjoyed Gordon Levitt's character alot. Heck he did more detective work than Batman.

It shines in HD cinematic glory. So, if you are interested in seeing this movie, Amazon Instant Video is a great way to go.The reason for the Title is: It's a nearly 3 hour movie, with 33 minutes of Batman in it (SPOILER. most of it is him getting his butt kicked.). It does not directly follow the Dark Knight movie. (at the ending of Dark Knight we are told that Batman must be chased because he is the hero we need right now.) This would lead us to believe the next movie would pick up with the police chasing Batman. SPOILER ALERT!!! It picks up 8 years later.) It's filled with plot holes.)Lastly, the dialogue is brilliant if....You have suntitles, which amazon Instant video does nopt yet provide. You will only understand 2/3rds of wehat Bane says.

They would have been better off choosing a villain people have actually heard of.The plot was drawn out and hard to follow. This movie should have been cut down to about 2 hours. The fight scene between Bane and Batman was lame; if all it took to defeat Bane was a few punches to his face, why didn't Batman do that in the first place?As usual, Christian Bale's exaggerated vocal performance was just silly. Between his throaty rasp and Bane's mask, I found a lot of the dialogue difficult to understand. I probably didn't miss much though.The only positive point to this movie--other than the obvious: special effects--was [SPOILER ALERT] the introduction of Robin at the end.If you're a hardcore Batman fan, you'll probably love this movie.

How comes that Batman who was conceived as the combination of such characters as Dracula, The Shadow, and Sherlock Holmes in this movie seems to have lost to all the characteristics of his inspirers?! If you know these characters well, you know what I mean!Also, More importantly,the movie is full of plot holes and the script is badly written.

And how can you call this a Batman movie when he is only in the movie for 20 minutes at most? It's a 2-hour 40-minute movie which could have easily been cut shorter. And they ruined the Bane character with the final reveal of the mastermind, also the way he was killed just made him look like a joke. The fight scenes are some of the worst choreography I've ever seen in a major blockbuster. Don't get me wrong, it has some great scenes like the first face-off between Bane and Batman, how Brcue Wayne eventually climbs out of the pit.

Almost three hours long, the story could of been told in twenty minutes. I get the over the top characters like Bane it's based on a comic book but cat woman wasn't up to par, and who ever that other girl was(I couldn't stay focused) was pointless. Now Batman was useless cat woman (although unbelievable in the role) did all the work. Bruce Wayne's a workaholic, he would have never gone away and let his company fall apart...........OK I'm upset with this mess and I'm starting to ramble, I'm annoy myself in the process.

And OMG THOSE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE TO DIE FOR! It even sounded like there were real bullets going off in the theater, that's how realistic they were! I guess some fools thought they were a little TOO realistic so they were ducking or running out of the theater, oh well, their loss for missing the action. My only complaint though is that there seemed to be bullets going off when character's would just be talking or something, like they couldn't turn off the sound effects. But when I was walking out of the theater I realized I got shot in the arm earlier, THAT'S how badass this movie is!

I think the third and final film in this arch takes the best portions of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight and blends them very well into a movie that focuses in on Bruce Wayne and his true purpose and legacy for Gotham and also provides the villain and threat levels we sense with Heath Ledger's Joker.

I think this film basically makes this trilogy perfect and worth seeing from start to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic conclusion","review":"I went to the theater and watched The Dark Knight Rises five times.

Yes, the movie can be downloaded to your computer, and moved to an tablet or phone, however, it has to have the Flixster app to watch your digital copy. This means no watching via your AppleTV or Android/Other bases TV streaming device, unless you can get the Flixster app. This also requires a UltraViolet account, a Warner Brothers account, and a Flixster account. If you are like me and prefer digital copies, then AVOID this product and grab it on iTunes. This was a very sad attempt at Warner Brothers for trying to make the consumer buy another copy of the movie.

It's poor quality streaming. And the Second Screen? SUCKS!","review":"OK, the movie is pretty good for a trilogy ending and we know that. I had fun in the movie theater despite of some serious goofs you might find in the IMDB page.However, the \\"Second Screen\\" app on your iPhone, iPad or whatever forces you to watch the movie looking at another screen, something you have to buy additionally. What if you don't have an iPhone or a Samsung Galaxy? You're pretty much toasted. The Dark Knight DVD had a feature in the BD that let you watch the features while the movie was playing, same way as Inception. This \\"App sync\\" is a scam.Oh and I agree 100% with the 1-star reviews about UltraViolet, essentially a way to compete against Netflix with low-quality streaming. A rip-off worthy of LucasFilm or Apple (The Beatles' Apple and Cupertino's).In 5 years nobody will care about these Apps, but the movie will live on."},{"rating":"1","title":"not all that great","review":"this movie left one guessing what batman was really about. there was a bunch of story strands flying around unlike the previous movies. i think another thing missing from this movie was the great action scenes that were in the other two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too long, needed lots of editing...","review":"What were they thinking? Too long, too dark, too boring. Way better things to do with your time. Forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing story and sound.","review":"I love comic book heroes, especially Batman. I have a home theater, so I rarely go to movies and when \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" became available, I was torn between buying and streaming. Fortunately, I decided to stream because this movie is not worth owning and here are two reasons why:1) Poor quality audio. With all the special effects, you'd expect sounds to be exploding all around you, but not only were my surround speakers quiet, the dialog was either muffled or too loud. I could hardly understand Alfred, Batman mumbled many of his lines, and Bane's voice boomed way out of proportion.2) The story was stupid. I realize these movies are adapted from comic books, but come on - there has to be some believability and logic. I won't go into details because, if you're reading this, you probably haven't seen the movie, but be prepared to both scratch and shake your head throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"More of Batman at his best.","review":"A complex story line and good acting.

Heath was just awesome as the Joker, and I wondered if the third movie could deliver. This movie fits well into the series. I still like the 2nd one best, but this is a great movie as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good end to a great trilogy","review":"I found this film to be just as my title says a good ending to a great trilogy. Christopher Nolan's trilogy has been my favorite of all the live action Batman movies. That being said I did not enjoy this one as much as Batman Begins or The Dark Knight. As for the DVD itself I got the basic version which is all I wanted I'm not really into commentary and all that stuff the only thing on that end I was disappointed with was the cover itself when compared to the Blu-Ray version it seems kind of lame. But overall I was happy with the product and the movie itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic interpretation of the comic.

Catwoman wasn't her normally cat self this time around. The outfit was good on her."},{"rating":"2","title":"best of the three","review":"Without a doubt the best of the three new batman movies.

The bad guy is just freaky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unleavened Batman Finishes Flat","review":"Clearly, this film appeals to many viewers and likely, this is just not my cup of tea, but I found this installment to start out on an intriguing note and then just nose-dive from there. The story line seemed muddled, the acting uninspired and the outcome contrived. The action and dialog could have been condensed here to approximately 90 minutes; instead, the plot was dragged out to the point of being tiresome. Also, is it really necessary for the tone to be primarily so deadly and dreary all the time? Is this not based on comic book characters and a fictional city, etc.? Where's the camp? I mean really, \\"Why so serious...?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not meet the BATMAN expectation for me!!!!!!","review":"I thought the movie lacked action and took too long to get to the little action they had. I figure when you watch a BAtman movie you expect some fight scenes and cool gadgets but this movie lacked both. Batman wasn't even batman for most of the movie. Overall, I wish I waited for the free instant video instead of paying for it, but I did save $2 by renting the movie through Amazon instead of my cable carrier so I was not too unhappy, but wait for the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mumble, Mumble, Mumble","review":"Everyone in this movie is hard to understand. Batman and his silly \\"disguised\\" voice and Bane and his mask, make this movie \\"unhearable\\". And...why can't batman keep his mouth closed? His mouth is always just hanging open...Is his mask too tight, does he have a cold?Bad long movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring. Terrible twist.","review":"Story reminds me of a bad Japanese Anime. Trying to be all epic and amazing but just a mess and tiresome. The twists in this film are terrible. Christian bale seems constipated. More terrible character voices i.e. bane. Ann hathaway has no sex appeal which is a must for cat woman. Why so do people like this film? I guess a lot of people are happy enough with big hollywood names and big hollywood budgets. Wish Bane just killed batman and destroyed gotham to put an end to the franchise. Thor was much better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucked.....","review":"Batman hardly uses any gadgets in the movie; instead he prefers to get angry and fist brawl everyone and gets pwned constantly doing so. I watched this with my mother who saw the first and second Batman movies when they first came out, the old ones with Jack Nicholson. All we did is laugh, laugh, and laugh during this movie. It's just that cheesy and poorly written. Throughout the film she asked \\"Why does Batman get beaten up so much in the new movies?\\" This was the first new Batman movie she had seen and I assured her it would be great...... I was embarrassed...... The last two movies were awesome, what happened? Also why does Bane talk like he's British when He's supposedly from the middle east. So confused. Yeah this one is a turd, I don't recommend watching it. If someone gives you the movie for free then maybe, but other than that don't do it. Batman The Dark Night Rises sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down big time","review":"Worth a dollar rental, but no more than that. Batman seems like a chump in this one who gets his arse kicked every time you turn around. Most of the movie he seems depressed and un-sure of himself and most are glad he is gone.Bane is a joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty well done!","review":"I watched this once and I was not impressed, after watching this movie the second time I caught some of the subtle foreshadowing, and creative development in it's story line.Overall I think it was well put together, from character development, to story-line, to the directing and acting.Legendary comic book hero's have already done it all, so all things considered, the movie is at least very entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"The trailer looked good but I was worried about the length which is nearly 3 hrs. The pacing was bad and at parts it dragged so bad I kept wondering when is this gonna end? I wasn't crazy about Bane's heavy accent because it was difficult to understand him. The so called \\"epic conclusion\\" is an epic disappointment and failure in my mind. Nolan should have quit while he was ahead with The Dark Knight which was way better. I was excited about the casting of Anne Hathaway as Catwoman but they didn't give her the screen time and character development Catwoman deserves. Overall I would red box it for cheap or go to the library and pick it up. Not worth paying to see it that's for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad It\\"s Over","review":"The two stars I gave this movie was generous, because if was simply ridiculious and a waste of my money. I wished there was a way to get my money back"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly long, too much mysticism","review":"The move was overly long and kind of dull, with too much mystic crap thrown in, though I preferred it to the Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher directed movies, which were just weird for the sake of being weird."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I was a bit dissapoibted with this one compared with the last two movies in he franchise. I wanted to like it through the very end but it was a tough one to get through. The ending did have some redeeming qualities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie - Ultraviolet Copy a Waste","review":"I enjoyed all three of the Batman movies in this trilogy.

Now THAT was a highlight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cardboard characters + Twisted Story + Special Effects = Disappointing","review":"We were fans of the first two movies but this one just didn't work well. The acting was inconsistent -- especially from Christian Bale. He is supposed to be injured and having trouble walking -- (he can barely get out of his car) then he twirls around the dance floor as if nothing were wrong -- only to limp again (and use a walking stick) later. Bruce Wayne doesn't have any emotional depth to him -- the moments he seems more . . . \\"involved\\" in what's happening and effected, come off as cheesy.It's good when a movie surprises you. This one doesn't have twists so much as it seems twisted. Really the story just seemed to be a backdrop for the special effects --- so the choppiness makes sense in a way.This is a visually appealing move with lots of action that still manages to be boring at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat of a disappointment","review":"There's seems to be a curse when it comes to to the last of a superhero trilogy. We saw it in the third Chris Reeves' Superman movie and in the original Spiderman trilogy with Tobey Mcquire. The Chris Nolan Batman movies I'm afraid suffers the same fate. The second Chris Nolan Batman is without a doubt the best Superhero movie ever made (The Dark Knight). These shoes were impossible to fill with the late great Heath Legder's brilliant Joker probably the best movie villain of all times. Unfortunely the Dark Knight Rises is a dissapointment with a hardly discernable villain in Bain played by the gifted Tom Hardy whose motives and visage are ill defined. The plot has mores hole in it than a swiss cheese factory and the twist at the end makes no sense. Rest easy dear Heath you will never be surpassed.RegardsPerry Greenberg"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big budget, lots of explosions, lots of Bat-Toys, weak, boring plot","review":"I think they tried to produce an 'epic' finale with this film but lost focus on the story.

By the end we were both just anxious for it to end and neither of us cared who lived or died."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy handed, poorly edited, and joyless","review":"While the film starts out promisingly, with good (if not limited) characters, and decent acting, it quickly goes down hill once the main threat is revealed.At that point the film becomes a jumble of implausible or unexplained subplots, which despite the movie's length, feel rushed. The main plot lacks subtlety, and feels only tangentially connected to the character struggle.My first instinct is to blame editing, which makes its awkwardness especially known in the action scenes, (shot of person, shot of action, shot of other person, shot of action.... WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?. After thinking about it a bit, I just feel like they were trying to cram in too many angles (literally and figuratively).Also, the sound design, good lord, do I need swelling music in every scene? How about you turn that down so I can hear the muffled dialog?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to wrap up the trilogy!","review":"I loved Christopher Nolan's entire Dark Knight Trilogy, and found this to be a worthy follow-up to The Dark Knight.

When I again scene another reference but this time to Aurora I was shocked. Pre-programming here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound - ing Off","review":"The sound tract was awful... I could barely understand the characters words except when Bane was speaking, which was too loud and very muffled because of the mask, I guess. The lighting was terrible through the entire movie. Everything was too dark... always in shadows. And most importantly, if you're making a movie about Batman, shouldn't 'The Batman' appear in costume more often? The injured Bruce Wayne had a lot of face time as he hobbled through the scenes, but only appeared as Batman a few times and got his butt kicked more often than not. I expected a lot of action as there is in all the other super hero movies of late, but this installment of Dark Knight was poorly written and poorly directed. I'm hoping this will remain a Trilogy thus ending this installment and I hope the next time it's remade someone will finally get it right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unable to watch as service was terrible Please remove from my bill","review":"It was unwatchable as the amazon service continuously paused to load the video data.

By the end I felt like I was being tortured to watch the rest of this movie. Horrible character development, incoherent and abstract plot with absurd sense of time. Horrible attempts at misguided political sentiment. Just wow you followed up on the Batman series with this. Every decision maker on this movie should be exiled for pandering, and failure to adhere to movie fundamentals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Horrible","review":"Simply put this film is a piece of trash. It plays no tribute to the Batman legend at all. Reviewers who dare call this even a good film can only be related to the film'sdirector. The acting is stale. The story line--if in fact there truly was one--was so confusing that it wasn't even worth the bother to figure out. There were some minor saving graces but not enough to even hope that the people responsible for this film should have any business trying to restore our faith in the Batman legeng--or any legend--ever again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Batman movie","review":"Mr Nolan comes threw again with an epic tale of the dark night.

Big mistake - HUGE. I spent hours trying to just get into the accounts they are forcing me to set up and then I could not download my movies. What a waste. I would give this movie - The Dark Knight Rises - five stars for the actual movie, but the inclusion of this crap \\"digital download\\" makes this a one star movie. I searched and searched for a version with an iTunes download - my preference - but to no avail. Amazon, don't sell this UltraViolet digital copy crap.

I adore Nolan's work, Inception is one of my top 10 movies and I've watched The Dark Knight multiple times. But, The Dark Knight Rises was too long and just plain boring (I had to pause halfway through to convince myself to finish) The plot was tiresome, of course there's a scheme to kill everyone, of course Batman is going to save the day. I was just hoping for something a little more entertaining. It is what is it, a rental. Unless you're a hardcore fan, pass.

This one on the other hand...I should've known when I saw catwoman was in it, let alone the actress playing her, that it was bad. I'm not saying that's the only reason this movie is a terrible, steaming pile of nonsensical s***. Mainly it was the absolutely god AWFUL writing. The plot was really bad. Any fan of batman since childhood or just the last two movies will be staring at the screen either in confusion most of the time or wondering aloud: \\"Really?....Like...REALLY?!

NOT WORTH IT.","review":"I bought this before I realized that it was an UltraViolet Digital Copy. They are the worst! It's a miserable experience watching the UV Digital Copies - you can't download them onto an iPad, and watching it on the iPad is miserable. It doesn't stream well - constant skips and hesitations, and the screen quality suddenly downgrades itself for no reason. I bought Amazing Spider Man because of the digitial copy and regretted it. Just got the Bluray in the mail, and I'm sending it back to Amazon. Ultraviolet is miserable. I'm going to buy it right from iTunes.

I forgot, it is easer to climb without rope. Also he goes from a sunny hot country, (middle east maybe) to USA in a few minutes.

The packaging for this version of the Bluray is a very nice plastic rendition of one of the teaser poster images.The discs themselves are filled to the rim with all sorts of extra features.

I have to say i was really surprised at this ending, so much so that this three set of movies along with Batman Begins may be my new favorite trilogy of movies.

Somehow there was an interesting movie in the middle, but the series was a roast beef sandwich made with stale bread if you know what I mean.

From the comics, to the movies, to the cartoons and the games, but I absolutely loved this series the most. This series really hit the darker side of Batman and gave it a little more of a realistic touch. Batman The Dark Knight Rises, in my opinion, made Bane one of the scariest, most intense villains in any super hero movie I've seen in 2012. I think this movie did a great job ending this specific series, and even still it left me wanting more, but I was very satisfied with the ending. It was intense, fun, and even amusing at times.

This movie was extreme in its plot and how bad they can make the bad guys. Lets make it so extreme, so hopeless, such overwhelming odds... it takes away from the movie and the characters. Its not the best Batman movie and not even the best super hero movie this year - Avengers was a better movie because it was more interesting.

That's not even close to cool. How could they even consider putting that moron in the next movie after Heath Ledger's disturbed performance in The Dark Knight?This movie was boring. It had senseless action. It somehow forgot that the rest of the Earth outside NYC might actually help in a situation like this. I mean... Whatever.

Maybe not quite up to #2 (with the Joker, what could be?), but an excellent movie nontheless. Enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done","review":"I loved it, really I did. In fact I wish it were longer. The audience was left to fill in a LOT of the character development in fact, most of that depended upon assumption and inference. Mind you, the writers and director did an expert job at setting up the inferences, but it still resulted in characters that were drawn a little shallow. I could have happily spent twice the time with these characters, and really wish that had been an option.Highly recommended for fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, poorly organized and boring!","review":"This movie did not hold my interest...after the 90 minute mark, it became almost painful.

I want to see him rise above evil using his unique gadgets, vehicles, and fighting at night without even being seen. I don't really care what hardships he went through to get him to where he is. This was way too dramatic and too much talking. It was a movie where Batman gets beat up for an hour and a half then somehow comes out on top. This is not the Batman I want to know. As Batman is my favorite superhero, I was truly disappointed in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"look at my review","review":"Okay, my brother bought it and i was ready to watch it. He got home at like 8 and we watched the whole thing. It was a very long movie. Okay, if you love the fighting scenes in batman, than this movie isn't for you. I saw the first dark knight and it was probably one of the best movies i have seen and i have seen plenty. This movie sucked. Their was barely any fighting scenes, Anne Stathoway or whatever was a big biotch the whole movie until the end, and i didn't like the story line either. This is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen. Don't waist you money or time buying this, if you are gonna watch it, rent it instead or burrow it from someone. It was also very slow in the beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"long and mostly boring","review":"A marginal Batman portrayal. wasted my $$. Even a sexy woman foil did not save this tedious film.

In my opinion, this was a long, tediously boring film that had Batman in it very little overall.

Sadly, without an actual internet connection, this is not the case, and after 2014, the switch gets turned off and that's gone too. Best news? Handbrake can rip a beautiful copy for you easily and allow you to use it where you want. If these movie companies want to show they care, they will release products in all formats, not just these locked down ones. iTunes has restrictions, but at least I can watch a movie when and where I want.

Good ending for this particular series. Will tell all my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Long & often confusing","review":"I absolutely loved the first two flix in this \\"trilogy\\" and was looking forward to this one. While I did enjoy it it could easily have been 20-30 minutes shorter and not diminished the story. As usual the special effects were great and the acting equally good. I just think certain elements of the story \\"dragged on\\" while other equally important issues were glossed over. One of the big points being communicated was that it did not matter who \\"Batman\\" was but that the existence of a \\"Batman\\" was what was important. I am not into long drawn out reviews so I will conclude this one by adding that the ending leaves open a lot of possibilities and this movie is absolutely worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved!","review":"I am a huge batman fan and enjoy these movies. This one I loved! Great story line, great action, and great actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Badass","review":"I rented this movie not really knowing what to expect, but I was completely blown away. Tom Hardy is phenomenal. Just as Heath Ledger terrified and astounded us with the Joker, Hardy's character development for Bane was complex and horrific.

I can't wait to watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY GOOD MOVIE (streamed it)","review":"Absolutely excellent movie.I may actually have to buy the blu-ray of this movie.

Netflix and Hulu work fine on my PS3 so I am blaming it on Amazon.The quality of the movie was downgraded and it was still buffering. I watched the movie in standard definition and clinking the continue button every 2 mns.I will be buying my on line streams somewhere else until this is fixed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, lousy digital copy","review":"Movie is great, 5 star worthy and a fitting conclusion to the Nolan trilogy. The one star is due to the awful Ultraviolet digital copy that comes with the disk. Its not a simple download to your iTunes account, in fact it is NOT compatible with iTunes AT ALL! If you want to watch it on your iPad, you have to download an app and watch it through a flixster app. Sorry, but I won't tolerate this as a consumer. So no more future Blu-ray purchases with this Ultraviolet crap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"they have ruined batman forever","review":"This is the worst batman movie ever. Christian Bale, WRONG GUY TO PLAY BATMAN FIRST OF ALL. Anne Hathaway as selina was the only bright spot in the movie. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this crap. NO comic relief, AT ALL. The villain I don't get. I guess, l like villains who are psycho and just total JERKS who are not witty. Get this, Batman becomes brokendown weak minded OLDMAN in this movie. Why even call this movie Batman? You only see him 20% of the time. I couldn't believe some of the bad acting. Few wellknown actors, just not convincing and were miscast to begin with. It was like I was watching a TV drama cop show. I found myself bored within first hour. Thinking it was going to turn aound soon. Wrong! If you want to be depressed and bored for 2 hours. Watch it.

Bad story, no character development, the logic even within the world of superhero movies is pushed too far. I was just pissed.

Seriously, all the good reviews about this movie, have got to be kidding me. The movie was basically about how wimpy batman is, and does not show Batman of who he truly is.

Rather, it forces you to download a spammy app from Flixster, giving you a copy of the video that you can only use with that. You want to use your iTV to stream it from your computer? Too bad for you! Maybe you like managing which videos are on your iPad from the same interface- not so here, what you download and store is completely separate! You can probably take a guess what will happen when the authentication servers for the app go offline.So go to iTunes and buy it there, or spend your money here and then torrent a copy that doesn't include ridiculous DRM and other stupidity, but don't waste your money on this scam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultraviolet is the worst digital service available.","review":"Ultraviolet is the worst digital service available.

Like many of you I had to watch it to finish the series. If you are expecting more of what we got when Heath ledger was the Joker, forget it. Chris Bale looks like a skinny Don Knotts through the whole thing, no wonder he cannot fight off a little old granny not to mention this sorry and unimaginative 'super villain' Bane. If you have half a brain you will know the whole movie within the first 15 mins. All the military presence and propaganda is enough to make any Call of Doody fan happy though I suppose.These scnees of explosions were long and boring, there were a host of characters that were introuduced and promptly forgotten because their card board acting and yes I am speaking of the even the main people....No likable characters and only one good line in the whole thing imo \\"Maybe your knife was too slow\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love batman!","review":"They need to make More dvd sets like this.

Taking some of the most epic story lines from the comics and integrating them into these movies was fantastic. The Dark Knight Rises brings everything to an end in one of the most satisfying ways.

I tried my best to make it to the end, but I just couldn't. After the third time I gave up trying to watch it. This movie seemed to drag on forever. I cannot image why C. Bale would agree to do such a movie.For the majority of this movie, Batman is the Impotent Crusader. He is either helpless or being beaten silly. He seems like the most worthless superhero in existence. I hate superhero movies where the hero is anything but a superhero until the end when he musters enough strength to fight back one good time. The storyline is also very difficult to follow.I got tired of watching poor ole C. Bale. I felt sorry for him. Poor pitiful Batman. Heck, Batman is limping around with a cane!

The entire canvas of the film is epic and themes are weighty, but the script is just too choppy and all over the place. A couple of great action sequences doesn't make up for almost an 2 and a half hours of boredom.You'll read a lot of \\"Good\\" reviews and most will start off, \\"It's no Batman Begins or The Dark Knight but...\\"Well guess what, you build me up with those great films, I'm gonna expect as good if not better for the finale.

The production quality was awful. It was hard to hear the low-talking dialogue over the background music. The villian was uninteresting and boring. Overall, just very dull script writing.

The movie once again threatened Gotham with it's destruction, snore... I found myself really just completely bored with the whole concept.

The plot line was not compelling, the pace was not exciting. The villain was pretty lame and Batman against the villain was pretty lame.

Any dude that gets sold down the river to get beaten to a pulp by a chick, and the original attraction was after she robbed you?i always thought the ras agul stuff didnt make any sense, and of course this doesnt either since its the same thinking.but all in all, who were we supposed to be rooting for?

Plus I'm a bit of a collector of special editions so this one was perfect. Not a big fan of how the disks are stacked on top of each other inside the little case, but I've found that's the new standard for special versions like this.

The result was the golden era of Hollywood. Nowadays writers/directors once achieved certain fame and success, they were given carte blanche to make whatever the movies they wished to make. The result is this last instalment of the most recent Batman trilogy which cost hundreds of millions to make and with the best available cinematic technology and the top actors from Hollywood. The result is a close to 3 hours of boredom, confusion and a story goes nowhere co-written by Chris Nolan and his brother. This film makes Michael Bay a movie god of blockbusters. It is a maddening waste of money, resources, acting talent and viewers' time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, for a 12 year old","review":"Was expecting an action packed, fun, adventure; I got a long, drawn out melodrama with some explosions and a plot that is about as believable as Alice in Wonderland.

Now that I've had the opportunity to watch the DVD with sub-titles, I've upped my rating considerably. I missed so many subtleties of the film in the theater. Major themes and plot developments were incomprehensible to me due to several characters' slurred speech and the rapid editing of some parts of the film. Now, I see The Dark Knight Rises is a complex work that requires multiple viewings to be fully appreciated. I still find the depictions of physical pain endured by several characters excessive, and it's not the perfect work that The Dark Knight is.

The authorities response to the major portion of the plot made no sense. The interactions between Bruce Wayne and the rest of the characters made no sense. Only one of the surprises had any surprise in it at all and the reveal was pointless and badly written. So, better than Batman and Robin, but not good."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"I expect that this movie would be irritating to anyone with [at least] half a brain in their head.

Batman needs to get over the \\"I'm a tough guy so I've got to talk like I have a bad cigar hangover to cover up the Christian Bale lisp\\" - and what was it with Bain's voice?

Boy was I wrong. The Dark Knight rises is boring and way too long. It's at least an hour too long. Most of the movie has no action and I almost turned it off I was so bored. I was originally sad to hear that Nolan wouldn't be back to direct a 4th Batman movie.

Even then, it's nowhere near as memorable as Heath Ledger's joker. And I mean, nowhere near as close.Other than Bane's voice, the movie is plagued by bad acting (or at best, forgettable.) The plot is full of holes, clichés, and extreme predictability.From Batman taking 8 years off to do nothing with his life, to a rookie cop knowing he was batman just because he can read people's minds or some bull about \\"fake smiles\\" to the constant hammering about the stupid auto-pilot being broken that you just knoooooow will be secretly fixed... bargh...

Christian Bale's mouth seemed to be distorted when wearing the costume & quite frankly, Batman was a wimp. Ann Hathaway's performance as Catwoman was a lot better than Bale's. Ending, when we see \\"Robin\\" go into the Bat-cave, left it open for another yet another Batman movie, which I won't be anxiously waiting for.

All of Christopher Nolan's films are so carefully constructed, but this so sloppy. It was incoherent and didn't make much sense, with plot holes you drive a truck through. And you have a 2:45 Batman movie when Batman is on screen maybe 30 minutes, and half of that getting his butt kicked. And that ridiculous dubbing of Bane's voice. You couldn't understand him half the time. I kept waiting for the film to be over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware The \\"Digital Copy\\"","review":"The digital copy is no better than a farce.

Considering this essentially a bait and switch... \\"get your UV digital copy...oh no wait it goes through flixster\\"The Blu-Ray copy as expected is of fine quality and there's no arguing the quality of the movie itself.

The acting was bad throughout except for Bane and the young cop, which is odd since you couldn't see most of Bane's face; I guess the voice acting and mannerisms are what sold it. The action scenes were poorly choreographed, directed, performed and edited. At the very least I had expected the action to be good.

REALLY sad, as this was once a very cool franchise. Michael Keaton was the best Batman, giving a human edge to the character, with a little bit of craziness, to justify his becoming a crime hero. Now, it's SFX, one grainy voice void of emotion, and plot-less chases.

The first one was a good different style to see. The second one was over rated. And this one made me down right bored wanting to fast forward through parts. Some parts of the movie just lack common sense and are pointless. One point to my thought is Batmans \\"spaceship\\"....yes he has one...anyways he gives a little grenade to blow a hole in a covered entrance to theunderground, it gets thrown and explodes...nothing happens...batman floats around the corner in his spaceship and shoots a rocket to blast it open...3 seconds later he is back on the ground talking....COME ON....this movie is a waste of time and money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and Boring","review":"Long, predictable, tedious .Did I say long and one big yawn.This movie could have wrapped in an hour and the story would still have been the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"This was a good movie, but thanks to Heath Ledger's performance in the The Dark Knight this movie finishes second."},{"rating":"2","title":"Batman","review":"I thought this was very good.

Overall though it could have been shorter, or maybe we felt that way because the movie kept stopping midstream to buffer. It was very annoying to spend $5 for a movie that would freeze or fall out of sync every 15 minutes. I don't know if it was our internet or amazon's site. Either way I think we'll stick to the \\"free\\" movies offered through the prime membership."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"I have found that most of the time when I purchase a Blu-ray/DVD without seeing the movie first I get disappointed a lot.

Don't get me wrong it was a good movie just not great. The character development was not nearly as good as the first two films and it wasn't quite as innovative. Bane's character was not as interesting as lets say the Dark Knight or The Scarecrow. This movie was still entertaining regardless and the story was well put together. The reason it gets a four star instead of five is because it did disappoint a lil bit IMO. Still a good movie so check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect ending to best comic book film trilogy","review":"Definitively concludes Bruce Wayne's story with some hope in what had often been a bleak story throughout the 3 films. Brought many themes and threads to an interesting conclusion going back to Batman Begins. Most plot holes reviewers point out do have an explanation WITHIN the narrative, Nolan just doesn't waste time showing you every train ride, bank transaction, etc. Avengers, although a good popcorn flick, could have benefited from letting the audience assume Tony Stark could fix the helicarrier's engine instead of showing it to us in real time. Where that film had maybe 3 issues of a comic covered in it at most, Dark Knight Rises crammed at least 3 of for major storylines/trade paperbacks worth of material into one film. The pacing isn't perfect, but is much more ambitious and willing to take risks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"Me and my wife enjoyed this movie. Lots of action and special effects.

I watched about an hour and then called it quits and watched something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have left well enough alone","review":"I had high hopes for this film, perhaps too high. My first issue was the story. Alfred made Bruce Wayne into batman. Then he decides to bounce? The first half hour of the film could honestly be chopped off. Next we have the unacceptable altering of characters. Selina Kyle was not just some jewel thief. She was a victim of attempted murder. Oh and Robin was a circus performer, not a Gotham city cop. I could say more and more bad things about this, but frankly I have things to do. One thing I did like was the villain. Baine was funny. Especially his voice. But you never see what's under his mask.

How much a movie can get me caught up in a moment, how much it can make me care, how invested I am, and how much it can simply make me feel, these things are what's important to me. And that's what this movie has in spades. Sure, it's got sub par writing, but let me tell you this; I enjoy this movie far more than many other movies which are considered masterpieces.

Endless repetitive scenes that had little to do with the moronic plot, plot holes that were amazingly stupid, inane dialogue, all smothered by an overbearing soundtrack (which thankfully covered up some of the idiotic script).

I will say that Dark Knight Rises concludes the trilogy on a somewhat more... disruptive... way than I had expected. There are a few scenes where I think the movie was trying to be 'written dark' a bit too hard in a way that breaks realism just a bit, which is the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars. Aside from that though this is an excellent film- well written, well directed, well acted.

I waited until this one came out on DVD to watch it home on my huge TV but it was terrible. I honestly wanted to turn it off 1 hour into the movie but kept thinking that the good part was just around the corner.......it wasn't. This is one of the worst movies I've had the displeasure of watching this year and I watch A LOT of movies. The only good thing about it was the graphics.

The rest of this snorefest is occupied by Bruce Wayne, who apparently is a cripple. Having spent the last EIGHT YEARS moping and feeling sorry for himself suddenly decides that being a cripple will not stop him from stopping Bane. Bane stomps him into the dirt and throws him in a \\"Hole\\" which a lot of other people are consigned to as a prison. Bane spends the next three month destroying Gotham and Murdering anyone he pleases.Somehow in this cesspool Bruce Wayne does a few pushups and gets his health back...escapes and then the fight begins in the last part of this movie.Give me a freakin' break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"My least favorite of all the Batman movies.

Story, actors, visuals, themes - the whole thing is well done. What is not well done, however, is the Ultraviolet digital copy. There appears to actually own the digital copy. Rather, it is stored for you in \\"the cloud\\" by Flixster and the Ultraviolet people, which means that you can only stream the movies, rather than having it downloaded to your computer. And their customer service is awful. Don't buy the Ultraviolet copy. If you want digital, go to iTunes. If you want the Blu-Ray or DVD, get it without the Ultraviolet and save yourself some cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily the worst of the three films.","review":"Having loved the first two I was fully expecting the same from this third installment. But, unfortunately this is one of those films where they are really attempting to outdo the others and make it spectacular. They proceeded to throw in everything but the kitchen sink, but then what the hell they threw that in too. Poor plot, poor story telling; very disappointing. Then to end with Disney's: \\"And they lived happily ever after,\\" was just too much. I wish they had never made this one. It left a bad taste in my mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to do with Batman?","review":"Batman was hardly in this movie. It was confusing and ridiculous.

Yes it is not as good or fast paced as the prequel, but its still pretty good. I only wish they cut down a little on the narrative and made it shorter.

This flick is two hrs. 44 min long and if you ask me it is two hrs. 44 min TOO long. I had to stop it 1/2 way through because I could not find a sharp pencil with which to stab myself in the eyeballs to relieve the tedium. If you have not seen this waste of time count your blessings. If you have and paid $8 at the theater, I think there is a government program that might get your bucks back. However, I eventually did find a knitting needle with which to inflict damage to my brown orbs and did indeed finish watching The Dark Knight through a bloody veil. If forced between watching this movie a second time or death on the rack, I would cheerfully choose the latter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very long and long winded..","review":"I think they could have easily cut this movie by about 1/2 hour and made some drastic changes to the story line. I mean, come on, the bad guy is going to exact his revenge on Batman by making Gotham suffer for months and then right when he is going to destroy Gotham is thwarted by some last minute BS.I understand that this is sort of the story of Batman, long drawn out plots, but this takes the cake.I enjoyed the 2nd movie the best, the first one was pretty good, but this one sucked and sucked and sucked and then sucked some more (I needed four 'sucks' to emphasize the fact that this movie seemingly never ends)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basically a waste of a few hours","review":"Enjoyed a few parts, but overall a weak film.

This movie however, was way too slow for me. Too much back-story and not enough action.And with all the back-story, there were still some elements that weren't explained at all.Over all, not a movie I would want to see again."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOR-ING","review":"I've been a huge Batman fan for years and was really looking forward to seeing this film. Unfortunately this was the most boring film I have seen in a while. The scenes are really drawn out and I feel like the script could have been written a lot better. Wasn't really feeling Anne Hathaway as Cat woman at all either. She has about as much acting skills as that girl who does the T-mobile commercials and I felt she brought the movie down tremendously. Saddened to say that this film did not meet my expectations... at all. Disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignoring the UltraVoilet issue, this is a good, not great, finish to the trilogy","review":"Batman Begins and The Dark Knight are both better than The Dark Knight Rises, but few movie series hold this level of quality all the way through. Look how strong the Matrix started and then fell way off. Star Wars, Star Trek, and so many others did not deliver great movies all through their series. Lord Of The Rings is as close as it gets for a great trio, but even it is flawed. I feel like some are putting the bar extra high after how impressive The Dark Knight did. The Dark Knight Rises is a good film. The biggest disappointment is how predictable the finish was, which is not very Nolan like. For such a Maverick film maker, this final installment just did not have that original spin Nolan films often have.Bottom line, if you love the first two, this is worth getting. If you thought the first two were okay, then this is a rental at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"Loved this movie.. My wife and I liked the the entire series. This was a very fitting end. I do hope they don't make more. To many times a good series will get beat to death.

This one teased my interest trite interest in the dark movies, which I rarely watch.

Quality is superb for both sound and video. What I liked about this movie is that it was a different direction then the prior movies and made for keeping you on the edge of your seat. The only thing I don't like about this series is Christian Bale's Batman voice.

I HATE the digital copy-of lack there of.We bought this version for the digital copy (we don't have blu-ray, but it was the only version with a DC), but we can't access it. AT ALL. First, ultraviolet does not let you go through itunes unless you have a specific code, which they do not give you. ok, fine so i have to go through a different app that i have to download and do a bunch of other things with. Ok fine, did that. when we entered the digital code in the flickster app, as directed, the code said it had already been used. mind you we bought this BRAND NEW from amazon. and UltraViolet has the WORST customer service.

Terrible editing that lead to plot confusion and a far inferior film.I am tempted to buy the DVD but am now very concerned about Unbox movies and their editing"},{"rating":"2","title":"All I Can Say Is...WOW","review":"Just came from the movie theater and couldn't wait to speak on this epic movie. I won't give any spoilers but I will say what I have to say about this film. Christopher Nolan gave the best end to any movie trilogy by introducing the perfect evil entitity for Batman to face off with, Bane. Bane is pure evil and that's all he is. You felt real horrow when he spoke, when his plans come to fluition, and when he gives you his eyes. Ann Hathaway played Catman flawlessly and stole the show in her scenes. Dark Knight Rises plays on all emotions when watching it. It's dark, gritty, and comes together masterfully. I was almost to tears and can't wait to add this to my blu-ray collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing movie to an amazing first perfect trilogy","review":"The Dark Knight Rises was absolutely amazing, brutally epic, PERFECT ending to the trilogy, the first perfect trilogy! It wrapped all the plots from the first two films. Everyone was terrific in it, Bale was great as usual, Hardy as Bane was a monster and even Anne Hathaway was great as Catwoman. Michael Caine was so emotional as Alfred, I want to give him a hug. There's so much I want to talk about it, but I won't spoil it. There were a couple of things I'm really happy that it DID happen. You HAVE to see it in the theater. I'm going again in a few days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"A little long, but definitely interesting and action packed.

There was one survivor whom I believed was playing dead, that was cool and smart thinking; but let us not forget the victims who did not make it out alive, for we are truly sorry for the loss of lives in that one single night.I am not exactly a Canadian, I am from London England. Doesn't matter, quite honestly, I was pretty darn scared myself if I went to see the movie on opening night, so I just told my friends and sibling that I was scared myself, knowing that The Dark Knight Rises was truly a masterpiece, last one in the trilogy and not to be missed.

The lighting in the movie was so dark I often had trouble seeing what was going on, which pretty much defeats the purpose. Also, Tom Hardy's Bane needed subtitles much of the movie, which made watching a chore instead of entertaining.

Character development?","review":"The plot was thin, choppy and poorly constructed. The storyline broke off into tangents and was hard to follow. Little to no character development (save Joe Levitt \\"Robin\\" who was BY FAR the most interesting character). Anne Hathaway was a passive little princess of a Catwoman and left me missing Michelle Pfeiffer who even in her 50's would have played a still better seductress! What's Bane's story? Surely deeper than the puddle of a storyline they presented for him which ended up being the films most interesting twist thus only raising more questions to his character in general. Lastly, the fight choreography was weak. For the trilogy having started on a solid formal combat training basis I found the hand to hand fighting scenes lacking, staged and as cheesey as 1960's Batman minus Adam West and onomatopoeia graphics. 2 hrs and 45 mins for what?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent film","review":"Possibly the best of the franchise! Christian Bale is an excellent Batman and Anne Hathaway a superb Catwoman.

Batman!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The end of the Legacy","review":"It was a very good movie great special effects and good fight sequences. However, it leaves a big gap between the last movie. It leaves the viewer bewildered as to what is actually going on for the first 30 minutes of the film. Then it seems like it goes back to the first movie and it's self discovery all over again. Parts of the film actually seem to come straight out of Watchmen and it seemed almost like I was watching Night Owl and not Batman. In my opinion it just seems like the director built up a huge climax in the second film only to have it quickly fall into a disorderly finale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"at 2 hours and 44 minutes this is a long movie but it keeps you interested the whole time!

I can not wait for the in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I honestly don't know why this movie is so popular. The story was weak (lets stick batman in jail so he can break out in a spectacular way?) and the villain was ho-hum (we didn't get to destroy gotham in the first movie, so lets try again- but harder this time.) Where did Bane even come from anyway? Why does he have it in for batman? Nothing was explained.This movie had nothing of the intrigue and plot twists of Dark Knight which made that movie so amazing. Obviously it's hard to follow Heath, but they should have spent more time dealing with batman's struggle and physiological growth. Or at least some depth, rather then large scenes of football stadiums blowing up.I'm sorry, but the first two movies blow this one away.

If you want a film carried by 1.Michael Caine 2.Morgan Freeman 3.Gary Oldman and 4.Joseph Gordon-Levitt, then this film is for you. if you want a long drawn-out bad plot that keeps you wondering when the real film will begin and let you out of the hell whole your sitting through of all 165 min, then this film is for you.I can't believe I waited for this film and then sat for 2 hours and 45 minutes of nothing but shallow characters (save for the actors mentioned above). this isn't a sequel, it's a curse! For anyone with half a mind that has not spent their life dedicated to video games and are so desensitized to anything save things blowing up, yes this film is a curse.

The container itself is nice and has a neat design, but there's no separation between the discs or any distinctive protection except for the outer shell. Basically you just pile/snap them in on eachother which is poor means for maintaining.

It may be offered for half off but unless you get it (at a much higher cost) that same day you will be out half of what you paid for! Lame!And what is this shift to only put extras on Blue-Ray? I'm sorry that I can't afford the fancy HD, but that doesn't mean I don't want to see the extras as well. Once again I'll just get in line to rent it from the library. Or off Red Box.

And what is up with that ridiculous mask on the bad guy? And the forced, old-man-sounding voice that dubs in his speech? WTF? With a gimmick like the mask, there needs to be a pay-off; I kept waiting for an \\"unmasking\\" to reveal all the hideous deformities it was purported to hide. The final big, over-the-top confrontation between Batman and the bad guy looked promising for just such a reveal, but, alas, it never materialized. I found my mind wandering constantly in boredom, despite the explosions meant to entertain. Sophomoric, adolescent tripe is my ultimate rating of this waste of time and resources.

I'm a reptile/amphibian enthusiast as well so I didn't hesitate before purchasing these. They are both playful and stylish; can't go wrong with that. I am a size 7.5 (sometimes 8) so I was hesitant about what size I should get. Amazon didn't have a 7.5 or 8 so I went ahead and bought a size 7. They fit me great.

First, there's the logistical problems. So much of the footage is poor and so badly-cut together that me and my husband, both punk fanatics, wanted to turn it off out of frustration at how jumpy and un-followable the narrative was. Second is the truly unforgivable part and that's the incomprehensible leaving out of so many pertinent bands and events.

The Gen X footage is not synched with the song, The Slits can barely play their instruments, and most of the interviews are brief and (to my american ears)unintelligeable.

The sound was essentially the rebirth of garage style R&R; to come from Detroit's infamous underground music scene. Along with the Gories this is the band that paved the way for the Go, the White Stripes, the Detroit Cobras and a number of other loud, greasy, not pretty groups.The songs on this CD are comprised of material released starting in the early 90's, with Bum Ticker and Scabby being their first recording around 1993, while the track Queen Cobra appeared on the 1997 sound track to the Traci Lords garage rock movie classic Full Blast.No collection of Detroit garage rock is complete without this recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating excursion into second person narritave","review":"The entire book is written as one side of a dialog; there are few surprises (he telegraphs the ending by the first quarter of the book) but it is so well written that you don't mind.

I say \\"shortness\\" instead of \\"brevity\\" because there is nothing brief about this tedious, dull, and longwinded book. This book is remarkably dull, painfully dull. Dull, dull, dull. Nothing in this book grabbed my interest or engaged my intellect.To be honest, the story that Pears created had potential. However, the telling of the story is remarkably ineffectual. The book is a monologue spoken by a painter to his subject. The whole story is framed through one dull voice. Reading this book is like listening to your hair dresser drone on for hours upon hours. Actually, most hair dressers are far more interesting.This book is unworthy of the author who wrote \\"An Instance of the Fingerpost.\\" If you value your money or your time, stay far away from this book.YAWN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Call Me Superficial","review":"This is a deep and complex book.

His AN INSTANCE OF THE FINGERPOST captivated me some years ago and his art history mysteries are a fun, light read. But I had never read THE PORTRAIT until now. It is unlike his other works, as it is a short (211 small pages) dramatic monologue, with everything you read narrated by and from the viewpoint of painter Henry MacAlpine, who directs his words to art critic William Nasmyth, as the latter sits for a portrait. Theirs is a long relationship, revealed through the painter's words, and the book's ending is not to be missed. This type of dramatic monologue has intrigued me since my high school reading of Robert Browning's poem MY LAST DUCHESS. The same feeling of mystery and menace is here in Pears' prose. It's a short, worthwhile read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, awful, awful","review":"I'm sorry - I absolutely loved \\"Instance\\" and was hoping for something of comparable caliber. Instead I found myself dreading the time I would waste slogging through it. Sort of the way I felt about Michael Chabon's \\"The Final Solution\\" when half-way through I realized that that's all there is and what a shame to waste the energy writing even a novella on so flimsy a framwork.Lewis Libby's \\"The Apprentice\\" is a better rendition of the \\"slender little mystery elevated towards art\\" genre which isn't really saying all that much.Spend your time reading \\"An Instance of the Fingerpost\\" twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Reference","review":"I am glad that out-of-print books are so readily available through Amazon book dealers.

Atlantic Jazz: Fusion takes the easy route however and presents us with examples of what gave fusion a bad name. Endless riffing and little substance that does justice to neither rock or jazz. Fusion destroyed jazz by burying it in half baked stereotypes and as a result jazz jumped back to hard bop revisionism. Joe Henderson, Woody Shaw and Donald Byrd and countless other musicians at the time successfully added electric aspects to their music without detracting from its substance (at least at first). This compilation though is heavy on the name dropping and light on the musical integrity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Worked perfect for a week then inconsistant from there on.

Try Nick Lachey's solo CDs instead for the true sound of 98 Degrees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice To Look At But No Voice","review":"I used to enjoy listening to 98 Degrees back in their heyday and always thought Nick and Jeff were great (vocally) together, Sadly Jeff's solo endeavor is so bad that it was released twice and with the same resounding thud. The songs are uninspiring and he clearly needs to find a new style. Of course I hope that he does not go the way of JC Chasez's Schizophrenic mess. I think Jeff has a pleasant voice but he needs to probably use those good looks for modeling or acting. Sorry Jeff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a huge 98 Degree fan and this was TERRIBLE!","review":"I'm sorry to say but this album was terrible. I was so excited to find out about Jeff Timmons solo cd since I was always a fan of 98 Degrees. I really thought this cd would be good. It's not. His voice is thin and limited and he falls flat on a lot of the songs. the songs are boring boring boring. There is not one song on here that I could recommend listening too. The ballads almost put me to sleep and the uptempo songs are plagued with cheesy production. Go back and listen to your 98 Degrees albums, or even go listen to Nick Lacheys not nearly as dreadful album. I wish I could find something nice to say about this album, but it really was terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alasdair Mac Colla","review":"Stevenson looks at the history of the Gaelic fringe of Ireland and Scotland in the seventeenth century with a refreshingly unromantic eye. Gone are the quaint stories of Highland laddies, and villanous Cromwellians. Stevenson's \\"Highland Warrior\\" is thick with intrigue. Alasdair Mac Colla emerges from these pages looking super-human, but certainly not heroic in the conventional sense. However, in the fallen world of the seventeenth century, Mac Colla and his sidekick Manus Ruadh O'Cahan may be the closest one might ever get to heroic figures. They are, at least, extremely interesting individuals. This is a magnificent book, and it is a must read for any student of Irish or Scottish history."},{"rating":"1","title":"This DOES have msg!","review":"Autolyzed Yeast Extract is listed in the ingredients - that is another name for MSG.

I thought that this book would offer not only guidance and insight pertaining to the philosophy of simplifying, I thought it would offer useful, practical advice. It offers neither. It spends more time telling you that life is complicated without delving into how you can actually simplify it. I already know its complicated! Furthermore, the book is rife with sentences like this; \\"State-of-the-art washing machines and dryers are readily available.

For example, to simplify the washroom, he suggests hanging a shower caddy, installing non-slip flooring, etc. For the bedroom, adding drawer dividers, using a nightstand, hanging up your clean clothes, etc. - Come on, these are all suggestions from a 1950 Ladies' Home Journal. I wish I could find more positive things to say, as I understand how difficult it is write a book at all, but I cannot honestly say that I got anything positive from Mr. Davidson's book.

Buyer beware - read the sample first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complicated","review":"I've been reading a few books on how to scale back and simplify life and this was one book that was recommended to me. I was disappointed with a lot of his advice. He referred to a lot of other author's ideas as 'absurd advice'. He thought it was absurd for women to scale back their wardrobe to just a few items. For me, I think it makes perfect sense no matter what type of job you have. Have you seen a man's closet? They can get away with it... yet he thinks women can't.Even something as simple as choosing to not make the bed he thinks is silly. If not making your bed will make things simpler for you, then don't. It's a personal choice and for some people it can be a stressful thing. Just think of it as airing out the sheets.If you want to simplify your life, don't read his book.

For this gig, they were not opening for another band, but it was their own show. And it was a big show. 80,000 people big to be exact. It was powerful and moving to be attending a U2 gig in their hometown with their \\"tribe.\\" It was a concert that got imprinted in my heart. So, I was in disbelief when I saw this DVD. I almost cried at the record store (no joke). After watching it again, the charisma, the enthusiasm, the love all come rushing back. Even if you didn't attend, you will most probably get chills down your spine. I've been to many U2 shows, but this one, certainly is one of the best. And of course, this show happend only 10 days before 9/11. The concert is still wonderful to watch, but it also transposed me back to the blissful time right before the world changed drastically.

They are \\"home\\" in this video and like no other rock band in the world U2's message is seen and heard vividly.The entire band seems so happy and in perfect harmony.And to think this was only about a week before 9/11. That makes it only more precious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great concert!!","review":"If you are any kind of U2 fan, you need to pick up this DVD ASAP!! The show is unbelievable. You can tell that Bono and the boys are having fun playing in front of their home crowd, it shows in their performance.

What sets him apart from other writers in the genre how he makes the characters more \\"alive\\".

Fairly faithful to the book, it has great performances from all and is well made. I'm very surprised its not better known. Its really a good film.Rourke is in fine form as the former IRA hitman. Everything from his accent to his acting is super. This is one of his best performances ever. The film also features a young Liam Neeson in a short but memorable role. Alan Bates and Bob Hoskins are both superb as well.To cut a long story short, if you like action thrillers with a good story, watch this film.Oh and Bill Conti's score to the film is good.

They are powerful, colorful and tasty. As the title 'Sentimental Journey' implies, we're given Lionel Hampton & Orchestra versions of classic standards. And we're blessed with the smooth and lovely vocals of Sylvia Bennett. Made in 1985, the album credits Lionel Hampton for playing not only the vibraphone but also the Yamaha DX-7 (for what? a vibraphone sound? sounds great, though). If you mainly only like Lionel's solo playing, you may not appreciate the big band focus of Lionel Hampton & Orchestra recordings.

Sad to say, but after 3 hours with HP tech support one day and 4-1/2 hours the next, it just wouldn't work. We could not load the printer driver due to a set-up error message that insisted my laptop did not have Explorer 5 or better. It's a brand new laptop with Explorer 7. So either the software is not a match with the Vista operating system or 2 printers and 2 laptops are defective - doubtful.

The tech support people (the 6th group I spoke to) said it was \\"faulty drivers\\". 5 weeks later the problem returned. When I called to get a product return number I was told that it was too late to return the item. I then called customer service who told me that the warranty had expired (false). The offshore customer support techs were basically automons who could not speak English. Unless your time has no value this customer support is WORTHLESS.

From Stephen Pearcy's sleazy vocal style to those catchy choruses, this is a great CD. It is also very underrated (Why are all the good CD's underrated?), always cast in the shadow of 'Out Of The Cellar' and 'Invasion Of Your Privacy', which are both strong albums, but not so much better than this.

Her stories are about families, the home, marriage, infidelity, relationships. She illustrates the fragility of human relationships and of love. She has the ability to make her characters absolutely real and her stories engaging and unforgettable. Her stories reveal her to be a keen observer of people, their flaws as well as their good qualities.Someone at a Distance (Persephone Classics)and 'The Priory' share a common theme: how inevitably and uncontrollably minor indiscretions can have the capacity to ruin marriages, childhood innocence, families, lives. And how through pride we often choose suffering over happiness. Both also illustrate how human suffering can be meaningful, and how often it is only through enduring unbearable suffering that happiness can be achieved.

Some error in the software that comes with the machine. Now that it's \\"working\\", it continuously misfeeds, and eats up printer ink like crazy! Actually, it shows that there is about 1/3 ink left in the cartridges, but it will not print until you replace the cartridge. I have never had any printer go through ink like this thing.

I called HP and they immediately sent me a replacement unit. I THOUGHT it was simple a good support policy, but what they did NOT reveal was the replacement was due to the fact these printers almost always fail, due to defective parts and engineering.

I also have the same yellow/black printhead problem - straight out of the box and it failed to work. I have bought my last HP product. You can fix the problem by first shaking and tapping the dud yellow/black printhead and then, repeatedly in my case, cleaning the printheads using the HP utility kit that comes on the CD (it should automatically install). Three times I cleaned the printheads going through levels 1 to 3 each time. It is a great way to waste expensive ink. HP agreed to send me a replacement printhead, which was no concession since the priner is less than a month old, but after nearly four hours messing around and putting through two calls to HP support, I was exasperated. Truly this model is to be avoided. If it was a car, it would be subject to immediate recall. There was a time when HP was the gold standard in printers. No more it seems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paper Feeding Problems - Stay Away!","review":"I was attracted to this printer by its speed, and the fact that a duplexer can be added.The first disappointment came when, after less than 150 pages printed, the black toner began running low. During setup, the print head alignment process uses a RIDICULOUS amount of ink, so that may have contributed to it.But the main problem was that, using regular Staples-brand 24-lb. paper, this printer constantly misfed. Two, three, up to SIX sheets would get pulled out of the tray at once, resulting in very inconsistent printing to say the least.Stay away from this printer. Don't be fooled by the speed and slick design. If you can't print more than 10 pages without a misfeed, then what's the point?"},{"rating":"1","title":"would have been great if it worked","review":"I am on my fourth warranty replacement. I chose this printer because it had the following features: available additional paper trays, duplexing, wireless, and networking. The print quality is excellent but three printheads have failed on me (always the yellow / black one) and the paper feeding from the additional tray is not very reliable. I would LOVE to believe in the product but I just can't. I know this is not a very technical review but 20+ hours total spent on the phone with HP customer support and countless instances of them sending the wrong item (magenta blue printhead instead, sending the printer but not the heads, etc.) have me beat! Good luck to anybody who purchases one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away","review":"I thought I got a good deal by paying 79$ new...wrong!

First the black color came out only in stripes, then disappeared completely. Like a fool, I spent $35+ to buy a new black ink cartridge (which won't fit a better printer), only to find that the real problem was internal and could not be fixed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware","review":"This printer is fast and gives good quality printing when it works. It has very serious paper feeding issues. It it is very prone to jams and even more to double feeds.

Reliable, not superb print quality like a good Epson, but fast. Unfortunately, the paper feeding device of this HP is clumsy and apparently pretty backward. I have more misfeeds than I used to have on earlier printers. The paper feed is not easy to use nor to change for sizes other than letter size. The ink disappears pretty quickly as well. So whatever I have made up on speed, I lose having to rerun documents to get them to print each page on only one sheet of paper. What has happened that we cannot even produce a better printer than what we used to have? I will probably not buy another HP printer after this."},{"rating":"1","title":"One to avoid at any cost","review":"I've been using this printer for nearly a year. It worked pretty well for the first 6 months, but went downhill after that.The upper feed tray still works pretty well with 8.5x11 paper, but the lower tray will not feed without assistance, and 30% of the time ends in a jam and ink soaked mess.Even after firmware upgrades and cleaning everything I can reach without resorting to hand tools for disassembly, it is still a terrible machine. Time to trash this unit and try again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware, Major Rip Off","review":"This printer receives zero stars. The ink door cover was broken right out of the box. The replacement printer was no better. All of a sudden, it stopped printing black. Thinking the black ink was low, I purchased a new cartridge. It still didn't print in black. Thinking the cartridge I purchased was a defect I bought another one. It still doesn't print black. The printer goes in the trash, where it belongs. Does anyone need any ink?"},{"rating":"1","title":"the pirinter did not do screen prints total waste of money","review":"I gave the printer away as the person that sold it to me would not return my phone calls and the printer would not do print screeen shots"},{"rating":"1","title":"this printer is a total lemon","review":"From day one of owning this printer I knew I had made a big mistake. A) It is very loud. B) It consumes a lot of time making noise calibrating something, testing something, spitting out pages that aren't printed. C) When you run any of the self diagnostics, it consumes a lot of paper, ink, and time. D) The inks are expensive. E) The printheads are expensive (and why do you need to replace them? - the printheads of all my Epson printers never need any replacement). The only good thing to say is the machine's print quality, but that doesn't make up for all the time and money wasted. This printer is so poorly designed, it convinced me to never buy a HP product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets better with every year","review":"Very good collection of music for your pleasure. The mixes are of very good techno/dance/club styles and should be very enjoyable for a clubber or anyone who likes the lable. although MoS tends to repeat their music selections throughout their numerous CD's this particular set is quite different and rises above the rest in its different themes and sounds.

Picked it up at the Virgin store by mistake, thought it was the Aussy import version (same cover design as last year but no gold color) but turns out, it was the US version. The tracks are less, the selection is poor, and the mixing was mediocre. My initial investment went straight down to the drain. It seems every MOS album that are targeted towards the U.S. market is always worse than the UK ones. If the 3 disc set UK version of The Annual 2004 is as bad as some reviewers said, then this one is a total trash worthy, in other words, worst of the worst. I am going to put it on eBay and hope I'll get some money back. I am not even going to make a MP3 copy of it, it's that bad. If you take your hard earned money seriously, don't spend it on this album. Or buy it at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really sure","review":"Some stuff is pretty good, but some stuff you just shake your head at.This CD has 22 tracks TOTAL. The Ministry of Sound Annual 2004 on the MoS website has 3 cd's. 21 Tracks per cd. 63 tracks vs. 22. And the majority of songs on this compilation AREN'T on the Annual on the website... funny. Maybe Ultra Records gets to make their own Annual under the MoS name.I am dissapointed with this cd however. Yeah it has some good tracks, but the rest are mediocre at best.

This is not a \\"how-to\\" video. Watch and learn. During his \\"interviews\\" with River Phoenix, Flea rambles about how he got into playing the bass and his personal philosophies. I think this was filmed shortly before River's death, and I think it shows just how bad his drug problem was. He and Flea look pretty wasted. The interview is more like a late night conversation you have with a buddy after a long night of drinking or whatever.It's pretty fun and energizing musically, and I found the interviews pretty hilarious. It's kind of like Cheech and Chong do the bass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for improvement...","review":"This DVD is not an instructional DVD. You won't learn anything with it. There is few tabs of riffs that Flea is playing in it, but they realy are no use...This DVD is fun if you would like to see Flea when he was younger and if you like this guy. This inverviewer is boring and looks like he will fall asleep any minute...If you want to improve your playing, purchase something else. If you wan't to have a good laugh and look some cool jamming that you won't learn to play, this might be for you..."},{"rating":"1","title":"More philosophy than bass instruction","review":"This DVD is primarily Flea's philosophy on music, love, life, etc. I would consider it more inspirational than instructional. Definately belongs under the philosophy section and not the music instruction section. The few moments of instruction are fairly basic -- thumping, slapping, plucking. All right-hand technique. Flea admits that he can't read music, tabs, etc. So he doesn't really speak to any fretting technique. In fact, he sums up his entire left-hand technique as \\"pressing his fingers down on the strings\\". You might love this DVD if you're interested in Flea, the musician. You'll be disappointed if you're looking for some significant bass instruction. Instead, I would highly recommend Victor Wooten's Live at Bass Day 1998."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full Pull","review":"This book showed many pictures when it explained the history of the sport.

But 'The Buffalo Tree' is tremendous because his powerful writing is at the service of a story and characters more humane and thoughtful than most writers could make possible. Like 'The Catcher in the Rye', I'd also suggest that Rapp's novel shouldn't be restricted to the Young Adult category, although it does credit to the genre; everyone can appreciate this kind of nuanced, compassionate perception. I certainly think he's a more powerful writer than most \\"literary\\" (ie. adult) writers of his generation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Buffalo Tree","review":"The book is narrated by Sura, a 13 year old boys who is in hamstock, a juvenile detetion center. The book had some great lessons about life such as that friendship will never die and you should never give it up. It has alot of painful things such as when Sura found the squirrel tail buried in the ground, because it belonged to Coly Jo's, his friend. It also had some action such as when Sura was shadowing the guard and he almost got caught by the gaurd. The story was kind of hard to understand because of all of the slang invovled. It had alot of funny parts in the story too, such as when Sura was talking about Nurse Rushing and how Sura was making fun of Boo, Hodge, and Dean Petty. This book had alot of profanity and some were funny and others weren't. This book had alot of depressing moments too, like when Coly Jo was put in the stink hole. Coly Jo was a great friend to Sura. I really enjoyed this story and I would recommend this book to any teenager to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Buffalo Tree","review":"The Buffalo Tree is about kids who were sent to juvenile hall (Hamstock). There was a kid Sura who was 13 years old and Coly Jo who was 12 years old. This book taught me a lot about juvenile detention centers. There you are treated with no respect. There are no doors on the rooms that they sleep in. There are many slang words you need to learn. The problem in this book is trying to stay alive which is hard because no one cares for you. There were a lot of instances of intimidation especially to inmates. Coly Jo was sent to the stink hole. It is where you go for doing something very bad while you are there. It is a small dark room,there is one bed and a bucket for a toilet. Coly Jowas Sura's roommate. Sura was planing to run away with Coly Jo until something interfered. This was a very powerful book about kids getting in trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"buffaloing","review":"The book is a very boring book. But it has some scenes that are very interesting such as when the guys were in the shower and Boo and Hodge stabbed Demetrius Gord with a pencil. This book shows what happens when you go to juvy hall where you get treated like a prisoner. The boys have no freedom to do what they want or have fun. Some of the characters who were in the story such as Boo, Hodge, Long Neck and Coly Jo were very well played in the scenes that the author put them in. At the end of the story something very bad happens to a main character. I would recommend this book to people who like depressing stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"This band is really good","review":"I've never really listened to JApanese rock, but lately I've been goinf for international music: Sigur Dos, Madness, The Mars Volta, and basically anything that's in another language.

The colors pop, there are lots of fun pictures to look at, and the caterpillars are fun to touch. My son, who is not yet 1 1/2, loves it. The only problem I have is the final spread, which is a pop-up page featuring butterflies. My son adores the butterflies and wants to see the final page as much as possible. He does make a special effort to be gentle with the butterflies, but they're pretty fragile. One has a bent wing now, and the wing sometimes catches on the other butterflies when we try to close the book. Other than that, though, I have no complaints. These wriggly, wiggly caterpillars are definitely welcome in our home!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating paintings","review":"Even without reading the descriptions that accompany each painting, you can see a story within the picture.

The arrangements on both albums are fantastic - accompanying instruments are naturally blended into Carla's guitar and vocal lines; you are getting a truly harmonic experience here.I was introduced to Carla's music in 2003 by a friend from France, and Quelqu'un M'a Dit (her first album) just would not leave my car stereo for almost a month. I remember that at the time it reminded me of Norah Jones' \\"Don't know why\\". It was very difficult to find Carla's albums in US at the time, so you guys are lucky you can simply order them from Amazon US! I would highly recommend \\"No Promises\\" (and the first one, of course)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely monotonous","review":"Watching a movie, I felt in love with one of the songs. I did some research and the song was Quelqu'un M'a Dit, from Cara Bruni's debut disc by the same name. I rush and bought it, and I was not a bit disappointed. Besides having great looks, Ms. Bruni has a beautiful voice, the guitar arrays were quite decent, and the melancholic tone was lovable.When I heard she had released a disk in English, I was eager to hear it... and as soon as I did I was terribly disappointed. This disk is absolutely monotonous. She basically took one guitar array, and adapted it to several different poems. The lyrics, yeah, they are nice... but they are not original. She still has that voice of a goddess, but I don't feel the disk is actually worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mais oui, c'ets horrible","review":"OK, so she has taken poems by some of the greatest English poets and writers and shows some taste in literature but not in music.

It starts out talking about the the first shaw movies and lau kar-leung, and also the origins of kung fu(briefly), women in the 20's making these movies, and of course kwan tak-hing. The only thing that I really had a problem with is that they just passed over the jimmy wang yu, lo lieh, chen kwan tai, hwang jang lee, etc. I don;t think it even mentions the venoms!! They show some good clips from one armed swordsman, but even though they show their dramatic scene, they don't even mention jimmy or lie's name.

They really made Vicky treat them better in the end. I think it is an eye opener to those who are mean to their things. But it can be scary to read, but knowing it's fiction makes it worthwhile!!

Bringing aboard annoying yelper Brian Howe, formerly of Ted Nugent, Howe didn't bring back any old Nugent fans on Ted's Penatrator, and he's not going to make any old Bad Company fans return for Fame and Fortune.

It's interesting to read about this earlier perspective of the Dalai Lama's family members. Thubten Jigme Norbu learned of his brother's discovery as the Dalai Lama, and of his flight from Tibet to India from a distance. He mentions that because of the great differences in age, and the distance between their home and the monasteries where they were installed, the first time he and all his brothers ever sat down to dinner together was after the Chinese occupation. I really enjoyed reading about the little details of his early life, and the great amount of emotion in his story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits 2 adults & 1 child","review":"This boat is smaller than we thought.

I reread this book about once a year just for the pleasure of it, and I snapped up this hardcover when it came out. If you like alternate history and fantasy, and don't mind them mixed together, read this book. If you just want to read about people living in Elizabethan England, read this book. And if you just have to have any book with Shakespeare as a character... you, too, have some reading ahead of you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Concerto - great interpretation.","review":"I recently bought this because I had not yet heard the Violin Conceto Op. 35 in D major, Souvenir d'un lieu cher Op. 42, Serenade melancholique Op. 26, and Valse - Scherzo Op. 34.

Their musical abilities are unquestionable; their creativity oustanding; their themes: at times playful, at times macabre, and probably offensive to some. Their can be consider pansexual; as there are subtle homosexual undertones and some of their songs clearly address violent pedophilia, not necessarily as perpetrators but more likely as social critics; as they invoke other themes, in lyrics and customes, they note other social ills.

Yeah, maybe in my teens, but not now.I've heard a Rammstein song or two in passing but was not really familiar with their work so thought I would pick up this DVD. As I said, I am trying to learn the language and I collect a lot of music videos, so why not?I was impressed. I like their style of music. It is hard pounding, aggressive rock with a good beat and some unique instrumentals. The videos, while violent (not normal for me), are artistic and well done.

Just one thing I would add; Take everywhere it says LSD and replace it with Amanita muscaria (Which was the real entheogen this manual is experientially based upon). Then you have it! Keep in mind that NONE of the world's religions tell the whole truth, and this includes Tibetan Buddhism. All Patriarcal religions have severe problems and you should know what those problems (false dogmas) are before experimenting. The discovery that this book is not necessarily a book for the dead but a book to map the consciousness of those experiencing the Shamanistic 'Death Experience' is crucial to humanity's understanding of Tibetan Buddhism and other world religion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little gem; don't miss it!","review":"Quite simply, there is no one with a better ear for women's voices in medieval texts than Elisabeth van Houts.

Growing up in the deep south, I could identify with Jim Price character played by Jim Brown. The overall theme throughout the movie was just a guy trying to do his job in a hostile environment with little or no help. The background music was a bit too \\"folksy\\" for me, but the acting is top-notch by Jim Brown, George Kennedy, and Fredrick March. Listening to March trying to do a southern accent was hilarious. I recorded this movie off my local television station back in the 90's. I was glad to find it was on DVD. The DVD transfer was a good as it could be for a 40+ year old movie. I thought this movie was not as good as \\"In The Heat Of The Night\\" with Rod Steiger and Sidney Poitier, but very well done in any case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"I first saw this film years ago at the movies when it first came out. I loved it then, And i still do. I always have liked George kennedy, And he does a great job as the out going sherrif.

But I was looking for a low carb cookbook and this was on remainder. I was very surprised to find that \\"sugar equivalent sweetener\\" was called for in most of the recipes, even recipes like pork chops. I don't like the taste of fake sugar, so that made the recipes unappealing. Some of the recipes were trivial, such as Baked Chicken Thighs (only thighs and salt), and others were page fillers where the 'recipe' was \\"Chocolate Ricotta Pudding\\" - which simply told you to add chocolate to the Ricotta Pudding recipe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always my favorite actor","review":"I read the book and fell in love with Lawrence Fishburne as a result of watching his performance. This was the first movie that I saw showing the complexities of a Black man.

Bravo Mr. Fishburne for taking this role, making it yours and making my heart sing! Thank you from the bottom of my heart.Anita Jacobson"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful film about the struggle for personal redemption","review":"Strong HBO film based on a Walter Mosley book, featuring a great central performance by Lawrence Fishburne.While it has a some Hollywood moments and touches, this is mostly pretty uncompromised stuff. An ex-conwith an angry temper tries to find meaning for his life in the tough streets of South Central Los Angeles.Uplifting, but not in a trite, easy, or morally simple way.Very different, and more gritty than most of the (often very good) fiction director Michael Apted hasdone before. Well worth a watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laurence Fishbourne in yet another great movie!!!","review":"Dig it...this movie is one that highlights the strengths of a man, and the motives he carries to survive - and teach others to survive in the mean streets of Los Angelas. Others have said that this movie is slow. I think this assessment comes because it is not an action film. It is a movie filled with dialogue that can tap ones spirit, and help you see the world in ways that you have forsaken. This is an important movie, mainly because it depicts the strength and will of a man...which is hardly portrayed in black films. This is a must for anyone who wishes to understand the dilemmas of lives that they are normally not acquainted with. Fishbourne is excellent, as is the supporting cast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laurence Fishburne III first film was 1975's \\"Cornbread, Earl and Me\\"","review":"Some have reported the 'Apocalypse Now' was his first film, but that's erroneous, his first role was that of a small boy that witnessed a police shooting of an innocent man, 'Cornbread' played by former LA Lakers star, Jamal Wilkes.

Mr. Fishburne does not disappoint and delivers, big time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an EXCELLENT movie!","review":"Lawrence Fishburne plays a diamond in the rough - a true hero, and a hero does not have to die. He's a the kind of man a woman would be honored to have, a man would respect as a friend, a boy could look to for direction and guidence, a neighbor would welcome next door and an employer would consider a valued employee, if given a chance.

And, he presently lives out his days in California, in a small one bedroom apartment. He persistently seeks out a daliy living collecting cans. Hardly being able to afford basic amenities, he [told untruths] to get a job. Yet, he had many friends, and tried very hard to be a good citizen. His dreams and memories haunted him, but they never caused him to loose his sanity or to return to a life of crime. His philosophy of life is astounding: In the movie (He)fought against poverty, age descrimination, domestic violence, prostitution, [ending life], juvenile delinquency, and social resentment....This movie is a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Show this One to Prisoners","review":"Anyone who thinks this is a \\"slow\\" movie hasn't shown it to prisoners, the way I have. They love it. They identify with Socrates, understand his nobility. They see that Socrates can tell them something positive about themselves. Socrates knows his anger and how it has caused him to damage others in the past. The flashbacks to his crime are common among violent criminals and his warning never to harm again. Socrates has figured out how to take who he is as he is and make it work for himself and for all the people around him. He's a true hero and a role model for these \\"tough guys,\\" the prisoners--a protector, never again a destroyer. The message I hope the prisoners pick up is about renunciation, retribution, and restitution. We correctional educators don't give up on these men but always have to believe they will find their way as Socrates eventually does.This movie could only have been made by people who have been there and lived it. It is a gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"POWERFUL","review":"Laurence Fishburne delivers one of his best performances. This is a powerful and emotional movie with heartfelt characters. Bill Cobbs also has one of his best performances. The movie shows poverty, human struggle and life on the streets. L. Fishburne plays an ex-con who trys to only do good in life and survive in the ghetto. He has a major effect on everyone around him and wont let the streets bring him down.

The movie starts out very slow and never fully explains the story which is the foundation for the movie. It does have some good \\"smaller\\" stories in the movie for younger children, but I would never show this movie to my children. It portrays the life of a black ex-con trying to make a living and make a diffeence in L.A. Although this may sound like an inspiring movie, it was not. The backlighting of the movie was very dim which made it hard to pay attention. If you like slow movies, then this one is for you.

John H. Griffin was not only a skilled author, but he lived one of the most amazing lives of the 20th century, aptly described by Robert Bonazzi in the book's introduction. Of course, Griffin is well known for dying his skin, posing as a negro, and reporting on his experiences in the book Black Like Me. Amazingly enough, Black Like Me is only one episode in an improbable life. Scattered Shadows covers Griffin's developing blindness, and eventual recovery. Griffin reflects upon music, literature, and religion as his sight departs as a result of a World War II injury. The author has been underappreciated since his death.

But the most amusing of all is \\"Staying Together\\" in which Deb opens the song with a childish check-out-my-attitude speech, in which she's not \\"asking you, she's telling you - they're staying together!\\" Hey, it's cute, but that's ALL it is - Deb's age was her ONLY asset."},{"rating":"1","title":"Singing with a spech impediment","review":"The 80s at its worst! This girl's voice was horrendous! At least Tiffany could sing without a speech impediment. Debbie: \\"Jusshht a foolisshhh beat of my hahhhrtt.\\" Why sshhhhee's shhhuch a shhinging fool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simplicity and pure fun belies Deborah Gibson's genius.","review":"Sure the songs are simple and the themes pedestrian, but it reflects the mindset and lives of many teenagers. Or it may simply be an escape and fantasy for the child prodigy who grew up too fast. Pop songs are meant to be catchy and simple, and the songs of the Beatles were fine examples of such. Gibson oozes sweetness and savvy in her self-penned songs. Longevity is a sign of talent and genius in the unpredictable world of music. Time will tell if Deborah Gibson survives the cynics and fickle fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Pick!","review":"Debbie Gibson's Out of the Blue is an outstanding pick next to Electric Youth. Though I would rate this four stars because four songs I love most on this album. Out of the Blue is a classic song, an outpour of realising what love is without the lover. Foolish beat of my heart is my fav song that shells out emotions through words. Red Hot has the talented voice of Debbie that sways you on high feeling. Shake your love scored to charts and this one's a catchy cheery number. The vocals match so superbly with the Synthesizer pieces and Debbie Gibson lyrics are almost on lips. However, I feel Electric Youth, her second album was just terrific making Out of the Blue slip down to four stars. Neways, enjoy! Its cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"You certainly get what you pay for.","review":"This series is amazing. Possibly one of the best anime the world has to offer.However, the packaging leaves a LOT to be desired. The discs are packaged on a single spindle, back to front. Which means that the digital read side is directly against the graphics on the disc beneath it. If you're not incredibly careful, scratching WILL occur. Also, it's hard to get the discs out of the spindle.You will be pleased with this series (After Story is far better than Clannad), but do yourself a favor and buy a real DVD case. I'm not quite sure what Sentai Filmworks was thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"My New Favorite Anime","review":"This is, as the title suggests, a continuation of the Clannad storyline. The first part of Clannad was funny and heartfelt, the second part is ever better. You instantly develope a bond to the rich character roster and their bonds to one another. This Anime is heavy on the drama, and is hysterically funny at the same time. Can't recommend it enough, even if you're not an Anime freak, you'll like this for the story alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"an amazing anime","review":"clanaad and clanaad after story are 2 of my favorite animes of all time. everything about them is great, the story, the characters. it's got the perfect mix of comedy and drama. it's rare for me to find an anime that can hold my attention the way clanaad and after story have. it's also rare for me to find one that can cause me to get emotional, and this one did, it made me cry near the end. this is definnately and great buy and should be in any anime lovers collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing must watch japans anime!","review":"This my all-time favorite DVD series ever. It will make you cry, it will make you laugh, and it is a heartbreaker and a tear maker! It has English sub on the songs so you can sing along in english or japenese! The opening song goes like \\" the slope that you walked up, was covered in spots of sunlight. I stand here all alone, and think back on all the tender moments. You were the only one, you were the only one that I have loved. The wind obscured my vision and you've gone far away. I will always remember you, even if everything changes, just one thing just one thing. It is something trite but I will show it to you it is full of light, and I'll cherish it forever and ever.The best episodes in my opinion are episode 1, 16, 21, and 22.

This may have been done by the record company as opposed to being a bootleg but it is the responsibility of both Amazon AND the seller to note that this is a cdr in the product description. I don't collect cheap cdrs so this goes straight back for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD must be reissued!","review":"Musically \\"Taking Over\\" was a big leap from \\"Feel The Fire\\", and is easily in the top tier of Overkill albums. Though sadly it wasn't the commercial breakthrough it should of been, and today is a lost and underappreciated classic of Thrash Metal. Being Overkill is a non-member of the Big Four of Thrash (Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax), its quite common for such lesser known bands to have CD's out of print. But its a shame the \\"Taking Over\\" CD is not being made as of today, otherwise I and I'm sure others would be here to buy it. Somebody please bring it back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WRECK YOUR NECK!","review":"This may be Overkill's finest moment. New York thrash at it's very best! Uber-catchy choruses on classics such as \\"Wrecking Crew\\" and \\"Powersurge\\" highlight this great disc. Check out the completely insane neck-breaker, \\"Electro-Violence\\", which has to be my all-time favorite Overkill track. Overkill's style of straight ahead, energetic thrash metal has never sounded better than it does on this classic! A truly fun album to listen to by one of the most underrated bands out there. \\"We're gonna walk all over you, cause we are the Wrecking Crew![.]\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"a true lost thrash classic!","review":"this cd has the pure thrash fury of the days of old with classics of powersurge,wrecking crew,deny the cross,overkill 2 and electroviolence.this cd was still a building point in their career but they come with a second cd that build on the first cds prowes and surpasses it and shows you some new tricks.in the years to come they will stand tall with the thrash giants but never get to the top of the heap but they will make a serious attempt to prove they have the chops with years of decay and horrorscope and wfo!this cd deserves a spot in the books of thrash metals top ten bands!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WE'RE GONNA WALK ALL OVER YOU!!!","review":"First off, let me state that I am in no way, shape, or form, \\"old-school.\\" I was about eight years old when this album came out. Luckily, I had older relatives who turned me on to these types of bands, and I'm very thankful they did. That being said, this album is classic from start to finish. If you are new to Overkill, this is a good start (By the way, you also can't go wrong with their debut \\"Feel the Fire,\\" but I digress...). This band has a huge catalog of music which will most definitely not disappoint. Also, if you find you like this album, you might want to check out a film that was put out by Rat Skates (Overkill's original drummer) entitledBorn in The Basement. It is an outstanding film that covers not only the formation of Overkill, but also how Rat epitomized the \\"DIY\\" philosophy; whether it be the stage layout or promotion. That being said, THRASH OR BE THRASHED!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good as \\"Horrorscope\\"","review":"Every single track on \\"Overkill's\\" sophmore release is outstanding, and shame shame if you dont have this in your collection if you are an Overkill Fan. Even though \\"Horrorscope\\" and \\"The Years of Decay\\" rank up there with fans as being the \\"best\\" Overkill album, \\"Taking Over\\" deserves to be up there as well. \\"Taking Over\\" contains some brutal thrash, and in my mind was the best thrash band of the 1980's. I even liked \\"Overkill's\\" material better then Metallica's. This is a great Metal album for fans of all types of the genere, as it deserves to be called a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"It dispels some of the myths about twins and shows several sets of twins.

I lost the record that came with it but fortunately recorded on a cassette when I first got this over 10 years ago. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic stories of Superman's early years!!!","review":"Superman Archives Volume 1 reprints Superman (first series) issues #1 thru #4 from 1939. These are truly great stories of Superman's early years. In the 1940s, Superman wasn't the all powerful hero that he is today. He was a person who truly believed in the fight for justice and helped anyone who needed it. Back then, he only had certain powers, and he became a vigilante, wanted by the Police!These stories give back the feel of the Depression Era. You really feel that time period through these stories. I bought this book back when it first came out in 1989. I loved it!!! As a die hard Superman fan, I wanted to read Superman's early years, and DC Comics made that possible through this book. The DC Archive Editions have proven to be great revisits of comics' early days. To any fan of early comic book history, or Superman, get this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like action, this is the place.","review":"Superman first appeared in Action Comics. Many of those were reprinted in Superman Magazine. This collects those and other adventures. Action is a very appropriate word for Superman jumps in at any conflict. There is very little sitting around doing nothing. This Superman also thinks. He finds the best solution, then jumps in and does it. What I liked the most is how he helped ordinary people with ordinary problems such as a woman falsely accused of murder, a wife beater, a crooked employer, an arms dealer who starts wars to make money, crooked polititions, children in orphanages, etc. The drawings are simple but full of power and energy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived","review":"This is a vigorous performance of Bach's Cello Suites, but one that sounds rather exaggerated.

As for David Montgomery and the Jena Philharmonic, they are superb. I have never heard better accompaniments in these concertos. The orchestra produces a rich, beautifully textured sound, and is hand in glove with the soloist. The sound engineering is excellent, too, lending a real glow to the proceedings. I'm sorry I can't give this CD the highest rating, since this is earnest playing with real artistry.

You have to take the boot floppy out of the machine and reboot. Once you think you know what to do you must reboot from the floppy. If the problem isn't fixed you start the cycle over again.I ended up buying a copy of Norton Ghost 2000 and it worked perfectly the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Solution for a Simple Job","review":"I needed a proven method of transfering an old drive to a new one. But with a NTFS/W2K disk this wasn't easy. MaxBlast, XXCopy and other free programs don't fully support NTFS. (If your using 95/98 then the software that came with the new drive will probably work fine.) That left me with Norton Ghost or Drive Copy. If all you want to do is clone your disk then Drive Copy is the answer. It's simple, easy and did a perfect clone. I'm sure Norton would do just as well a job and if you want to do a lot of incremental ghosting operations then maybe it is for you. But if all you want to do is move or backup a drive then save $50 and Download Drive copy from Amazon. And I mean Amazon.... No reason to buy the boxed product. But I still don't understand why it takes 14MB to make two floppy disks? Anyone?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Author's Choice","review":"As the author of this book, of course I gave it 5 stars! I was just absolutely flabbergasted to see it listed on Amazon! It is a privately published 12-page spiral-bound soft cover book produced for the 50th reunion of the Lawrenz family. Actually a compilation of individual reminiscences as well as \\"minutes\\" of previous reunions (maintained by the descendents of Bernhard and Pauline Lawrenz), it also gives a brief histoy of Pommern (or Pomerania). If your genealogy includes this Lawrenz family, then from the horse's mouth, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Action Flick!","review":"Bacon does a great job in this pure action flick.

I finally got around to watching it tonight and I'm really glad I didn't rush to see Death Sentence at the theater. Kevin Bacon does a decent job acting, but I didn't find any of the gang members believable at all. John Goodman was wasted and Aisha Tyler, as the cop ally, wasn't needed. The plot was the same old story it always is in these kinds of movies, so I won't say the story was razor thin. I knew that going in.The film was violent and gory, so I give it an extra star for not holding anything back, but this alone couldn't save a weak script.Check out The Brave One (not great, but much more depth than this one) or The Crow (visually stylish) if you want some quality payback flicks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run-on Sentence","review":"I think the film is a waste of good acting. It's all about revenge. And Kevin Bacon's character, Nick, deserves revenge because his son was brutally murdered. But there is gratuitous violence, a lack of basic logic, and a failure to build much interest in the key players.Nick is a corporate executive who somehow (never explained) is also a shockingly effective killing machine, adept at using car doors and seat belts as lethal weapons. He's a master of diverse firearms, although he needs manuals to figure out how they are assembled. He's pretty good with head slams too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Death Sentence...","review":"The acting & action were good in this movie, but it was a bit too violent for my taste.This movie is all about revenge vigilante style, when a parent witnesses a brutal slaying of his eldest son and realizes the justice system may not give the appropriate retribution... So, he takes matters into his own hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bacon vs The Gang","review":"A completely silly movie. Bacon takes on a gang by himself after his son is murdered. The police are no where to be found throughout this film, ya right. A gang allowed to roam free without fear of arrest, ya right. Bacon allowed to roam free and kill gang members, ya right."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did NOT like this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"The first few minutes of this movie had such promise but things went down hill rather quickly after the murder of Kevin Bacon's son. I think it was totally unrealistic with regards to the pursuit of the criminals that killed his son and I really hated when the thugs broke in and shot his wife and surviving son . . . just too dark with no redemption whatever! I would not recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laugh riot","review":"My wife and I were actually laughing near the end of this film. That a nerdy actuary-turned-Rambo commits such errors in judgement, manages to keep his day job, elude the most incompetent cops and fool his clueless wife (Kelly Preston) could almost be believable, but how he manages to leave his hospital bed with a gaping head wound, confess his sins to a dying comatose son in another hospital bed, jump out a hospital window, drive to the bank, withdraw his life savings, buy guns from a bloated, hapless gun pimp, go home and change, read gun owners manuals, drive a car into a van (splitting in half), find the thugs who just killed his wife, kills thugs, and manage to get home to watch home movies, well, you get the point. Should have gone straight to DVD, and to the bargain bins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kevin Bronson?","review":"I liked it better when it was called Death Wish.

It is region B and we are region A.

Although, up to this point, the movie had some insane action sequences, it started to become too much, as in too much caca. I haven't finished the movie but in 10 minutes (I'm at 1:10 min) it's become down right silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"What starts off well....","review":"The movie starts of promising with a seemingly interesting story line but decends into a very trashy B-grade film ending. For all the excellent attempts of Bacon the 2nd half of the movie is totally unrealistic and most of all resembles an Arnold Swarzenegger movie when Bacon jumps out of his hospital bed after having been mortally wounded. He shaves his head, buys a bag of weapons from his targets father (!) and sets off on a wild chase where he manages to outshoot 5-6 hardcore criminals in their own crimeden!Shame it could have been so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it could have been.","review":"Engrossing film. Hard to say if I actually LIKED it though. I wasn't sure I really bought Kevin Bacon as this mild suburban corporate Dad. The film certainly shows how bloodlust and revenge destroy this man and his family. Unfortunately, it also revels in the violence, which makes its message (if it has one) a little complicated. There is a really cool scene in the middle and there is a special feature on the disc that shows you how it was made. That was fun to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment......","review":"I was all hyped to watch this movie in the theater and, to me, it was a let down. The movie is about a good, decent, hard working man called Nick Hume (Kevin Bacon) who looses his eldest son to gang rage. It doesn't end there though--they want more.....Hume could go two ways: forgive or become a man of vengence. Which way to go????I will say that his ultra-impressive performances in \\"The Woodsman\\" and \\"Mystic River\\" are nothing like he shows in this movie. No depth of character for Bacon, which I believe is his bread and butter in the acting field."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promises Much, delivers nearly nothing","review":"Just saw this, and like other Wan films, the Saws included, found it predictable, lacking in what it promises, and in many ways simply a mediocre movie. Bacon is good, Goodman overacts, and everyone else is just pretty much there. The plot is something you've seen 1,000 times, and Wan in no way improves upon it. The transitions were poorly done, and the final sequence is almost laughable, it's so poorly over the top. The use of odd \\"ballads\\" in the soundtrack kinda underscores the fact that Wan is a totally unoriginal filmmaker, barring the plot (NOT the acting or film) of Saw 1. Don't even bother to rent it...OH, and BTW, this is one review area where the \\"reviewers\\" who give away certain key occurrences and the end are actually doing those who haven't seen it a favor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the cops?","review":"Completely unrealistic, this revenge fantasy depends on a belief suspension throughout. The most egregious absurdity is that the cops appear all but invisible while this gang war plays out. They are never around, though they have ample reason to be. Kevin Bacon looks like the lead singer of Slipknot by the time this is done, his head shaved and his face bloodied. Why isn't he arrested when the lead detective initially suspects him of killing the gang member who killed his son? Shooting galore here, and plenty of gore. No redeeming social value whatsoever."},{"rating":"2","title":"What \\"The Punisher\\" Should Have Been","review":"Revenge is perhaps one of the coolest motives there are, and in Death Sentence, Kevin Bacon declares war on New Jersey gangs only to lose everything.Death Sentence is not only both hard and cool to watch, but it carries great emotion (my girlfriend cried) and raises a serious question: in the end, is it worth it?Splendid movie, recommended for anyone in the R-rated movie crowd. Haven't had this much fun with an \\"under the radar\\" movie in a LONG time."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Goodman's Performance","review":"First of all, I am not a fan of violence but I am most definitely a fan of Kevin Bacon and his performance in this movie was nothing short of brilliant. For just a moment, let's overlook the shortcomings of the film and focus on John Goodman's appearance in this movie. It has always been my opinion that actors specializing in comedy actually excel in dramatic roles. An example of this is Robin Williams. (\\"Dead Poet's Society\\" and \\"Awakenings\\" to name a few.)I was mesmerized by John Goodman in this film. The jovial, cherub-like Goodman became evil incarnate before our eyes. If we sift through the imperfections of this film and concentrate on Goodman alone, we will see an Oscar-worthy performance of genius magnitude.In summary, the movie is worth watching for those who adore Kevin Bacon, and those who can appreciate and identify Goodman's unmatched transformation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too shabby","review":"I just finished watching this movie. I have to admit that I actually liked it. It's very dark, but the characters draw you in. I laughed, cried, gasped, and screamed at the TV! I'd recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Embarrassment for Kevin Bacon and John Goodman","review":"Considering the source material, Brian Garfield's 1975 follow-up to his better known Death Wish, this should have been a decent film.It wasn't! Even the presence of Kevin Bacon, John Goodman (essentially a grotesque cameo) and in a much smaller role, Kelly Preston, cannot save it from director James Wan's ineptitude.There's very little logic to the movie, the production values are low rent, and it feels as if it was made some time ago and then finally released in 2007 rather than let the film stock turn into Fritos in a vault somewhere.A truly dreadful movie. Justice remains to be done to author Garfield's interesting and thought-provoking novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"surprised","review":"I was very surprised when I received my Makita jig saw.

However, my child can't get enough of this video, and for the adults it has a lot of (intentional or not) funny moments with the fairy godmothers, the evil villaness, and the would-be hero prince.The animation reminds me of the Care Bears.

Written in a very entertaining yet thoroughly researched style, this book satisfies your interest in unusual stories of after hours pranks and trysts and morbid fascination with death in the Magic Kingdom.

I was in another large bookstore with a very nice coupon and gift card in hand and was able to find two different versions of the same release. One had the tissue thin paper and one had thicker than newspaper in feel and sturdiness! So my advice to everyone who wants this book - if you need a hardier version...go to the local shop and see if they have an edition similar to mine. It's thicker than the other two I saw but it identical in length and edition with the exception of the better paper!

It will enable you to find and deal with the root causes of many of the issues that worry or upset you and to raise your self-esteem.

Some greatest hits albums out there have 3 or 4 recongizable songs and the rest are just fillers. Even if you're not a country fan, you will recongize most of the songs on this CD. This CD is a must have for any Country Music fan and espically for a Terri Clark music fan. The only negative thing about this CD is the last song, a live version of \\"No Fear\\" I love the song, but can't stand this version. Terri's voice sounds like she has an apple in the back of her throat or something.

Jonathon and his brother Aaron share their family farm in Minnesota. Mary and Jonathon are married but childless after 7 years of marriage. Jonathon suggests that his brother father his child, since he is unable to. Although the three of them have lived a happy life on the farm, this idea puts a strain on their relationship. When Jonathan leaves home for a few days to purchase a prize bull, the relationship between Mary and Aaron is ignited and the predictable happens. While at first I found this storyline rather appalling, it does become beliveable. My interest picked up and I read on eagerly to the conclusion. The story held my interest and I would recommend it to other readers. I particularly enjoy Spencers historical and prairie stories and most readers will not be disappointed in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left me wanting more...","review":"When I first started reading this book I wasn't sure I was going to finish it. Come on, a man asking his wife and brother to unite, create a life and feel no emotional attachment? Unreal... But as I pushed myself on the story began to grip me and I was unable to put it down. I love how the Author described the life of the pioneer family. Jonathon had more passion for the earth and his bull then he did for his own wife, and I found myself feeling good that she had found this missing part of her marriage with Aaron. This was my first book by Spencer so I had no idea how these two would be able to finally have a life together. I will be picking up more titles from this Author, Thanks for the good read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all \\"Fulfilling\\"...","review":"I unfortunately picked up this book at a local used book store and it was a waste of 75 cents.

I suppose it didn't suit the writers of United States history to relate to us as children that we spent months getting our asses handed to us by the Germans.This is a really well crafted book. Home Hickam has done an excellent job of reporting the typical ego battles of men in command that caused the delay after delay in protecting the shipping lanes of the Atlantic. He also well stories the bravery of the men who navigated these treacherous waters to keep the war effort going. I am amazed at the detail that every page of this book offers.This is one fine read. Hickam is a marvelous writer, easy to understand, and his tale of the perils of this time in WWII is easy to follow. I highly recommend this book. You will be mesmerized by the tales of the individuals who both lived through and died in this battle arena. I could hardly put the book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good read","review":"I found this at a used bookstore for a dollar and some change.

Even their toll-free support has been discontinued. Are they wrapping up? I was stupid enough to think I do not need extended warranty for a $600 TV.Now, about when it was working - compared to picture on some of the latest HDTV (I have Samsung and Panasonic), it was only average.

Field Tech came to the house (which seemed like a nice feature) told me the LCD Panel needs to be replaced but they need final clearance from AKAI in order to replace TV. Neither AKAI and or their Field Service Team will call back to give me updates, each placing the blame on the other and promising calls back. After 1 month of 3 times/week phone calls to AKAI, they finally tell me to ship back (on my dime) the TV and they will send me a new TV in approx 4-6 wks.Would not recommend......I'm still waiting for the next steps to replace this \\"affordable piece of junk\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give it a 0 out of 5 stars if i could (buy a Vizio instead)","review":"Bought this TV about 6 months ago and was bad from the get go.

Because of that I decided to call Akai's customer service (which is not toll free). They told me that i could return it but i wouldn't get a full refund.

We figured it was because this one was a return, the rep said there was nothing wrong with it, so we gave the benefit of the doubt. We exchanged it for another Akai - same model - and within 2 months the screen went blank and the tv turned itself off. When we turned it on again it would only go on for half a second then go blank again. Thank God for Sams Club where returning/exchanging is easy. We brought it back and this time got a Magnavox.

The sound quality has never been good. A day ago the remote would not turn the set on without multiple tries. The red light would turn green then back to red. Then it quit working so we used the power button on the set. Now that won't work. Unplugging the main power cord works once to at least turn it on. I have been researching the problem online and have found that there are hundreds of customers with the same or similar problems with this set and other Akai TVs. I will not buy their products in the future and will think twice about Samsung also since they are the ones who also produce Akai."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Years and Dead","review":"I purchased an Akai LCT3201AD from Sam's Club a couple years ago and at first, it looked good and sounded good especially for the price.

If you look this model up on the internet, you'll find that this is a problem experienced by a LOT of Akai TV purchasers.

(especially since it has a red-haired queen like me and my daughter :-)) I thought they would be essentially the same, but there are differeces. They dropped several parts off the pink version. The ramp in back is gone, the rail on the bedroom, the attached throne (which I didn't like anyway) one fence piece and two posts are gone. Also the torches don't light up and it comes with a dragon instead of a horse. You'd think it'd be cheaper than the original. I bought mine at Wal-mart for $1 less with TWO BONUS FIGURES though, so if you can find it with the bonus figures (maiden Mary and a horse) it's not a bad deal.

Unlike his slicker later recordings this is a much more primitive set and frankly he should have stuck with this style.

While in some cases Mr. Nickell did appear to do a decent job of researching the selected subjects in some cases I think he let his own opinion take over. I don't require that a book find every, or even any, story to be true but I do want things to be approached in a respectful, thorough manner. In some of these things Nickell does a pretty good job of digging things out, in others he's more of an it doesn't seem likely type and doesn't dig enough for me. He can be pretty rough on his critics and his subjects (most of us would be) maybe even meaner than he says they are. I want an investigative book to look into things with an open careful attitude even if it doesn't give the result I want.

Stay Away!","review":"The problem with Joe Nickell's books are that he assumes that most UFO and paranormal cases are not real.

It is nice to have everything laid out monthly but the 10 chapters are separated by area or type of plants so that you have to look 10 different places to see all the info for that month. The information is straight forward and easy to understand but too basic for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good songs from Sinitta","review":"The songs are good. I actually saw her perform in a Hong Kong nightclub in 1988 and it was a very entertaining show. I bought a bootleg cassette of her songs at the time. I thought she was a regional star since I had not heard of her outside of Asia, but I did a Google Search recently and found out she was from the UK and very successful. I thought she was a very talented artist, she probably falls into the same category as Atomic Kitten and Robbie Williams, not wanted by the U.S. Music Industry. Her songs are a reminder of the dance music era of the 80's and would be great to have in your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Martin Lawrence is my favorite comedian hands down, but man does this 'movie' stink. 'You So Crazy' is 100 times better than this....this....this garbage. Point Blank ...IT'S NOT FUNNY. In all actuality I fell asleep on it. HOW DO YOU FALL ASLEEP DURING STAND UP COMEDY? There were about two parts that I actually laughed at and I don't even remember what they were about. IT truly honestly was a waste of time. I don't even see how dedicated fans could even get a chuckle out of this.IF you want to see some funny Martin Lawrence check out his new movie NATIONAL SECURITY...,now that joint is hilarious, and skip this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"One of the absolute WORST stand up shows I've ever had the misfortune of watching. I was hoping for a few laughs, but what I got was an uneducated sounding napolean complex having ignorant fool giving black people a bad name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure idiot!","review":"the only reason i gave him a 1 star was because there was no 0 star available. Frankly after watching this, I realised Martin Lawrence is the biggest idiot on television.One example. He talked about how sept. 11 brought united the blacks and whites. In his next sentence he talks about how the blacks and whites united to discriminate those who looked arab decent and according to him \\"looked like bin-ladin.\\" he gives an example by saying how he pulled the turban off an indian man.wow. what a display of how racism suddenly didnt matter anymore... or between the blacks and whites atleast.i could go on, but i dont want to waste my time on it anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Martin has lost it!!!","review":"I would have expected more from Martin especially since his old stuff was beyond funny. It seemed as if he has become more of a violent. The entire show the only thing that he uses is profanity and talks about how you should beat the <heck> out of this and out of that. It would have been ok if it would have been one or two jokes about beating the children and etc. but more than half the show he talks about whippen someones <rear> and after about 15 min. of it, i got sick of listening to him. I don't know what has happened to Martin but the only thing that was interesting was close to the end when he explains about why he got arrested on the street and in the club and the only thing that caused all that was drugs... and to be honest i was wondering if he was on drugs through the entire show!!! Not worth it and if keeps on with this pace, i seriously doubt it that he will still be on the top!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time! I want my money back!!","review":"Okay, so kick me for giving this movie 2 stars. The first star was for being (excuse me) ballsy enough to do a stand-up routine based on his own indiscretions, embarassing moments, and general muck-ups, instead of as he said, \\"waiting for the E! True Hollywood Story to tell it.\\" Fair enough, but I am thinking that the E! Story might have been more entertaining and less buffoonery. All that aside, this movie was a waste of an afternoon that I spent. There were very few parts that were funny/amusing. The only heartfelt message that came across was: \\"No one is immune to the trials and tribulations of life.\\" Well, damn, Martin. Maybe you oughta give comedy a rest and try philosophy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...","review":"Wow...Martin Lawrence has gotten progressivly worse since leaving \\"Martin\\". He had something going with that. Anyhow, this is the LEAST funny stand-up routine EVER. I would underline the word ever in the previous sentence if I could I figure out how. The humor extremely low-brow. Not suggested viewing for any one with I.Q. of over 85. Martin at one point says \\"Critics are people that dont have the talent to do anything else\\" or something along those lines. This is not true. Critics are people that let alert other of people with no talent, such as Martin Lawrence. I saw this for free, and it still wasnt worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.............","review":"The first time I attempted to watch the DVD I fell asleep sometime around 6mins of the concert.

In addition to his manner and mien, which are cold, arrogant, unkind and un-funny, the comedic material is weak and the flow and ramble is awkward and stilted. Something bad has happened to Martin and it shows here, as his easy way with the audience in his stand-up routines has given way to an embarassed, chip-on-my-shoulder attitude that is off-putting at its best. I walked out after 45 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"A man who makes predictable, stupid, and boring movies performs predictable, stupid and boring stand up"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious DVD","review":"Martin Lawrence is a great stand-up performer.

But as an over all show, it was a bit of a downer. He kept on urging the audience to \\"ride this mother till the wheels fall off\\" and how he kept giving his true holywood story which was kind of a contradiction because his wheels almost did fall off. I dig Martin L. and I am glad he is alive and I hope he continues to make us laugh. But after 20 minutes of this show I really wasn't laughing. But I will continue to buy and stay interested in Martin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great If You Wanna Hear A Grown Man Whine!","review":"Martin Lawrence is highly talented and funny why he did this awful standup and various other floops (ie. Black Knight) will have comedy historians guessing for centuries. Simply put, there was really only one funny part in Runteldat, the part when he was mimicking a drunkard having a onesided conversation with his wife. Other than that, Martin was whining and complaining about the bad press he's been getting. And the media has been singling him out and giving him the shaft but why commit an entire hour to talking about that I mean good grief. Martin's other standup's have been stellar but this one kinda stunk."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Won't Run Tel Your Freinds About This!","review":"Im sorry, but i was expecting this to be so funny, something to follow up \\"You So Crazy\\", but it wasn't even close. He spends most of time talking about his struggles and his problems and run-ins with the law, i laughed a couple times, but basically he spent to much time talking about one subject and it got boring, especially about alcoholism, if your a fan of Martin you'll probably check it out anyway, but don't expect much laughs, i would rent it first. It's to vulger for kids and contains alot of adult matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissappointing","review":"this is one of the first stand up comedy dvd's i have bought (along with kings of comedy) and i have to say i was dissappointed. he's really not too funny with his racial jokes, chris rock and dave chapelle are much better in this area. also its annoying to hear more bin laden/911 jokes... they're just not that funny. i really wish i could return this dvd, i couldnt even watch it all the way through the whole thing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge waste of time","review":"I'm so glad I only rented this dvd.

Since everyone has differing unique needs may I suggest checking out the numerous fitness DVDs at the local library while thoroughly reading the reviews here on Amazon, see which one seems most suited, give the video a try for a week or two and then come back to Amazon and buy the one that's most appropriate for you.For additional fitness on the move, I highly recommend any of the TNT Lifeline bands includingLifeline USA TNT Special Triple Resistance Cable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anita Baker's Rapture was great and still great","review":"I loved it when it first came out and I still love it now.

Although her second record, Rapture showed her with an very sexy voice, and an mature sound that became tradtional. All of the tracks are classics. From You Bring Me Joy, to Sweet Love, to Caught Up In The Rapture, Anita showed that people always come back to basic R&B. While Rap and Hip Hop were starting to form, very few people believed that old school would remain the constant at that time. Anita Baker really showed it with Rapture. 15 Years after its release, people still are catching into the Rapture of Anita Baker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still her best","review":"After a couple of years I just listened to this truly beautiful record again, and it is still Anita's best. All the songs offer great moments and the distinctive Baker style - I find it impossible to pick a favorite. The material still sounds remarkably fresh and a comparison with more recent releases (e.g. the latest Tony Braxton effort) really shows how far ahead in quality this album was when it first came out. It must be one of the essential R&B records."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best make out CD of all time","review":"Her voice is like gold!! She is so smooth on this CD.

There's no song that stands out among the others as being anything special. Each one drones blandly into the next. It appears he is simply trying to imitate other performers like Gordon Lightfoot and John Denver, but Sunny falls far short. On the other hand, there are no \\"dings\\" in the music, either. If you're looking for insipid background music to listen to, this cd is for you. Otherwise, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Art & Soul","review":"Sunny Waters' talent is far beyond what could be expressed with mere words. If you take the time to listen to the music, interpret what is being shared, and feeling it.......you will then begin to realize that this rare \\"gem\\" of a man/musician is polished and ready to shine!

I bought my copy what it was at the original price, and it's still worth every penny that I paid for it. In fact, I think it's worth more now. The more I listen to it the more I realize how much Sunny's voice stands out among the rest. It's so crystal clear, almost shimmering. The CD case has a crack in it now from being used so much, a testament to how often I listen to the CD. My two favorite songs are \\"The Man I'm Made Of\\" and \\"Don't Cry For Me\\". I can listen to those two over and over again.

The songs here are all bland and about as predictable as you would expect. All the \\"ideals\\" that are custom-made to sell folk records you will find obtruding as big as a butte at the Grand Canyon. It just sounds like a rehash of what others before have done better, all with a sickly sweet sound that would send a diabetic into a coma. The style is nice and folksy (but dull), and the sentiments are nice and sacharine, but it all seems engineered to sell records rather than to express genuine feelings and ideas. It's all a great effort -- at copycatting. But as the songs are not too unplesant, I give him two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"She does it again.","review":"Funny lady Laura Jensen Walker does it again.

Given a choice I would rather have out of control hair and healthy lungs as to use the toxic brands. Then I found this at my fav healthfoold store and tried it. It's great, makes my hair shiny, has great control, brushes out easily and I can still breathe. There are several safe hairsprays on the market but they all made my fine textured, limp hair look greasy and stuck to my head.

Thanks Aubrey and Amazon for giving me back my all day hair do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, long lasting hold","review":"I have a short hair style that requires styling and hold. I was a little hesitant to try this hairspray because I wondered if a natural product could really provide the same hold as a synthetic product. I found out that this is indeed possible. This spray holds my style all day long--it's almost so strong I wonder if I should go down to the regular hold next time. While it's strong, it doesn't weigh your hair down or make it look or even feel like a brick. What's nice is that a very small amount goes a long way--I don't even do full pumps when I spray my hair--just little 1/3 ones are enough. The only downside to this product is that the fragrance is definitely herbal--it smells very earthy--a tad musty. The scent doesn't linger that long though. I must say, it did catch me off guard at first. Now I'm used to it and it doesn't bother my husband at all who likes my hair to smell good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to wash out","review":"I bought this spray because I am sensitive to chemical, but need spray for dance performance. First, this works great for a firm hold, doesn't smell bad, and dries quickly. I like it for what it does. However, I have used it twice now, and each time I have had a headache the next day. I am extremely sensative, so most people would be OK. Also, I agree with another commenter that this product takes two days to wash out, and with all the washing my hair feels stripped. I am looking for another product."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this but didn't","review":"I really wanted to like this product since I'm moving to more natural personal care items.

Written with a left-wing bias (\\"it's all the fault of those right-wing fascists\\"), the book makes a number of assertions without any indication of serious research. As an example, the author blithely associates Edison/General Electric with alternating current and Telsa/Westinghouse with direct current when quite the reverse is true. Within the same chapter, the author fails geography when he states Philadelphia and Norfolk are only 15 miles apart. (Those cities are about 210 miles apart when last I checked a map.) Indeed, the author is innocent of map-checking or other fact verification.

Suffice it to say that this is one of the worst books that i have ever read (and i am an avid reader). It is completly unrealistic, which would be alright because fantasy is a respected genre. But nothing interesting happens. So let's consider it as a novel then. Does it have interesting characters that one can empathize with? No-they're all hysterical, repugnant, self-absorbed, emotionally stunted, selfish, and neurotic (and I don't mean that in a good way). This book is supposed to be \\"moving\\", sort of a tale of rebirth and redemption. But I disliked the characters so much that I actually wanted something awful to happen to most of them.

Have you lived on a farm in the South in the 50's? 7 year olds are mature there -- they see more life and death and work harder than most of us reading this book! Farm life, paticularly before mass television and \\"entertainment\\" was only routine and boring if you weren't a farmer -- or to us urbanites who are over-entertained by the world around us. The supposed lack of ending is only there to people who do not enjoy using their imagination. Think of all the possiblities that could go on -- think of writing a novel that begins where this one ends from the perspective of Cowboy or the other Mexicans that come to work each summer. Grisham gets our appetities wet to know more -- isn't that what good authors do?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Loved it!","review":"After waiting until this book came out in paperback, because of all the negative reviews I'd read, I bought this book. I loved it. Perhaps you need to live in the south to appreciate the back breaking work of picking cotton, no I've never picked a boll, but I could see the faces, feel their feelings, see them sneaking around at night, feel the fear and their hopes for a better life.

This book is filled with lots of heart and interesting stories. Like no other book I have ever picked up. Makes me thankful for my life and everything I have. It also makes you realize that picking cotton is not as soft as the result."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had high expectations for this book because I had heard of the author's reputation. The first half of the book is very interesting because there're mysteries about certain quirky characters. In the second half, things began to get predictable--and they turned out the way I thought they would. The plot is something you might see on LifeTime or Hallmark, which others might very well like. Grisham's writing is very succint, and the dialogue is easy to grasp. The direction of plot isn't unique.I was also puzzled by the behavior of the boy with the withered arm at the end of the book. Grisham doesn't give us a clear explanation, so I went back into the text because I thought I had missed something important. Well, I'm still puzzled. I think if Grisham had resolved this issue, then I would've liked this book more."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time....","review":"In a nut-shell - ANTI-CLIMATIC.

How many times can they pick cotton, listen to the St Louis Cards on the radio, eat butter beans, buy paint, go into town? I also thought some of the plots were a little far fetched. A seven year old boy witnesses two murders in one summer. How often do seven year olds witness even one murder, let alone two? If I didn't take that trip to Vegas and needed a quick book to read it would have remained unfinished."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book...","review":"i love J.G. and i've read most of his books..but this one, it was sooo bad. I hated the cotton picking... i hated the little boy, and what i hated the most was the lack of and ending..i dont know how i finished reading this book. i just tought it was gonna get better, but it didn't. i could not believe how bad it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very very weak effort by Grisham","review":"Even for a die-hard Grisham fan, this book was very very lame. The writing style is definitely Grisham, which is a good thing, and the fact there are not any lawyers in the story is not necessarily a bad thing.But the plot itself is incredibly weak, to the point of being almost non-existant. The character development is shallow and predictable. The \\"suspense\\" of who is painting the house is a joke.I couldn't believe how slowly things developed, until I realized that he had developed them as far as he was going to - and that was it. End of book. Do yourself a favor, don't buy this book new. It's a waste of money. If you absolutely must read it, pick up a copy at a garage sale or a used book store. And don't say I didn't warn you."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is not what you are expecting form Grisham","review":"If you are a reader of previous John Grisham books where you are cough be the suspense, events, plots and Law, then this is NOT the book for you to read.I was so furiuos to pass the first seven chapters without any excitement. I really was forcing my self to continue reading but that was invain."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like Grisham's other books, you'll hate this one","review":"Having wasted numerous hours with \\"A Painted House\\", I figured I'd better warn others of doing the same. While I've enjoyed almost everything else by Grisham so far, \\"A Painted House\\" was a huge disappointment. It's not just the lack of suspense (in fact, this book's most thrilling aspect is the summary on the cover). It's a total lack of a plot, a message or anything else that would justify 400+ pages. If that particular style of story-telling aims at getting the boredom of life in rural America across, THEN Grisham has certainly succeeded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different then most John Grisham's books","review":"Good book , a little different from most of his books. More about cotton farming then law."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat Disappointed in Grisham","review":"Finally, after 50 some pages Grisham grabbed me with \\"A Painted House\\". But I am somewhat disappointed because my expectations were for the usual Grisham which is fast paced and an \\"I-can't-put-this-down\\" book. After I admitted to the honesty of Grisham's new style & new characters I began to delight in this book. But if you're looking for the usual kicks, try a differentGrisham book. I really hope this author's style hasn't mellowed out. I turn to his books for a thrill ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great piece of literature","review":"After reading all (and I mean all!) of Grisham's lawyer related novels, this was a refreshing change. Not only is it a great book, I believe that it will go down as one of the great novels of our time! The writing reminds me of a cross between \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\", and \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\". The story is told through the eyes of a 7 year old boy (similar to the boy's perspective in \\"to Kill\\"), and is set in the 1950's Arkansas cotton fields. The way he tells the story, from the hiring of Mexican workers and \\"Hill People\\", and the quaint and nostalgic times of a yesterday gone by, is breathtaking and captivating. I could not put it down!! I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The book started out pretty good but never got off the ground. It seemed that every chapter melted into the next and the author became very repetative. I have read a number of his books and have really enjoyed them. This was not one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes Its Different... Viva La Difference!","review":"I had heard that Mr. Grisham's, \\"A Painted House\\" was very different and it was. I thought perhaps I wouldn't like it because I have enjoyed some of Mr. Grisham's earlier works so much. The story pulled at my heart. The writing is simple but the story is not. It brought back memories of John Steinback's, \\"Grapes of Wrath.\\" Hard times, changes, deep currents of feeling... Its about life... the unending back breaking work... year after year the struggle... Life and its pattern in which events occur that are not a part of the pattern but become a part of the pattern because life is like that... stretching out to include the different as much as what is known... Most of all its about family... I could see and feel the love of the family... I will be disappointed if Mr. Grisham doesn't write a follow up. I want to know what happened to all of them..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"John Grisham is such a wonderful writer! I predict that anything he writes will become an instant sucess! I've read all of his books, and have enjoyed them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Dull for Me","review":"I hate reading half of a book and then not being able to finish it so this time I kept reading it until the very end hoping that maybe something would happen and make the book interesting...but it didnt. I think that maybe John Grisham should go back to the layers and the courtroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"Being a Grisham fan to the nth degree (now having read all of his books), I dived in to this book with great expectations. Unfortunately, it took forever to \\"get in to\\" the story and when I finished I thought I'd missed something. It's such a total departure from his usual thrillers and, I guess, I'd like to see him continue his original focus rather than try this route."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Painted House","review":"The Painted House is a diappointment. This book is one of the worst books I have ever read. If I didn't pay good money for it, I would have just thrown it away.. This book is set in the '50's, through the eyes of a seven year old. Nothing happens in this book towards any kind of drama. The book plods alone like a plow horse in the mid-day sun. I felt this book was written to keep the author in print. If I had one good thing to say about this book, No matter what you condition is, this book reminds us that people are worst off then yourself. However, I can read the daily news and figure that out. I literally had to drag myself through this book. I kept reading it just for the hope that something would happen, nothing ever did. From the begining to the end, this book reads at sea level, just barely keeping itself from nose diving into the earth and buring to death, which is what I really wanted this book to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money - But if you must, buy it used","review":"Remember in school trying to turn a two sentence topic into 500 words? Mr. Grisham did effectively the same thing - stretched five pages into 388. Whereas his previous works were exciting, this book tossed in one murder (which easily could have been omitted since the author didn't go anywhere with it) and a pregnancy which didn't contribute much to the storyline. First Grisham book where I actually went to bed with one chapter to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"House Painted","review":"Loyal fan of John Grisham....I bought \\"House Painted\\" and what a disappointment! What was the point to the story? The same scenerio repeated itself throughout the entire book. Was this book supposed to be a test, something different from the \\"lawyer/crimal\\" books Grisham usually writes?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Part Two.....PLEASE!!!","review":"I loved 'A Painted House'. It kept me laughing, crying, stealing time to find out what was going to happen next. John Grisham has such a sharp sense of humor. The only complaint I have is that it ended too abrubtly. I think there should have been a homecoming. Maybe at 'Christmas'? Just hoping, wondering. I need to know how Luke is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Painted House","review":"Boring. Should have been a short story. It offered very little, gave very little and ended with very little."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTING :((","review":"I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS WRITING! I HAVE LOVED ALL OF HIS PREVIOUS BOOKS, BUT THIS ONE LACKS \\"him\\". I KEPT LOOKING FOR THE PLOT, NEVER TO BE FOUND. JUST A BUNCH OF RAMBLING ON, NO STRUCTURE. I BOUGHT THE BOOK ON CASSETTE, UNABRIDGED, BUT FEEL I WASTED MY MONEY!!!!!!! HERE'S HOPING FOR MUCH BETTER IN THE FUTURE! SINCERELY, FRANCES WILLIAMS"},{"rating":"1","title":"His next book should be \\"Guilty of Bordom\\"","review":"This book has entered my list of all time cures for insomnia, along with \\"Cold Mountain\\" and \\"Angela's Ashes\\". It can be summed up in one word - depressing. Books like this can be called 'page turners' because you keep turning the page to the expectation that something interesting has to happen.It is not believable. I might have believed it more if Luke were 14 and not 7. (I can't remember ever knowing a seven year old with the interest in naked women of an 18 year old.)And I don't think I could spoil the end because there is none. It is like Grisham just decides he is bored with the book himself and stops writing. It leaves a lot of loose ends. And there are so many loose ends that I fear he may be considering a second in the series, or God forbid, a trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need some ZZZZZZZZZZ's","review":"I just finished reading John Grisham's latest book. Personally I really didn't care for this story. It was mundane, slow and dull. Definitely not one of his greatest works. I don't think I would recommend this book. A great book to put you to sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"One not to miss","review":"Grisham at his best. This story of social class differences avoids being PC and engenders real empathy in the reader. Events in the life of a young boy are recollected as an adult. It's a moving story and beautifully crafted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"Very different to the usual Grisham lawyer style books, but really good and captivating book! Highly recommended, at least by me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better Grisham works","review":"Sometimes I love Grisham, sometimes I don't. This novel kept me interested right up to the end. Well worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to get into","review":"I started this book twice now and can't seem to get into it. I imagine I'll try it again some day."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine departure for Grisham","review":"I read Grisham for entertainment and not profound life's lessons. So The Painted House surprised me. It was a relatively slow book, but it's vividly and lushly written. The prose was very smooth. The dialogue, characters, settings, and storytelling place me right there right then. It is a pretty simple story, devoid of Grisham's normally frantic twists, but you just can't help but feel for these realistic characters. The ending is a little of a letdown, especially after an emotional journey. But I recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real life story","review":"This is a real to life story. Once you start reading this book you don't want to put it down. I enjoyed it from beginning to end, and still wanted more. Great book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Evokes My Own Childhood","review":"I was born in Tuckerman, Arkansas (near Jonesboro) in 1954, and although I've lived most of my life in St. Louis, I still feel a deep connection to the South. Although I recognize that A Painted House is not a classic along the lines of To Kill a Mockingbird, I still took great pleasure in reading it, simply because it evoked memories of my own childhood. Like Luke Chandler, I picked cotton, played with Mexican migrant workers, rode in the back of pick-up trucks, tiptoed my way around barns and chicken coops to avoid the occasional snake, and listened to Cardinal baseball games on a transistor radio on my grandfather's front porch. Those days are over now, and my extended family is spread across the country working for corporate America. My grandparents are gone now. Reading this book was like a visit back home. It brought tears to my eyes, and I'm sure I'll read it again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book--","review":"I was expecting another lawyer book and was pleasantly surprised. This is an absolute page turner. A wonderful story of life on a cotton farm. I really enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL, terrible, how could anyone like this book?","review":"I don't get it, John Grisham puts his name to something and everyone says it is good....This book was nothing. Nothing happenned, I waited 450 pages for something, I am still waiting. I can't remember feeling more empty after finishing a book that I do now.....The only good thing is that I finished this in a few days on the train.....I read everything by Grisham and usually like most things, although, he has not come close to his first 3 novels....This one was NOTHING................don't waste your time.....I look forward to any feedback from people who liked this...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Grisham Really Write This?","review":"Having read most of Grisham's books, I find it hard to believe he wrote this one. I wanted to quit reading it after a few pages, but I plodded through the entire book from beginning to end and it never got any better. I would not criticize a book unless I read it all to see if it had redeeming qualities - I found none. This book depicts a miserable summer in the poor cotton belt as seen through the eyes of a seven year old boy fixated on the Cardinals. It may appeal to some readers, but I find it hard to visualize it appealing to regular Grisham readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst grisham book ever published","review":"I have read almost all of John Grisham's books, and this book is pathetic. There is no overall plot, but just a lot of ramblings of a 7 year old boy in a make believe land. I am old enough to remember the early 50's. The book has no overall story line. I have read the first three-quarters of the book, and I am not sure I can force myself to finish it. The book is that bad. It does not keep my interest since it is full of drivel stories. I cannot say enough bad about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Grisham Quality","review":"John Grisham has strayed from the subject matter he has previously mastered - lawyers. Instead of a compelling story that draws one to the next page, I was forced to endure a rather long boring story line. Very disappointing from one of the most talented authors of modern times. Here's hoping that this was only a one-time venture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not John Grisham Style","review":"If this is the first John Grisham book you have ever read, please do not judge him off of this. He is brillant in all of his books pertaining to law. This book is written well....don't get me wrong, but the story is just too boring. I couldn't finish it.I do recommend John's other books.......this one must have been an experiment for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham Holds You","review":"This may not be a standard Grisham theme, but who really cares if it isn't! The characters still shine, you care about them and are caught in their journey. It was a good read, and set up nicely for a sequel, i.e. what are the real fates of Luke, Tally and the rest?"},{"rating":"1","title":"too depressing, not realistic","review":"I have read most of John Grisham's earlier books, and enjoyed them, so I thought I would try this one. To me, it was not quite as good as his others. I thought this book was depressing. And it seemed a big stretch for a 7 year old to be as observant and clever as Luke was. The things that he witnessed and had to hold in were pretty strong for a young boy. It seemed to me that he would certainly have been traumatized, and would have told his mother, or grandfather. So it was not very realistic to me. That was the problem. Luke was too young. It should have been written in the first person by someone a little bit older, maybe 11 or 12. Then I would have enjoyed it more. Hard things happened in the book. I'm sure things like that really did happen, but for them all to happen here and for this boy to see them all, it was too much of a stretch for me. But I like John Grisham's other books a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Purchase","review":"The book I ordered was exactly as represented and came very, very quickly. I rate this an A+ purchase! Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a surprise","review":"I really loved this book. Grisham can write books about something else other then lawyers. I was really surprised how good this book was. I could not put it down. I could picture ever thing in the book in my head. I felt like I was there in that cotton field. I would like to is him write more book like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointment from a good writer","review":"This book is another disappointment by a very talented author. The idea, it seems is taken from Homer Hickam's novel 'October Sky or The Coalwood Way.' Fortunately I did not spend any money on this book as well, but read it in hope that this might be interesting. The whole book evolves around one or two plots and does not get anywhere. The reader hopes that soon it will become interesting but, it does not. Mr. Grisham is cashing in on his old credibility. I would not recommend this book to anyone.Arshad Altaf Karachi, Pakistan"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"At first, I was happy to here John Grisham trying his hand at something besides legal matters. But after reading this book, all I can say is I hope John gets back to what he knows best! I think John really missed a good chance to have a great book. It could have been great. I get the feeling he got in a hurry and ended the story without all the subplots coming to some great climax.I am sorry, but the story kept developing and developing, then nothing happened. All the different plots and story lines just drifted off into the wild blue yonder! After getting to the end, one is left with the question,,,,what happened???????I feel this is one book that would make a good move. As a book, I was very disappointed. Although, it was not as bad as the last book, \\"The Brethren\\"!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely spendid!!!","review":"This is simply one of the best books I have ever read! I was a little hesitant to read this book because I so love thrillers and mysteries, but from the beginning, this book kept me enthralled.

WHILE READING THIS BOOK I HAVE FELT AS I'M PART OF THE BANDELLS AND THAT IS SURELY WHAT WE BOOKLOVERS EXPECT FROM THE BOOKS. WELL DONE MR GRISHAM AND KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.P.S.

I found it long, boring and tedious. Perhaps, there have been just too many books written about poor people in the South in recent years. I found it difficult to identify with the characters. Some of the main characters were downright unlikeable. I am a teacher, and know seven year olds very well. The seven year old who narrates the story is extremely unrealistic. Seven year olds do not think like this child, nor do they have the vocabulary that this youngster has. I always keep books I enjoy and feel are valuable. This one was given away the very day I finished it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Refreshing Change","review":"I've always liked John Grisham's books, but was pleasantly surprised by his latest.

I like his writing technique - short and pithy sentences - but this works better when there's a lot of action; it doesn't work as well in a \\"bucolic\\" as this book has been described. Also, the plot had too many loose ends. I was never sure if I was reading a child's perspective or that of an omniscient narrator. I will always buy another John Grisham book, but this one has already been passed on..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MAGICAL STORY","review":"THANK YOU JOHN GRISHAM FOR THIS FANTASTIC STORY AND FOR THE GREAT CHARACTERS WHO COME ALIVE ON THE PAGES OF 'A PAINTED HOUSE'.

I WAS CAPTIVATED BY AND ADMIRED THE STRONG BOND BETWEEN LUKE AND HIS DEVOTED MOTHER. UNDERLYING THIS TOUCHING TALE ARE SECRETS, LIES, TENSIONS AND MURDER WHICH MAKE IT AS SUSPENSEFUL AND EXCITING AS ANY LEGAL THRILLER . I ENJOYED MR. GRISHAM'S STYLE OF WRITING AND HIS SUBTLE HUMOR.

While I think the rest of his books are follow a specific formula and are kind of repetitive in some ways I was begging for that feature in this book. The book is slow, and pointless.

No 7-year old I have ever met could think like this character. The reader waits the entire book for something to happen and nothing ever does. It was quite a disappointment, as Grisham's stories are usually so riveting, you can't put them down. This was a waste of time and money. It is much like the new Baldacci novel, both of which should be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham at his worst.","review":"If you are a John Grisham fan, do not pick this one up.

I have enjoyed all of John Grisham's books thus far and this one is no exception. It does take on a different role from his previous legal fiction books, but this one however, is another suspense filled story which I again could not put down until it was finished. It is well written with a sometimes fun loving prankster included. You couldn't help but look back and remember days gone by. But as always this book ended to soon.

It took a while for me to realize there was no big, exciting, climactic event coming but once I figured that out, I enjoyed the \\"folksy\\" feel of the setting and characters.

Only the name Grisham has saved it from a fate worse than death.John Grisham started sliding after 'The Firm' and A Painted House does nothing to slow his descent. I understand his need to get away from the lawyer genre, but a slow action, poor story book is not going to help.

First of all, a seven year old is not interested in sex in the way Grishom writes. Plus a seven year old does not have the thoughts and insights that are as \\"mature\\" as Grishom's character. This falseness made me intensely dislike the book. The boy was speaking in \\"Grishom-language\\", that of a forty-something man (or at least a 14 year old), not a seven year old. Didn't someone point this out to him when the book was being proofed, etc? or were they relying on his name to make a best seller and didn't care about the authenticity of the storyline? I think it is a waste of money. Get it from the library if you're curious about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"John Grisham should stick with what he does best. This story, narrated in the first person by a seven year old farm boy is at best a reasonable depiction of life in rural Arkansas in the early 1950's. At worst, it is as this reader found it - boring. The narrative is unnecessarily tedious and drawn out and adds nothing to a simplistic tale. The reader is constantly waiting for something to happen, and nothing ever does. What you get in the first two chapters is what you get for the rest of the book. It is unfortunate that this book will make it to the best seller list, purely on the strength of Grisham's name, it does not deserve to be there."},{"rating":"1","title":"whats cooking Grisham?...","review":"This novel has been such a let down, I have read all his books from start to finish always wishing it would never end,but this was one book I wished I didnt start!!

Employed Mexicanos, white trash (definition back then becasue they needed the work so they could lay around all year), and any other to help family pick cotton before the mechanical equipment. Had a sexual encounter with an OLDER female, birth of a baby by a white trash neighbor. A flood. Out of money went North to work at a job to come back and spend it on sharecropper land. What an original. Notice no top ten finish NOW. Grisham needs to realize that people PAY for a GOOD book not a family diary. Please JOHN write us a book...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite","review":"Uninspired and boring. Grisham's writing has been on the decline since The Pelican Brief and this novel does nothing to elevate his writing. I couldn't force myself to finish the last quarter of the book. The novel's pace is languid, the characters are uninteresting and story itself is uninspired. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn - I just don't think I can go on anymore","review":"I am a third of the way in and I keep asking myself if I can take anymore. This is almost as bad as The Chamber. How did this book make any bestseller list? Save your money unless you have difficulty sleeping at night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely a let down","review":"I had preordered this book, thinking it would be another one of JG's thrillers, sadly, it is more like reading a Romance Novel - one keeps thinking - Ah - now, there is going to be a court case or now a lawyer will enter the story - sadly - never happens !! Also, the book is more like leisurely reading and should be retitled \\"Farm Life in the United States - A documentary\\" .... good if you want to develop your knowledge about farm life in the US - but, if you have read any of JG's books earlier, then, shed all expectation while reading this one !! I think its his name that has sold more than the book itself !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Grisham but really hated this one!","review":"I have read all Grisham's books, most within a day or two. I still read this one fast, but unfortunately I read it fast because after a hundred pages or so I began to skim read. I do not like to skim and don't even remember the last time I have resorted to doing so because I normally love to absorb the details of a well-written book. Despite Grisham's attempt to depart from his typical style and bring us a nice story about a poor southern boy to life, I was bored to tears and raced through to see if it was ever going to get any better. I do like non-suspense literature but this is not Grisham's forte. Without lawyers, he is out of his element. John, please return to the stuff we love!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sequel - I think I am Confused","review":"I read several reviews where readers are looking for a sequel to wrap up the various storylines.I read \\"The Painted House\\" in the serialized version that appeared across six issues of the Oxford American magazine (John Grisham is the Publisher).This version included an Epilogue that brought closure to all of the storylines. Apparently the book version did not include this epilogue.What's up with that?I'll give 5 stars to the Oxford American version .... I would have been VERY disappointed if there had been no epilogue. I will be even more disappointed if a sequel is written that ignores what has already been published."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful and delightful change","review":"I could not put it down! I read the book at record speed and when I got to the end, I flipped to the front and thought I'd read it again! I have read every Grisham book and wasn't sure how I'd feel about the switch. But the story grabbed my attention and held on till the end. Unlike some of his books where I find myself dragging through the middle, this was not the case. When I started feeling over-whelmed with my life and it's mundane chores, I thought of little Luke and the families of his time. It made me appreciate the simplicity of our high tech world. John Grisham has shown that he can write outside of his element and make strong, believable characters and a plot that still keeps you guessing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second only to A Time To Kill","review":"As an avid Grisham reader, I really enjoyed reading a book with full character development and a good storyline. Although I still feel A Time To Kill is the best book he has ever written, A Painted House comes in as a close second. I only hope that Grisham will write a sequel to this book and let us know what happens to the Chandler clan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfying..","review":"I absolutely LOVE John Grisham's legal thrillers, but I was excited to see that he had written something else. I bought it the second I saw it. It's one of those books where I had to keep starting over - I would get through a few pages, get bored and not pick it up again for weeks. Eventually, I forced myself to read it during my lunch break. I found it very predictable, no real depth to any of the characters, not thought provoking.. I just kept reading because it seemed like Grisham was building up to something, and I kept waiting for it. Then the book was over. I didn't have any attachment to any of the characters and in general I didn't really care what happened to them (this never happens to me!)But if you're a Grisham-lover like I am, you'll probably have to read it for yourself. My advice, borrow it from someone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Change For The Best","review":"This story is not a legal thriller, which is a first for Grisham. Instead, this story is a narrative that keeps you wanting more, especially at the ending. The story begins in rural Arkansas in 1952. Seven-year-old, Luke Chandler, tells of the trials of sharecropping and the adventures of farm life. Luke goes through more experiences than most seven-year-olds and his life changes that summer. The adventures and challenges in the book keep you reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED THIS BOOK!","review":"I loved this book. I listened to it on CD, and it always kept my attention. Couldn't wait to get back to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Painted House","review":"This book has been reviewed and summarized so many times that it's pointless for me to try and add anything in that regard. So I'll just throw in my 2-cents and say that I applaud Mr. Grisham for having the courage to step away from his signature genre and write a story that clearly came from his heart. I enjoyed \\"A Painted House\\" very much and hope he writes another in this fashion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Painted House","review":"A very interesting book--different from otherbooks from this author,but I enjoyed it.Hope there he will continue it in anotherbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Arkansas","review":"This Grisham book was awesome. A seven year old name Luke is growning up on a cotton farm in rural Arkansas. I would reccomend this book to anyone. It was different than most Grisham books because it didn't have to deal with the law stuff. It is a good book and I would recommend it just like I said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Close to Home","review":"My inlaws moved from Kentucky to Detroit in the fifties to find a better way of life. The closing scenes of \\"A painted House\\" tore my heart out as I imagined what is was like for my father-in-law to tell his parents he was leaving the family home for ajob in Michigan. - Although the story starts out slowly, It hit home with the parallels of the exodus from the farmning south to the promise of the \\"Good Life\\" in the north."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a single lawyer in the whole book.","review":"This novel is very different from the usual Grisham lawyer novel but still an excellent read. The story is about growing up on a cotton farm in Arkansas in the early 50s, as seen from a seven year old boy's perspective. There is the struggle of farming cotton and some exciting secrets that keep the story going and interest high."},{"rating":"1","title":"You probably should have put a lawyer in it","review":"Could not finish. First book from his stable of book that could not allow to run to completion. I can not give it away. Good luck if this is all you have to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham Disappoints Again","review":"I've always waited impatiently for John Grisham's next book, buying the hardback instead of waiting for the paperback release. I was very, very disappointed with this book. I found it hard reading because there basically is nothing to grab your attention, nothing to keep you avidly reading well into the wee hours of the morning. It took me 2 months to finish this book, and the only reason I finished it at all is because my husband bought the hardback and I felt guilty about not reading to the end.Perhaps John Grisham feels he's made enough money that he doesn't have to produce gripping stories anymore - or perhaps he was contracted to write so many books and is struggling storywise to fulfill his obligation.The storyline to this book was so dismal, so slow and so uninteresting - a real disappointment. This reader will wait for the paperback editions of any future Grisham books, but only after reading reviews.John, what happened?"},{"rating":"1","title":"WAKE ME WHEN IT'S OVER.","review":"\\"A Painted House\\" is definitely not a page turner and not John Grisham at his finest. I think he made a mistake when he deviated from what he does best, and that is writing stories about law and order. \\"A Painted House\\" is the kind of book that is easy to put down and not pick up again for days. I found it rather slow and at times downright boring. People slave in the cotton fields day after day and fall into bed completely exhausted every night, only to get up again the next morning to repeat the whole process over again. This is not to say that there weren't some interesting pages in the book about migrant workers and mountain people who came to pick cotton so that they could make ends meet and put food on their table. However, in the final analysis, I thought this tedious tale would never end."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a book!!","review":"i thouroughly enjoyed the book and i neither could put it down nor did i want it to end. i actaully stopped myself from finishing the last chapter and rather chose to extend it to the next morning when i took hours to read and re-read each word, sentence, phrase and imagine i was lil' luke chandler. the end was so captivating, it almost made me cry."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Grisham's DULLSVILLE","review":"I have read all of his books from A TIME TO KILL onward. This was by far the most disappointing. I couldn't get through it. The characters had no substance and the plot was dull. Very rarely do I not finish a book, however, this was one of the times."},{"rating":"2","title":"MaryAnn","review":"I've read many Grisham novels and have always liked them, and when I heard that this one wasn't about lawyers, I looked forward to a change of pace. I enjoyed it VERY MUCH. Beautifully written, keeps you very interested, and you really get to know the characters and story setting. The only problem I had with it was that some of the continuing story lines weren't tied up at the end. In fact the end of the book didn't really seem like the end, it just sort of stopped with respect to some of the ideas in the story. But as I've said, I really did enjoy this book and would highly recommend it. As others have said, this book screems \\"sequal.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely loved it!","review":"Someone once said, \\"I don't like to read books that have everything in it but the kitchen sink. Instead, I like to read books ABOUT the kitchen sink.\\" Grisham's new book \\"A Painted House\\" is indeed about the kitchen sink. It's the kind of book you never want to end. I hope he writes a sequel. And judging from how Grisham ended the story, it wouldn't surprise me if there isn't another one in the making."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cotton-Picking Page-Turner","review":"John Grisham has yet to disappoint. Faced with spending time with the parents for Christmas, I decided I needed a book to read, and picked up A Painted House. I chose it not becuase I particularly wanted to read about picking cotton in Arkansas, but because I have greatly enjoyed Grisham's legal thrillers. Although there was not a lawyer to be found, the tale of seven-year-old Luke Chandler and his family was quite gripping. I found it difficult to put the book down (as I had with Grisham's other works), and I finished it in two days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging tale of a different time and place","review":"Wow! I had a hard time putting this one down sometimes...this is my second Grisham book (Skipping Christmas was the other), and I am very impressed, especially compared to \\"Skipping\\". I felt like I was on the 1950s Arkansas farm with 7 year old Luke as he dragged me along to pick cotton, listen to the radio in the Southern heat, and peep at Tally or watch fights. I felt his frequent helplessness in his youthful position, and enjoyed his expolits and subtle rebellions. Grisham took me to a world I knew very little about and really described the farming life well enough that I could imagine how everything \\"looked\\". The ending was actually a new beginning, and I wished I could tag along to see what happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"A relaxing reading","review":"It is a really easy reading book, the story, secrets and dreams of a 7 years old farmer kid keeps you entertained at all times, I will recommend this book for a trip or when you don't have a hurry to finish it, just relax and read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Out on a Painted House","review":"I have not been able to get into this book. Maybe because it was the first different book he wrote. I did love Skipping Christmas, though it was great."},{"rating":"1","title":"From the sublime to the mediocre","review":"Like most people I know, I read all of John Grisham's. This one is definitely a plunge from sublime to the ridiculous. From the first few chapters, I had this strange flasbacks of Tom Sawyer, Studs Lonigan and Once Upon A Time in America all slapped together into this dragging, incoherent, disjointed plot, without rhymes, reason or resolution. Some people call it style, I say Grisham should stick to his lawyerly knitting."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Bore","review":"This book was an unbearable bore. The only reason it sold is that Grisham wrote it. I have read all of his books, but I will think twice before buying another after this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A PAINTED HOUSE","review":"I have read all of John Grisham's books. What the hell was he thinking of when he wrote this one????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lowering standards","review":"I don't buy Mr Grisham's books anymore. His first works (Time to kill, the Firm...) showed an attention to details that's just not there anymore. His late work is much too unbelievable and has a taste of the unfinished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great...","review":"...for a Grisham book. Maybe it was because it was his first foray into non legal thrillers, for this book has nothing to do with law nor is in the least bit thrilling. The character development is decent, and that is all that it turned out to be--the book just seemed long and drawn out. Nothing dazzling here. I say skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Painted House","review":"Found this book extremely boring. Nothing really happens until you are two thirds through it. The last third of the book seems to be setting you up for the sequel. If this were someone else's novel, rather than John Grisham's, can't believe publishers would have ever considered it. Maybe they read the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I have loved all previous Grisham books. This one was so boring. Was this really written by Grisham??? Dont waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Painted a minor masterpiece","review":"I saw that a movie was made of this book and decided to give it a try. Who would have thought that John Grisham, king of the lawyer airport novels, had written such a moving American story. I think this will go down as his best book. This story has great scale and I love the way it was all tied together in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grabs Your ATTENTION...","review":"Unlike a few of the comments that I have read, I thought that this book really grabbed you attention (I read it straight through, non-stop).This book slightly reminds me of Salinger's Catcher in the Rye. You get an inside look at what is going on in the mind of a seven year old. Luke is always telling you how he feels and what his thinking is at the time. It is easy to sympathize with the characters in the book.All the while, various plots are opened up. A lot of these plots are just partially closed at the end of the book, leaving your mind to wander.Grisham uses both humor and despair well. There were times when I was rolling around on the floor and there were times when I could really feel for the characters.Overall, this is by far the best new book that I have read in the last year. Hope that you will enjoy it to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great departure from his norm","review":"This is completely different than any other John Grisham novel I have read (namely The Firm, The Client, A Time to Kill, and the Chamber) and is by far my favorite. You won't find a lawyer within a country mile of this story. Set in the 1950's in rural Arkansas, it details one hot summer in the cotton fields from the eyes of a young boy. There are no courtroom battles in this story, but the interactions and conflicts between the Mexicans, hill people, farmers and sharecroppers held my attention as well as any drama. The one flaw in the book was a slightly slow beginning. The reader did an excellent job giving the many characters distinguishable voices (which had to be difficult since most characters were adult men from Arkansas), although I did think one farmer sounded like Dale Gribble from King of the Hill (especially when addressing another main character, Hank)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't really like it!","review":"I have read almost all of Grisham's other tales. I knew not to expect the typical lawyer tale, but I could not get into this book. For me it did not have the substance that I was seeking. I was frankly bored by the tale of the mountain-people coming to town to help the farmers. It just did not have mystery, suspense, romance or anything captivating to me.If you like this kind of story, I guess it is good for what it is, but it definately wasn't for me. If I had skipped ahead and read the last chapter, I probably would have quit the book less than half way through.Sorry, but I just didn't like the story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment","review":"I love to read John Grisham's books, but here is one author who should stick to what he is good at; the law. \\"A Painted House\\" was one of the most boring books I have ever read. Characters were shallow and there was absolutely no plot. I wanted more. I expected more. It could have been a good story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected More...","review":"Grisham leaves fan wanting more from the Painted House. Have way through the book, he lost me. The characters tend to just fall off without any follow-up. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Painted House","review":"I am absolutely amazed by a 3 1/2 start average rating on The Painted House. I give it ONE star, at best.I have read all of Grisham's books. He blew it big time on The Painted House. It is the first time he has strayed from what made him a household name, the law. This book never captured my interest in any way. It had no theme. It was boring. In all other books I have read by Grisham I have had a hard time putting it down once I got into the meat of the subject. With Painted House, I skimmed just to finish it.My suggestion to Grisham is to stick to the law. I will probably read one more of his books because of what he has done in the past. Please, John, do what you do best, talk about lawyers, judges, prisons, or anything else related to the law."},{"rating":"1","title":"Precocious 7-yr old","review":"If you like violence, out-of-wedlock babies, floods, drought, and \\"minority\\" characters, then this is the book for you. If you know of 7-yr olds who have the maturity of a 15-yr. old, then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"As a Grisham fan, I was extremely disappointed with this book. I was worried about his deviation from the legal thriller when Skipping Christmas came out and was hesitant to read it. However, I was pleasantly surprised and when this book came out, I was a bit more eager though secretly wishing he would stick to his genre. After reading this book I am not even looking forward to reading The Summons (though I will). The character development was mediocre, the plot went nowhere, making you glad when the final page was in sight, though I wouldn't say it was an ending. Let's hope he can make a comeback, though I haven't been hearing the greatest about his new endeavor. Skip this one and possibly the next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed","review":"The story was beautfully told, but at times dragged on and on and on..... Can't believe I actually finished it. Frankly it was boring and left too many loose ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I spent two days reading this book and wondering when it was going to get to the point. Basically a \\"Farmers Almanac\\" of rural Arkansas cotton country in the 50's through the eyes of a 7 year old. A lot of would-be plots that never seem to blossom into anything and then vanish into the endless dialog of Cardinal games and cotton picking. Sorry...this was a Grisham disappointment. I only finished the book because I thought somewhere it would eventually tie together and make some sense, but the ending was the most bland and disappointing part of the book. I always keep the books I read, but this one goes to the used book store as a donation."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Can Not be Grisham","review":"If you are reading my review as a long time Grisham fan, I plan to give you insight to this book. First of all, I can tell you this book was only a hit because it had The name John Grishman on it. For all you fans out there, don't buy it. All you housewifes and grandma's this is your book. I've read every Grisham ever written, some of my favorites being The Pelican Breif, The Chamber, and A Time to Kill. Those are fast-paced books on Grishams topic; law. He has strayed so far from his genre of book, that we now see him writing about a little cotton pickin' boy that you'd almost think you'd see on a required reading list in middle school, next to the grapes of wrath. Sure-maye this is a good book, but not for the normal grisham fans. It looks like his next one 'skipping christmas' is along the same lines. I think I'm going to be missing my favorite author for awhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"A time for pseudonyms","review":"When I buy a book, I read the blurb and reviews and try to figure out if it's going to be a good read. When I buy an Author, I grab and go. John Grisham is no longer a grab and go. I am very disappointed by the lastest offering by Mr. Grisham. It's a bad as opening a new Clancy and finding poetry. It's like I've been robbed of time and money. If Grisham wants to experiment with style and genre, I think he should use a pen name. It's a cotton picking shame he had to flood the market with a dirt poor, down and out, out-of-character work. Now I've got to start vetting his work before buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was he thinking?","review":"I think if this book was written by someone other than John Grisham, it would not recieve the reviews it has been getting.Although I think it is great that the author has stepped out of his normal 'box' and written a non-legal story, I still found it to be very slow, and kept waiting for some sort of plot line to develop. Instead, the book just trods along, somewhat depressing, just like the characters in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have listened to my first instinct","review":"I haven't bought any of Grisham's legal \\"thrillers\\" in years, because I feel his writing has become increasingly more for the screen than for the reader. The only reason I picked this one up is that I thought it might recall some of his earlier, less commercial work. That being said, I found the story in The Painted House compelling at first, then as I got deeper into it, I started to wonder \\"where is this going?\\" That question was never answered. The story is nice, but there is no plot. The story just sort of...dribbles away. The \\"shattering secrets\\" Luke uncovers never have any discernable effect, either on the town or the story. I had more sympathy for the grandparents trying to make a go of it farming than the family that picks up and moves north, with the final image of a mother's self-satisfied smirk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ashley's Painted House","review":"John Grisham's A Painted House is a wonderfully written book. The style is similar to that of Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird. The story is told from a seven year old's point of view. This point of view adds a different dimension to A Painted House. Because Luke Chandler, 7, tells the story, simple work days turn into exaggerated and humorous adventures. Also the issue of each generation wanting more for their children is discussed in this book. Luke's mother longs to leave the farm so that her son will have more opportunities. Incorporating recurring issues is what makes a classic. I feel that in years to come this book might become a classic taught in high school English classes."},{"rating":"1","title":"What might have been","review":"I tried to like this book - really, I did. I just couldn't. Grisham tries to evoke the spirit of Scout from To Kill A Mockingbird and just fails miserably. Luke had the potential of being a wonderful creation, but never quite made it. The characters are poorly developed and the backstory is essentially nonexistent. Perhaps the failure lies in the sheer number of characters? The worst part is that I kept thinking that the book would get better and it didn't. I hate when that happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watching paint dry","review":"I have read all the John Grisham books available. I love them. I recommended them to all my friends until I read this one. This book is about as exciting as watching paint dry. I kept reading and reading waiting for the plot to pick up. It never did. In my opinion John Grisham needs to stick to the courtroom and lawyer storylines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Change For Grish","review":"Not being a huge fan of Grish, or really any modern fiction, I was a little sceptical reading this book but I needed something to read on the beach. It was done by the end of the day and I was impressed. I will admit he knows how to write a legal thriller but this is something worth reading. Its no Grapes of Wrath or anything like that, but its a good easy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simplicity at its best","review":"Truly a breath a fresh air for Grishim.

It read well, kept your interest and I enjoyed it very much. I was a smidgen unhappy with the \\"drop off the cliff\\" ending. That is,I had hoped to know a little bit more about where the characters ended up instead of \\"dropping them off of a cliff\\",(this is an analogy, not what actually happened) but all around it was a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Grisham I Know","review":"What a disappointment. After so many great thrillers and suspense novels from Mr. Grisham, \\"House\\" reads like Writing 101. Told first person by a seven year old, the novel covers a cotton pickin' season in Arkansas. Oh, and a house that needs painting. I missed the \\"coming of age\\" of young Luke Chandler that some reviewers rave about. Luke starts out as a seven year old, saw some nasty things, missed his brother Ricky, and dreamed of being a St. Louis Cardinal. We leave Luke after too many pages still seven years old, missing his brother and dreaming of being a Cardinal.After 250 pages I started skip reading then resorted to skipping pages. I don't think I missed anything. Maybe this was the \\"artistic\\" effort that some critics have wanted from the author. If so, you've got it out of your system, John, now please come back with the good stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs Down","review":"I like metaphores as much as the next guy, er, or girl. But this has got to be one of the most boring, uninspired book I've ever read with a title that is as shallow as the depth of this story. I understand that Grisham wanted to break out of the crusty-Lawyer vs the Big Bad Businesses kind of plot-letting, but this was more than I could stand. I knew going into it that it was much more laid back, no lawyers, no courtrooms...but what I was not expecting was a narrative of a 7 year-old boy (who's too young to think about sex) living on a farm with his reletives, each of which you never really get to know very well. Crops, rain, more crops, more rain, a one-paragraph murder, an illegitimate baby. No thanks. I think I'd rather watch the \\"paint dry\\" than to read \\"A Painted House\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A PAINTED HOUSE","review":"WHERE DID GRISHAM GO? I was extremely disappointed with this latest book. Enough already with Saturday outings into town, and enough already with picking cotton. The characters were dull and the events boring.What happened to plots like the \\"Pelican Brief\\" or \\"A Time To Kill\\"? I only bought this book because I collect first editions of Grisham's novels. I didn't want to break my collection.I wonder if Mr. Grisham has fallen asleep at the word processor. This book worked better than a sleeping pill at putting me to sleep. Hopefully the next one will keep me interested and awake."},{"rating":"1","title":"As fun to read as watching a painted house dry","review":"Grisham should stick to his legal dramas. It started with a lot of promise. Sadly, the characters were underdeveloped to say the least. I never felt any kind of emotion for anyone in the book. If he had wrote a few more chapters that developed the characters it would have been a much better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"DULL.....","review":"I hope that John Grisham returns to his regular genre with his next book. I always look forward to his new release in February as an escape from winter in Western New York, but this book was dull, slow and boring. I just kept reading to get to the end. I'm glad I borrowed this book from my public library and didn't waste my money on purchasing it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed...:(","review":"John Grisham gets such high accolades from many of my fellow readers, I just had to read one of his novels. Since \\"A Painted House\\" is historical fiction, my favorite genre, it was choice #1. Well fellow readers, I was so dissapointed. The book is so slow that it was like watching molasses drip from a jar. There were tidbits of sweetness, the only reason I continued on, but for the most part a slow, boring story. I will give Grisham another chance but not for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Painted House","review":"After reading all of John Grisham's novels A Painted House is a refreshing piece from this author. Readers who would expect to find lawyers and courtroom battles may be disapointed, however, I would urge everyone to read this novel. It is told throught the eyes of Luke Chandler a 7yr old farm boy and readers will not fail to be captivated, enchanted and moved by his experiences. His innocence, develoment and humour will envelop you and in its own way A Painted House is as much a page turner as Grisham's other best sellers. In summary A Painted House illustrates Grisham's ability to tell a diffrent kind of story, outside that of his typical genre, set in a rural farming community and told with a passion and conviction that charms ones heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Painted House","review":"I have read all of John Grisham's novels and have liked every one of them. In \\"A Painted House\\" Grisham once again proves that he ranks among the best story-tellers writing in America today. What a sweet, moving, touching and often laugh-out-loud-funny little book. They'll make a movie out of this one, folks. Loved it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I need a sequel","review":"I think the book was brillant in the descriptions of life in rural Arkansas and the people in the life of Luke Chandler. Being from a coal mining camp in the 50's, I could relate to the poverty and the closeness of family. I can also relate to the place religion played in the lives of all community members.I was disappointed in the ending because so many questions remained unanswered for the reader. I realize this was a literary ploy by Grisham to hold my interest beyond the last word of the last chapter. But it is so unfair! I was so caught up the lives and times of Luke that I feel betrayed.John, we need a sequel!!

Incessant yammering about the love of the St. Louis Cardinals, mom's garden, and Ricky's service in Korea propelled me skim the last third of the book. The seven year old protagonist sounded more like a twenty year old and had ideas far beyond those of any seven year old I have met. Grisham certainly captured the environment and hardships of farming life in the 50s; however, other than giving the reader a sense of a life that is not commonly part of most American's lives today this book is, quite simply,boring. The author opens many potentially interesting plot lines that all fizzle in the end. Nothing much develops from these plot lines; then again that may be Grisham's point and I am so obtuse I missed the \\"big picture.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching book","review":"This has been one of the best books that John has written,It tells a good story and keeps your interest high,GOOD BOOK !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work","review":"Just finished A Painted House and seeing as I have read all of Grisham's books I can honestly say \\"Not his best work\\". This books drags to a point of bordeom, however you keep reading thinking it will get better since all of John's books do at some point. Not sure what he was trying to do with this story, but he failed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Painted House","review":"This book was a major disappointment. It was a struggle to finish it. I am a big Grisham fan. I have read and loved all of his books. I eagerly awaited this one. I do not read reviews of his books before purchasing them. I felt totally deceived by the author. I had no idea what the book was about and assumed I was going to enjoy another of his books,as usual. From now on I will surely read reviews. I want his \\"old\\" stuff, the lawyers, the thrillers, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Painted House","review":"This book has unfortunately become the standard for which to base all of Grishams latest novels by. You keep looking for something interesting to happen which will propel you into an exciting adventure and it never happens. I have all of Grishams novels and I would rank this above only the Street Lawyer, only because it was the worst (short) story I have ever read. I think John Grisham should take some time off from writing to see if he has any more great novels left in him instead of pushing out sub standard novels like his last few."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me the old Grisham back!","review":"I am not impressed.

I had to smile as Luke tried to understand how the Sisco boy would go to heaven even though he never had to sit in church every Sunday like he had too. There are many wonderful scenes in the novel and won't expound on them. It's a great story for adults and young adults. And it's refreshing to read this \\"home grown\\" story from Mr. Grisham."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable, light read","review":"This is a simple story of a child in the cotton fields of Arkansas. Besides a good story, there is little to this book. I enjoyed the light read, but a thought-provoking dive into the complications of law this is not. Don't confuse this Grisham book with his other books. I can see how many Grisham fans would be disappointed and be left wanting more from a perfectly good tale. So, if you are searching for a fun read that will keep you busy then you have found it. I was actually happy to keep away from the law and more to a book that could be enjoyed by the young readers of Mark Twain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Same brush, new colors for writer John Grishim","review":"\\"A Painted House,\\" is an interesting story...very nicely plotted and subplotted and a nice change of pace for the author who is famous for writing legal tales of mystery and suspense.I appreciate him stretching out his new legs on this story about a young farm boy and one particulary tough summer.No law mentioned in here, which proves Grishim can write whatever he feels like writing about.Yeah, buy the paperback. It'll paint some pretty pictures in your head....if you saw it on TV already, that's okay.The book is much better .... really."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gorgeous change of pace!","review":"Bookstores often lump novels into \\"fiction and literature.\\" Grisham here has moved from fiction to literature, and with a bang. I was moved and delighted. The evocation of a time and a place, a way of life and a way of worship, is spectacular, and the story is consistently told thtough the young narrator's eyes...nothing happens that 7-year-old Luke didn't see directly, or hear about first hand. It left me wrapped in sunny warmth, and yet it has an empathetic sadness, and as much violence as any blood-thirsty reader could ask for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slowest Read Ever","review":"Go to the library to get the book. Then your only costs will be your time to obtain the book, gas to get the book, time to read the book, cost to return the book, and time to wonder why you read the book (although there is no cost for gas for doing that). If someone gives you the book - write your 'thank you' before you read it, otherwise, you'll put off writing the 'thank you' because you'll be wondering why and how to say 'thank you.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham is not Faulkner","review":"Grisham left the familar law environment and ventured into the world of sharecroppers and white trash which Faulkner did so well. He should have stuck to his familar area. This book did not hold my attention as the others did. A Time to KIll remains his best book ,in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"He gets \\"southern\\" right","review":"I love to read about the south from a real southerner.

I felt like I was reading about the Waltons, which I grew up watching and loved every episode. Good old holsum down home reading!!!! Shelley"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Reading","review":"Certainly a departure from Grishom's usual writing.I loved the book. You almost felt as if you were on the cotton farm with the young boy. It was apparent throughout the book that this was written by someone who had experienced first-hand all the hardships, friendships, and love generated during a less than luster crop season.Keep them coming, John. Also loved Skipping Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"His best work...","review":"I have to say that this one Grisham book surpasses all his other efforts. I wish we'd see more like this one from him. This is southern fiction at its best. I want to feel, smell, and breathe the south when I read a southern author who writes about the south; someone like Robert Paul Blumenstein in his bookFlirtin' with Jesusset in Richmond, VA. In A Painted House, I could smell the harvest air rising from the cotton fields late in the fall. And I've walked similar cotton fields in the Sand Hills of North Carolina; I was right back there in this book. Grisham is on par with the great southern authors from the past such as Flannery O'Connor and Faulkner with this masterpiece. I highly recommend you read it if you yearn for a heaping helping of southern fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"A painted house","review":"Honestly, I could not wait for this book to end.

Thank you John Grisham for reminding me how bountiful the simpler times were.Audio performer, David Lansbury, did a brilliant reading; vocally distinguishing Grisham's many colorful characters. All in all, a very entertaining and enlightening story. Although simple, remembering how complex and blown out of proportion incidents seemed to me as a child, was the most wistful, sentimental feature of this read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Surprise From An Icon","review":"I have been a John Grisham fan from the get go. Never missed a book. I was quite willing to accept that his talents went beyond the legal. I was wrong!The book is a disaster! It is a total bore.

I found the prose boring, along with the story line and plot, what there was of one. This was definitely not in the style to which I and others have become accustomed. Do not waste your money. If you do feel obliged to spend some, please donate instead to your favorite charity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!","review":"I'm a big Grisham fan, but I knew this wasn't going to be the typical legal thriller and was looking forward to the change. Unfortunately, Grisham should just stick to his formula. A Painted House was boring, predictable, and unrealistic. Luke, the 7-year-old narrator, sounds too much like Grisham and not enough like a 7-year-old boy. I believe this is supposed to be a touching coming-of-age story, but that theme has been done much more justice in many other books, namely Catcher In The Rye. Grisham had a formula that worked, he should stick to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"Most readers have favourite authors and buy their books without reading the reviews because they know the genre. If you're a Grisham fan and are intending buying this book for those reasons - don't. I find it difficult to believe that Grisham wrote this tedious and frankly boring book. The subject matter has been done to death, the plot - such as it is - goes nowhere and when eventually finished, you're left wondering why you bothered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"I am a huge Grisham fan. I have read all his books, and never complained about one. However, his latest book \\"A Painted House\\" was a huge disappointment. Before buying this book, I thought it was extremely clever of Grisham to try something new and different, and I couldn't wait to read it. On retrospect, he should stick to what he knows best. The book lacks any purpose, plot or substance. It was a simple story which lacked any real suspense. If you are looking for a book that is easy to read and which requires little thought, than this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"... like watching a painted house dry","review":"In a word boring. Want another word: pointless. This is the most boring book I have ever read cover to cover. Normally I'd give up earlier on a turkey like this, but hey it was a long flight and Grisham's are always entertaining... or so I thought.Let me save you the trouble. Story line in brief:. young boy grows up in rural cotton country. help arrives in the summer. two murders happen. suspense builds, until key characters disappear for good. rains wash away crops. family leaves rural cotton countryYes that's it. If you'd like to learn how boring cotton farming is- buy the book. If you like books with plot, entertainment value, character development and some occassional suspense, pass this one by."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm tired of waiting for something to happen","review":"I picked up this book yesterday with hopes of classic John Grisham. I am now at page 86 and am thoroughly bored. I came to this web site to see if it was worth dogging through the book.All that has happened so far, is an intricate story-telling of hiring workers and picking cotton. I'm not sure I can make it through another chapter.Maybe I'll pick it up again tomorrow, and try again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Painter House","review":"Of all the books John Grisham I think this is the most boring and mundane book I have ever read. The only reason I finished it was because I actually thought it would imrove. I will not buy any more of his books untill someone else whose opinion I trust reads it first. I felt this was a waste of time and money! Do not recommend this book to anyone I know!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Re-title this to \\"How I Spent My Summer\\" by Luke C., Age 7","review":"In essence the book was about the summer experience of Luke Chandler, a seven year old. The book contained observations and story-line introductions but no resolutions or endings to dilemmas that had been introduced during the telling. It was a decent read, the writing definitely had a nostalgic flavor and a nice feel, but there was no real story. Therefore, there was no real ending. It is too bad, the characters and their situations held potential for a good story - but it all fell way short at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story Never Takes Off","review":"Grisham leaves the courtrooms for cotton fields in what appears to be an attempt to write a Faulkner-type tale. The author does live up to his reputation as an inventive, plot-driven storyteller, but bottom line is this book does more exploring the fact that farming is a tough gig than it does creating a riveting work of fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, not worth the money","review":"This book put me to sleep.

There is no story line and little action."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"A very disappointing effort from an otherwise outstanding author. Very slow-moving novel without a strong or clear plot. The author has not risen to his usual excellence in this work. Worth reading only if you have a keen interest in cotton picking in the early '50s and a rather unremarkable story of day-to-day living in rural Arkansas. The book most likely will be a profitable for the author and the publisher because of the author's reputation, not the quality of the book itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLOW, SLOWER, SLOWEST","review":"This was the slowest most boring book I have read in along time. Please don't waste your time. It starts out slow, never gets going and then unbelievably crashes to a stop on the last page mercifully. There is absolutely no plot or action in this book. It's as exciting as watching paint dry literally."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!","review":"Well, was I surpised. Mr. Grisham has certainly changed gears on this one. After reading and thoroughly enjoying the suspense and characters of his previous novels, I was quite disappointed in this one. Ok,Ok, life on a cotton farm in the 50's was no great way to grow up but this book didn't quite captivate me. I don't find any interest in a 7 year old boy watching a 14 year old girl take a bath in the river. The characters are explained in depth but are not followed through to the end. What happens to Ricky, Miguel and his new wife, the family they take in from the flood,etc. And what does painting the house have to do with anything! I guess he is setting us up for the sequel. I did enjoy the baseball references and will probably read any future books of his just based on his past endeavors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham's worst - so far","review":"After reading all of Grisham's stories, I was truely disappointed of this one. Nice story-telling, but not a great plot, no great characters, no suspense, no surprises. I admit, he did some research before he wrote this book. But you can feel the pressure of writing yet another bestseller, without having any idea of a story to tell. Never mind, if your name is Grisham, the book will sell. And if a story like this sells, he is likely to write more of the same. Heck, if you can write bestsellers without a plot, why should you try to find one? I bet his next book will be even worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Mr. Grisham would have been better served to write this under a different name. Those of us who savor \\"Grishams\\" will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I do not normally read Grisham as I am not enthralled by his writing of things legal, but this was our book club selecttion and I read it. I too kept waiting for something exciting or interesting even to happen, and it never did. Had I not needed to finish it for discussion sake at our Book club meeting, I would have quit it. The end was a let down as well. So Grishman did not get a fan when he deviated from his norm...Boo hiss!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Painted House Paints a new Picture of Grisham","review":"I was pleasantly surprised with A PAINTED HOUSE. Grisham, in my opinion, showed a side of his talent that brought to mind Steinbeck or James Lee Burke. Very descriptive tale of a seven year old boy, and life on a cotton farm in rural Arkansas in the early '50s. Not a lawyer in sight!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Innocence Lost","review":"The book started slow and easy but I really ended up enjoying this slice of American life, circa 1952 on the cotton farms of Arkansas. Hard to imagine the harshness of this life and the blood sweat and tears that is poured into farming America's Heartlands. A very good read for urbanites. The story of a tough life for a seven year old who sees too much and needs to keep too many secrets. I would enjoy a sequel to this novel. Up \\"North\\" as seen through the eyes of Luke. In an age where everything is fast & explosive, its nice to take in a \\"little story\\". This is one worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I truly believe if I had written this book, no one would have published it. Talk about resting on your laurels. My advice for John Grisham is to stick with what you do best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite Disappointing","review":"Frankly, I expected much more from this book after reading other books from him. This time, Grisham veers totally away from law and instead plunges himself to write about a boy, Luke Chandler, growing up in rural Arkansas.After a whole bit of introduction and description, I was expecting some form of suspense and mystery abounding. Yet, as I kept reading, I didn't feel the least excited or scared. The story took expected turns and even the murders weren't really exciting.I was really disappointed and raced along trying to find some form of suspense but never found any. It left me with a bitter taste in the mouth after i finished reading it.Perhaps the only salvaging part is grisham's good description and style of writing which made the sotry bearable and not boring. Still, i was quite disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham has lost it","review":"Grishman latest is not even a pot boiler. The pot never boils. If one is interested in a day to day events of a rather dull life--this book is for you. It is a shame when Grisham has written so many good and eventful books that he has dwscended to this level. Has he run out of material??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an Accurate story","review":"This is one of John Grisham's worst books. He should have stuck to what he knows - law. He tried to paint a picture of rural life on an Arkansas farm and went into so much detail about the family's daily activities. However, he left out one important aspect -- the animals! He alleged to cows and chickens because they had to gather eggs and milk in the morning. At the end he mentions they butcher a hog once a year. But never in his story are these animals taken care of. Why so much detail for mundane things but an important part of a farm is left out! Does no one attend to these animals? They never even mention the cost of feed when saying they will be short for the year. Totally unrealistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am a Grisham fan, having read all of his books, thus far. The ending was as disappointing as the story itself. Not his usual intense work holding the reader spellbound from beginning to end. Get back on track Mr. Grisham, and please no sequil to \\"A Painted House\\", though I seem to be in the minority in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"non-eventful","review":"Being an avid Grisham reader I always snap up a copy of his latest novel in order to be carried away, if for only a short time, in fast action, suspense and puzzle-solving. Although this book is of course well written, I have been sorely dissappointed in the plot - or lack of one. I read Grisham books in order to be swept away and this one swept me in a corner with nowhere to go but to sleep. When I was half way through the book clinging only to two fights and a bare chest for excitement, I began to lose interest. I wish I had borrowed it from the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what your used to but...........","review":"It's great! Go into it with an open mind and you'll love it.

Though the book was written well, it came out of the blue for him. I enjoyed all of his other books and I consider myself to be an avid Grisham fan. I was however, disappointed in the off the wall story line of this book. I would like to see Mr. Grisham go back to writing books like his earlier ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodbye John Grisham...","review":"I read Grishams previous book, The Brethren and swore off reading Grisham again, to me he had taken the path oft travelled and became formulaic.

Anyhow this has nothing to do with his latest book other than I won't be buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star: generous","review":"I am a huge fan of Grisham. But having lent my brand new copy to another Grisham fan before I myself read it, I now feel the need to do penance, thus my first review here. Oh. My. God. This is one tedious, uninspired and plain badly written book, filled with plots and characters ripped off from other books as if they were so many bolls of cotton to stuff in that mile-long sack. I too forced myself to read it - get the darned story over with - it's Grisham after all, and the book is a hardcover - but it left a bad taste in my mouth every time. I'm convinced Grisham's heart was in it about five percent, otherwise he wrote it because it's in his contract to keep churning out books. I picture him sitting agonized and hot and bored at his desk at his bedroom window like a high school student writing that last essay for English class so he can get outside for the summer and play baseball."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Grisham","review":"I have read most of John Grisham's book and find them hard to put down. I have been attempting to read this one for weeks. I keep putting it down and no longer have the desire to pick it up again. If you are expecting the typical Grisham suspense novel, this is not it. This is not what I have come to expect from Grisham. I found this book very dry and difficult to get through because of the lack of any plot or action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snooze fest","review":"Someone else said it was like watching paint dry.

I found myself (much like I did with The Catcher in the Rye)reading only because I kept waiting for something monumental to happen, which never did. There were no surprises in this story, save one, which was about as shocking as pissing on an electric fence and then realizing it's not electric afterall. Plus, when Grisham dropped this \\"bomb\\" on me, I didn't even give a damn because by then it was such a tiny part of the story. My advice is to read something else by John--anything else--and feed this one to the fireplace."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sequel would change my mind.........","review":"I don't wish to undermine this book as it was a page turner for me. I was totally caught up in the characters. However, the ending was most disappointing for me. The story lines were just not \\"wrapped up\\". I always enjoy a book that leaves me wanting for more, but unless there is a sequel in the works, this one just left me feeling a little cheated out of a complete ending.

Don't get me wrong, I read my fair share of books. I just like it when they have some sort of a... I don't know...PLOT! This book just rambles on and on. So many parts in the book could have become something interesting, but none of them ever did. The worst part is that the only character I ever felt anything at all for was Ricky, who doesn't even appear in the book. He's only mentioned.And the ending of the book was awful as well. It was filled with loose ends and left me wondering. Nothing was ever resolved. This book had no point."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Painted House","review":"Good book. Vaguely reminds me of \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\". I would have rated it 5 stars except for 2 things. One, Grisham seems somewhat unsure of himself with this writing. Maybe because there are no lawyers in this book. Two, Luke, the seven year old. No matter how I try I can't seem to wrap my heard around the maturity inflicted on this boy by Grisham. I don't know too many 40 year olds that think that deeply about things.Overall, a very nice story though. I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"...and one to remember...","review":"I don't know whether \\"A Painted House\\" is a good book. I believe, it is his \\"Misery\\".No, he doesn't come close to Truman Capote, who really didn't care, if it sold...I do believe that Stephen King is a major writer.I do beliebe that Martha Grime always had to say more than just whodunnits - inspector Jury had to solve.If it wasn't 'a Grisham', it would probably never have been published. Which would be a loose.I imagine his publisher urging him to do another legal thriller, his environment telling him: Do another one.Not giving him the time to write what he was about to write.His Chistmas book dwindeled.Noone wants him to be a father and a caring, average human being."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Painted House","review":"Sorry.

The story of a poor Arkansas farming family is told from the seven year old boy Luke. The story centers on the families cotton farm and the difficulties they have with their hired workers, the spurills and some migrant Mexicans. With a combination of murder and the everyday trials of farm life this book makes for a very exciting read. I highly reccomend the book to anyone who enjoys a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Painted House","review":"This is the first non-lawyer Grisham novel I have read. As with most of his books, it was easy to read. But, in the end, he blew it. As others have complained, the ending goes nowhere. He had an opportunity to make a moral statement about the seven-year old boy's concealment of secrets, including murder, throughout the novel. In the end, the only thing the reader is left with is \\"Small boy lies, gets away with it, and moves out-of-town. Appears to learn nothing about life other than occasionally you can get away with deceit.\\" As with too many post-modern novels, there is, in the end, nothing at all for the reader to contemplate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story!!","review":"If you like John Grisham, I would definitely recommend this book. Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely read","review":"Stopped reading J Grishm years ago, but I really liked this story. Discriptions of work & people v believable. Sad story . Iwould recommend this book to my friends , may buy a few as gifts for Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"A marvelous read","review":"A great tale from a young boys perspective. Defenately hard to put down and when I did, I couldn't wait to rejoin him in the cotton fields of his home county."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck was that","review":"The rules of these reviews prevent me from using profanity, so excuse the lame title. This book had no plot, no ending, and no reguard for the readers intellegence. The main charictor thinks and acts 10 years older than the book claims he is. Each chapter is about an average event that should have been reduced to a paragraph. Usually I enjoy a Grisham book, but I had to force myself to read this one waiting for something to happen. It seems that he tried to write a charictor developement book that would make you feel as if you knew each one of the charictors intimatly, however, in the end I really cared less about what happened to these people because they still felt like strangers. Grisham needs to stick with courtroom drama's and leave whatever type of writing you would call this alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy if you're looking for a legal thriller!","review":"When Grisham's The Firm was released, it was the first fiction book I read in many, many years. He convinced me that I could really enjoy reading a book. I got hooked on legal thrillers. Buying this book, Painted House, was a huge mistake. It's not a legal thriller. Nevertheless, I kept hoping it would grab my interest, but it didn't. I tossed out the book after reading about 1/2 of it (and checking the ending to make sure I wouldn't miss anything by tossing it out)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something?","review":"So many people have said A PAINTED HOUSE is an excellent work. Even Grisham has said it's one of his favorites. So why did I feel so let down by this book? It's a sweet story; it does evoke a time and place beautifully. We come to see and care for the characters. All the elements are in place for a true classic...and then the plot goes no where. Without giving too much of the story away, let me suggest some of the themes that begged for conclusion: race relations; class distictions; crime and punishment; truth-telling vs. secret-keeping. I can not recommend this book. And it certainly is not in the same league as TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD."},{"rating":"2","title":"i'm from eureka springs","review":"I loved this book. It is too bad that everyone has the tendency to compare it to Grisham's other works when its apples and oranges. Having a rural, 50's, backgroud yourself helps you relate. Maybe that's the reason some didn't care for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want to be a rural farmer?","review":"If you were considering a move to rural America to experience the thrills of owning your own private farm, then this book is a must read. Otherwise choose another book!Most Grisham books are captivating. I really enjoyed \\"The Firm\\", \\"The Partner\\" and \\"The Summons\\". While \\"A Painted House\\" is a well told literary story, I actually found it quite boring. My guess is he wrote it to proove to himeself and maybe his peers that he can write as well as other authors even in the absence of a compelling story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a lawerly story, but an interesting tale nonetheless...","review":"I picked up the novel being an avid Grisham fan from the older series of The Firm, The Chamber, The Pelican Brief, etc. And I was quite suprised to see an entire departure from these forms of story. However, I found the book to be a page-turning mystery of interest to me and thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Painted House - down the road","review":"I was so very excited about the A Painted House when I heard about it. The story takes place just down the road from where I grew up. Black Oak, Ar. is about 4 miles from my families farm. Mr Grisham's family owns the land next to my Dad's so you can understand my excitement. The book was very well written as are all of his books and it brought back many memories of my childhood. I even learned some things I did not remember. I look forward to each new book John Grisham puts out, as each one seems to be a little better than the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"A god damn boring book with no plot at all","review":"I was very disappointed with this book as it was god damn boring.I was very patient with the book and i waited for the plot to develop.However,there isn't a plot at all and the characters were poorly developed.The story just rambled on and on about how hard farm life is.Don't pick up this book unless u are really a fan of his...."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZZ","review":"I can review this book in one word - BORING!!!! About one hundred pages into it and it's all I can do to keep reading. I'll finish it, but it won't be easy. For all the reviewers who liked this book and call it his best, this book can't hold a flame to A Time To Kill. There's nothing in this story to hold your attention. It's like lying under a hot summer sun. Ten minutes and you're falling asleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham! Stick with what you do best!","review":"A very sad story about sharecroppers. Reminded me of an Oprah Book. If I hadn't purchased the book myself, I would have sworn it was absolutely not a Grisham."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"I am a big Grisham fan but this book was not worth the cost. I quit reading about half way through because I lost total interest in the story line and the characters. The story line was dull and exceedingly boring. When I reached the point that I did not care what happened to the seven year old protagonist or his family it was time to give this book away."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"The story line was frustrating. I found it very hard to believe that a seven year old boy could be a part of so many secrets and not be overwhelmed! The ending, or lack thereof(!), was especially disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ending? What ending?","review":"This started out very interesting reading. The world from a 7 year old's view was natural and refreshing and the could reader empathize with fantasies of the Cardinals, the hot sun while picking cotton and his fears and curiosity about the hill and Mexican people. Tension builds between groups, the little boy is burdened with secrets no adult could reasonably cope with, from violence to outright murder, yet in the end, there is no resolution for the reader to \\"end\\" the story. Just a resolution that grandpa and boy will carry a secret to their graves....oh, come on! It seemed the author just had to foist on some simplistic conclusions at the end that Mexican and hill people really are basically nice people, all in the same boat to struggle, and work and survive Arkansas in the 1950's.Very disappointing. I would not recommend this to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Read","review":"The Painted House by John GrishamI read it because I was curious to see how well Grisham could pull off a \\"legalless\\" environment novel. I'm quite happy that I did because I really enjoyed it.The story is told by a seven year old farm boy, Luke Chandler. Don't let this be a turnoff. Luke has the insight, thoughts and feelings of someone (Grisham, perhaps (?)) well beyond seven years.I'm very relieved that I did not have to grow up in the early 1950's Arkansas cotton country. Grisham brings the reader very close to those hard times. Even the St. Louis Cardinal radio games were marred because the Cards were playing second fiddle to the Dodgers and Giants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story!","review":"I thought this book has to rank as one of Grisham's best novels. Having grown up in a similar rural area as Grisham and the characters in this novel, I felt like I was transformed back in time. This is the type of book that you wish would never end. The details and language are a joy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Painted House","review":"This book starts out very slow. Keep reading as the heat of Arkansas draws you into the storyline. One of his best books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding, beautiful story","review":"I purchased this book as a gift to myself for vacation. I was a little worried since I knew it wasn't a \\"legal thriller\\", but I was so pleasantly surprised by this refreshing story narrated by a young 7 year old boy. I thoroughly enjoyed it, equally as much as every other Grisham book, and eagerly await the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Grisham at his finest","review":"This is my absolute favorite John Grisham novel. Reading this book took me back to the time when my mother was growing up (she also spent her childhood picking cotton with her family). Although the ending kind of leaves you hanging, it's a very good story that keeps you interested right up to the very end."},{"rating":"2","title":"DIFFERENT FOR GRISHAM","review":"This was a pretty solid book a good read but a definite turn from the typical john grisham novel. If this is your first grisham novel to read do not judge the rest of them by it. Wish grisham wuld put out a book a little more often"},{"rating":"2","title":"A different type of novel, but still very good","review":"I would agree with the previous reviewers who said that if you are looking for the typical Grisham novel, you are not going to get it here.With that said, This is still an outstanding novel. The character development is very good, and this novel will give you a new appreciation for those who make their living in farming.There are two minor weaknesses with this novel. The plot is a little slow in getting started, and the novel is probably inappropriately titled. A Cotton Harvest may have been a more appropriate title. A Painted House does not really encompass the story the way Grisham's previous titles encompassed his previous stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK story, but lacking that Grisham suspense I expected.","review":"The book totaly lacked suspense and at times was very slow. I have read every Grisham book, and all, with exception to Painted House where gripping legal stories with plot twist after twist. This book is simply a story about a kid growing up on a farm who wants to someday play baseball for the Cardinals. Outside of that, the rest of the 360 pages don't do much for you. Lucky I read it all in one night, or else I might not have picked it back up."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Painted House","review":"Totally surprised by this book. All I could do to read it, and it normally takes 1-2 days to read a John Grisham book. Didn't like it at all and wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Wait","review":"There are only a few authors that I look forward with anticipation for their new books. John Grisham is one. Although I certainly could have waited a lot longer for this one. This book seems to encompass the same day throughout. It plots along and in some places, drags along. There is never edge-of-your-seat action. It gets to the point of \\"who cares\\". I had to stop 3 times and read another book in between. My advice is to wait for the paperback and then try it. John Grisham should go back to what he does best, legal thrillers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst yet","review":"I've enjoyed all Grisham books except The Street Lawyer so far, but this one is a sleeping pill. Only one word discribes it best. Boring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"It is understandable that Grisham has chosen to deviate from his usual story line. Unfortunately, it didn't work. I usually read a Grisham novel in 24 hours. This one took a week! Even though the book had many of the same elements of his previous novels, it lacked the excitement and I missed the ambition usually shown by the characters. I still love this author and I'll buy his next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible! Dull! Boring!","review":"There are no words to say how awful this book is. I could't finish it. I'm assuming this book was sold to a publisher because of Mr. Grisham's name, not for the story content. If there was a -1 that would have been my rating. Pass this one up and don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"FIRST BAD GRISHAM","review":"This book reminded me of the Grapes of Wrath. It was told through the eyes of a seven-year-old. I kept waiting for something intriquing, some twist something like Grisham's books always have. It was so boring that it was hard to finish. I hope the next book is more interesting than whether a house is painted or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful surprise","review":"I've read and enjoyed most of Grisham's legal thrillers to date, and checked this one out with some trepidation as I recall hearing that not only was it not his usual genre, but it just wasn't quite up to his usual standards. Well, I just finished it and I'm hoping he'll write a sequel! What a delight. Engaging style, intriguing characters, plenty of suspense, good humor, moments of sadness, ideal pace, even learned more about cotton farming than I'd ever known. And to top it off, baseball sprinkled liberally throughout, though I'm not a Cardinals fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic Local Color","review":"A nice read that gave me a glimpse into my father's childhood and the struggles my grandparents faced as sharecroppers. The novel does not reach a dramatic climax but rather has the rolling up's and down's of realism. The immersion into local color makes it a worthwhile read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A slice of life","review":"This book gave an interesting picture of what is was like to live in the 1950's in rural America with almost no money. Life was hard for sure for the Chandlers and for those who lived around them or came to help to pick cotton. But there was also a lot of caring evident for family and for others. I would have liked for some of the loose ends to be tied up, to know what happened to some of the characters, but maybe that was left to the imagination on purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reading","review":"This book is easy reading. Each chapter keeps one intrigued. It is written in first person, from the eyes of a young boy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing Grisham","review":"I love reading Grisham novels because you usually know what you're going to get--a good, albeit somewhat predictable read. (I love a good plot-driven novel.) A Painted House is more of a character study of a young boy with some good drama and a murder thrown in, but not really a mystery. The perspective is delightful and the characters more well rounded than is usual for Grisham. What's more, the plot keeps the story moving. I wouldn't call this a \\"Grisham\\" novel, but rather, a delightful novel by Grisham."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written, but ending does not thrill me","review":"I've read a few Grisham and I love him. I was really into this book and kept wondering how it was going to end. I'll explain without spoiling: it doesnt have a dramatic conclusion. The ending makes it real though, like Luke is going on with his life instead of some obviously fictional crazy ending.It was written very well; I really felt the emotions Luke went through. It's a great book to read if you're interested in how life on a cotton farm was back before there were many painted houses, t.v.s, and corn syrup filled foods. It reminded me to be thankful for what I have and that vanity is fleeting. Makes me want to enjoy simple things like the weather more.If you want a good book that doesnt have you on the edge of your seat but is very real read it. If you're looking for suspense, this is not your book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not your typical Grisham","review":"this is not what you expect to get with a Grisham novel. there is no plot, at all. it is an interesting book if you are interested in life in the rural south in the 1950's. I grew up in the rural south around this era and was familiar with much of what was discussed in the book. it was nostalgic and often humorus but not what i look for from Mr. Grisham."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"I bought this book because I have read all of Grisham's books. I left it on the shelf forever and kept putting off reading it because I didn't think I would like it. I was so wrong. It was amazing. This book could become a classic - you could very well see this on the high school reading lists someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"The easy style of Grisham, with a great new storyline!","review":"I've always found John Grisham's writing style a nice, comfortable read. His legal stories have been great books to read on the plane or when traveling. \\"A Painted House\\" continued in that easy, comfortable style, with a storyline that was more personal and intriguing to read. Told through the eyes of a 7-year-old, this story demonstrates the demons that can haunt a child when they are thrown into a grown-up world, full of secrets and tough decisions. I loved the way Grisham supports the child as often the wisest one in the family regarding when to \\"tell the secrets\\" and when it is better to not share things with anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great story by a great storyteller!","review":"I live in Jonesboro, Arkansas, a city that figures prominently in the plot of this book. Having grown up within a few miles of the setting of this book, I can say that Mr. Grisham tells a wonderful story that paints not only a house, but also paints an accurate picture of growing up in a simple Southern culture that is fading into history. \\"A Painted House\\" is more than just a story of a farm family struggling to get by...it's the story of a culture where a young boy is forced to deal with the pressures of keeping secrets and telling lies. Personal secrets build on family secrets...lies are told to cover secrets...and the young narrator finds himself caught between his desire to protect his family, and the fear of hell fire. Readers accustomed to the action, suspense and drama of Grisham's previous works might not enjoy this one as much, but I found it to be a great story, and a great word picture of the culture I know well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Kind of Grisham","review":"I read this in serialized form in \\"Oxford\\" magazine..... Good story, but I had no trouble waiting for the next installment. The 7 year old central character was delightful, but other characters were flat and somewhat dull. I kept waiting for some spark that never came. Grisham is a favorite of mine and I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"dISAPPOINTING!","review":"John Grisham is a talented writer...but you'd never know it from this book. This must be the season for \\"old times\\" books...but Baldocci did it much better! The book is slow to start and only has a couple of minor interesting sections. While normally I read a book straight through, I kept putting this one down to reread another favorite..even one of Grisham's. Gave mine to the senior's library! It will probably help them go to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what you expect from grisham","review":"I was extremely dissapointed in the book-it was nothing like the Grisham books I have loved in the past. This is not in any way lawyer or crime related. It is just a simple book about simple people in a pretty simple way of life. I'd say pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham is not Faulkner","review":"Grisham ventures out of his familar environment of law and into world of sharecroppers and white trash which Faulkner did so well.He should have stuck with the familar, he's definitely not in Faulkner's class with these topics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Grisham","review":"The reason I buy John Grisham's books is because of the subject matter, legal thrillers. That's what I like and that's what he does best. This type of book didn't interest me and I hope he goes back to what he does best."},{"rating":"1","title":"No lawyers in this, thank God","review":"Well Grisham had tried something new and it sells because of his name. There is a murder and \\"mystery\\" on a rough and tumble setting. I prefer a mystery that makes me think a bit after I finish the book. This does not. A much more provocative read is Defenders of the Holy Grail by Ken Agori."},{"rating":"2","title":"the painted house","review":"I'd gotten a little disappointed in Grisham lately because I thought his writing had become second rate. This was a delightful book, sure not the \\"usual Grisham you were expecting. But what a well written slice of our past in America"},{"rating":"2","title":"A book I would read, if I read books.","review":"An excellent audio book. As a daily commuter, this book was a real stress reliever. All Grisham books have been good, but I enjoyed this one the most so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable With No Surprises","review":"A nice coming-of-age story even if nothing really happens. The Chandler's joys and sorrows draw you in for a quick, comfortable read. I'm always impressed with Grisham's writing style. He is, perhaps, the most readable author out there. Sometimes your brain just needs that...a book that just washes over you with no tough words or situations to figure out. If you enjoy this type of story, let me also recommend \\"Boy's Life\\" by Robert R. McCammon, \\"The Barrens\\" by Joe R. Lansdale, \\"The Body\\" by Stephen King, \\"The Travelling Vampire Show\\" by Richard Laymon, and the grandmother of all coming-of-age stories, \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" by Harper Lee. (Shame on you if you haven't read that last one)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Apples & Oranges","review":"If you're into reading the quick-scene, fast-action novels that are typical of Grisham, you're likely to be disappointed with this one.The only other Grisham novel I've read was The Brethren--entertaining, but not literary. Comparing A Painted House to The Brethern is like comparing Gone With the Wind to The Terminator. I'm not saying one is better or worse than the other. It's a matter of accomplishing a different goal, which appeals to different interests and tastes.Personally, I enjoy the quick-scene, fast-action novels, but I prefer the literary beauty of A Painted House much more. Considering that Grisham has a different goal with A Painted House, I believe he was quite successful in this arena and hope to see more like this from him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This was a pretty weak storyline. I am usually a Grisholm fan, but this left me a little disappointed. The novel drags on without many captivating scenes.With all the great novels out, including some other Grisholm books, I would recommend a pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"No plot? Hmm. I think you need to read it again.","review":"I'm surprised by the reviewer who gave this a rating of one, and stated there was no plot.The plot is that of a boy who loves his family, but must keep secrets far bigger than his age. We see the beauty of the relationship between family members. We see the reality and starkness of cotton farming in rural Arkansas, and the prejudice between races and economic status. The reader hears through a boy's story how a city mother has adapted to the country and an unpainted house, when her heart longs for the city and the finer things of life. And that's just the surface issues.No plot? Maybe you should rent a video instead. You missed the heart of this beautifully-written story."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the ending?","review":"1ST let me say I love John Grisham but this was not one of his best works. It was if the story just ended. You want to see what happens to the characters when you read a book and this one just left you hanging. Not one story line was finished. You get to a point in the book and think it must be coming up...then you realize you only have 20 pages left and he can't tie up all the loose ends. The ending of this book was a big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightfully different","review":"I am not a Grisham fan. I read The Testament and felt it was a flat meaningless story. I borrowed A Painted House because I really did not notice the author at the time. Although I finished the book a week ago, parts of it are still in my mind. Like another reviewer, I LIVED those six weeks of picking cotton. I wanted my husband to read it, my 12 year old son to read it, etc. Maybe it didn't solve race relation issues or tie up loose ends neatly, but I never expected it to; life doesn't. There are few books that transported me to a setting as well as Grisham's did. I hope he has more like this one in him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham seems to have re-discovered his talent for writing","review":"I picked up this book with a lot of skepticism, having found Grisham's last several books to be too formulaic and missing the 'spark' of A Time to Kill, The Firm and The Pelican Brief. But I was pleasantly surprised!It seems that the genre shift from legal thriller to novel was just the thing that John Grisham needed to get back his voice. A great book (although definitely NOT the typical John Grisham fare)-- I'd definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"Different from the courtroom and the Caymans but a typically fantastic Grisham, nonetheless! Super characters, great story - what can one say? If you like Grisham (except Skipping Christmas), then you won't be disappointed in A Painted House."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is not your typical John Grisham book. When I started reading it, I didn't know anything about it. By the end, I was crying because it so moved me. I truly enjoyed this book. It's written from the perspective of a young boy who doesn't completely understand everything that's going on around him. I really enjoyed that aspect of the story because it's so different from so many other books out there, expecially other John Grisham books. If you just read Grisham for the lawyers and courtroom antics, you won't want to read this book, but if you want to read an excellent book, I truly recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Painted House","review":"Pretty amazing that this story is told from the perspective of a seven year old. Different from other Grisham books."},{"rating":"2","title":"not your typical john grisham","review":"i read this book when it was first published and foolishly gave it away. i bought it a second time to read again on vacation. it is a beautifully written story capturing the summer of a boy's life in a past era. it's somewhat reminiscent of \\"to kill a mockingbird\\" (yes it's that good). there isn't a lawyer anywhere in it, yet it is perhaps grisham's finest work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good...except for the narrator","review":"A wonderful tale, well told. Place is evoked and people are brought to life--including excellent dialog.The downside: Telling the story through the eyes of a seven-year old boy is difficult, particularly when Grisham attributes to him much more adult thoughts and feelings. His attraction to a teen-aged girl is very unlikely and his philosphical ponderings just are not appropriate for a boy that young.My suggestion: Read it with the mindset that the boy is about 12, a more likely age for what he thinks and for his emotions."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wanted more.","review":"I'm not a fan of Grisham's normal work,(actually it's more the genre than his writing)but I have enjoyed his \\"off-genre\\" tales. A Painted House, however is my favorite so far. I hope he writed more novels away from the legal thriller realm. The author did a nice job of writing from a seven year old's point of view. If I have a complaint it is that I wanted more at the end of the book. (especially on Luke's uncle) but I won't say more for fear of spoiling the book for others. Overall a good pleasant read and a good insight into that time and place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Author successfully changes genres","review":"I enjoyed this coming of age story of Luke set in rural Arkansas. It was a welcomed departure from the lawyer books and took me back to the fifties which appeals to all aging baby boomers born prior to 1950. It reminded me in scenery of Cold Mountain and also Baldacci's The Wishing Well which was another coming of age story written from the voice of a 12-year old girl. I would suggest that Grisham is capable of writing in multiple genres and he can continue with Luke and follow him into adulthood as a first-year law student. Many possibilities abound in this semi-autobiographical tale of young Luke. A good read. Keep it up John."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Grisham may enter the world of the great american novel","review":"The beautiful texture and nuances of a young Luke's mind is written with ease and reality. THE PAINTED HOUSE reminded me of Faulkner and Cather's novels THE SOUND AND THE FURY and O'PIONEERS. It is nice to see Grisham write about something that doesn't involve lawyers. This is the first time I've enjoyed his work. I hope he writes more like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cotton-Picking Good Book","review":"John Grisham takes us to a time and place where values seem simple, 'family' is a sacred word, and people are defined by the amount of hard work they do. We become intimately familiar with the Chandler family, get a birdseye view of their farm and the surrounding countryside, and get an indication of the bonds of community that helped define the times. The only weakness I saw was that there may have been just a little too much going on between Hank and Cowboy. Grisham paints a picture of midwestern Americana in the early 50's that is hard to resist feeling a sense of longing for."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISGRACE FOR GRISHAM","review":"Ths was the worst by far book that read from John Grsham.It was narrated by a 7 year old boy ,Luke.

So I ran out and purchased this one. I WANT my MONEY back. What a disappointment. He tries to COPY the MacCorte book from Irland. However, this kid has two parents(very good prople). He has two grandparents(very good people). And NOTHING is funny. Maybe it is because I know a seven year does think or act like this seven year old. What a DUMB story."},{"rating":"1","title":"If \\"0\\" stars was an option...I would have picked that!!!!","review":"This was a pointless, never-ending book.

I have to say I prefer the suspense books a lot more. While Grisham certainly has an extraordinary gift for painting a detailed picture with his words, in this case that of a little-known slice of the American past, the picture turns out to be not all that interesting to look at. Perhaps it's the fact that it's told through the eyes of a 7-year-old, perhaps it's the fact that life as an Arkansas cotton farmer in 1950 was incredibly dull, but this book was much more put-downable than other Grisham books. Even the book itself seems to conclude that this is a rather miserable way to live out one's life, and that those who could escape it, did. If you're looking for something slow and meandering, read it, but don't be expecting \\"The Firm\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"300 pages into this and nothing interesting yet","review":"I have a couple hundred pages to go here and nothing interesting has happened. Ok, someone got killed but you know who did it and even if you didnt, you would care either way because the guy getting killed is some beatnik that wasnt even a part of the story. This is so ho-hum and mediocre I cant believe it. It reads like it was meant for ages 5 and under. Farm life must be pretty boring right? Well, heres a story about everyday farm life and nothing more. The result? Boring. The characters are uninteresting and the writing style has no coloration whatsoever. Bland, bland, bland. If something happens during the remaining pages, assuming I get that far, I will eat my words and update this. This is the last Grisham book I'll ever read.

And I adore \\"slice of life\\" books; so it was with great expectation that I looked forward to reading this new one of Grisham's. His dialogue is believable and engaging, as usual. His characters are well drawn, as usual. He writes about important stuff: family ties, honor, integrity, truthfulness, wisdom, youth, and hard work. But, notwithstanding all these great elements, to me this book lacked \\"ummph.\\" The story line was slow paced and uncompelling - I kept wondering when the plot was going to kick in. This just wasn't one of Grisham's best works, in my humble opinion..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I am a huge John Grisham fan but I enjoyed John Grisham's past books much better than A Painted House. I, like so many other reviewers, purchased this book in anticipation of reading a gripping book that you just couldn't put down. It took me forever to read this book and the only reason I finished it was by sheer determination. It is John Grisham's choice to change his writing style and it was probably refreshing for him but it is not the style that his fans want and not the style that will sell the next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Jardine brilliance","review":"This short work is typical of Jardine's acute, if labyrinthine, analytical style and content.

The author jumps from one topic to another using unexplained terminology (particularly in examples.)

One example of such misleading comments is implying the existence of \\"symbolic random variable.\\" In fact the \\"symbolic random variable\\" IS a \\"usual\\" random variable, as it should.

The pieces are somewhat light in nature, but they are quite innovative. Of course, Winter Games was the main focus of the album, but there were other tracks that are noteworthy as well, particularly the Concerto and Firedance. Excellent balance, mixing, and performing by Foster and the very under-rated and relatively still unknown Vancouver (B.C.) Symphony Orchestra.Even though I played on the album and perhaps have heard the pieces more analytically than most listeners might, I still enjoy it. If you like Yanni, John Tesh, David Lanz, etc, you ought to really like this album. I believe this album contains music that is more expressive, less pop-formulaic, and not as hyper (especially compared to Yanni!). It is good as background music, and also to sit and listen to on a quiet evening.Give it a shot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth a try, but don't really like it","review":"Perhaps the degree of doming is wrong for my finger, but this really didn't work for me.

I look like I just got back from a two week vacation:-) I'm giving it 4 stars, because it takes practice to spray yourself evenly. I would recommend you not to spray yourself before an important date. Practice at home first. You won't get it right the first time and it'll look like you'll have bruises:-) Oh yeah!

But unlike the typical expert, I throw away my pride and firmly believe in the most bang for your buck.And these Binocs definitely pull through.Would have been five stars, but I agree with everyone else; the strap is a piece of crap.

I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived. These Bushnells were built very rugged, were surprisingly clear and easy to use and offered a much better field of view than similar models we had used in the past.The carrying case could be beefed up a little more if, like me, you tend to toss them in the back of the SUV and head out into the field. The lens caps also were a little skimpy and easy to lose. But, for a good day-to-day field work unit, it offers both ruggedness and precision viewing. Easy to focus and the magnification is perfect when you are in locations that tend to be inaccessible and you need long-range viewing power. In that price range, the Bushnell 20x50 is more than worth the investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!","review":"Do not buy these, they are good looking but flimsy junk. I should have known when when I opened the first pair (in the store) and noticed that one of the barrels was severely bent sideways. \\"Bad batch\\" I thought, and asked for another pair, which focused correctly, etc. Sometime in the next month they took a little banging somewhere, nothing major, but suddenly they were out of alignment. One of the plates that the front barrels mount on had just popped out, they are not even screwed on really, just pressed in or something. I sent them back to Bushnell but as they were out of warranty they wanted $56 to repair, I told them they could trash them. It will be a happy day when it will be too expensive for these big companies to make their junk in China and sell it here. Things may get more expensive to buy, but at least they will be local where they will have to up their standards or face the market consequences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Focus Technology","review":"The strange focus adjustment lever is just plain difficult to use. The lever is uncomfortable to reach and adjust. It wasn't easy for me to adjust the focus easily or exactly.

The representative who helped me over the phone was very nice and even sent me a replacement the very next day. The replacement binos seemed fine at first but then I noticed that the lenses were slightly crooked. So when viewing an object, both eyes have different perspectives which creates a blurred view. The only way to view an object clearly is to keep one eye closed. I would return these too, but I threw away the manufacturer's packaging. I wouldn't recommend these.

However beware that the focus adjustment takes time to get used to and lacks finesse.Also the eyes spacing adjustment must be made very carefully or you'll have a double vision.I thought these binoculars were made in America but they're Chinese...like everything else these days....After a few months usage, these binoculars turn out to be a lot disappointing. The construction quality is very poor, water vapour gets behind the lenses foging them from inside, upon closer examination one can see that the lenses have been screwed in very badly (cross with thread damages).These are only good as toys binoculars for 4-5 years old to play with.To be avoided."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bushnell 20x50","review":"For the price they are what I expected.I have a lot of property and enjoy watching the animals.They do a great job for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!

I waited to long to check them and use them and now I am past the return window. My mistake! But poor item their mistake!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No brainer","review":"Sent these back. They were out of alignment so everything was double vision. The field of view is very narrow making your subject difficult to find. Every time you move them you have to refocus and the focus mechanism had a no movement gap when changing directions. This was aggravating. I will be looking for an alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Binos!","review":"I primarily use binoculars for amateur astronomy. And, I am still quite new to the hobby-started in March 2010. I believe that these binoculars are great for beginners in skygazing. On an exceptionally clear night, and holding still, you can see Jupiter's moons. You'll definitely see Pleiades, Orion Nebula, Beehive Cluster, and Venus, to name a few.I have several pairs of binoculars (including Bushnell 10x50) and after reading an astronomy site, I noticed that Nikon 16x50 was mentioned an awful lot. I decided to give them a try, and I didn't really see a difference between the Nikons and Bushnell, so, the Nikons went back in less than 24 hours, and I traded them here at Amazon for the 20x50s.My strong advice to beginners is not to purchase a pair of high end binoculars at first, unless you have a dual purpose for them. Bushnell will pull through for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy these--you'll see double","review":"Bought these June 26, 2009. Within 2 weeks on our trip, they were \\"out of collimation,\\" which means you'll see double. Of course, we just returned from our vacation, and Amazon won't take them back only 5 weeks after I purchased them. Visit a retail store where they stand behind the products they sell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just returned","review":"The vision was double! Could not correct, and the distance focus was dismal to boot! Impossible to get both lenses in sync and focused. And yes, I know about binoculars (30 years law enforcement, used \\"a few\\" times!) Very poor distance clarity. I returned (no problem thru Amazon) although my account still has not been credited. I ordered the 10X50 power which works great!UPDATE ON RETURN- Took a while (month) but I was credited fo the full amount including shipping, so we are square! Did buy the next lower power which work fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bushnell PowerView 20x50 Binculars","review":"These binoculars were sent back for refund....I own a pair of bushnell 16x50 binoculars and they work just fine, but I wanted to get something that was a little stronger, so I purchased the 20x50 and after receiving them I was disappointed in them because they would not focus clearly. I followed the instructions on focussing, but they just would not focus well enough to see things clearly. There were parts that seemed to be loose and when using the focus rocker I could see the two lens wobbling. These were just poorly made. I have sent them back to Amazon for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought this, and regret it.","review":"I had a bad experience with my Bushnell purchase, and the customer service at Bushnell is terrible, you just receive form emails back all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"The vision tubes on the binoculars were out of alignment. This caused double images. A simple vision test before putting this pair on the market would have caught this defect. I am dissapointed that the manufacturer did not catch this defect. It did not make me want to get a replacement pair. I sent them back to Amazon for a refund. It was easy to return them to Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality, HIGH powered binoculars !!!","review":"I received these binoculars just today, and I am EXTREMELY PLEASED with them !!! The images are VERY sharp and bright. I have no trouble holding the binoculars steady, despite the High-Power. the Insta-Focus lever works very well !!! The binocular strap that came with them is good quality woven nylon with \\"BUSHNELL\\" proudly showing on the back of the strap. Bushnell must have heard the complaints about a cheap plastic strap and took action to remidy that problem. I purchased these to watch aircraft at the \\"Thunder Over Louisville\\" airshow in April and now I can't wait!!! And always remember, \\"NEVER KISS A CHICKEN ON THE LIPS\\" (Benny Hill)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality","review":"Great field of view. Very clear even at long distance. These are great for spotting deer in the woods or watching a suspect from a distance away. Either way they are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product.","review":"I purchased these binoculars as a birthday gift for my husband. We use binoculars to watch the wildlife in our backyard and pasture. We are both very pleased with the quality of these Bushnell PowerView 20x50 glasses. The view is very crisp and clear, and the 20x zoom far exceeds any other binoculars we have used. (We can count the points on the antlers of bucks half-way up the mountain.) The product has a nice, solid feel but is not too heavy. I really like the rubber coating -- it gives you a good solid grip. We have other Bushnell optic products which have performed well for over 30 years, and we expect the same result from these. The only issue we have is, for some reason, it is very obvious that we can't be still while using these glasses. The 'wiggling' is much more distracting than we ever noticed with the 10x binoculars. It probably has something to do with the extra magnification, but I suppose it could be just old age setting in. I would recommend these binoculars to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"A costly binocular best suited for observing the moon","review":"It was fascinating when I first observed the moon with this. It's actually good to have bought this one because, it's more powerful than a terrestrial telescope which I already have. However, it's also nice for terrestrial observing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Double image","review":"Very disappointed in the product. Bought the name brand, as it was well known and I have had similar binoculars for years.

Not happy with the purchase of such a defect in TWO binoculars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Bird Watcher","review":"Have tried different scopes and binoculars and this is the best for my backyard and woods. Easy to use, I support my elbows on the desk, and am able to use without a tripod. Perfect birdwatcher!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Affordable Surprise","review":"I bought these binoculars as a gift for my husband whose owned quite a few sets over the years but who always seems to lose them. He will tell you that these are the best ones he's had yet. That being said, I should qualify that our requirements from them are modest...only to see what's going on around our 260 acre lake. These do that and more. I would say that anyone looking for a good set of affordable binoculars will be hard pressed to find a better pair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Views","review":"I bought this pair of binoculars as a replacement and upgrade for what I had for the past twenty years.When I orderd it, I did know it would let me see more at much farther distances than what our previous pair allowed. But when I actually had the chance to compare them both side by side when it was delivered I was amazed at how much difference there was. I only now wish I had made the switch many years earlier.Well worth the price, very good close ups for sporting events, travel, recreational, and hunting activities.The quality is very good, and I have had no issues with the mechanism so far. The only short fall, and it is a minor one at that, is the strap. It could be of better quality and a little better thought out with its functionality.However with its carrying case, the strap is not that much of factor. I do rate it a good buy overall. If you buy it, you will like what you see with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good!","review":"These Binoculars are for the build quality totally overpriced! There are Binoculars you can get at Kmart or the Dollar Store for 15$ and compare to the Bushnell. Even so they are 20x magnification they don't even compare to my Binoculars from Nikon with 8x magnification. The optics are unclear and hinged in plastic!! The eye width adjustment is also very limited, which if you have a smaller eye distance creates a double vision. Which makes them useless. Order... have a laugh ... and send back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful binoculars","review":"The binoculars are exceptionally strong and easy to focus. They are as good as several of the same power that cost two or three times the money. I would give the binoculars five stars, but they did not come with a hard case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for serious use","review":"I purchased these to observe eagles in my golf community in Florida. They do not have the ability to observe my subjects in any more than a casual way. If you are a serious nature lover and bird watcher stay away and upgrade. I am returning these and will be looking for better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bushnell Powerview difficult to adjust","review":"One of my eyes is far weaker than the other and I could not manage to adjust the binoculars so that I could focus them clearly. I kept seeing double unless I closed one of my eyes. My son did not have this problem with them so if your eyes are similarly strong/weak, then perhaps this product might work for you. I also found them to be quite heavy."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective beyond belief","review":"I ordered these binocs because we needed a basic field binocular for viewing live stock, elk and deer. After struggling with the simplistic adjustments and directions, I finally visited a store that carried Bushnell only to discover how defective these binoculars were. Double vision and over priced,($39.99 over the counter price). Fortunatly, I was able to exchange with them with the display model, avoiding the process of returning and waiting for delivery of another pair to arrive. The \\"display\\" pair work fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bushnell 20x50 Binocular","review":"Got this yesterday 3/18/10. This binocular is so powerful do to it's 20x that it can not focus right.

I called the shipper and return the binocular for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bushnell 20X50","review":"I returned the Binoculars because they had double vision.

It even looks sleek and stylish, and is a great conversation piece as well.The only flaw I found is not so much a flaw, but a comment, or suggestion. I now always have my Ipod on me, but I am always forgetting my earbuds. Sure it shows a place to wind your earbuds around the item, but they do not travel well like this, and their bulky on the unit, and they are always coming loose or falling off.

Although his youth was already far behind him when he made this fine album, House had lost very little of the power and intensity that earned him his prominent place in blues history decades earlier.

You have to get by the poor sound quality, but it is totally worth it. You won't ever know why he is so important and so deep until you hear those old recordings.

If you ever wondered what you would get if you strung all of your random home surf video together and layered it with some lame surf music, this is it! The remarkable thing is that it it is published and for sale. The movie title and description suggest high-quality surf footage by someone with access to top surfers, and edited with an eye for making it artistic and soulful.

I would have to compare it to the first generation of short board videos featuring Machado and the likes. It looked like it was shot with a camcorder. One song scenes, like one of those high energy, punk rock surf videos. Crappy waves overall. No interviews or commentary. If you liked September Sessions, Single Fin Yellow, Longer or other high quality flick, this is as far from that as you can possibly get. Did I mention that I hated it? OH! There was a good part.

I also love seeing the girls and groms ripping as well as lots of the guys I see photos of in the mags but never get to see in motion.

Seems hard to believe that the events are only 35 years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"A WORTHY COMPANION","review":"This is a very good book on its own.

Wake Up, America."},{"rating":"2","title":"fast shipping..","review":"this book came at a reasonable time. i can't comment on the contents of the book seeing as it was for me.

Not what I expect. I will never purchase another book from this vendor."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly funny film","review":"Clay Pigeon's is one of those small great films you look at in the video store and ask yourself whether it's wort your $5. Well, for this small, off beat, black comedy it certainly is. It features a great cast and a darkly funny scrpit. Janenne Garofalo is hilarious as the cynnical FBI agent and Joaquin Phoenix is great as the poor guy who keeps stubling across dead bodies. Also Vince Vaughn's performance as Lester Long is one not to be missed. This movie will keep you laughing from beginning to end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise! It's Good!","review":"A dark comedy that starts off with a bang -- literally. The beginning is well-written, for it sets the pace for the rest of the movie. It pulls you in and makes you wonder what's going to happen next. A few minutes into the film, however, it starts to show traits of some pointless independent movie. Luckily, it picks up when Janeane Garofalo, the dry and sarcastic FBI agent, steps in. Joaquin Phoenix, whose brilliance as an actor is becoming more evident with every progressive film, turns in a commendable performance. Vince Vaughn provides great comic relief as your stereotypical, insane cowboy. The rest of the cast is also brilliant, however subtle their roles are. Although not perfect, this film has a way of staying with you, with its quirky and fun soundtrack, offbeat performances, fast-paced and intricately woven plot, and desolate country setting. Give this movie a try and you will be pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vaughan is distinctly humorous!","review":"Vince Vaughan continues to impress me (Swingers, Return to Paradise). His performance in Clay Pigeons is hilarious. I quote the film religiously, (Lester the Molester, alarm..alarm...man overboard! it could have been a rock star - dont make me out to be the dumb one!) The soundtrack is surprsingly good as well - I've got a timebomb in my mind mom, Sea of Heartbreak, Moon over Montana..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must-see twisted dark comedy","review":"You like Fargo? You'll love Clay Pigeons. A well written script backed up by a talented cast and director."},{"rating":"1","title":"When Joaquin was the lesser of two Phoenixes","review":"Maybe I was smoking something when commercials for this flick first came out, but I thought it was marketed as a comedy. This is not a comedy. Unless you want to call it a \\"black comedy\\" which basically means violence and murder and sex for no reason is funny or absurd. I didn't like this movie at all. None of the characters are likable and the story is unbelievable. This isn't a sleeper, a cult movie, or an art movie. Its just a bad movie. If you want to see an \\"exploration of violence\\" type movie, go watch Kalifornia instead. You have been warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Such a Good Movie!","review":"Even though this movie was just recently released, I have seen it about 20 times. Maybe I'm a bit prejudiced because I am the biggest Vince Vaughn and Joaquin Phoenix fan in the world (they are only the finest guys ever), but I loved the movie as well as the main characters. This movie is dark yet lighthearted at times, creepy yet hilarious-it is a thriller packed with comedy, and mystery. The actors in it are incredible, and each of them give incredible performances. Vince Vaughn plays the hilarious Lester Long, Joaquin plays the troubled Clay, Georgina Cates plays a small-town gal with a serious attitude problem, and Janeane Garofolo plays a witty FBI agent. (Also watch for the goofy Deputy) The plot is fast-paced, and you will never know what happens next. This is a definite must-see movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HILARIOUS","review":"I am 33 years old and have two children and frankly I felt really guilty getting as much pleasure as I did from this movie. This is the funniest movie I have seen in several years. Vince Vaughn absolutely made this movie. From the minute Lester Long said, \\"Don't hit me or nothin'. I just wanna play pool\\", I was hooked. Vince Vaughn is a fantastic actor! He has a charm about him that is rare. He also has a certain physical comedy that few of us are graced with. If you are an adult and you can appreciate dark comedy, this is the movie for you. Murder has never been such a side spliter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great performances...","review":"I thought the cast was pretty much perfect and their performances were great.

I love Sarah's vocals on this track, they're so haunting, so when I first heard about a remix I was hoping for a lot.

It's too bad that this mix isn't available on any cd single to date, only white label records, but there are many downloadable versions on-line. Try searching google. And remember, downloading is illegal if the song is released, so buy this mix when it comes out on a cd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzzz","review":"I have to say that this was a bit of a snooze.

At first i thought maybe the removeable dust buster would work well for the car or boat but It's suction is not powerful enough. Ok to suck up dog hair. i would not recomend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good for hard floors","review":"This vacuum is worthless for picking up small particles of dirt or rock (sand like) when being used as a floor vacuum. With the beater bar off, it doesn't pick them up, it just pushes them around. With it on it just throws them out from behind the vacuum. The suction is not great enough to pick them up when it is spread out across the length of the vacuum head.On carpets and as a handheld dustbuster, it does a nice job. Do not purchase if you are planing to use it on hard surfaces."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally displeased","review":"This cordless vacuum was absolutely useless.

The power is better than most.I only have 2 minor annoyances:(1) The little rollers which glide the vacuum make a lot of noise.(2) The Vacuum hanger does not automatically charge. If you use the hanger...you also have to retrieve and plug in the cord to charge. IT seems like it would have been easy to automatically charge when you hang the vacuum (like most Vacuums).Overall... I am pleased with this product....just minor improvements would have made it even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad on pet hair, bad overall","review":"I purchased this vacuum mainly to do spot clean-ups of pet hair from our two dogs. My biggest complaint on the performance is that the hair gets caught in the little wheels on the stick vac that the vacuum rolls on, and is near impossible to get out! I continued to try to use it regardless of this problem, and then it scratched my wood floor. Not sure if there was a rock stuck in the brush, or what. Last but not least, the charger stopped working. I waited too long to return it, and as I only paid about $40, I think I'll just throw it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vacuum didn't work!","review":"I've had this vacuum for 5 months now and for 2 of those months it's been in the repair shop. It would have been in the shop longer if I had time to take it in earlier. I think they're waiting for a part from Black and Decker that's never coming. After 4 or 5 light uses, the battery just stopped charging. So I can't tell you how it works, because it doesn't. I'd save my money and go buy a corded stick vacuum and forget about cordless for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't pick up much and very loud","review":"I bought this vacuum based on the reviews it received and I was very disappointed. For a dustbuster it is very loud. Much louder than what I was looking for. As loud as a full on heavy duty vacuum. Considering it does not pick up much on the carpet or the floor, I can't imagine why it has to make so much noise. I returned it after one use. The filter was completely clogged with dust after the one use and will need to be cleaned after each use. Don't waste your money on this one. If you are looking for a lightweight vacuum for the floor and short carpets consider the Swivel Sweeper touchless. It works great picking up dust, sand, dirt, food off our hardwood floors and does a light cleaning on our wool rug. It is not perfect, but it works just as well as sweeping yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little vacuum","review":"We bought this vacuum for cleaning up after the kids as they drop cereal, crackers and other little morsels all over the house since my wife is pregnant again and cannot bend too well. It has plenty of power to pick up off of tile, hardwood and smoother rugs. There are two settings on the vac itself, one with just suction and the other which activates a spinning brush in the handle which works very well. Taking the unit off the handle to use as a hand vac is a snap. Great little vac for smaller jobs around the house. No complaints at this time at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black and Decker CFV1200 DustBuster 12-Volt Cordless Vacuum","review":"the vacuum seems cheaply built and doesn't have a lot of suctioni would not recommend it"},{"rating":"2","title":"dustbuster vacuum","review":"This product did not come with the crevice tool as shown in the description. it is nice to be able to have a stand up vacuum and a dustbuster too. it does not sit very securely in the handle, but the vacuum works nicely. i put it on carpet setting for everything and it works better. it is nice and light and easy for everyday running over the floors..not for heavy duty vacuuming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good.","review":"This vacuum doesn't have good power or suction. I bought it just to keep my workshop clean and am pretty disappointed. Charge runs out quickly and suction is weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for a few months, but not longer...","review":"We bought this about six months ago as the primary vacuum in our very small 1 bedroom apartment with wall-to-wall carpeting. It was wonderful for the first few months, the cordless option was great and it worked fairly well on the carpet (it's no dyson, but it picked up most of the visible stuff). However, it hasn't held up very well. Even after cleaning the filter and pulling all the hair out of the beater bar, it has almost no suction. It tends to collect crap inside the mouth, and then either spit it back out behind, or drop it out as soon as you turn it off. It is also made out of cheap plastic, and part of it keeps falling off and has to be snapped back on almost every time we use it. It's probably fine as a secondary vacuum that dosen't get a lot of heavy use, but if you're looking for a primary vaccum, even for a small apartment, this one won't last long."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst cordless vacuums","review":"I am totally disappointed in this cordless vac.....it does not stand alone.....removable handle is HARD to remove....Dustbuster is HARD to remove.....capacity is oh so limited.....very hard to clean.....doesn't hold a long charge.....I will keep using my Black and Decker Floorbuster, which is 200% better than this poor excuse for a vacuum!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective","review":"It works very well to pick up crumbs on a hardwood floor in the kitchen and on a rug under the dining room table between real vacuumings. ...best thing is being able to detach the Dustbuster for a quick cleaning of the stairs....it's a true multi tasking tool!Only 2 negatives . 1... if you bend down to reach for someting stubborn on the floor you get a blast of air from the side vents...You'll learn, hopefully faster then I did, not to do that. 2. It's a bit hard to push around on a thick carpet but not impossible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This does not pick up anything on my hard wood floor, it just pushes things around, I have to use the dustbuster that detatches from the vacumme and bend over to clean my floor, it is a pain.

I wanted a cordless vac to use on my vinyl kitchen floor for quick pick-ups in between real cleanings.This unit as a hard floor vac is horrible. It barely has any suction and hardly picks up anything - picks up dust, but nothing more - crumbs, etc all stay on the floor. I performed my unscientific test of holding a single square of toilet paper in front of the vac and there is absolutely no suction.As a hand held vac removed from its \\"handle\\" and without the brush roll it does fine. Unfortunately, I already have a handheld vac and did not want another. Seems to me that the handheld vac is fine, but the design of the handle assembly ruins its suction and its abilities. Its useless for me then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great find at a great price","review":"I had been looking for an appliance like this since one I had previously owed died. I had been to a few web sites and had only found it on two, and Amazon was cheaper than Wal-Mart and had free shipping. The only thing I liked better about my old one was that that the charger was pluged in and attached to the wall and you just lifted it off the charger to use, where this one has to be unpluged everytime you use it and then re-plugged.

She speaks of Hitler's days in the bunker with painful candor and apologizes after recalling his love for his dog (which he later tests his poison capsules on) which she thinks is, in the greater picture, a frivolous memory. She also recalls an attempt on Hitler's life, his last-minute marriage to Eva Braun and the announcement that Hitler's body had been burned per his last wish. Nobody else who was with Hitler on his last day has ever spoken out and this is a fascinating, historical and important testimony."},{"rating":"2","title":"Low production value, fascinating content","review":"This documentary is nothing fancy-- no music, no old photographs, no fancy camerawork, and no artistic re-enactment footage. It is a straightforward compilation of three interviews with one of Hitler's secretaries, filmed shortly before her death, in German with subtitles. It is fascinating. And you should watch it. History books are just compilations of data stamped with the opinions of everybody who handles it. This is as close as most of us can get to a direct source, free of the obscuring glaze of interpretation and analysis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unintentionally evil","review":"Traudi Junge never mentioned to anybody what she did during the Second World War. But the guilt wouldn't go away. That's because, as a 22-year-old woman, she was one of Hitler's personal secretaries, trusted to the point that it was she who typed up his last will and testament in the Berlin bunker. Documentary filmmaker Othmar Schmiderer and conceptual artist Andr Heller convinced Junge to tell her story and their film is as simple as it comes: Junge talking straight to camera, attempting to explain what she did and why. There are also snatches of Junge watching herself on film, commenting further on what she has said. A film that shows it is not just evil itself, but the ignorance of evil that can be equally destructive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Production made this the worst film I have ever seen","review":"This documentary may be full of history, but I couldn't get past the pathetic production. I enjoy documentaries and have watched dozens, but in my opinion this was the worst made film I have ever seen.I was really looking forward to seeing this film, but couldn't stand watching it. The framing was bad, the sound was bad, the edits were this close to causing a migraine and if that wasn't bad enough then I had the pleasure of seeing multiple shots of Traudl just sitting there watching her poorly done interviews on tv.Don't waste your time on this film.

It's a easy read. Something you could pick up and finish in day, but nothing and I mean nothing in this book was surprising or unexpected and the dialogue was so contrived I couldn't buy into any of it (and I actually really wanted to).

I didn't know it was a romance novel until I checked it out but since it was free I figured why not. I had read other Nora Roberts books and enjoyed them. This was another formula romance novel with anemic characters. Twenty-eight year old concert pianist returns to hometown 12 years after leaving her high school bad boy boyfriend. The bad boy is now the town doctor and still hot. Surprised? Not.

The Nora Roberts books for kindle are usually out of my price range, (I won't pay over $10 for a kindle book), so I thought I would give this one a shot. It reads like an older book, maybe late 80's or early 90's, so it was hard for me to get into the characters. Some of the other reviews said that this was a re-print, so maybe it is 10 or 20 years old. The whole storyline of Van still being a virgin after being such a jetsetter, not believable. Brady wasn't that great of a H and I didn't think Van was a great h either.

Sometimes I found myself sympathising with the mother of the main character at having such a selfish child, but that was seeing it from a mother's point of view I guess.

In fairness to their readers, and to continue to receive their loyalty, the \\"reprinted\\" statement should be clearly shown and I find it especially deceptive that the titles are changed.

From her new adult prospective, and out from under the misguided influence of her father, she realizes that the misunderstandings that to her estrangement from both of them wasn't what she had been lead to believe.

The author suggests arguments based on rumour, hearsay, wildly inaccurate newspaper accounts, and (in what I think is his most misleading, self-deluded exercise in investigative journalism) his previous books on the subject!

First, the book includes many models of Virago, which are all different. You will find yourself thumbing through pages and pages of not relevant material, and the entire second half is only about the 500 cc bikes. Second, the table of contents is not detailed and the index is almost non-existent. Finding a specific topic *always* takes good round of searching.Instructions will say things like \\"Step 1. See section 3 for how to do XX.\\" (Then spend 10 min combing through section 3 to find something relevant.) \\"Step 2.

The music is upbeat and fun...I found this band when I began getting interested in the electric violin. What's also great about this is that on the reverse side of the cd is a dvd with 3 or 4 of their videos.

I would definitely recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Best Of\\" for a band with few titles and less than 10 years?","review":"I absolutely love this band, but I really think it is lame that they allowed a CD to be created titled \\"Best Of ....\\"! That shows how greedy they or their marketers are to sell CDs. The band should seek to tour more often if they want to get their name out. I just get irked that they chose to make this mistake. The music on this CD it top notch, but they don't deserve to have a \\"Best Of\\" title anytime soon, and neither does Britney Spears!Buy the CD if you don't have any of their music.

The inside notes say there is some sort of automatic 5.1 converter they used. This album was never remixed into 5.1 properly but just run through some 5.1 generator that makes 5.1 out of stereo recordings...lame. I listened to it at home and was very dissappointed.Just to make it clear, I am a big fan of their music and I recommend it, but the included dvd is sub-par. The regular cd also included is great. Seeing as how I bought it just for the 5.1 dvd, I felt very, very unsatisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spice Girls meet Vivaldi?","review":"This is an exceptionally strange recording. Someone has recruited some highly attractive women (their accompanying photos look like a Victoria's Secret spread) who also happen to play string music. They have formed (or been formed into) a group that pits their fiddling against a heavy, synthesized rhythm track. The music has its occasional classical touches (including Tchaikovsky's \\"Nutcracker\\"), but it mostly sounds like Latin music (of the \\"Tico Tico\\" variety). I defer to the people who like it, but it's about the most bizarre music I've heard, and I'm frankly sorry for those who apparently haven't heard the sound of acoustic violins and violas--or haven't heard a decent live rhythm section."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away at all costs!","review":"Horrible, horrible tripe that gives classical music, string quartets, and beautiful women a bad name.

Two of the albums I got were just fine, but this one refused to play.I was forced to make a copy of the CD in order to use it, which is sad.Classified and Remixed, the other two Bond CDs I got, worked just fine, but this one required me to jump through hoops. If you are like me, and only have a computer (I use a mac mini to listen to music and watch my DVD collection) and not a standalone CD or DVD player, then you might want to skip this album to avoid being out the money for an unsuable CD (unless you are also a FreeBSD user, and can copy the disc)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even on the same PLANET as David Garrett","review":"This group showed up as a recommendation for me because I bought (and love) David Garrett's work.

You will hear Handel's \\"Messiah,\\" Mozart's \\"Marriage of Figaro,\\" Beethoven's 5th and 9th Symphonies, Tchaikovsky's \\"Swan Lake\\" and much more. In addition, you will also learn the stories behind the works, often revealing details not commonly known.Overall, this was a very good program.

She is now restored to a highly energetic person. She is soundly knowledgeable, and accurate in her observations. Her findings as described in this book emanate from her own struggle with fibromyalgia and from her eighteen-year experience with over ten-thousand patients. All of her workdays are dedicated to advising and treating none but fibromyalgics. Her book outlines the results of her efforts and patient responses to what she has long recommended and now details in this book. There are very few experts available to treat this overwhelming illness, Claudia is one of those.

I could have had a compassionate, practical expert lead me by the hand and teach me all I needed to know to take charge of my health and take care of myself. Even when deep in fibrofog, I could have read clear descriptions of what to expect and how to cope. I would have read the exact questions to ask about my care and the right professionals to ask them of. I would have had the benefit of clear, impartial discussion of conventional, experimental, and alternative treatments, and practical advice on how to distinguish hype and junk science from real medical research. The book opens with Christopher Robin's words: \\"You're braver than you believe, and stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think.\\" Claudia Craig Marek then goes on to show you just how to prove that to yourself and reclaim your life.

It's great.A carefully thought out kettle.Pop a button and the water heats up and turns off when ready.The kettle lifts away form the base leaving power cord behind.Pour directly from the container without having to open the lid. What a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot water smells, tastes like plastic","review":"I purchased this model of T-fal Electric Kettle in Sept 2010. It heats up quickly and is easy to use. HOWEVER, when the water is hot, it takes on the smell & taste of plastic. I expected a little of this in the first few uses as a consequence of the pot being new. But even after all this time -- nearly 2 years -- the taste is so strong that it significantly alters the flavor of teas, hot chocolate, soups and instant coffee.Some readers may wonder if I'm reheating water that has been standing in the pot. No, I empty it, give it a quick rinse and begin fresh each time with cold water from the tap. And there is no unwanted taste in the water before it is heated. I can only conclude that the defect is in the kettle itself. Very disappointing.I cannot recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should come with earplugs","review":"It does what it's supposed to - heat water quickly. It's nicely designed, and the clear panel lets you confirm what's happening inside.Be aware that it is LOUD. You'll have to shout to be heard over the noise.The dial setting on the front of the unit was deceiving. Although the red graphic at the top of the dial implies a variable temperature setting, the unit seems to have only two settings: hot water and boiling water. Turn the dial all the way to the left to get a cup of hot water for diluting previously brewed tea concentrate (tea from a pot with 5-6 bags or a similar quantity of loose leaves). Turn the dial all the way to the right to get boiling water for brewing tea.The instructions were not prepared by a native speaker of English and were not helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong Plastic Aftertaste and Smell","review":"We used this kettle for making everyday green/black tea, and occasional coffee.Unfortunately, after 3 months of use, the water coming out of this kettle stinks of melted plastic and has a bit of a chemical aftertaste.

Do not make the same mistake we did, if you intend to actually drink this water and taste/smell matters to you at all.The strong points of this kettle is that it looks good, has water temperature control, and boils the water really fast. Excellent price too!Anyone still want it? You pay shipping and its yours for free. ;)Update: I returned this tea kettle to manufacturer and they shipped me a brand new one, free of charge. I'll give it a try eventually, when my current one break down...UPDATE:THE NEW ONE, that they shipped LEAKS. Sending this one in, to the manufacturer, for yet another repair.

The switch kept malfunctioning every time after that - I tried the kettle at several different outlets with the same result. I returned the item and got a refund.

Based on features, it should get a 4. If only it didn't stink.It was to be a replacement for a stainless steel Breville that started tripping the GFI outlet. The troubleshooting instrucions said to boil the pot with 2 tsp of baking soda. That didn't help - still a strong chemical odor. Tried white vinegar as well. First 1/2 cup plus water, then all vinegar. Still the smell. After a total of 15 pot-fulls, some baking soda, some vinegar, some plain water, the smell was diminished a bit but still present.I called the manufacturer and was told they'd replace the pot, but that they were out of stock and would take at least 3 weeks.I'm returning it for another stainless kettle."},{"rating":"2","title":"t-fall","review":"So convienient. easy to use. i like the variability of water needed, one cup or more. it looks good and is easy to clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Electric Kettle","review":"I recently purchased a T-fal Vitesses electric kettle and I like it very much! This kettle boils water very quickly, even when full, and it is very easy to use; one on-off switch, a simple temperature setting, and a lid that opens easily when the top is pressed. The only reason I gave it only 4 stars is that the automatic shut-off takes a few seconds longer to shut off than the one I used on vacation. Of course, I used the previous kettle while on vacation in the Dordogne valley of France and that location may ave influenced my perceptions."},{"rating":"2","title":"T-Fal BF6520004 Vitesse 1.7L Electric Kettle","review":"Good kettle.

Easy to pour in water as top opens easily4. Temp control good for slight variations in heat of water5. Low price for chosen parametersI still like Braun better but was not available on Prime:1. Braun has cleaner styling.2. Braun has better indicator on side of how much water you have poured in (e.g., one line for each cup of water up to 8). Vitesse only has 3 lines...3. I think Braun a little faster on the boilIts too early to judge durability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value for the product","review":"I purchased the T-FAL Vitesse 1750 Watts after a lot of research. I wanted a product that heated water quickly (like the ones in Europe), large capacity, swivel based, cordless, and not-too-expensive. This product fit my requirements and so far it's been great. I agree that it's unfortunately Chinese made (that I usually don't buy since they don't last) but all electric kettles seem to be (like most household products). A couple of negatives.... it's a little noisy when it's heating up the water, and takes about 30-60 secs. after the water starts boiling to auto-shut. Since the water boils rather quickly, I would recommend that you stand around and manually shut the switch for safety reasons. All in all I strongly recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Water tastes like plastic","review":"Even after many uses, the water boiled in this kettle tastes like plastic. You might not taste it when the water is hot, but when the water cools down you can clearly taste it, so plastic has to be leaching into the water. I don't think it's safe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad design","review":"I bought this water kettle due to the many good reviews on amazon. However, It turned out to be one of the worst water kettle I have ever owned. My previous water kettle lasted me a good 4 years and the only reason I tossed it was due to it becoming exceedingly dirty inside. The design of this kettle leaves a lot to be desired. I found the 3-way setting on the front ugly and pretty much useless. Moreover, the knob fell off after about 1 month of use. I've had it now for about 3 months and now the contacts are starting to fail so that it is not always obvious whether the kettle is actually on or not. My other kettle made a nice \\"ding\\" sound when it was done. There is no way to tell when this kettle is done except by the light on the front that is not always easy to see. In all, I'm not quite sure why it is rated as highly as it is. I give it a 1-star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Its the best electric kettle on the market...the only reason I am giving it 4 stars you have to watch for your electricity bill to go way up :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"What can be better then a hot cup of tea","review":"My wife and i do enjoy nice cup of cofee.This is what makes our day.Very good quality, solid build.We love it.Thank you T-Fal"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Thus Far","review":"Years ago, my mother purchased an electric tea kettle that I never particularly cared for. It took up too much space on the counter, had to be manually turned off, and it was difficult to clean--the only opening was the spout (as I recall, heating coils were inside the unit). I purchased the T-Fal electric kettle after burning a few pans full of water meant for tea. Research brought me to this gem of a tea kettle. I've had it a week thus far. The water warms or boils to three different temperatures, according to my needs. I can rely on it to turn off when it reaches the desired temperature, so it has safety built in and I can feel confident that I won't ruin another of my best pans. It's relatively compact--the cord for the heating stand can be as long or short as I need. The top of the kettle opens, making it easy to clean. What more could you want?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I never expected the spout to offer such precise direction of the hot water, which is important in making coffee with a cone filter. Also, the variable heat settings lets me bring the water to \\"just the boil\\" and not beyond. The large carafe allows me to boil water quickly and efficiently, then transfer it to a pot for cooking. Also, I had no odd tastes, as some reviewers have claimed as their experience. A very good value. I'm keeping it in mind as a gift idea this next holiday season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works very well, would buy again","review":"I bought this kettle after I started getting into having tea each morning. I wanted something that got the water VERY HOT, the best for brewing tea, without a long wait. This does the trick. There is a temperature adjustment on the side that controls how hot the water gets (simmering to rolling boil). Also, it has a filter at the spout to keep any foreign object out of your mug. Speaking of such, this unit (and I think others) tend to calcify and/or leave deposits on the bottom of the heating element. Over time these \\"floaters\\" will end up in your hot water. I have found that keeping the unused kettle dry by pouring out the extra hot water right away, and the occasional wipe with a paper towel, helps to minimize this problem.Overall, this is a wonderful product and I use it almost every day. When it wears out, as most things do, I will buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it, love it, love it.....!","review":"This has to be one of THE best purchases I have ever made!

It may seem pricey, but it is worth it.Pros:- The docking station is great, there's no cord in the way when I remove the kettle to pour. Also, it's really easy to take off and put back on the station.- You can choose what temperature to heat the water to. This is great as I don't want boiling water when I have tea, just hot.- The hidden cord is great too, my kettle is right next to an outlet so I don't have any extra cord dangling around on the counter.- The kettle automatically turns off, so I don't have to stand over it and keep an eye on it.Cons:- A stay on option would be nice to keep the water hot longer (although it does stay warm for a while).- There is no place that tells you the temperature (not even the knob where you choose how hot you want it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!","review":"The reason I bought this was because I currently own an old T-Fal \\"Vitesse\\" and have had zero problems with it over the several years I've owned it.

This solar bug zapper light is a complete piece of junk that does not work at all as advertised. Forget about the zapper aspect of the device. The only thing it ever zapped was me during one of my many futile attempts to get it to work. Even the plain white light is spotty at best. I have solar garden lights that I bought for less than $3.00 each that work far more reliably. The biggest insult after weeks of trying get this thing to work is that I could not simply toss it in the trash where it belongs.

The directions included with the product warn of this problem -- sort of scary, now that I think about it -- and provide the \\"solution\\" to the problem. I followed those instructions, the smell and taste problem disappeared for awhile, but after having not used the kettle for a few months, the problem is back. My Earl Grey tea tasted funny, and the water remaining in the kettle smells plastic-y. So, I'll be chucking this thing in the garbage can and buying a kettle that is made of metal and glass.

We've been very happy with it.

I have owned it for about a month and I mainly use it to make tea and instant grits. I wish they still sold the smaller version, but this one still takes up very little counter space. I ultimately bought this one over other smaller kettles because of all the features is offers. It definitely brings water to boil quickly. I like that you can adjust the temperature as well, from ready to sip to full boil. It was important for me to buy a cordless kettle, and this one is great. Fits well on it's base. I have had no trouble with a plastic taste in my water. For those that do, the instruction manual covers that scenario; use it 2 or 3 times until the taste goes away.
