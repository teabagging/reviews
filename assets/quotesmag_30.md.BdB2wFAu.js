All four dancers were great. Rania and Marina were amazing. I have been bellydancing for three years, and I showed this video to my family to show them what I am learning. It is classy, tasteful, and loaded with great performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Visual Encyclopedia at a nice price","review":"How do you explain the differences in costuming and signature movements between Iranian and Egyptian dance to a beginning belly dancer? This tape gives students an entertaining overview at an affordable price of different types of Middle Eastern Dance as interpreted by American dancers. A nice tape to add to the collection to pick up a few moves, and to just get a good sense of what a complete choreography looks like. Yes, there are more incredible performances than these out in the video world, but this is a good place to start your collection. The costumes shown are readily available through distributors like Turquoise International, and the lighting and production are good enough that you can see what the dancers are doing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"I hold a Masters Degree in Dance, and I loved every performance on this video. The cultural interpretations, music and costumes were right-on (except for perhaps Marina's cane dance). This is a quality production with diversity and some of the best dancers out there. There is not one person I have shown this video to who has not fallen in love with it. It is definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great, but had some value","review":"This video is not a very good example of true Raqs Sharqi. I did not like any of the styles of the dancers. They all lack the refinement needed to be true performers. They look like they are just going through the motions. Also, I do not like how the video was filmed in a studio. The best performance videos I own are filmed in front of live audiences, so you get to see the performer interact with the audience. This video is lacking that element. Maybe that is why I dislike it so much.Save your money and buy a performance video that is actually from Egypt, Lebanon or Turkey. They are generally more entertaining because the dancers are better and they are usually real live performances filmed at nightclubs."},{"rating":"1","title":"I cant believe you put something out like this.","review":"This video is a waiste of money. Rania performace ,although technically ok. she definately needs to work on stage presence. I didnt like her blank stare, it just annoyed me. Marina performaces were horrible. She was just flying thru her dance without listening to the music; therefore, being behind with the beat of the music. Not to mention her costumes didnt flatter her figure at all. Louchia dancing was great, although I have not ever seen in persian dance that the middriff (belly) was exposed. They state she is wearing an authentic persian costume but to my knowledge it is not. Souhaila's performances were good and to the most part very egyptian and her costumes were fabulous. She lacks energy. I got bored with her cuz she was so robotic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the viewing","review":"This is a wonderful video if you wish to see different styles and levels of bellydancing. I wish that there was a way to purchase the music from this video which was so great to hear consider Rania's workout videos have more techo music."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you are looking forward to learn something, this DVD is not for you","review":"Please, if you want to learn bellydance, spend you money in another DVD.I watched it expecting to learn something new, but I only saw dancers I have seen before with other videos I have.It is fun to watch and if you already master bellydance, you can get some ideas to your performances.Definetly do not spend your money in this dvd if you are looking for teaching. This product would be not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"I read this book about 15 or 20 years ago and I still remember it as though if were yesterday.

They go get a quick marriage. Due to their situation she drops out of school and he has to quit football to work at the bank. They live at Bo Jo's parents then get a place of their own. We are privy to both of their family inter-workings.She meets a gal and they become friends. She also has a pen-pal that she strings along. It kinda ends suddenly and unexpectedly. We do not get the pay-off we expect or maybe should get after over 100 pages of a relationship with the characters.Read today it is somewhat laughable as to how everything goes. Interesting to see the mindset of the day. Bo Jo calls her 'kid' throughout, maybe he should have been brought up on charges as it appears she is a minor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Story!","review":"This book is very realistic and it gives teens a \\"real look\\" into teenage pregnancy.

This book should be in all the middle schools/jr.hs. Great reading then and now!"},{"rating":"2","title":":0) This book was realistic, and interesting!","review":"I haven't finished this book yet, but so far its extremely good! This book is about two teenagers that are dating, the girl gets pregnant, and now the two of them have new and unexpected experiences. They end up feeling forced into marrige.

I deffinitely reccomend this book, its realistic and makes you think of the difficulties of teen pregnancys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book Despite the Stupid Title","review":"I am a freshman in high school, and my friend recommended this book to me.

I would recommend this book to any teenager."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the cost","review":"Those who were mesmerized by Dark of the Gods and Seeker's Mask may be disappointed by this long-awaited 3rd volume from Hodgell. While 2 of the stories do shed light on the history behind Jame, her brother and the world her people are now in, much of this very slender volume is repetitive (the Ishtier / scroll theft story is here in full its first incarnation) or mediocre at best.At [$] way overpriced ... at [$]it still is. This reads like an attempt to wring additional money from fans. Save your money and your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for fans","review":"If you loved Dark of the Gods and the Seeker's Mask, you'll enjoy this one! This collection of short stories is made up of the odds and ends of Hodgell's work that started the whole series. Most are new (to me at least!) and give some great insight into Jame's childhood, (including why her father kicks her out), Jame's future, and how the whole series evolved. If you haven't read the series, read it now! If you've already read the series and you're starving for the next book, this is a great \\"snack\\" to tide you over!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Usual Superb writing, just not about Jaime and her brother","review":"I was oh-so-excited when the book finally became available and I was able to purchase it. When I received the book I discovered that maybe half of the short stories contained within involved Jaime and her family. Hodgell's writing is excellent, of course, but I was expecting to spend the day feasting on unread tales of the adventures of my favorite heroine. I had no interest in the other stories that were included. What is there is good, but I would not have purchased the book if I had actually known what was contained. Borrowed it, absolutely, but not bought it. I guess I will just have to wait until her next book to get my Jaime fix. *grins*"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever!!!","review":"I enjoy corny Hispanic gangster movies because it reminds me of the people I grew up with.

I have several of Martha's earlier cookbooks, which are creative, delightful and offer really wonderful tasting food. For example, when I cook something from her Quick Cook Menus people love it.

My experience was pretty much identical to theirs, and they are right - it's no good to bake in without the glass dish (and that's a lot of money for something that looks good but you can't use!) After the second shipment arrived with no dish, I went out and got my own because I really like the metal baker and was determined to make it work. I've contacted Amazon.com several times to let them know the problem, but it's been nearly two months and no resolution. They only offer to take it as a return, but as I keep telling them, I don't want to return it, and especially not now that I've gone out and gotten the Pyrex dish!

She is energetic, tells great stories, and knows this topic like no one else.For all the \\"self-medicating\\" behaviors in this country, it's amazing to me that this book isn't required reading in high school -- or at least entry-level psychology classes. Then again, I think that's true for most good books that explain the very common but all-too-misunderstood lifespan condition called Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. This book, however, stands out for its focus on the reasons that unrecognized ADHD and addictions go too often hand in hand.Read this book, and you will have a new paradigm for understanding why people get stuck in these destructive cycles -- and knowing how they can stop the cycle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignorant Solution","review":"This lady must have been paid by the drug companies.

The story is so well known it does not need repeating but seems quite new even though the tale presented is just about the same as any other version you've seen. What makes it better is Palance's performance which is very subtle as Jekyll and strident as Hyde without being overblown. Hardly any make up used on his striking features is a big plus,as is the understated direction. 6 years later the same producer and leading man's 'Dracula' is not as successful although still a lot better than most versions and certainly better than Coppolas which stole the idea that Dracula is Vlad Tepes and comes to England to find the re-incarnation of his previous love. It also omits the sanitorium of Dr Steward and Renfield totally, but watch it anyway.Picture quality is good.

Well, when this video showed up and it was 18 minutes long I knew I was wrong. The FitMama actually included the whole FitMama and Me workout. Buyers should note this is a very short video with very short segments: Dance with me - 4 min (dancing with your baby) Tummy Time - 3 min (crunches with your baby) FitBaby - 3 minutes (workout for your baby) Quiet Time - 3 min (stretching while massaging your baby) and Stroller Boogie - 2 min (using a rubber band to workout with your stroller).

However, I am disappointed with this one. WARNING: this video is only 18 minutes long! And that includes all the talking. Furthermore, although the first set of exercises is great, I found the set using the stroller to be pretty much useless: I can't drag my dirty stroller into the middle of the living room!It would be nice if Leisa could have come up with some more exercises that don't need props. Sure, with a small baby, one might not be able to do more than 15 or 20 minutes at a time, but, for the money, we should be given more material.

I probably forgot a few spots that dried out ... and to my surprise it left streaks on the auto body that cannot be removed afterwards. I have tried to wash the car, applied some polish and it does not come off. Turtle wax says this product is better than any run formula ... at least the run formula will go away with water, this one needs a cloth ... not really convenient ! Do turtle wax actually test their products on real cars before they sell them ? You wonder ! Stay away from it if you like your car paint."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the scariest books I've ever read.","review":"I thought the beginning was a little confusing, but once I got into it I couldn't stop reading- it actually took me just two afternoons to finish the book. Although I don't really understand why everybody thinks it's so much like Steven King. I've never been a big fan of King's, but absolutely love this one. Much better than any Stephen King book I've ever read (maybe I haven't read enough of them?). I agree that the ending could have been abit better though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scariest book I've ever read","review":"This book is hard to read if you're in the house alone. Will keep you awake after you put it down for the night. I've read them all and this one will scare the living daylights out of you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"Because I am a beloved Stephen King fan, I actually took HIS advice and read this book. I was very disapointed. I actually had a hard time finishing the book and when I got to the last 30 pages or so I just skimmed through them and was relieved to have it over and done with. What a boring and tedious book this was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dim, confused and interminable","review":"Straub's novel ambles along ponderously, going nowhere for hundreds of pages as he labors to build an atmosphere of mystery and dread, and exhausts his readers' patience with his unwillingness to let us in on what's happening. It's like watching a magician dash around the stage for twenty minutes, all dramatic poses and flourishes, without ever performing an actual trick. Occasionally Straub has someone die offstage in odd fashion. Yet two-thirds of the way through, we still know almost nothing about who or what is behind their deaths or why. All we know is that a terrible secret from the past has led to some form of supernatural revenge being taken decades later upon some very dull, thinly sketched characters with whom we have insufficient reason to empathize. That much I could have gotten from reading the jacket flap. By the time all this wearisome effort shows signs it might pay off in the final pages, it's too late to care."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull","review":"this is one where the movie is better than the book....found the book to be just plain dull. just seemed to wander all over the place, would not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Start. Muddled ending.","review":"I've read only two of Straub's books, this one and \\"Lost Boy. Lost Girl.\\" The latter is definitely more consistant, but \\"Ghost Story\\" has more moments of brilliance. In fact, if the second half had been as good as the first, it would probably rank as one of my favorite novels EVER (if not THE best). Unfortunately, once the evil force is no longer a mysterious entity (it is explained in excruciatingly disappointing detail), the creepiness ends and it becomes a convoluted monster hunt. By the time I reached the bizarre and rather anticlimactic conclusion, I didn't care anymore.Despite my disappointment with the conclusion, I still consider this one of the scariest books I've read in a LONG time."},{"rating":"2","title":"There Is Nothing Better","review":"Not only is this a readable, enjoyable, intelligent, and well written novel of horror (many are not)it has one thing that sets it apart above all others. It is complete. Not only does it tell what happened, it tells you why, and it explains what it is. Far too often does a book examine the tradional monsters of lore by detailing their habits, but this goes a step further by explaining why and how. It reveals the truth about vampires, werewolves, and ghosts. They're all the same thing. They're you. If there's a better novel out there, I have not read it. You can let me know if you have. I highly reccomend this book for fans of Stephen King who want to read something great by another author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"This novel by Straub is horror of the buried secret variety.Basically, a group of friends, as young men, kill someone, by accident. Rather than own up, they cover it up.Many years later, their group keeps getting smaller, and what isout their may have a much more devastating effect than just getting ridof them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary!","review":"If you are looking for a real ghost story and a real bad scare,they open this book!The book can at times get complicated but once you get the basic idea,you would see what a masterpiece this book is...Nigel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Effort","review":"I found this book to be tedious, boring, and poorly written.

After working my way through the first 200 boring pages which were not even particularly well-written, I was about to just give up when my puppy got hold of the paperback and shredded it. Turns out she did me a favor. How in the world did this book get such good reviews?? I'm stumped."},{"rating":"1","title":"One-star rating, until I finish the blasted thing","review":"I agree with mattneal@hotmail.com in that, so far, Ghost Story has been a difficult launch for me! It's been about two weeks, and I'm only on page 205. It's a good story, yes yes yes, but what's with the tweedy, dorky Sears James and Ricky Hawthorne? What BO-ring characters. I'm crossing my fingers, ploughing through the next three hundred pages and hoping for the best. I trust good reviews and will see for myself how accurate they are. I'll let you all know in a couple of weeks, it looks like, how the book is upon completion. But for now, I do recommend it, based on the fact that there ARE good parts, it's a very intriguing story line. . .I just wish it would get to the point already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like getting stuck in traffic","review":"I, like many, got to this book through the recommendations of Stephen King and the joint work him and Peter Straub did together. At present, I am 200 pages into this book and asking myself why I am still reading it. The novel begins with character development and proceeds to attempt to develop every citzen in Milburn. Too much! It spends so much time on the characters that I have stopped caring about them awaiting the horror part of the book. Reading it is like being stuck in traffic waiting for things to get moving. No horror, no scary, save your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I found this book to be tedious, uninteresting, and utterly forgettable. Not really much more to say. Try before you buy; it is definately not for everyone despite Stephen King's recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booorrring! Way too long","review":"This story started slow and remained that way. There are so many character I forgot who's who. Plugged as a horror story is wrong. The scary bits, if you can call them that, are few and far between. The story is predictable and a hard read.There is no value for money."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the great horror novels","review":"Ghost Story is not only one of Peter Straub's finest books, it's one of the finest horror novels written. Of course, Hollywood then went ahead & made a truly awful film! So if you're avoiding reading this book because you saw the film, do yourself a favor and read this book! Straub's depiction of a town under siege by malevolent forces is unforgettable, much in the same way of King's Salem's Lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre at best","review":"I have been reading mostly sci-fi lately and wanted to try something new. I used to be a big Stephen King fan and had heard of Straub but never read him. This book has some stellar reviews so I thought I would give it a try.I must say I was sorely disappointed. The first two thirds was mind numbingly boring and the last third was simply contrived foolishness. And for a horror story it wasn't scary at all. I'll take classic King over this any day. I guess its back to sci-fi for me..."},{"rating":"1","title":"An enormous disappointment","review":"I'd been saving this title for twenty years, and finally decided to read it based on how many good reviews I'd read of it. I was utterly disappointed: although the smalltown in wintertime atmosphere was beautifully evocative, the fight with the ghost didn't seem scary at all, but rather dully cinematic (there's a huge fight at the end, and then another even more enormous fight after that, and the great teaser of a beginning is resolved after that in a somewhat pedestrian fashion). I think what was most disheartening for me was how derivative the book was: the first story of the Chowder Society is clearly a reworking of \\"The Turn of the Screw,\\" and much of the rest of the story relies heavily on Steven King's SALEM'S LOT in both its plot and its method."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much Here","review":"I borrowed this book from the library after reading the four and five star reviews on Amazon. It was very disappointing to find out that it was not scary as advertised. The characters never come alive and the situations in which they are involved are implausible. I kept expecting to be caught up in the story but it never happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I purchased this book with great expectations of enjoying a suspenseful read. Unfortunately it's not. There's a great opening prologue involving an apparent kidnapper and a young girl who is apparently his victim. Then we move on to the Chowder Club, a group of old men who tell ghost stories and for the two hundred or so pages we are stuck. We get hints of horrors, a lot of confusing suggestions meant to baffle and keep the reader interested but it is done so often and for so long that it fails. Interesting and gripping moments along the way but too few to keep this reader's interest. I forced myself to the end however.Shame. I like some of Straub's books (Koko) and since this was hailed by so many as one of his best, I thought I'd enjoy it. Did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not scary","review":"This book is as scary as any B-movie you are likely to see. Very predictable and not really worth your time. The only thing that really scared me was the thought that the book is slowly coming to its end and nothing is going to happen. My fears were not baseless. Since I really like SK and he recommends this guy (and worked with him) I guess I'll give him another chance - maybe Lost boy, lost girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Boring, Boring!","review":"Just finished this five-hundred-page mess. I have never been so bored or frustrated with a novel as I found myself with THIS one! Unnecessarily long, unnecessarily wordy, and as frightening as an episode of The Brady Bunch, this novel trudges on forever, is terribly anti-climatic, and fills the reader's head with so much rambling nonsense that, by page 180, I considered abandoning the read. But, I hung in there--hoping the story would improve with each page--only to realize that this unnecessarily complex mess of characters and plot lines only gets worse. The most thrilling aspect of the story is FINISHING it--never to have to read it again! Huge waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary!","review":"I read this book back in the 1970's when it was first published. Peter Straub reminded me very much of the way Stephen King used to write back then -- really, really scary. If you're a fan of real ghost stories, I strongly recommend this book. I just had to buy it again and re-read. The stuff that's published today cannot touch this. It WILL keep you awake at night, making sure all the doors are locked, windows shut and night lights on. Enjoy the goosebumps!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth reading","review":"One of the those books where the only reason you even bother to finish it is because you've already read so far. It starts off with a definite air of suspense and terror but I thought the ending really didn't seem to fit. The heros in the book are up against this supposedly shape shifting monster that has been here since the beginning of time and yet the way that they kill her is so mundane."},{"rating":"2","title":"staub's best","review":"the only reason i'm writing this puppy is because after reading all of straub's books, ghost story is the best. his earlier work (julia, if you could see me now) was pretty good, but not stephen king level. ghost story is, nuff' said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and boring all the way through","review":"I really had to force myself through each chapter of this so called horror masterpiece. Straub is a good writer in his own right but this book just didn't do it for me. It wasn't overly predictable but the character's actions were frustrating. I've never had such an incredibly difficult time finishing a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really tried to read this, but......","review":"I picked up this book based on the recommendation by Stephen King in Danse Macabre. I liked the mood and the basic premise of the book, but the constant shifting in viewpoint between the characters and the jumping back and forth from the present to past events just made me quit reading half way. It just became too irritating and with over a year's reading to do on my bookshelf, I just couldn't justify spending any more time on it. I am sure more forgiving readers will enjoy the novel, but I personally expect a novel to be structured in a way to encourage the reader to keep reading. Unfortunately for me, it ceased to be fun and became a chore instead.This is only the third book that I have started reading and didn't finish in my entire life. It was that bad for me. With the praise I keep reading about Straub, I would be willing to give him another shot. But it won't be this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie is far better","review":"I don't think I've ever given up on a book with only 100 pages or so to go, but I did this with this one. I just browsed through the remaining pages to see if it got better at any point (it didn't). I was very disappointed by this book, I expected something better considering all the praise it has received, and also I had seen the movie and I had found it very scary and haunting. In fact the change of concept in the movie (to make Eva a ghost coming back to haunt her killers, instead of this obnoxious shape-changing thing) was a winner. This book is Stephen King at his silliest, with all that stuff about characters behaving erratically because of some supernatural and all-seeing influence, etc. but I have to say that even at his worst King can infuse more spirit, interest and life to his stories and characters. If you are die-hard fan of Stephen King's IT and suchlike books, you may like this one; otherwise, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too slow and long","review":"Trying to read this book was an awful experience. This book could be half as long as it is. I was so aggravated with it after being 2/3's of the way through that I finally had to give up. The very few frights that are there are few and far between. The story is very disjointed and the author seems to be playing, \\"guess what's in my pocket\\" with the readers throughout--which I find very irritating. Nothing about this seemed like a \\"ghost\\" story. See the movie, skip the book! Dull, dull, dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meandering and pointless","review":"If you enjoy being dizzy (and I don't mean with delight or excitement) then this is the book for you. It constantly is hopping you backwards and forward in time, not only that, but you are constantly hit by a slew of new characters (all peripheral and mostly unimportant) aunts, uncles, friends, sons, dentists, doctors insurance sales men...MAKE IT STOP! Enough is enough. I read this book and it would end up irritating me to the point of putting it down. I like an interesting and complex plot line as well as the next person, however, this seems self serving and written just to show you how damn clever Mr. Straub is and how stupid you the reader are for being unable, or unwilling, to follow along with this meandering and endless tale. I normally like most things but I really hate this. Very disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORROR SPECIAL OLYMPICS CONTESTANT.","review":"Peter Straub breaks the cardinal rule of fiction writing with this loser: SOMETHING BETTER HAPPEN IN THE FIRST 5 PAGES. Nothing much happens in this book for 66 pages....a character sees a ghost briefly. Whoopee. Then two kids 'cross-over,' like they were catching the bus to school.Fiction exists to give you vicarious experiences, lessons, and feelings. GHOST STORY reminds me of schizophrenics with 'happy feet,' who wander aimlessly about the asylum's grounds, and bump into fences and trees. The queerness of the spectacle quickly decomposes to boredom.Good horror should be identical to what you experience when you put your hand up your girl's leg and discover something that shouldnt be there. Something that immediately puzzles and alarms you.Straub (and King, lately) remind me of horror writers who've crossed-over to the Special Olympics or Kiddie Ride section of literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book for any use other than a sleep aid","review":"After reading so many good reviews on this book, I decided to get it and give it a shot. I had read something by the same author many years ago and remember disliking his writing style (I felt it was on a 6th grade level), so I stayed away for a while. While I don't feel that the book was poorly written, it definitely was NOT good. At all.This book is not scary. This book is not good. It's not even interesting. About 50% through the book there was one \\"tense moment,\\" and the rest was drivel. By the end of this predictable book, I just couldn't wait for it to end. Finishing this book was a sheer act of willpower, and an agonizing few days. I would never read this book again, or recommend it to anyone. I will probably never read this author again either.

We were not able to take more than 8 or 10 pictures before the battery went dead.I gave this camera 2 stars because I did like the camera design, easy of use and number of editing features.

I do have some other graphics software so it is not a total loss.If you're smart you will go to a company's web site and see if they have a phone number for tech support and see if you can contact them before you buy anything.

The one player mode is bad and the game is only fun if you have friends over. This game was made for the wii zapper and is a good gun game if you have one. Also there are only 3 levels and each level takes about 5 minutes. Even if you do have friends over it gets boring really fast and it gets hard to tell witch sight is yours. Lastly it is a waste of $30 and *consider carefully before buying*."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you love shooting?","review":"I just wanted to put a note in here that this is an extremely fun game if you love to shoot.This game is also excellent for people who do not like the nauseating experience from other shooting games that shake the screen too much as you move.Even though the stages are replayed, they get harder and you get to unlock other paths not found in the arcade game ( I believe)I had a blast with this game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Multiplayer problems","review":"The multiplayer mode is a major feature of this game but the game will not recognize my second remote. All other Wii games recognize the other remote in multi player mode. Ghost Squad just flashes when I press the + button on the second remote.

I have not seen any resolutions to the problem of recognizing a second remote."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's just as fun as Virtua Cop ever was!","review":"this game is just as fun, if not more, than the Virtua Cop series. i would recommend this to any Virtua Cop fan. not quite as fun as Time Crisis, but good enough for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids enjoy playing this game...","review":"My kids have played this at the local arcade. They think the Wii version is even more fun. It's a basic shooting game. It is different in that the people that are shot do not bleed but just disappear. There is also a strange mode, paradise, where the enemy are women in bikinis. Interesting. Although there only three locations the kids found other modes to keep them interested. We also had no trouble adding a second player...when the first player is in the game the second person presses + and they are in. We only own the Wii remote and it works with this game fine. So far so good. I would note this game is simple, so if you want a more complex shooting game this may not be for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must buy","review":"My son loved this game.

Me and my 8 year old son continue to enjoy it even now after having it for 8 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Short To Fully Enjoy","review":"I bought this product because it allowed 2 shooters at once. Maybe it's me, but I haven't been able to figure out how to do that, after repeated tries, yet. The game only has 3 levels (or maps). After that, there's no more. The levels that are there, are well done and of arcade quality. I just can't give it a high rating since it just doesn't provide \\"bang\\" for the buck due to its very short duration and lack of replay value. It does work very well with the SureShot handgun."},{"rating":"1","title":"No the best","review":"I was looking for a decent shooting game for Wii. Clearly not the best brely decent.

The Wii provides an amazing platform for gun games, and this is one of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"This shooter is dull by the standards set by other Wii shooters. It isn't creepy like the zombie shooters, it isn't quick and cute like Link Crossbow or the chicken games, and it isn't a Lee Marvin movie like most of the WWII shooters.

Plus, it's up to 4 players and has a party mode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too short","review":"This game is rally fun for untill you beat the three levels in the game! They have basicly the same three levels but change it to nighttime instead of day to pass as another level. I'm talking the same enemies in the same places, same mission.

It was obviously written by someone experienced in teaching Sanskrit, and sensitive to student input. It was easy to follow and repetitive enough to give the beginning student a certain sense of mastery as each new piece of information would build on the last. I highly recommend it for any beginning student who may have found the Colson text entirely too overwhelming and confusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I became very interested in Sanskrit after visiting some temples in Japan. This is a great book for beginners, as the alphabet is big and clear, and the book shows the stroke order of each. It also eases into the grammar in such a way that you can really stick with it and not become too confused like with other text books. This is also great because it has advice and exercises to help you keep what you learn fresh in your mind. Unfortunately it does not come with a CD or casette (for pronunciation), but there are some great websites that can help you out with that. This book is highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works!","review":"Great product at a great price!

This video provides everything you need to do yoga for relaxation, for energy, for mediation, stress relief, etc. The video includes instruction on poses and breathing, an energizing AM routine, a daily connection routine for relaxation, energy, meditation, and a wonderfully relaxing evening bath routine. I highly recommend this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a really different Yoga video product.","review":"This Yoga DVD is a one of a kind! I was very plesently surprised with how much yoga was on it! It is very easy to use and theres a workout for every time of day. I found parts of the longer routine a bit challenging, but I especially liked the \\"Yoga Bath\\" (evening routine). It really works great to help me sleep. There is also an additional section that explained the different breathing techniques, which was very valuable. I own 4 different yoga videos, this is the second DVD I've bought -and it is by far my favorite one so far. Its a great value. (and the music is very soothing too)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best yoga dvd that I own!","review":"I have so many yoga instruction related items (books, vhs, dvds, cd-roms, etc.)and by far this is the best one. It is the most like a real level 1-2 yoga class. Plus, you don't have to deal with any props (props are fine in a yoga studio but at home it's too much to fool with). Unlike other yoga vhs/dvds, where it is difficult to connect movement with breath because of poor verbal cueing (i.e. Yoga Journal tapes) or the instructors' annoying habits (overly perky Yoga for Dummies lady), these three routines are great for daily practices and I like Hemalaya's straightforward style. Although the routines are basic, they include core yoga poses that even experienced yoga practitioners continually seek to refine. I recommend this dvd for anyone who has attended some yoga classes and is looking for a way to develop a daily yoga practice at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply wonderful!","review":"Without repeating what other reviewers have already written, let me just add that this is a fantastic DVD. I bought it because I saw it was voted best yoga DVD of the year. I am so pleased. Although I mainly use the 60 minute routine, it is great and shifts me to a wonderful place. Just the right pace, the right amount of meditation combined with movement. Try this one and you will be glad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging practice","review":"The 60 minute main workout is very challenging, but I was really glad to see that her workouts include a shoulder stand and shoulder stretch. Although I couldn't do the advance versions of these poses, I know that I will be able to work up to them. This is not for beginners and a beginner could be someone that has done yoga for 2 years or less. Even the beginner dvd's are useful for the advanced yogini's so my recommendation is not too move to fast through your yoga journey. I really liked this DVD but it was a bit too advanced for me. I will use it as something to work up to. The morning quickie will be great a couple times a week and the pm workout twice a week. I do have other yoga workouts that I will use when I feel like I just can't do this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not that it matters....","review":"This video has already recieved such praise that I dont know if someone would need much more convincing to buy it, but let me tell you, it is GREAT. Granted, it is my first yoga video but I have been doing yoga for over 2 years and I LOVE it. Her voice is soothing, which apparently is important (while researching, I kept reading about how anoying other instructors voices were). As someone with a medium-good range of knowledge of basic yoga, I found that I enjoyed it and felt it was simple to follow. I also think that someone who has very little knowledge would find it great as well. I didnt want a basic video but didnt want to be overwhelmed by dificult poses and I think I found that happy medium!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well for a little while","review":"I bought this for my husband for Christmas a few years ago. We were looking for an easier way to have access to our garden hose when and where we needed it.We were both very excited. It was much easier to cart our hose around the house depending on the task we wanted to do. It attaching and detatching the hose to the water was not as easy as I would have hoped - you have to disconnect from the water supply in order to 'reel' in the hose or the end gets all twisted up.The unit began to rust after only a short period of time; we have no space to keep the unit in the garage, so it stays outside. It is now all rusted out and the wheels no longer hold any air. We're going to have to throw it in the garbage.Seems like a lot of money for something we couldn't keep for too very long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"I bought this cart since I was tired of plastic carts cracking and falling apart with use.

It's going out to the curb next week."},{"rating":"2","title":"a much better hose reel than the plastic ones I've tried","review":"The reel works very smoothly to roll up a couple of hundred feet of hose with little effort. The large wheels allows it to roll over rough terrain very well. It is much sturdier than any of the plastic hose reels I have tried in the past and the hose winds up much more easily. It has brass fittings so it has handled freezing weather very well.I do wish it had a wheel lock to keep it from rolling sometimes. It would also be nicer if it had a way to lock the hose reel into one spot when the item is being wheeled about as I have had it unwind a few times. I have only had it for two months and there is a spot of rust appearing near one of the welds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing pieces","review":"Items in box were haphazardly placed in box with a couple of pieces of cardboard and styrofoam, but parts appear to be in good condition.

Can't call them because they're closed on weekends. What's the good of having Prime shipping if you can't assemble the cart when it arrives? It does appear to be a sturdy cart - if only I had all the parts! 1-star rating for now, but hopefully my opinion will change if and when I get two more wheels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liberty Hose Reel Cart","review":"We ordered this product for use at one of our baseball parks and it has been a tremendous help in pre-game, in-game and after-game use.

That is the only design flaw we have found in the reel cart."},{"rating":"1","title":"POS","review":"Received this hose cart only to send it back. The handle is way too short and makes moving 300' feet of hose a back-breaking experience. The also feeds over the reel in some peculiar fashion.

I've had it for less than a year and I'm seeing rust form so the powder coating is not too good. My biggest complaint is the fact that everytime you crank it up or pull it out, the intake hose is not free spinning and gets bound up. This really sucks if you are using a quick release hose connector since it loosens the thread on the adapter and causes leaks. Other than that, no real complaints."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is total GARBAGE!","review":"I am on our FOURTH one of these in less that 18 months.

If we weren't stuck under the replacement plan, I would NEVER purchase this DVD player. It's junk. We have tried treating it with the gentlest care imaginable and it still stops working.

I don't know if the whiteness of the screen is related to low battery power or what, but it stopped working.My principal complaint is that the service/repairs are shoddy, and the company simply doesn't stand by its products.

I must admit that when it worked there was no problem with picture quality or sound etc. I now get a message that says \\"no disk\\".

When I first used this unit, I loved it. The battery lasted almost 4 hours, the picture was great. The only downside was the tinny sound of the speakers. A pair of good headsets solved that problem.Then the problem started. I used this only three times, and now, the battery will not hold a charge. It works maybe 4-5 MINUTES before the battery shuts down.I have contacted the company, and they offered a new battery for 40 dollars. I was considering buying one, thinking maybe it was just my battery that was defective. Then I talked to others who bought this same DVD player. They ALL had the same problem.

The ridiculous plot, the apparent lack of any editorial oversight regarding the numerous grammatical errors, and the predictable ending all add up to a very dull reading experience for anyone unfortunate enough to have spent good money on this book (fortunately, I was loaned a copy).

Inspector Kurt Wallander, aches & pains (mind, body & soul) plods along. This time out Mankell is less than his usual self in my humble, but still so vastly superior to almost everybody else (except New Mexico's Steve Havill) that I'll also reread this one again--like the four others thus far translated into English.

Pretty stupid Cop 101 mistake--inexcusable from almost anybody else."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Step Behind","review":"This volume is one of the best entries in the Wallander series. All the books are character-driven and interesting--to me--for that reason, but this story also has a carefully crafted plot with some good twists and turns.

One Step Behind is no exception as Wallander and his colleagues have to solve a murder mystery involving several young people and one of their own fellow detectives.

Gavin Harrison's talent with percussion is especially impressive, mind-boggling and entertaining.But lyrically, it's the Final Cut, a la Steve Wilson. Been there, heard that.

And different PT CDs appeal to different people for different reasons. But this is the third CD in a row -- after \\"In Absentia\\" and \\"Deadwing\\" -- that I think is a very fine effort. Steven Wilson and his band make some quality music that can appeal to far more than just fans of prog-rock. Call it \\"pop-prog\\" if you will. It's very listenable, very accessible, and yet has a lot of the little things that I look for in prog: extended pieces that are not boring because they contain enough surprises and clever turns to keep me interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"Porcupine Tree's latest is INCREDIBLE!","review":"Fear of a Blank Planet is sure to please both old and new Porcupine Tree fans. The writing on this album is rhythmically advanced, harmonicallycomplex, and Wilson's writing just seems to get better and better despite his dark side. The title track is very catchy, the guitar is heavy but pleasing, and Gavin Harrison's drumming is stellar. The second track, My ashes, contains an ethereal and Floydian atmoshere with a luscious string texture. The 3rd track, Anesthetize, is 17 minutes and 42 seconds of greatness. Harrison's drumming is spot on, hypnotic, and beyond explanation. Alex Lifeson from RUSH contributes to this track as well. Robert Fripp also makes a guest appearance. If you like Floyd, space rock, tool, groove, odd time signatures, sound effects, keyboard texture, and something else which is unclassifiable, Porcupine Tree is the hottest thingout there in 2007."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing...as usual...","review":"steven wilson is simply a genius. He cant help it, he just is.

A fan since 'Signify', I've often wished their aggressive moments weren't so few and far between; the metal infusion suits me fine. My only criticism is that the last two cuts seem \\"tacked on\\" and the big choruses, by that point, a tad predictable. I withhold one star solely because I set the bar impossibly high for these guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audiophile Alert","review":"This box set does not include the DVD-A advanced resolution/MLP lossless 5.1 surround mix. Only DTS 5.1 digital surround sound and 24 bit stereo versions. Nice package if you are a Porcupine Tree fan, but not the ultimate sound if you have been waiting for the actual DVD-A version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and growing on me","review":"I discovered PT with In Absentia. Since then I have seen them live twice and am about to see them again in about 3 weeks. Deadwing to me is their masterpiece so far. FOABP is another wonderful effort but it definitely is more atmospheric and ethereal than Deadwing. I was hoping for a couple of real \\"standout\\" songs like HALO and SHALLOW from Deadwing but there's nothing here that really does that. I myself like the heavy stuff alongside the incredible musicianship. Gavin Harrison has fast become my favorite drummer and on this CD he approaches Virgil Donati territory. Incredible stuff. One thing I noticed is that Track 5- Way Out Of Here could be right off of a PERFECT CIRCLE Cd. It's way too similar if you ask me. I still like it though. I can't wait to hear some of these tunes live but I'm hoping for a good mix of older stuff too. Deadwing is going to be hard to beat for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark, highly involved and interesting - a little different from the last 2 CDs","review":"I've quickly become a Porcupine Tree fan. I purchased Deadwing and In Absentia first, and then followed that by getting older works. I think Steven Wilson is an amazing song-crafter (for lack of a better descriptor). When I first purchased Fear of a Blank Planet and looked at the total song count - 6 - I was a little disappointed. After I listened to it once, I was struck at the slight evolution their music appeared to take on it. Now, I can't stop listening to it. Gavin Harrison is an off-the-charts great drummer and he's had his chains loosened on this CD. Overall, this is a stunning piece of music, and has to be considered one of the very best from PT and one of the very best for 2007 period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I am really glad I found this cd.

(Sentimental) The entire cd is fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"Bored kids, kids on drugs, kids who hate their parents, kids who waste their live in shopping malls, kids who listen to s***t like Pearl Jam, disillusioned kids....this is what this album is all about. Great lyrics, great sound, great drummer...God bless Steven Wilson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Porcupine Tree continues to impress","review":"I first heard this cd at a friend's house. It was so incredible that I just had to buy it for myself. Every time I listen to this music, I get transported into another magical world.Porcupine Tree has that incredible power to get the listeners entranced. The music, the singing, the lyrics are top-notch. This band has made many unforgettable cds. The music in this one ranges from a melancholic sound to a frantic beat. All the songs fit in with each other magnificently. Give it a listen through a sampler, and you'll discover one of the best bands of today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps A Bit Too \\"Concise\\"","review":"FOABP is, sonically and creatively, diverse and satisfying. I confess, however, upon my first listen, that I was disappointed in the overall brevity. I agree that Wilson continues to mature incredibly as a songwriter, vocalist and guitarist. His guitar phrasing is simply astounding and always elevates each song to incredible levels. Yet, somehow, the expectation that this CD would surpass the briliant \\"Deadwing\\" of 2 years ago leads me to slight disappointment and a sense of anticlimax with each repeated listen. The length and contrast of Deadwing are sorely missing. Perhaps Porcupine Tree as a band, and Steven Wilson as an unparalled songwriter of recent times, are so far apart now from the \\"rest of the pack\\" that one simply cannot come to grips with the fact that the CD must, eventually, end! Required listening for any serious proghead and music fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with first few listens maybe it gets better?","review":"Have to say am most disappointed with my first few listens of this CD. After reading a few reviewers who raved about this band I went out and bought this cd. I find it really hard to listen to. For me there is nothing that reaches out and grabs you. Sure I am sure they are great muso's but they need to work on there songwriting to make it more listenable in my opinion. Its all a bit wishy washy and drab, could do with the occasional heavy riff or a change of pace to keep you interested. Obviously not for me, much better prog metal out there IMO."},{"rating":"2","title":"just keeps getting better","review":"i have been a fan ever since their beginning, and each release has seemed to redefine steven's vision.

Dark and beautiful, musically, lyrically. Only six songs, but they are worth the while. These guys have many other great songs before this as well.

If you are big on Tool and Placebo, I reccomend this to compliment your collections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical Dope","review":"Dark, deep, powerful, wonderfully executed, artsy, rocking, audiophile quality, and melodic = I am undeniably hooked.Great band, great songs, not to be missed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging listening","review":"Nice songwriting. I've read that the lyrics are not as abstact in the touchy feely way that some folks like in order to frame music within their own interpretation, but that was obviously not the intent here.The album's theme is social in a generational subtext like the Who's Quadrophenia, a narrative, but much more than one man's plight. I don't think the message could have been couched in an indirect way and gotten the message across. This record hits you and pulls you in, and has so many nice layers, moods and nuances that I'm going to enjoy the seduction. Ultimately it moves me as a listener and I like that"},{"rating":"2","title":"impressive modern prog rock...yet very dark...not for parties!","review":"As a long time prog rock fan, I'd say FOABP is executed as well as most any prog-influenced theme album i've heard. Though the overall musical influence of Porcupine Tree's work is progressive rock, they add effective dashes of more contemporary rock elements, like grunge and metal, in order to keep things lively. It is a great listen many times over. Be warned that the album cover artwork reflect the dark mood of the lyrics and set the overall tone of the music. As such, some may not take as well to this album as might be the case otherwise. Yes, Genesis, Rush, Pink Floyd fans: take note of Porcupine Tree and this album! I caught the live tour for this album as well which was equally impressive."},{"rating":"2","title":"PT perfection","review":"The only problem with this record is that it over long before you want it to be. SW's production genius is apptly displayed and the the deep textures and melodic layering that is PT is in full regalia. The subject matter is legitimate and relevent, albeit dark (but that's what we've come to expect and respect) Harrison is a madman, a percussionist driven!Edwin provides his solid skills on the bottom end. Barbieri creates masterful ambiance to add to SW's (with the help of Wesley, Lifeson, Fripp) inspired guitar works. The vocal work is completely fitting and full of the rich harmonys that all PT fans admire. All combine to create a new genere trancending experience that is a must hear. In short if you are a fan you should not be disappointed. If your not a fan you will be. Catch PT live, they are all that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't be put into words........","review":"There's just not much more I can say about this band that I haven't already said. Steven Wilson's music can bring you to tears one minute, and banging your head the next minute. Porcupine Tree has everything I love about music in general, and this album is no exception.Fear of a Blank Planet speaks to me more than any other PT album has in the past, because its subject matter consists of all the things that terrify me about raising a child in the \\"digital age\\" of over-medication, over-stimulation, and being raised in a latch key environment.In the last couple of years with the release of Deadwing, In Absentia, and this disc, I have put Porcupine Tree on a very high pedestal. My addiction started with Stupid Dream and it has only grown since then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to believe, but yet another monu-mental piece of art!","review":"Another work of sheer beauty and power. The focus is on dynamics within songs, and the production is mind-blowing and modern. Steve Wilson is a musical genius as a player, yet has all the studio savvy to go along with that. Guitar playing, keyboards, and pianos are all loud and rocking, and the album has been produced with high levels of atmosphere thrown in like huge gobs of sonic candy. Vocals are excellent, and the bass player and drummer really keep things extra tight. Heavy and beautiful. The 17 minute track is a true centerpiece and is almost worth the price of the album alone. But its all amazing, and all a very large step above the norm and the mundane."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not my favorite.","review":"This is a good album. I still prefer the last two over this one but understand that this is the one doing the best in sales and on the charts so more power to 'em.Porcupine tree is still one of the best bands out there. Definatly worth a listen.Would love to see them tour with Marillion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive pubescent whining","review":"I feel misled by the other reviews. The same pathetic lyrical content is recycled through every song: I am a bored teenager who hates my parents and wonders the mall stoned with no other purpose in life than to play XBox and feel sorry for myself. I don't know what motivated Steve Wilson to devote an entire release to this theme, but my copy is now in the round file. The music is OK, but not any better than previous PT. I recommend buying a different Porcupine Tree album if this is to be your first. I honestly enjoy Deadwing and still am interested in other material by PT and Steve Wilson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"As a long time dedicated PT fan, I'm always looking forward to the next PT album. Since Signify I know it takes about 10 listen sessions to get caught by the album. Usually the albums grow by each session but this one did not get me the first time and I quitted after the tenth. I miss the empty spacey atmospheres and I miss good songs. The second Blackfield fulfilled expectations, FOABP did not.

Not incredibly bad storyline, but almost no fighting! Lorenzo doesn't even do his jumping pump roundhouse (a move which he is most notable using in his TV show Renegade). The movie came out one year before his show started, so I guess he was desperate for a role, so he didn't mind starring in this film. Lorenzo plays Miles Keane, a night club owner and photographer. He payed off his loan to the guy who gave it to him by fighting for him. His employer wants him to fight again, he refuses, and then gets framed for murder.

How does a basic bread formula change in 5 years????We also discovered that earlier printings of the book had companion errata slips to correct the typos .

Many authors feel that they are the logical choice to read their own works--they wrote it, they felt it, they know where all the pregnant pauses should fall. I can think of many examples where this is true, but not in this case.Ms. Smith reads every word with the same inflection-- no change in tone or volume, no dramatic emphasis, no pausing for effect. The comings and goings of her neighbors, the dramatic onset of her period, or the unexpected death of her brother, all are intoned with equal lack of affect.

If your answering machine can't do that reliably, wouldn't you say you purchased a bum product? Well, about two weeks after buying this guy, co-workers started saying \\"hey, don't you have an answering machine?\\" and I knew we had a problem. Tested it and sure enough, it picked up only about 50% of the time. Our Uniden never had that problem. We sent it to GE and to their credit, got a replacement phone in about 2-3 weeks.

It reminds me of the very first cordless phones that you had to hold in just the right orientation in just the right place to get good reception.The LCD display is all but illegible. You have to look at the screen at some weird angle in order to increase the contrast to where you can read it.

They're practically constant now--well, actually, I stopped using it since it doesn't recharge anymore without blinking and making clicking noises. Even when it would be fully charged and right next to the base, it would say it was out of range. In the middle of a phone call, with a full battery, it would turn off and I'd have to run over to the base and put it in for a second and press on.

The display is small and if you have caller ID, the number and name of the person calling does not register (I have an AT&T cordless phone that does register the number). One other thing to consider is...the handset is not a speaker phone (very disappointing).

At times, the band goes for a more bouncy, electronic feel that reminds me of Postal Service. At other times, they really groove well with a jazz-tinged indie rock in the way bands like Sea and Cake used to. The songwriting is strong - I'd say 2 or 3 songs are a little weak, but the first 5 songs and the closer are fantastic. I've showed it to all my picky audiophile friends and they're digging it too.

I have attempted to research the various forms of both conditional and unconditional security. In an attempt to be discerning and fair, I read Charles Stanley's book on Eternal Security. I was dismayed to learn that he would say that one may be saved by faith, but then fall from faith and become an unbeliever, and STILL remain in a saved condition. I think that Dan Corner's book on this teacher and teaching is both balanced and needed. He shows how Scripture refutes Stanley's \\"once saved always saved\\" position, and he explains how the word of God does teach security--a security that is conditioned on continued obedient faith. This small book should be supplemented with Corner's larger book on conditional security."},{"rating":"1","title":"Devastating the Bible, Too?","review":"This book may be a shocking expose of Charles Stanely only because Charles Stanley uses bad arguments for true doctrine.

I really had hoped this would contain the scenes cut from the original dvds.If you don't already have seasons 1-3 on disk than this is a good deal but if you do this is not worth it. All three seasons are subtitled so if you bought an older version like I did before they subtitled them this is a bit better.Rebelde: la serie completa es basicamente temporadas 1-3 en una cosita. Si ya tiene rebelde en dvd entonces no compra esto porque no es nada nuevo. La tiene 'los mejores besos', unas videos de rbd, pleitos, 'las mejored escenas de amor', trayecotiras, y una galeria.

It is easy to follow and does not require you to purchase odd ingredients, plus it educates you on the nasty realities of the commercial cleaners you've been using for years. I actually look forward to cleaning days now, as my house smells crisp and fresh, not chlorine and chemical-like. I also do not worry about harsh solvents that my children might get into.

As someone who lives in the country where waste water is returned to the ground in my back yard (septic system), I'd cringe when I'd dump Vanish in my toilet or Comet in my sink. This book has a lot of effective alternative options. Some of them take a little more effort because they aren't as harsh or caustic and their chemical counterparts. That being said, you can go a long way to make your house less toxic by using the suggestions in this book. The tip about baking soda sprinkled on dirty dishes is a gem!

Most of the recipes are repetitive. The most annoying aspect though, the author rants about how ANY artificial/chemical product (like commercial dishwashing liquid and artificial scents) is too risky to use in her opinion, but then she turns around and uses commercial dish soap and artificial berry scent in later recipies.

As another reviewer said, start small with vinegar, baking soda, and club soda, perhaps a box of borax too. My one real gripe with the book is that it is fairly disorganized and it is not easy to go back and look up recipes. That being said I would still recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great idea","review":"I am very much particular when it comes to cleanliness not just with in my self but to almost anything about and around me. And when a friend of mine introduced to me the book authored by Karen Noonan Logan, I feel really excited about it.What I did is I purchased the book, did read it, and tried the suggestions she provided about the utilization of baking sodas, vinegar and other liquid materials in cleaning up some areas of the house like the window, kitchen, etc. Well I am glad as they worked for me. When I applied them to the surface that I wanted to get cleaned, they totally work which is good! I think the author's idea was really great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An honest, clear guide to cleaning safely.","review":"I purchased this book along with another, larger book on this topic by a well-known author of books on the subject. I had assumed that I would learn more from the other book and that this would be a supplement. I couldn't have been more wrong. Not only is this book concise and easy to read, but Karen Logan explains the chemistry behind what makes combinations of ingredients work...or fail. This is critical to success with cleaning products of this nature. Because of her recipes, I have won my husband over to the efficacy of natural cleaning products. He always assumed they just didn't work. Additionally, she does not recommend the use of toxic ingredients (such as LYE! recommended in the other text when making soap!!) in any cleaners, so I don't worry about doing more harm than good. This book has paid for itself several times over. A very good read and an excellent investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book that could use a new edition","review":"I started making my own nontoxic cleaning products using recipes and information from the internet.

The author also discontinued her business selling containers, which she promotes in this book, so you'll have to find them elsewhere (but that's pretty easy).I agree with other reviewers that there's a lot of redundant information.

As any adult who has ridden a bike knows, the seat is the most uncomfortable thing, specifically on the nether regions. Without the horn, I thought my \\"area\\" would be safer. I guess it was. This seat is wide, so you have to practically straddle it OR sit as far forward as possible. I felt like my knees were going to hit the handle bars with every pedal I took. It was awful!

And, at least on my bike, there is no way to rotate the front side down enough to avoid this.I liked the idea of a tractor style seat. But, on a tractor, your legs work pedals far in front of you. On a bike, even with an upright sitting position one, your action is constantly pushing down. I could find no position on this saddle that made it a pleasant ride. I even tried sitting fully in the seat, legs lifted up, while coasting downhill. Still uncomfortable.I didn't give it one star, since there is no defect with the product. It's pretty much as described, but I for one am going back to more traditionally shaped seats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not comfortable","review":"I always felt as if I was falling off from the seat.

While the concept of a noseless saddle seemed like a good one, I found it pretty terrible on my commute to work (1.5 hours). All my weight was transferred to my arms, and I wasn't able to get any kind of pedaling consistency going. I constantly felt like I was going to fall forward off the bike. It made me feel like my frame was way too small. Maybe I need to adjust it again, but I'm starting to think there's a reason that noseless bike saddles haven't caught on in a big way.

The replacement is made with a nominal amount of metal so it simply sits on top of the \\"pipe\\" that comes out of the bike base. THERE IS NO ADJUSTMENT TO TILT THE SEAT FORWARD OR BACK.

Although the problems is not a male health concern, it interferes with normal biking. While pedaling, our thighs are continuously angling up and down as we pedal. The conventional seats allow this type of movement with little obstruction. With the \\"no pressure\\" seat, it either forces us to sit further forward or deal with the front lip under our thighs. Seating further forward will take us away from the comfortable sweet spot almost to where it feels as though we'll be slipping off.The best remedy I have found in a comfortable bike seat must fit three criterion.

This seat hinders your leg movement when peddaling at the back of thigh/butt area. :/ Spend a little more and get the Ergo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I bought this saddle just to see how it would work. In order to pedal, the seat either has to be lowered significantly, or you have to sit on the edge of it. Either way, on the downstroke, the corners of the seat dig into the insertion points of your hamstrings. You lose a lot of power, and expend a lot of energy trying to stay on the seat. Don't buy it. Buy the E3 Form Gel instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stephen Z Smith","review":"I rate the seat a two.

As I use to ride the bike mostly standing and lik to have the seat high enough so my legs will be stretched with the seat high.

Even after messing with the tilt and position adjustments for an hour, I could not find a position that would be both comfortable and not interfere with leg movement.I was also not too impressed by the build quality. The seat mount itself is only screwed in at two places, leaving the other two points to be held by a cheap plastic slot. This is stressed every time you lean to the left or right, which does not provide enough support and makes it awkward to balance on. I doubt this thing would last very long with regular use.Your experience may vary depending on how you sit on your bike, but before purchasing this seat consider that the traditional bicycle seat is designed with a horn for a reason. You need the horn so the seat will give you enough support while not restricting leg movement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't feel stable","review":"I bought this seat as a replacement for my stationary bike. It is very comfortable to sit on, but when you start pedaling it doesn't feel right. At first I had the seat adjusted forward a little. When I pedaled, I felt like I was falling forward. Then I leaned it back and the front edge of the seat was bumping into the back of my legs where your leg meets your butt. It just didn't feel right."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like comfort!","review":"I converted my bike to an indoor excercise bike and found that it was torture to sit on its seat.

I adjusted the position on the rails and the height of the seat many ways, but couldn't get it to work.PROS: - Nice firmness; not too hard, not too soft.- seemed to. E great quality, ESP for the money- the noiseless feature really worked. No problems with my \\"girl parts.\\"- cost!CONS: - The square shape does not give you room on the down pedal. As a result, my pedaling would push me forward , and I kept having to hike myself back up. They should have made the seat more triangular or arched, liket he moonsaddle.- no matter how you position it, the saddle is too far forward, and that really messed with my knees..Anyway, I have a very flat butt, so that might have contributed to the proble. My husband tried it, and though he wasn't a big fan, he didn't have the same kinds of problems as I did. Obviously, this seat works for many people. If you have knee issues, I would not recommend this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Purchased for 74 year old father","review":"I purchased this bike seat for my 74 year old father, after he requested it. My 70 year old mother has this seat on her Giant cruiser bike, and loved it, so my father gave it a try and decided it was more comfortable than his 'male' anatomical seat, and wanted one, too. He installed it easliy and has given it good ratings (and he is picky). Apparently it does take a little getting used to, since you have less control since a long nose is not between your legs, allowing you to guide the bike with thigh pressure, but for his aging, arthritic body, it is far more comfortable. It is easier to get on the bike, too. They ride at the most 10 flat Ohio miles, slowly, but they do ride pretty frequently so a comfortable seat is important. I am just glad that they are riding to stay in shape, and if this seat helps them to remain active, I'm all for purchasing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Replaced bike Seat with this one.","review":"I wasn't sure if it would work when it came, its a lot smaller than the picture makes it look.

The only downfall I have seen are the way the seat forcess you to be closer to the handle bars. There is no real way to adjust this. What I finnaly did was to just tilt the seat more forward then I would have thought you were supposed to( and against the advice of schwinn) and the ride is great. I had had surgery to my umm (well you know) and this seat has allowed me to continue riding.I will say that due to the riding position be ready to have more of an arm workout then you are used to when riding. I dont mind it really but my hands do suffer on long rides.One person commented that they felt a lack of control. I have not felt this at all and feel fully in control when I ride.

Unfortunately for me, it did not work out.The seat is not that wide (10 inches) compared to many other \\"comfort\\" saddles although the price is definitely right--about $30 cheaper than any other seat in the \\"comfort saddle\\" type category on the web.I used this on an electric scooter and I could not tip the seat forward like so many can do on a regular bicycle. Because of that, the full support effect of the wide saddle was lost. It was more uncomfortable than the seat I had, so I went out and purchased another saddle.I would say that if you can tip this saddle forward for your butt adjustment, you will be okay. But if you have a fixed seat post of some kind that makes forward/backward adjustment of the seat impossible, go with another wide saddle."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Comfort Bike Seat!","review":"I was shocked and dismayed at how uncomfortable this seat is. It's unimaginable that it was designed by a cyclist! Sure, it eliminates groin pain, but it creates other problems. The seat has to be tilted far forward to ensure that the front edge doesn't interfere with upper thigh movement. However, this causes your body to be thrust forward, an awkward position that increases pressure on the hands, arms, and shoulders while also adding stress to the legs. My arthritic right knee hurt for the first time while riding.The bottom line: I've returned the seat to Amazon for a refund and will look for another model."},{"rating":"2","title":"NO Pain In The Backside","review":"Since I have been using this seat on my Schwinn AerodyneI have been able to up my exercise time by 10min = 40 minutesa day 5 days per week.

The best track on the album -- possibly the best track of Ibbotson's career thus far -- is \\"Things Change.\\" An uplifting and beautiful track, it uses the same sample as Ian Pooley's \\"What's Your Number,\\" but takes it in a completely different direction.

The tea leaves are trapped inside the bottom of the filter and stop brewing. This works better than I expected and also makes it very easy to do a second brewing with the leaves (particularly nice for the greens and oolongs, works well with some of the black teas too). The filter, pot and lid/press are very easy to clean.I purchased mine on impulse at a local market and it came with a nifty neoprene (tea-o-prene) cozy that easily slips around the pot with velcro.

A very hands-on approach that really had me thinking about math differently. The first problem was dividing three subs for 4 children, 3 subs for 5 children, 4 subs for 5 children, and 7 subs for 8 children.

Most books focus on K-2. This book is the first one that really fit the bill! I loved learning the history of the use of fractions, decimals and percents. The classroom stories gave me ideas that I can transfer directly to my own classroom, as well as giving me a clearer picture of what mathematizing can look like. It was inspirational and thought provoking, especially on regards to my own practice.

It has a lot of great information and has an extensive Bibliography which is a great source. The Morrigan is a dynamic and far reaching goddess who appears in many forms.Rankine and D'Este goes far and trying to connect the Morrigan to several goddesses.The only issue that I have with this book is that the authors reach a bit much in some cases to link the Morrigan to many Celtic goddesses and non-Celtic goddesses, such as Andraste, Lamia and the Valkyries.But barring this I would highly recommend this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite...","review":"Though the book had some useful mythology, i had an issue with not only the grammar but the copy-paste seeming format. It seemed like the author just did a google search on the Morrigan and pasted all the half decent parts into a book. The same point is repeatedly reiterated and it gets redundant. Considering that there is so much conflicting information about the Morrigan, i was disappointed that more was not clarified."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far too many assumptions","review":"While it's hard for me to think of a subject more interesting than the Morrigan, the authors have basically assumed that pretty much every Celtic Goddess was just part of the Morrigan. As we really don't know that much about the mythology, they make assumptions and report them as fact.They are also determined to focus on sex with the Morrigan. This really serves to diminish the Morrigan, and is unfortunate. Nope, we can't have a strong female god. Her main purpose is to have sex with people.The drawings were, well, there.

This is a Russian edition, with Russian menus, Russian liner notes, and Russian narration (which thankfully can be turned OFF). It is most likely a bootleg, since the focus is pretty significantly fuzzy throughout, and the film is not to my knowledge officially available on DVD due to music clearances. The DVD cuts off at the last scene, before the credits. The \\"extras\\" consist solely of four crew bios... written in Russian.On the good side, the sound is clear, color balance is good, and this was dubbed from a print without any dirt or splices.

The scenes in LA are interesting for their vintage looks at a city no longer there as it was in the 60s. The plot is non-existent. This was a European director's take on American youth during the war protest days when peace was everything and the cops were \\"pigs,\\" worthy of being shot or else they might shoot you for having long hair. The ending is very surreal, extended slow-mo scenes of blow-ups. Freaky in a 60s way. It's all pretty tedious, though the orgy scene in the desert, while awkward to look at, was pretty suggestive for those days. The acting and dialogue between the two main characters is stilted at best. They seem like rank amateurs, which they were."},{"rating":"2","title":"A weak beginning, but a tour de force ending...","review":"\\"Zabriske Point\\" (1970) is directed by Antonioni(Blow-up, Red Desert). This film starts off very slowly focusing on youths at a campus. The initial scenes seem rather amateurish and weak, but once the film gets beyond the campus and into the desert of Zabriske Point in Death Valley then Antonioni starts to turn on his magic. There are some very hauntingly beautiful shots of the desert, and of couples strewn out in a dry river valley, and then an amazing finale with an apocalyptic image of the shreds of civilization.I was also pleasantly surprised to see that the dvd quality was very good with deep blacks and rich colours, and it appeared that the movie had been remastered since it was a very clean print. There are, however no special features except for a movie trailer."},{"rating":"2","title":"zabriskie point","review":"zabriskie point is a story of American corporate culture while also a love story of Daria and Mark two beautiful, free spirits who meet and connect with tragedy.

See how films can be but aren't. Before viewing this film I was only familiar with Rod Taylor (Who is, without a doubt, Robin Williams father.) and some other character actor whose name escapes me. Now, after viewing this film, I want to familiarize myself with everyone involved, from the director, Michelangelo Antonioni, to the two main actors, Daria Halprin and Mark Frechette, to the various music involved. This film, in a way, reminds me of Easy Rider, in its portrayal of true freedom within and the ones who truly ruin it.

People that took him and the film apart in 1970 -- and now -- seem to forget Antonioni was never a master of plot or performance, but texture and color. Z\\\\\\"Zabriskie Point\\" stands up better today then 1970, since the decades gives the viewer a distance. Yes, the leads are blanks and the dialogue weak, but it's an IMPRESSION of American youth in revolt. Not answers. People who claim it's \\"boring\\" are the actual boring people. There are so many fantastic and unique images that any film watcher should be able to appreciate Antonioni's vision. And imagine a big studio today giving 7 million dollars (at the time a chunk of change) to a minimalist film artist. Appreciate this folks, because now studios wouldn't dare finance this film.

If the phone does not say 900 mhz or 2.4 Ghz DIGITAL then it is analog. Retailer mix them all together and many associates don't even realize. I would recommend a 900 Mhz DIGITAL over 2.4 Ghz Analog. Another thing to notice is that many phone will say 2.4 Ghz with Digital Answering machine. This usually means that the answering machine is digital but the phone is not.

People complain the voice is weak on the receiving end. The conversation gets disrupted if the 2nd line rings while talking on the first line and vice-versa. This happens even with the ringer turned off. There is a static clicking sound every time the lighted handset lights. Tried two different brands of headsets and both distort with this phone. The line 1 and 2 indicator is dreadfully small and difficult to read. The complaints others have with the dialing tones can be attributed to the fact that you can pre-dial the numbers before accessing a phone line. When operated in this manner, you typically dial the number, pick a phone line and put the thing up to your ear. This is when the dialing tone volume becomes VERY apparent.

The ! shaped speaker hole is so awkwardly shaped that only at a certain angle and tightness against your face can you properly hear through it, and when you can the speaker will make your ears bleed at the lowest volume.

Also, the LCD display on the base unit and one handset stopped working after less than six months of use. I also agree that the buttons on the base unit are not very user friendly.

My biggest problem with this phone however which makes it unusable is that I keep hearing silences on my end - similar to what you hear when the other person gets a call waiting signal. The result is that I miss a lot of the conversation because when it happens it happens rather often. While I hear the silences the person on the other side hears a loud beep. Very annoying! I see that another caller spoke of this in their review and said that when they contacted Customer Service they were told that other Customers have complained about this, so there is obviously a fault in the design.

After about 3 - 6 months, the display on one of the handsets started to fade. Now it's totally gone. The display on the other handset is now 3/4 gone. We have also experienced the sporadic beeping while the phone is in use. We thought that this brand name would be one of the better ones. Boy were we wrong!

Otherwise, we'd try and get our money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"keep looking","review":"I have had the same problem everyone else has had with these phones display is fading and line problems.

Forewarned is fairwarned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"I wish that I had checked online first before I went to the store and got this phone.

However, it's only half a story - assume this is contrived in the hope of selling the other half at a later date. The author's reconstruction of dialogue is to be admired, as well as the descriptions of her life of poverty and deprivation. More to be admired is the character of her mother who managed to produce and provide for eleven children in an unmarried state, while coping with an irresponsible father.

Her recording of the piano music of Eugenie Rocherolle clearly demonstrates why Julie has earned such wide recognition as a concert performer as well as a composer/pianist. Eugenie Rocherolle is a prolific composer who has been very active in producing collections of teaching material. The pieces that make up this recorded collection are obviously from her more advanced repertoire, and are definitely to be considered classical. Rocherolle's composing style is varied and original. Most of these pieces are short, with some recalling Satie in their brevity and abstraction. There are bursts of Gershwin as well as hints of many other 20th century composers, but the music is very personal, and Julie Rivers brings it to life with her elegant playing style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tomato/Potato Slicing Helper Guide","review":"more trouble than its worth. easier just to slice them the way i always have. waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tomato Slicing Guide","review":"Tomatoes have to be small to fit the slicer.

Some are as old as 1926 (silent!) and as new as 2001 (should be silent!). The acting is laughable, the direction is pure horse shiat... and that's actually being rather nice to this sorry collection. Pirates kick ass, but even the asskickery of pirates can't save this compilation of crap from being anything other than... well, crap. I can wipe my ass with a piece of film and end up with something more deserving of the classification of a \\"movie\\" than this tripe.

He doesn't play with it very often though. He lost interest in it fairly quickly. It doesn't have too many small fragile parts on it that break as the orange snow plow does. I always like the looks of Bruder trucks, but they are not always very durable if they have small/removable parts. I do like this one though and hope my son takes more of an interest in it as he is now 5 and may be totally past liking this sort of toy now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Holiday Stories","review":"This book tells the story of three women over three holiday seasons. Each story is told in the first person. The first is Jane and she is debating over her career and choice in men. She also finds out that she has a a thyroid condition, which causes her to examine her life so far. The next story involves her sister, Ricki, who has moved down to North Carolina to be with her boyfriend-who is still married. This was my favorite character in the book. She realizes that the life she has there with her friends and business is better than the one with her SO! The third story revolves around Emma who is a friend of the sisters. She and her SO are trying to get pregnant. He goes out of town on Thanksgiving and her ex pops by and something happens. A few weeks later at a X-mas party, she does the pregnany test and its positive! I won't give up what happens, but this is a cute book that has a few sex moments and a good holiday message."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing, boring, no eggnog","review":"This book was, simply put, pretty bad. The characters were all wooden, predictable, and boring. The plot was lacking in interest, and the men, though uniformly \\"handsome\\", could have been replaced by a clever cardboard-cutout for all the personality they had. I bought it expecting something passable, but honestly, I'd rather clean my bathroom than read this again. Also, pseudo-rape happening to one of the characters but her not even recognizing that fact does not win any awards in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Christmas Gem","review":"A friend recommended this book knowing that I am a fan of Christmas books such as SKIPPING CHRISTMAS and SHEPHERDS ABIDING. I love these heartwarming stories (when they're not too religious) and EGGNOG CHRONICLES delivers on so many levels. I related to the three women in their individual stories, really felt for them, and loved the Christmas atmosphere and the sense of community in the beach town as well as New York City.If you enjoy reading a great holiday story about the bond between friends with a few laughs thrown in, this is the read your looking for!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING","review":"So much for this being a \\"Christmas\\" book. It was basically 3 short stories involving 2 sisters and a friend. What bugged me is that each story ended abruptly. Once they found happiness it was over by the next page.The story that I disliked the most was Emma's. What she did to her seemingly wonderful boyfriend was horrible. I couldn't believe how she justified her reasons why she did what she did with her slimeball ex boyfriend.Overall, it was an OK read but not much of a light, Christmasy story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Movie!!","review":"Im not quite sure why this movie took so long to be released but I was a really good movie.

Actually the MC100 was probably the best DV camera that Canon ever made, and it just so happens to be the one that is discontinued.

You just jam it down into soft soil and the soil stays in the cylinder allowing you to drop in the bulb. Then place the tool over the hole and squeeze the spring handle which releases the soil -- done! I usually have a problem gauging the hole depth so this helps. It's a bit pricey, but worth it for a lot of plantings.

Push it into the soil, use the markings on the side to determine depth, place the bulb in the hole and squeeze the handle together to open the bottom and release the dirt. It worked great when the soil was soft. However, I have clay soil. Pushing and twisting at the same time helped to get through the soil, until the metal side collapsed. I straightened the metal side several times, and tried to be gentle with it, but it collapsed over and over again.

In fact, it is rather helpful, especially for those students who are not used to the CPM style. The parent guide (which should be called a student guide) gives different examples of the main concepts and explains them in great detail. It then has a \\"more to try\\" section for each unit which gives the student a bank of similar problems to practice (such as a traditional textbook would).

Barbour's book not worth readingAlan G. Barbour is no friend to the Lyme patient. I suffer from chronic Lyme disease and was terribly disappointed and angered by this book. There was a pervasive, underlying thread which downplayed the number of Lyme cases, the severity of the disease, and the complexity of the disease. Barbour's disregard for the plight of Lyme patients is demonstrated in his inexcusable lack of treatment guidelines besides a cookbook reliance on a short term antibiotic therapy which has been clinically proven wrong for many patients. Many, many people are suffering with Lyme disease and cannot get proper treatment. If you buy this book, you will be, in my opinion, adding to this suffering. You will also be less informed when you have finished this book than before you began. Please don't add credibility to Barbour as a Lyme disease expert by buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this book! (I didn't want to even give it 1 star!)","review":"This book is typical of the kind of biased and unsupported reportage about Lyme disease that is responsible for so many Lyme disease patients NOT being properly diagnosed and treated.While rich in jargon, the book argues for definitions of Lyme disease that exclude so many patients with seronegative, intractable, antibiotic-resistant borreliosis. It is a disservice to Lyme disease patients everywhere and misleads naive doctors as well. There are many far better books on the market, and many websites that are far more informative.This book is a waste unless you can use it as a case study in the arrogance and close-mindedness of some doctors. I use my copy as a coaster for drippy coffee cups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Information is not helpful; controversy is not explained","review":"This book will only confuse you if you are looking for real answers to the Lyme disease controversy or help for an undiagnosed illness. Barbour does not give you enough information to make informed decisions regarding treatment or diagnosis of an actual entrenched and untreated case of Lyme disease. Your money will be better spent buying books by Denise Lang, Karen Forschner, or Polly Murray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon doesn't allow a negative rating, so I gave it 1 Star","review":"Alan Barbour did not cite a single reference in the book. It is entirely his opinion and the reason it was published was to hide the truely devastating epidemic of Lyme and related diseases. It is NOT based on his own scientific evidence.

Better books are Karen Vanderhoof-Forschner's Everything You Need to Know about Lyme Disease and Polly Murray's The Widening Circle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Condescending, arrogant and narrow-minded look at Lyme.","review":"Barbour cleverly reviews some of the literature, dismisses entirely or denigrates what doesn't support his hypotheses, and ignores clinical and patient experience to paint a very narrow view of what Lyme is and is not in his eyes. The insensitivity displayed towards patients is only driven home by his patronizing condescension. Patient overviews not only appear oversimple, but faked.Barbour doesn't seem to understand that his academic posturing may intimidate his colleagues into buying his ideas, but doesn't necessarily work when trying to sell his ideas to the thinking public.A book that leaves you snowed, slapped and spitting.

If you are looking for a book that provides good background and justification for steering clear of commercial pet food, this book does a good job, however, the recipes were VERY unpopular in my house, the food combinations included in the recipes caused both me as the cook and my Dog as the diner to physically gag a couple of times when I attempted to serve. The author of this book claims she and her dogs frequently dine on the same recipes......that is quite a scary thought to me, as these recipes tasted dreadful to both me and most importantly my dog.

It's probably okay if you have a smaller dog and have a lot of time to prepare a meal. It takes plenty of time and a lot of planning.I found it very pricey to prepare a meal for my pet. I started with the transition/cleansing diet, which is to be fed for 7 days. After 2 days, she took one sniff, gave me a disgusted look and walked away refusing to eat.

I am a big Carrack fan and these performances are well recorded.I do have one small complaint; I think the stage could have used more light. The video tends to feel a little \\"dark\\" in that spotlights are often used rather brighter stage lighting to highlight the whole band and stage. Still this is a small personal complaint.

Instead, it's just a typical generic guidebook that tells you same old thing, such as Louis Vuitton is the place to buy leather wallet. Well duh, I knew that!

These are the nuggets of information you continually write on the back of business cards and napkins to you can find them in the future. Ray has included these tidbits in an easy to find topical sections.I would recommend this to my peers. It is a quick read, easy review of what we learn in training.

However, my hair is tangly and dry all the time, including immediately after I get out of the shower. I would not recommend this product. It HURTS to brush my hair and I feel like the damage it is doing to my hair with how hard and dry it has become cannot be outweighed by the fact that it is natural. It does seem like my hair has more body, but I would take soft hair over dry-body any day.Just for info: I have fine, straight hair.

It might be better suited for other hair types."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"Please see my review for the matching shampoo-also fantastic!

The controls are straight forward, and the images, when displayed on my computer monitor (Dell 15\\" Flat Panel), reflect accurate color reproduction. The problem I currently have is that when using the 8MB internal memory, if I attempt to take a picture when the LCD readout indicates six images remaining, the camera locks up. The only way to get out of this mode is to open the battery bay door to power it down. (The power switch will not do anything at this point.) This problem does not occur when using a Compact Flash memory card.

The first one I bought had problems with the macro lens setting. It quit working! The second one had a bad LCD right out of the box (illegible bands across the screen). I noticed the demos in the stores had broken macro switches as well. This model is made in China. The 200, the next model up, is made in Taiwan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent entry level digital camera","review":"All I needed was a simple camera that could take resonable quality jpgs for newsletters and websites. Outdoor pictures are fairly good and indoor (flash) pictures are quite acceptable. The sensor is rated at ASA 200, so keep in mind that flash range is only about 12 feet.With a 32M flash card it holds 69 photos at high resolution. Downloads are easy,the digimax viewer/browser is excellent and all the included software seems to run well enough in Windows 98.The only flaw is that it is too easy to leave the lens in macro position when taking normal range photos. On the plus side, the macro pictures are excellent. With Nickel-Metal rechargeables and conservative use of the LCD screen, battery life is \\"not bad\\" for a digital camera. All things considered, a decent camera if your needs are modest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal picture quality at full resolution","review":"I bought this looking for a cheap camera to put up pictures on the web. 1.3MP (1280x960) should be more than enough for that. However, in 1.3MP mode, this camera takes awful blotchy photos. I suspect this camera's CCD actually uses far less than 1.3MP and interpolates up to that resolution, since the photos this camera takes don't lose any apparent detail when downsampled to 640x480. In fact, I keep mine set at 640x480 all the time, because that's the only way to get decent detail out of it. Bottom line--this is a toy camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price...","review":"I bought one of these for myself a while ago - and while Im sure this was a great camera 7 years ago - its just not up to par anymore - Ive also seen the image quality deteriorate in the last few years ive had it - this is in all lighting situations as time moves along the pixels just get bigger and more noticeable....

Even if you haven't watched \\"Days\\" and you enjoy the biographies of the stars, this one is a great afternoon read. It's written well, following the careers of both from their early beginnings, through Days, and after. You'll find Bill is a down to earth, giving, loving man.

Bill's background in the Golden Age of TV and Radio and on Broadway was skillfully told with a sense of awe and respect for the people who hired him. Susan's background in Hollywood plays, movies and television was revealed with a sense of understanding of the times and a well-honed sense of humor. The book was surprisingly candid, funny, and touchingly personal. Bill's and Susan's love for each other and for life is so apparent.

I'm not sure if it's in the menu system, but the menu system is difficult to figure out, and I'm usually pretty adept at those things.

It was not used much until recently when I found out that it is completely useless. Even when you are standing next to the phone, it often sounds like a mistuned AM radio. Forget about using it in another room. Pressing the channel button rarely improves call clarity. Though it looks like it is an ergonomic phone, when holding the earpiece straight against your ear, the mouthpiece ends up several inches off the side of your cheek. So you are unintellible to the caller on the other end. To compensate, you end up shouting or mashing the phone into your cheek to hear and speak at the same time.

PLUS 2 NEW CUTS from a new AHC release for 2004 which are both FIERCE! And one cut (I think it's \\"Don't Follow Fashion\\") appears in a newly edited/mixed form. All tracks are re-mastered and sound great. I think the bottom end is beefed up a bit, which is pretty much always a good thing.

The outside handles are extremely comfortable elastic and the weights, in my view, are not unduly wide (but I have average to large sized hands).I would, however, caution anyone planning on using these for kick boxing. The bean-bag style of these makes them very comfortable for this, but because the length is quite long, as you punch, they're going to shake a little. This will give you the feeling of some sort of a connection or oomph at the end of your punch, but you may find that you feel like you're waving a shaking instrument around or something.Still recommended for kick boxing, but just contemplate whether this is a sensation you're going to like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good purchase overall.","review":"I purchased the 4lb. pair of weights and they are bigger than they look in the pictures and descriptions. I agree with the other reviewers that this size and larger could be a problem for people with smaller hands. I, however, have come to like the larger size.

This is by far the worst cd Mustard Plug has put out. There funky vocals and \\"skankin\\" feel is just gone. This album is really leaning toward the pop-ska category instead of just plain ska. This is no Big Daddy Multitude or Evildoers Beware so don't get your hopes up, and no MP didn't sell out.Now for the highlights of the album. There are some decent tracks on here, \\"Not Enough\\", \\"Get It Goin On.\\" But this album is less than 30 MINUTES!!!!! That is ridiculous since Mustard Plug took three years to make this after Pray For Mojo. Another good part about this cd is that there is not a bad track, you can listen to it all the way through.I guess this album isn't that bad, but why did they change?

However, some of the features of it don't work (like Mac address filtering) because the software is horrible. Also, the device just stops working periodically, and you need to mess with the configuration for a while until it'll start working again.I've been updating the firmware and Windows software for the past week (bought it last week), and it seems like they put up a new version of the firmware every 2 days.

It took me hours to figure out how to set it up, and work around the bugs in the software and firmware. In the end, I ended up flashing the firmware with Linksys firmware (the firmware for their WAP11 device works on the DWL-900AP).The wireless network works now, but occasionally, a remote computer can't get through. Pinging the AP seems to remedy this. Other times (once every couple months), the unit stops working entirely. So I load up the configuration utility and play with the settings until it magically starts working again.Its inconsistent behavior is extremely frustrating, and I'm tempted to throw it away and buy a different AP, just to get rid of the hassle.

It has a very easy to use quick sandpaper change mechanism. All of the other sanders work as advertised and all require a little bit of fiddling to bend the sandpaper in a small arc to insert into the clamping mechanism. Now along comes the Bosch 1297DK and that small complaint disappears. It also has a slightly better dust collection system, though, no sander short of using a vacuum hose is really going to have great dust collection. I'm replacing my DeWalt quarter sheet sander with this one and am very happy with the upgrade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well new, but quickly falls apart","review":"I have had three of these sanders. When they are new out of the box, they work great. However after several hours of use the front gripper looses it strength and will not hold the sheets of sandpaper in place.This problem is acute with fine grit papers and I frequently have the front edge of the paper come loose and start flopping around less than a minute after inserting a new sheet. The front edge will come loose even if you're not sanding anything - just running the tools causes it to get loose and flop around.When this happened on my first sander I thought it might have been a manufacturing defect. However this has happened with all three of these that I have owned and it appears to be a design flaw.The rear gripper is great. It's too bad that the whole tool is rendered useless by a poorly designed front gripper.I suppose I could try stick on paper; but then what's the point of the 'SheetLoc??"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Lasted One Week....","review":"There is an obvious design flaw with this sander. The front sandpaper holding clamp does not apply even pressure across the clamp. One side holds the paper rock solid while the other side is somewhat weak. My machine lasted one week before the sandpaper started to come loose from the weak side. Once that happens then the paper flies off the front of the machine. I went to Lowes to check out their on display model and it too was designed the same. I wrote an e-mail to Bosch about the problem and never heard back from them.Otherwise, while it was working, I liked it. The ease of changing paper is the big plus for this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"It had a MAJOR design flaw: the rubber gets worded out after few usage","review":"in less than 1 year the tool is useless. the paper slips out. the rubber gets soft and breaks into pieces (melts actually, they used cheap materials on that or because of the vibration).I bought BOSCH because it looked nice and the locking mechanism seemed very easy. BUT in less than a year the holding rubber broke on both ends. and the paper slips out after few seconds.don't buy it or tested it out in you 30 day allowance. (90 at HD)..AND the filter doesn't stay locked in place also. it is frustrating to use this tool. - believe me - I like Bosch tool because but this is trash. looks cool but..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Let Down","review":"I bought this sander just over a year ago, and I'm very much regretting chosing this one over the Dewalt. Don't get me wrong, I love Bosch tools, but this sander has a major fatal flaw.After a few days, the rubber pad split apart on the first one that I got.So, I returned it for a replacement. The rubber pad on the front clamp of this one won't stay in place. The vibration of the tool causes it to slip and the sandpaper falls out. I can't sand for 20 seconds without the paper slipping. I'm severely disappointed in bosch. I had higher expectations of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look out wood here comes the Bosch sander!","review":"AFTER USING IT A WHILE, I would only give it three (3) Stars because the punching plate that punches holes in the sandpaper does not work well, it tears instead of punches clean holes... The Makita has a much better punch plate but it is noisier and does not have as nice a filter/dust bag...It looks small but it really sands wood and everything else with little noise and vibration. In short it's a joy to use and it even has a easy to use hold down system that makes changing sandpaper fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"easy to work with","review":"This is one of those tools that almost put a smile on your face when you use it, and makes the unpleasant job (sanding) tolerable. I am sure you can read the stats in different places, but from my standpoint, this is a great, great tool! It feels good in your hand, does not vibrate, so you can work as long as necessary without tiring out your hand, does not leave the marks on the wood (not even alongside the edges and corners), and best of all, uses great system to load and unload sand paper. As some reviewers suggested, it probably is the best finish sander on the market. To top it off, the dust collection canister performs well, definitely above my expectations, in case you don't hook it up to dust collector. All in all, one of those tools you are actually looking forward to work with. If I could, I would give it 6 stars. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor front gripper design","review":"I stuffed this sander in a drawer shortly after I bought it because the front gripper failed to hold the securely. The concept is wonderful but in practice, it makes the tool frustrating to use. The sand paper falls off after less than a minute of sanding. Either that or the rubber gripper on the front clamp comes off.Recently, I've started using it again. I spray the back of the sandpaper with 3M 77 adhesive before attaching it. Voila, it works. I like the sander but I cannot believe they are still selling this tool given the faulty design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clamping Bar Does Not Work","review":"Always though that bosh was a good brand of tools. I have many of them. (I am a professional cabinet maker), but this tool is for an armature who uses a sander a few days a month, who considers changing paper to be a problem. yes the paper goes in easily, but, unfortunately, it comes out just as easily. with this sander you will be spending more time adjusting the paper than sanding. Also as the paper moves under the clamping bar it gradually sands off the plastic that holes the paper in place. making the problem worse and worse. BTW the replacement clamping bar costs $5.06 plus shipping . Repairing it is not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"This sander WILL fail to hold paper with in 3 to 5 months with medium use. Mine was not defective it is flawed in design. The sheetlock system is only slightly faster and not worth the trouble of failure. The horrible thing is if you want to just keep replacing the assembly you cant. Bosch discontinued it along with the bottom pad assembly. The guys that reviewed this thing well have only had it a short while. All the bad reviews have used it for a few months. Go with another brand with the basic sheet holding design, its proven.-Mark"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor dust collection.","review":"A great little sander if you had a downdraft table. The dust collection did not pull anything through to the bag. I attached a shop vac using the adapter (sold seperately) and same difference. Sanded one small cabinet door and this beast threw dust all over the place. The sandpaper \\"punch\\" is a real piece of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Anyone Make a Decent 1/4 Sheet Sander?","review":"Throw me in with the crowd that had problems with the front grip failing. The little rubber piece on the front sand paper clamp comes off. This happened intermittently for a while, but I could always stretch it back on and for the most part, the sander was ok. Just a few minutes ago it failed for good. I put the grip back on, and it takes seconds to fly off again. When its not on, the sand paper isn't attached to the rotating plate and you have a useless piece of junk. I was in the middle of a project and got angry enough that I chucked it at the cement floor, and well...its in sander heaven now.This is my second 1/4 sheet sander in 2 years. My first was a Ryobi that failed on one of the gripper bars, but that was the cheapest sander in the store. This failure is especially disappointing coming from Bosch and being the most expensive sander of this type. Doesn't anyone make a good 1/4 sheet sander?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit after 12 hrs","review":"My sander stopped after 2 days, about 12 hrs of work. I sanded the paint off the plaster walls because some genius painted with latex over oil without the proper priming and the latex paint began to flake off. The sander worked well at first and it was very easy to change the sand paper. But then it just did not turn on after I replaced sand paper once again. This sander was made in Mexico. I read all Amazon reviews before choosing this sander and I have other Bosch power tools that seem to be reliable. I am very disappointed with the sander."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality product ?","review":"My bosch sander lasted me about 9 months before the motor burned out. I didn't use it every day mostly weekends and it often sat for weeks at a time. I bought the vacuum attachment and strictly used this sander attached to a vac to sand sanding sealer. The hole punch was poor at best, I think a pencil eraser is more pointed than the puinches on the plasic plate. The paper changing system is pretty convenient, or better than others I have used. I didn't save my receipt when I bought it a lowes and Bosch didn't make any effort to help me out with getting a new sander even though they admitted that the sander still should be under warrenty because of the serial numbers. I like most Bosch tools and will continue to purchase them if the fit my needs, but I woun't buy this sander again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent palm finishing sander","review":"The paper clamping system does work well as mentioned by other reviewers. It is the stand-out feature of this product. One aspect of the tool that I do not like is the rigid plastic filter cannister. It gets in the way when sanding recessed panels on doors and cabinets. This is not a problem with a Makita palm sander, where the bag is fabric with a flexible plastic interior frame. The dust bag on the Makita is also fairly short and angled up higher. The plastic dust cannister on this tool is attached with flexible plastic clips that do no engage the body of the sander very well and they seem like they would break off rather easily. The punch plate rips holes in the sandpaper rather than punching them, because plastic spikes of the punch plate are too flat. Noise and vibration are low, and dust collection seems to work ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the advertised-as-included vacuum adapter?","review":"I had great expectation for this sander but the included vacuum adapter was the RS007 for a 19mm hose, not the RS006 adapter for American sized hoses. The Bosch web site says the RS006 adapter is included but it's not in the package. The I'm not going to order the adapter (at extra cost), so it's going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Foreign Made and of Poor Quality","review":"This item, which was Made in Malaysia at the time I bought it, is of poor quality. The SheetLoc holder in the front has rubber which started coming off only after placing a few pieces of sandpaper into it. I had to manually push the rubber back into place before I could load more paper. Then, after an hour and a half of use on a piece of flat panel wood, the foot that you attach the sandpaper too started to crumble apart, which made it impossible to attach new paper to the unit since this was the base you placed the paper upon. It looks like I'd be better off manually sanding the wood then buying another poorly made sander from a foreign country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possibly the worst 1/4 sheet sander available","review":"Have other Bosch tools that I am satisfied with (bought for occasional use - for heavier use I buy better tools)Have used this sander just a little (after the old Dewalter gave up the ghost) and it is quite possibly the absolutely worst 1/4 sheet orbital sander available:The paper clips do not hold the paper in place resulting in one end or the other coming completely off by applying just modest amount of pressure while sanding.It vibrates so badly and rattles around if there is just a slight uneven build-up of gunk on the paperThe dust collector is almost impossible to get to stay onBuy something that works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the others but needs glue on rubber block","review":"Others have said what I would about the design improvements over other sanders but they should have glued the rubber block that tightens the sand paper. Easy fix though, just add some weatherstrip cement or liquid nails to the front rubber pad to keep it from slipping off the metal holder. My older De Walt is now second string. I hated having to play around with tightening the sandpaper each time on that sander.Amazon should sell the vac hose connector accessory but as of this date they do not, only 3rd party sellers here where s&h; is too much for the item. You need to buy the Bosch ,it is a special type connector.

A Buddhist monk and his apprentice live in a temple up in the mountains, and contemplate life and all of its meanings. This is the basic premise for a film which lasts for 2 hours. And it took 10 years to make. But this is no criticism. Plenty of Zen Buddhist philosophy abounds despite sparse dialogue. While the film has a very challenging duration to endure, people who do stick with it will learn something of this popular religion (which I for one find interesting), and will also be treated to a lot of simply beautiful, captivating and breath-taking Korean natural scenery. If you can't watch a film without action, or a dialogue-driven drama, then don't torture yourself. This is not for you. Everyone else however will find a damn good film with depth-aplenty. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"My family and I love this movie, which we have watched 3 or 4 times. It is amazing just to watch how lovely each shot of film is. The relationships among the 3 Buddhist monks living in a mountain hermitage, the basic issue of the movie, is very touching, and the spiritual development of the middle monk (in age) is moving.If what you want is shoot-'em up action, or meaning laid out on a platter for you, this movie is not for you. But if you enjoy sitting back and letting the story flow over you (and the story is indeed a stretch for the western mind), then this is for you. I can easily see why it has been named one of the top 10 movies of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Experience It","review":"I agree with one poster that this is one of the best movies ever made, period.

I not only use to clip her pacifiers to her but also to clip small toys to her. Its kind of strong. It holds small dolls to her cloths and pacifiers. I have 6 of them. Definitly a helpful product. No regrets"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great parenting resource!!","review":"I am a therapist and use this book in my practice with parents wanting help with their parenting skills. It is very hopeful, well thought out and user friendly. A must for every family library. The sooner you learn these skills and ideas, the better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern-day muckraking","review":"As a previous reviewer noted, _Fast Food Nation_ is in many ways similar to _The Jungle_ in tone, purpose and content. Schlosser, like Sinclair, seeks to point out the seedy-underbelly of the beef industry. Schlosser does one better, though, looking at not only the economics of the business and its toll on the working class, but also explores its larger implications on the nation's health and ecology.Writing about fast food from its infancy in the 1950's to its impact on the waist-lines of today, no punches are pulled. The marketing techniques, ecological costs and daily practices in the slaughterhouse are all exposed in graphic detail. Perhaps most disturbing, however, is how very little things have changed over the last 100 years.It is a quick read, in part because it is so fascinating. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A jaw-dropping account","review":"Fast Food Nation is a jarring experience. I wasn't quite prepared for the grotesque accounts of the slaughterhouses, yet what shocked me most is the power that these companies hold over American society. This book is a very thorough look at the Fast Food Industry from all angles and how it effects everyone. It is obvious that Mr. Schlosser put many years of research and heart into writing this book. If this book does not make you re-consider your own consumption habits, I would read it again. One of the best books I've read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspiring and unfounded","review":"Sure, this book might strike any reader as chockful of \\"facts\\" and background research--but when a journalist starts to draw wild paralells between fast food and the life-long disenchantment of America's workers, between fast food and the rate of high-school drop-outs, and holding the fast food chains responsible for all and any negative socio-economic developments in the US since World War II, I can only begin to wonder whether Schlosser is even familiar with the concept of \\"argument by scenario\\" (telling a story that links unrelated incidents and situations and then pointing to the story itself as proof that the various conditions are related).Having greatly anticipated reading Schlosser's work, it left me nothing but greatly disappointed. The basis for both his arguments and his conclusions are often so weak and far-fetched that I can do nothing but shake my head in disapproval."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast food nation review","review":"I was interested in reading Fast Food Nation because i was in the process of cutting back on fast food and wanted more motivation to do so. Then wonderful Mr. Fischer gave us this as a choice of literature to read. I picked it up and didn't stop reading it; I read the whole thing in 2 days. (Note to Fischer: notice the semicolon usage) The book was filled with interesting facts about the quality of meat we are being served in fast food nation. Its pretty disgusting. I would have given it 5 stars but i was expecting the book to be more about the actual fast food restaurants themselves and not so much about slaughterhouses. Still, a very interesting book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Food Nation","review":"I learned a lot about what is wrong with fast food. But I would still Eat it. Ididn't Know there was so much wrong with fast food. Even their natural ingredients are artificial. It was very informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jackie's take on Fast Food Nation","review":"The book was long, but direct and unnaturally convincing. It caused me to see fast food as another way of taking advantage of people and their ignorance. It has taught me that most companies do illegal and unethical things in order to benefit themselves. The book was filled with vivid detail and strongly written. I would recommend this book because it not only relates to the economy, but other areas in life as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Jungle of the 21st Century","review":"I am so happy to see someone taking a hard, critical look at American society today. Eric Schlosser writes in a very clear and organized way. He leaves out no details in order to give us the most honest and accurate picture. He explains the inner workings of marketing strategies and questionable motives that have spawned the fast food industry. In contrast, he moves on to citing statistics of work related accidents at slaughterhouses. I enjoyed the fact that the author took careful time to present to us each and every aspect and side of an industry that is so heavily woven into our culture. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone. But do your economics and politics homework first. At some parts, it can be quite confusing and dry if you don't understand. I will definately be reading this book over many times in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check your expectations before buying this book","review":"I purchased this book fully expecting to be convicted on my fast food habits and to be significantly turned off to ever eating it again after I finished reading. Instead, I found the book to be poorly organized and the information barely convincing. In fact,the most damning evidence was against all the suppliers of the fast food industry, the same companies who supply everyone from grocery stores to schools. In fact,he(Eric) even states several times that fast food restaurants obtain the best quality meat available, due to their massive buying volume and leverage.Further, the author himself said \\"Even 'Fast Food Nation' did not revolutionize my eating habits\\".(Organic Style,May/June 2003)I was disappointed in the book, but perhaps my expectations were too high based on all the rave reviews I heard since it came out.

Thanks, Eric Schlosser."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible eye opening experience","review":"Ok. I knew that fast food was horrible, and that the working condition sucked incredibly bad by hearing about if from other people.

I dont even know how I will be able to touch a fast food burger...a must read for all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Something for Everyone","review":"Eric Schlosser's Fast Food Nation may be light reading, but it stills covers the darkest of the dark about the All-American meal. Do you know what happens to the cow before it enters your mouth? Do you know what happens to the people? Maybe you don't really want to know. Maybe all you want to know is how fast food started; maybe you just want a little chuckle when you realize what fast food corporations are really about; maybe you want to know why your child is so into fast food. As for me, I appreciated being reminded of what the business world is really willing to do to make some money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be aware of what you eat ! ! !","review":"The book, Fast Food Nation, is very good for every fast food consumer to read. It exposes the truth and all that goes on inside the fast food industries. It shows you what unhealthy food really means. You have to read this book to believe it. Words can not describe how well formulated and outstanding this book is. So get out there, read this book, and have a clue what is inside your hamburger today. Then, you will be able to decide wheather to continue eating fast food or not. I strongly recommend this book because \\"knowledge is wisdom.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Empty Calories, Empty Heads","review":"It isn't that this book JUST reveals fast food for the gunk that it is--its the way fast food is used as a link to much about what is wrong with America. FFN goes to the heart of the nations need for greed. The interdependence between cash lust and schools, architecture, physical landscape, religion -- the very air that we breathe--is revealed as the crappy erector set that it is. Eric Schlosser reminds us to be diligent in protecting what we Americans have left."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be taught in every school","review":"Wow, what a monumental book! It will change WHERE you eat and WHAT you eat. I will never eat at another fast food joint every again, I can guarantee you that. If you love fast food than stay away from this book. It will make you see the definite dark side to the fast food industry. It should be read and taught in every American school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alarming and though provoking","review":"Most reader will be impressed with this book. It is well laid out and researched, with enough amozing facts and details to keep the reader interested. It makes you think about eating fast food long and hard, and many will give it up after reading this book, if only for a little while.I can't say if parts were biased against conservative republicans or not, but at times it did seem the author was attacking the right wing and praising the left for no reason whatsoever. It certainly did not help to make any point. Towards the end of the book, it began to feel more and more like I was only being shown a small part of the picture. Maybe its because I can't imagine all of the horrible things the author writes about with absolutely no redeeming factors, or maybe the author was deliberately trying to make a point, but it definitely feels as if the reader is not getting an entirely accurate picture.All in all, this book comes highly reccommended, just be careful."},{"rating":"2","title":"shocking!","review":"I knew the fast food industry was bad... but had nooo idea how bad! Schlosser does a wonderful job of depicting what really goes on behind the fast food counters and what the chains do to hide it from you. I will never again touch fast food thanks to this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"This book is one of the best book i have ever read. It will open your mind about all the things that happen in Fast Food restaurant. For all of the poeple that eat fast-food you better brace your self because after you read this book you are going to be vegeterian. You also are going to read about how employeesget treated and things they have to go through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be Manditory Reading","review":"Simply put - this is one of the most interesting and informative pieces of literature I've ever read or been able to read.

Make informed decisions for you and our children, find out what is really in the hamburgers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"This book was great! It changed the way I think about fast food, and I have found it has actually helped to change the way I eat. I no longer feel comfortable just grabbing something from McDonalds, because I now know what's in the food, and how they are manipulating the market. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in finding out more about the story behind the counter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocking and disturbing...","review":"This is a must read for anyone who is interested in knowing how our government abuses the people of this nation and other countries as well! An excellent read, and full of information that I found very shocking, heart wrenching and embarrassing. The lack of human decency and the greed that feeds it is a direct reflection of who we are and what we stand for. Unless you are willing to make a difference...don't be blind and let your faith lead you!\\"The current FDA feed rules are primarily concerned with efficiency and utility, not public health. They allow cattle to be fed pigs, pigs to be fed cattle, cattle to be fed poultry, and poultry to be fed cattle. The allow dogs and cats to be fed dogs and cats.

I live in Colorado Springs where many of the author's examples are drawn. His attention to detail is notable.Unfortuantely, the author uses his platform to attack and blame the Republican Party just about all of America's woes. If you can take his comments with a grain of salt, it is still worthy reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not eating out again","review":"\\"The Jungle\\" of our times will really open your eyes.

Whether or not you care about what you eat - it is so interesting. You will have a greater respect for so many people after reading this. I thought I knew what I would be reading when I bought this book but it is so much more. Eric Schlosser writes in an \\"every man\\" style that you will completely identify with. It's also shockingly in depth, supported by pages and pages of notes.I'm sure you will be surprised at how defined North Americans are by Fast Food. It's not just about the food - it's the people, the industry, the culture. It's almost ridiculous how its all connected!Go out and buy this now! It will amaze you! You will thank yourself for giving it a chance. Also, don't miss his next book Reefer Madness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading","review":"I liked this book better than I had expected to from previewing the reviews here, but did get a little weary of everything being blamed on Republicans. Also I had expected more emphasis on the health aspects of fast food. The book actually focused more on sociological, economic, and political influences of fast food. Heavy emphasis is given to certain geographical areas, especially Colorado and California. The book should make anyone give thought to the amount of fast food they eat. Other reviewers have expressed a belief that the book is biased and distorts the facts, and I wish someone would publish a book with the other side of the story. Overall I learned a lot and think the book is worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Credible work","review":"This was an interesting book that chronicled the evolution of fast food from businesses owned by hard-working entrepeneurs, to huge mult-national corporations. The best part of the book for me was that it offered solutions. The fast-food industry is extremely sensitive to public opinion. Want to see healthier menu options, higher quality meat, even safer working conditions in meat-packing plants? Put your money where your mouth is. As one of the biggest buyers of beef, chicken, and potatoes in the country, influencing the fast food industry can positively impact agri-business in this country."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll never eat fast food again...","review":"After just three chapters of this book, my New Year's resolution is to learn to cook so my husband doesn't have to do it all the time. We know fast food places advertise to our children, but it's more glaring in the black and white. I don't know that I will ever be able to set foot in a fast food place again. This is definitely a good book to read if you have any curiousity about the industry at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll think about a lot of things after reading this one","review":"I expected the book to be about the detrimental health effects of eating fast food, but that was just one of the topics. The book comprehensively covers the entire spectrum of the fast food industry, as well as food processing in a more general sense. While the author sometimes seems to over-simplify the issues by laying the blame at the feet of fast food executives motivated only by greed, his best point was that we consumers cannot continue to blindly trust the companies that put food in front of us, no matter how good the french fries taste. Of course the industry wants to make money -- that's not the problem. The problem is how we consumers encourage bad behavior by never questioning how they make the money. How many 99-cent items have to be on the menu before you question who's really losing out on the deal?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I had no idea...","review":"This is a very interesting book. It made me think twice about many of the places that supply food to our children. I found the first part of the book fascinating. Particularly the history of the fast food phenomenon in America. This book was very hard to put down. It took me longer to read than I would have liked, but I enjoyed every minute of it. The chapters on the meat packing companies as well as the information regarding the employees and how they are treated was especially enlightening. I have always wondered how fast food can be so ridiculously inexpensive. This books provides some if not all of the answers."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic book. Thought-provoking and well-documented","review":"This book is easy to read, and I highly recommend it to all people who eat out (anywhere, not just at \\"fast food\\" places). It was eye-opening for me, and I'm a lot pickier eater (for the better) now when I go out to restaurants. This isn't about just one issue, or a few issues, but an overall idea of what is going on at the other side of the counter. I was expecting a big book that told me simply that french fries were unhealthy but I was surprised to find out about a complicated behemoth that is there trying to get us to eat things we probably shouldn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get real Eric Schlosser!","review":"Being a health conscious individual, I was anxious to read this book. Unfortunately, the author reminds me of my 20 year-old ecology-major daughter who wants to save the world. Maybe I'm growing cynical in my older age, but I have a problem blaming all of America's woes on the fast food industry. Sure, this industry hires the young and uneducated (it was my first job 32 years ago)and doesn't pay health insurance but it offers beginning employment where there might be none. Schlosser goes on to expect the fast food industry to save the farmers, change the meat-packing industry and basically take responsibility for its entire supply chain. Give me a break. Go to business school Schlosser and you will see how ridiculous your suggestions are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Issue deserves a real analysis","review":"I can't claim to have finished this book. In truth, I read about the first 70 pages before putting it down in disgust. I'm a vegetarian and am concerned about the effect of fast food on our society. Unfortunately, Schlosser lost me around the time he began ranting about the problem with Colorado Springs being the fact that all the Republicans from California moved there, or the attack on the \\"free enterprise\\" values espoused in an area that owes its prosperity to military spending. What's the point of an investigation when you've obviously determined the conclusion ahead of the research? Useful material for angry students or the chattering classes' dinner parties, compromised dogma for those seeking a real analysis of the industry's effect on society. Anyone have any recommendations for those of us that prefer not to have our conclusions drawn for us?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The author's obvious bias adversely affects this book.","review":"What could have been an informative and interestiing book was largely spoiled because of the author's anti-Republican, anti-business, anti-capitalist bias. Not only does the writer make no attempt to hide this prejudice but he seems at times to wear it like a badge of honor!The author obviously wishes us to adopt his well footnoted views about the societal evils wrought by the meat packing and fast food industries as gospel, and while he provides many corraborative discourses to support his arguments he allows little or no rebuttal, or \\"equal time\\" as liberals love to say, to those institutions and persons he skewers.This would have been a far more powerful book had it been inclusive. The author's lack of objectivity and balance reduces what could have been a meaningful statement to mere propaganda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regurgitated information...","review":"I really do hate books written by journalist's. Most of them regurgitate someone elses words and this book is no different. I decided against my better judgement to buy this book based on two friends recommendations... and now they are going to pay me back for the hours i spent reading this book! The book is written in a logical flowing manner... but i found myself blanking out through huge sections of the book... \\"blah blah blah...

What I found, instead, was a wolf in sheep's clothing. In my opinion, Schlosser should have chosen one of two paths for this book: either provide a historical, sociological account of the fast food industry, or provide a long editorial, highlighting the fast food industry as a manifestation of the things he thinks are wrong with our society. Either path is fine, but he should have chosen one CLEARLY. Instead, he makes us think it's the former when really it's the latter. This is just a cleverly disguised liberal speech, lashing out against commercialism, the vicitimizing, opportunistic nature of our evil society, and the lurking, evil monster that is big-business. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sell out","review":"This was one of the best and most influential non-fiction books that I have read in the last 20 years. If you respect this book, DO NOT SEE THE GRADE B MOVIE!! I have no idea what he could have possibly been thinking. This needed to be a CBS White Paper or some 2007 equivalent of that.

Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad reviews?","review":"Just looked through many of these reviews and it appears that the only negative reviews of this book come from Republicans and Conservatives. It seems they were quite upset at the jabs Schlosser took at them in his book. Unfortunatly I have yet to read a negative review that provided any counter evidence to lead me to believe the Conservatives were not guilty of the accusations made by Schlosser in his book. His sources appear to be on target, his arguements seem to be sound - yea maybe he could of chewed out the Democrats as well (that would of been enjoyable too!) - but if you are going to give a negative review, heck, give me something, anything to go on other than the fact you vote republican and it hurt your feelings when you found out they could give two hoots about what you eat because they're getting paid out by big corporations."},{"rating":"1","title":"overcooked","review":"i purchased this book hoping for an interesting dissection of the world of fast food... essentially, i finished it because i bought it, not because i was captivated.. here's some advice when reading it...go to the last chapter. it is at this point that the true nature of the author emerges. otherwise, this was a total bore. file under: \\"could have been a nice leaflet\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Just buy it","review":"Not much to add that has not already been said.This is an eye opening very well done book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tell All!","review":"A truely shocking reality.

Even though I got a little bit bored starting from the middle of it, I think the author does a very good job on researching and investigating the fast food industry. All of the facts and information in this book give me a clear and detail picture of the hidden problems that exist in many of the fast food restaurants. However, my main dislike about this book is there are too many facts rather than the author's opinions. I believe the book would be more interesting if the author put more his feelings and thoughts in it. Although most of us know fast food is not good for us, there are some hidden aspects that we don't really know. Therefore, whether you like or dislike fast food, I think you should consider reading this book because fast food is directly related to our lives and it can affect our lives in both good and bad ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy-handed","review":"I went in expecting to read an insightful accountof how fast food has effected our nation and the world. What I got instead was a heavy handed argument against development. I can respect the opinion of the author, as it well founded, but he dismisses the possibility that eh could be wrong, even finding surprise in the fact that there are people who could be happy with suburban growth. I had to throw this book down every few minutes in disgust. Just wading through the biased and self-satisfied jargon to the end was enough to make me want a burger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice book","review":"I must say this is a nice book: well-written, persuasive, with astouding facts and a very interesting history of the development of the fast food industry in the US. But I must say that I don't agree with Eric Schlosser on all subjects. For example, I for myself would not blame the fast-food industry for being successful. Indeed, while reading, I had the feeling that Eric Schlosser criticized the whole capitalism system. I do not think that the government should interfere, on the contrary, I think that parents should educate their children to be critical and not to believe all the ads, and to have sound consuming habits, especially on food.But apart from that, the informations given by Schlosser on how the food is made and everything are truly relevant and it changes the way you look at fast food restaurants, and might change your food habits if you're kind of these types of restaurants, at least for a moment, until you forget or decide that you don't give a crap :p"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for all american","review":"Fast Food Nation opened my eyes to the abuses of an out of control industry that has replaced real food with cheap worthless dangerous food. Americans beware once you are hooked on salty, greasy, fatty and undeniably cheap food your health will falter and your families will suffer.

It is not just an updated \\"The Jungle,\\" filled with page after page of details (although there is certainly some stomach-churning stuff in there). What this book is is a balanced, wide-ranging social history of all the facets associated with the fast food industry: automobile culture, the advertising industry's turn to children as targets, teenage work, migrant labor, the obese-ing of America, etc. The complete picture that emerges is of entire country's lifestyle gone wrong. The complex of factors that leads us to eat too much, to eat the wrong things, to exploit slaughterhouse and fast-food workers, to turn our land into strip-malls, and to treat living animals as assembly-line commodities must be overturned. It will be a virtually impossible task, but the first step is being aware of the problems. This book will jump-start our awareness."},{"rating":"2","title":"fat farm","review":"Schlosser fights for the common man. In this book he tells of the true nature of the fast food industy. After reading, fast food will never taste the same again. Schlosser will startle you and make you think about the food once consumed in blissful ignorance. Whoever eats fast food of any amount, is in for a rude awakening upon reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Open Eye Is Better Than An Open Mouth","review":"After reading through this book, it really does (as the title of this review so wonderfully states) open one's eyes to the fast food industry's faults. Schlosser neatly lays down facts that make you think twice about scarfing that next quarter pounder. what if that next bite, for instance was just ground up, not beef, mind you, but rat excrement? is it really that appetizing then? is it really worth the couple bucks to get it faster if what you're eating is really the remains of some rodent who fell into the meat grinder? this is the argument Schlosser so neatly brings up. it's the argument that he brings us to open our eyes and close our mouths. not to sound cliche, but if the nation really did read this, we'd shape up. pun intended."},{"rating":"2","title":"should be required reading","review":"If everyone had to read this book our country would be in better shape.

Although I still occasionally eat fast food this book made me keep it to an absolute minimum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vegetarian anyone?","review":"While I was already on the road to banning meat from my lifestyle, this book was the cementing factor for me to keep it up. This book brought to light for me that corporate farming is not just abusive to animals but to the human workers as well AND also to the consumer since we are getting unhealthy and inferior and possibly dangerous products. I found it particularly interesting to note that the lowest quality meat went to the military, and to children's school cafeterias."},{"rating":"2","title":"great expose","review":"Do not read this book if you can't live without McDonalds. This book gets to the bottom, and mostly disgusting details of the fast food industry in this country. It is not for those with weak stomachs. For example: there is a section on the worst jobs in America (like those who clean up the slaughterhouses).If you read this book and still frequent McD's, Burger King, or any of the other places mentioned in it...I don't know whether to congratulate you or smack you upside the head.This book should be required reading for the entire nation.

This was am extremely detailed book that was benifical to the readers beucase it let us know what they (the fast food resturants) did not want us to know. This book expressed well the dirty, and un-clean way the fast food resturants are kept, as well as the food is cooked, and the dark side of the employment at these resturants. I would reccomend this book to ANYONE who eats's at fast food resturants as well as anyone who does not because I think that this is an informative book that should be read by EVERYONE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow food town","review":"This book is great, primarily because it was written by a reporter rather than a novelist. It gives the facts without the ususeless crap information, and covers all bases involving the fast food industry and how it came to be the corporate monster that it is now. This book has changed my life in the sense that I can barely stomach to buy even a drink at these disgusting establishments! Nice work Schlosser."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you eat fast food often, then read this book!","review":"Although a lot of this is known by many of us, this really details it better. I will probably still eat fast food, but it's gonna be a rarity for sure. I love the way the author says that what it comes down to is - there's s--- in the burgers. Not only that, but all the politics and people exploited by these corporations is insane. After a while you do feel the author had a sense of bias against Republicans, but the general information is sure very informative. Great book Eric! (much needed too)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed my life","review":"I highly recommend this readable book that is not too preachy but simply lays out the facts. The facts about the fast food industry and the societal changes it has brought upon us will amaze you. Ever wonder why we have so many fat kids and adults in America? Ever wonder why people get sick and even die after eating meat? Ever wonder how the food at every McDonalds can taste the same? Ever wonder why you see fast food clusters of 5-6 restaurants within five minutes of each other. There is a real cost to America's love affair with the hamburger. Taxpayers, consumers and the unfortunate souls who work in slaughterhouses pay the price. This book really scared me. I am trying to stop eating chicken and beef after reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best gift an American can give.","review":"There are many excellent reviews so far and a few negative ones that reveal a great deal about the negative reviewer, so I'll be brief ... This is one of the finest American 20th Century history books you'll find. Read it, pass it on, buy them as gifts, and put them into schools. The Goliath of Profit Without Ethics can be dealt a great blow by this little slingshot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, somebody had to do it...","review":"I love this book, and am overjoyed that Eric Schlosser took the time to write it. I have been a vegetarian for five years and this book now gives me another thing(or argument) to throw at people who tell me to eat a burger. I believe this book is extremely important to share with the youth of America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal","review":"After reading this book you will definitely think twice about buying meat. You will never go back to McDonalds for a Hamburger and you will start avoiding other fast food places. It will make you wonder about dark side in other meat industries. The book is definitely good reason to turn into vegetarian.It will also leave you wondering why our government does not improve the regulations for the food industry. They can recall hazardous toys and appliances but not infected meat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Despite all the hype, a big disappointment","review":"I originally purchased this book because of the interesting topic and the glowing reviews on amazon. Upon reading this book, I was extremely disappointed by the contents.I expected a higher level of reading - this book can be read by those of an eighth grade education; fifth grade even. It relies on too many anecedotes and information that's already passed around by animal rights activists, urban myths, and health conscious people.What's positive about this book is that it makes you actively conscious of the contents of processed foods - and that's always a plus. If you're going to buy it, wait until it comes out in paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast Food","review":"Fast Food Nation gives the reader an idea of how the fast food chain works. It gives life experiences of people that work in the fast food industry and how they were treated. It also gives facts of what's in the meat that we eat in restaurants. But overall it's an okay book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same book, different cover","review":"Since the description isn't clear, don't waste your money on this \\"limited edition\\" book if you already have the original. I was under the impression from the low price and (P.S.) after the title that this was an addition to the original or perhaps even the original with additional new material. Nope. Same book I already have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast Food Nation","review":"I found lots of the information very interesting. However, Mr Schlosser showed his lack of understanding concerning the American consumer. His claims of profit motive only ignore the realities of our American economic behavior. The American consumer DEMANDS, PRICE, PRICE, PRICE. Any firm wishing to be successfull, McDonalds or anyone else, has to cater to the American unwillingness to pay. The mass market in this country wants everything from gasoline to food for pennies, ignoring value. How can any firm pay living wages, when the buying public will run to the shop down the street to save a nickle? Our retail society only knows how to compete based on price. Lower retails demand lower costs, whether it be labor or ingrediants. The retail industry and its suppliers are only giving the American people what they demand. I think the blame wasn't spread around to all the right places in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to get lost","review":"If you like fact reading, you'll like this. I thought he was to discriptive and went on and on and on about nonsense. Some of the info was really good, but it was hard to stay focused and really take it all in. I found my mind wondering and thinking about other things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good info, but...","review":"I am a fairly intelligent person, but I found this book extremely hard to read. It seemed to have good, well researched information, but boring, boring, boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't amaze me","review":"although the book did have great details, it was so incredibly boring that it was difficult to read. some chapters held interest much more than others, but still there were a few parts that made you want to kill yourself. i did get into it after about 150 pages, but before that it was absolutely awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hard stretch for facts.","review":"Fast Food Nation, unlike the Big Mac at McDonalds is hard to swallow. Eric Schlosser tries to associate everything from armed robbery to political bombings, to the spread of a particular strain of Escherichia Coli with fast food companies. He did this with lame anecdotes and an over-abundance of fuzzy facts, all while trying to push his political agenda. Eric Schlosser tries to become the Upton Sinclair of the 21st century by demonizing the meat-packing companies. Although he might have some valid points about sanitary conditions and lack of inspectors, he negates those with over-the-top stories of meat-packing and fast food workers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leftist Propaganda Slop","review":"The first red flag went up when Schlosser mentioned the formation of the Hell's Angels motorcycle gang coinciding with the founding of McDonalds in San Bernadino, CA. The first real FACT (that was not ubiquitous common knowledge) appeared about page 119. Schlosser spends most of this book decrying the woeful state of affairs in capitalist America. Most of what he has to say has nothing whatever to do with the evils of fast food. Karl Marx would be proud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"I must admit, I was excited to read this book, thinking it would be something like 'Super Size Me.' However, as I progressed through the book, I became more and more disappointed. It starts off with details that I found, had nothing to do with fast food. As it continues, the fast food portion comes in bit by bit. The parts that tell about the slaughterhouses, and the ingredients in the food did interest me, but there was little of that. I also felt that the book was entirely one-sided. The points about minorities are true, but to me, it sounded as if the author was saying that only minorities and teenagers make up the fast food nation. Don't get me wrong, teenagers and minorities do make up the majority of the working population at fast food restaurants, but when it comes to customers, I think all races and ages make up the fast food nation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Schlosser is not an expert on agriculture","review":"Avoid this book at all costs and engage in reading sources written by experts in the field of agriculture."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's too much and not enough to this book...","review":"For anyone that is thinking about reading this book, because you are going to follow in the coat-tails of so many that have already, I say to you, if you do not want jargan and enough figures to make your head ache, then don't bother.While the book does repersent an O.K. study of the \\"fast food\\" industry, this book is probally not what the average reader thinks it is. It is filled with senseless numbers, statements, and terms that will make the average reader lose interest or pretend that they understand everything.This book is one of which many people won't finish, or will stuggle though to have that accomplishment. I say this, because this book is not leasure reading, and is even heavy with figures and data for a unprofessional journal.Whoever is out there looking for a book to read about the fast-food industry, and all the sick attributes that go along with it, look for another book or go work for one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well researched, non-alarmist","review":"If you care about what you eat and how our food supply is maintained in terms of the cost to workers, consumers, animals and the environment, this book is a must-read. The author has done his homework and his writing is superb. He tells you lots of things that you know vaguely but he puts a point on them for you.This is a great read for anyone, but it would be really great for high school kids. They have the energy to really care about things and they are on the cusp of making life choices that will affect their fellow citizens, the earth's health and the economy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unreal","review":"This book should be required reading for every high schooler in this country. It's about so much more than the fast food industry, specifically man's inhumanity to man on a staggering number of levels. A great read crammed with facts and research."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unorganized Rip-off","review":"This guy didn't bother to organize himself before he put pen to paper. The book is chaotic, filled with anecdotes instead of facts, and drips with the author's apparent communistism. A total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I still will not eat the fast food.","review":"I usually never eat the fast food, especially MacDonalds because it taste no good. This book expalins not only the process of the production but behind the fast food business scene, which makes this book interesting. Schlosser did lots of reserch to create the fast food business, which made MacDonalds the king of the fast food chain. And for example he explains the secrets of his success such as why the French fris tastes so good, etc.However he states only the bright side, and not the dark side. For me it is a little sharrow. I wish he had gone deeper.But after all this book does not convince me to eat at MacDonalds."},{"rating":"2","title":"anyone notice this?","review":"did anyone else notice that Arby's is not mentioned at all in this book? Does anyone find that suspicious? It's not even in the index..."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST MORE LIBERAL HOGWASH AND HALF-TRUTHS","review":"Well, this is an interesting book. But I must say...God Bless the Fast Food Industry! It represents all that is great with this country. If you don't like fast food maybe you should leave America or are a Communist. Even EUROPEANS love our American fast food, fancy French restaurants are going out of business because the French know a good thing when they see it and can't get enough Big Macs. Books like this are just wrong they say fast food is unhealthy and evil my brother eats nothing but fast food he's 39 and healthy as a horse. I think Schlosser must be jealous of fast food success and that's why he wrote this book. How sad.You can go ahead and click \\"Not Helpful\\" but by doing so you're admitting that I'm right and it scares you so much that you feel the need to censure me in some way. Go ahead, I am used to attacks by liberal nancy-boys.Final ratings - 1 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"McGo Away","review":"We listened to this book on tape during a long road trip. The author convinced us that we would be better off eating the actual book on tape, plastic wrapping and all, than we would be stopping at one of the disgusting joints mentioned in the book.If you like fast food and need to lose weight, don't waste your money on a trendy diet book... \\"Fast Food Nation\\" is all you need.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid warning!","review":"I agree with some of the reviewers that state that there is cause for concern. And there is no doubt in my mind that Schlosser is a very good writer-journalist-storyteller. He is. And for the most part this book is riveting reading. But he brow beats us with some parts of the tale, telling them over and over and over and over again, as though we didn't get it the first time. It's as if he doesn't realize that his plain, smart, direct, and often funny narrative style is a true gift, and in using it, he does not need to tell us things repetitively. And the constant berating of members of the Republican party is also unnecessary --- everybody knows that Republican apprently = the devil and Democrat apparently = angel ... though I would be hard pressed to find a major US corporation (on the scale of IBP or ConAgra) that does not donate both ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great journalism, poor economic analysis","review":"Eric Schlosser does a phenomenal job of recounting and reporting - he is at heart a journalist. However, once the book moves beyond straight reporting, and makes an attempt at economic analysis, that's where the book falls apart. Mr. Schlosser, unfortunately, is not a trained economist. The book provides wonderful anecdotes and brings to life conditions in the fast food industry. Unfortunately, the author doesn't know enough about economics to properly put his anecdotes and reporting into proper context."},{"rating":"2","title":"But I still love hamburgers","review":"An amazing tale of food, greed, and the treachery of modern corporate food retailers. The story of the slaughterhouse worker is terrifying, and the french fry story is fascinating (McDonald's fries still gets my vote, regardless of the huge markup).If you want to know how you are being manipulated into craving fatty, low quality food, this is your book. It's like the X Files of food, except this one has sources to back up the claims."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting","review":"After reading this book you will probably think twice before buying your next big mac.It allows one to know what lies beneath the fast food industry, the reasons of it' s immense growth these last decades, how it changed not only America's diet but also it's landscape, economy, workforce and culture. After all, as Schlosser writes: \\"A nation's diet can be more revealing than it's art or litterature.\\"My only regret would be that I would have liked to see more about the situation in other parts of the world. It might have open doors to interesting comparaisons and maybe help to understand even better what has happened in the United States.But over all I would recommend Schlosser's work to anyone interessted in the fast food issue or simply in the american culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"This book should be required reading for everyone! An intriguing exposé of the fast food industry in particular and corporate greed in general, Schlosser does not pull any punches, but states it as it is. If will leave you wondering exactly where that hamburger on your plate came from and what could happen to you if you eat it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Less of a polemic than I expected","review":"I was sure, when I picked up this book, that it would push me back toward those years in the 70s when we all seemed to think that vegetarianism was the logical answer just about everything that was wrong with the world. So I was surprised that Eric Schlosser wasn't really pushing that philosophy; he's not truly anti-hamburger, he's just in favor of healthy hamburger. Healthy for everyone: cowboys, consumers, corporations, and even the cows.One effect of those who read Fast Food Nation will probably be a severe lessening in how mindlessly they turn into McDonald's or Burger King when hunger hits on the Interstate. Instead, you just might find yourself looking for kosher and organic meats and packing your own lunches before heading off on a trip to Disneyland.A much-needed book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Eat Fast Food Ever Again!","review":"As a vegan, I read this book, and it confirmed my decision to not eat meat. I don't want to reward the large corporations that try to scam poor people out of money, provide deplorable living conditions for animals, create hazardous working conditions for their workers, don't provide them with benefits or recourse when they are injured, and try to scam the American citizen into thinking their products are safe to consume.I appreciate Mr. Schlosser's work on this book to open the readers' eyes to see that we should not continue to provide them their lavish lifestyles at the expense of others."},{"rating":"2","title":"This will make you become a vegetarian","review":"Perhaps the title of this review isn't entirely correct, but in most cases it should be, at least for a week or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Food Nation","review":"Oh that everyone would read this book and react in a way to make the changes needed! I am buying everything locally that is available now. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Those midnight runs","review":"In this book Eric Schlosser shares the details of the American fast food industry; the good, the bad, and the ugly. He talks not only about the horrid meat packing plants but also the rise of fast food in America. He exposes the fast food chain for what it really is. This makes you think twice about going on a midnight run to McDonalds."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little boring.... sometimes interesting.","review":"I picked this book up hoping that it would make me never want to eat fast food again. It did work...for awhile. I have to admit that the ease of fast food makes it hard to stay away completely.Parts of this book were very slow. Although the author at times went into painfully long detail about certain things (particularly the part about artifical flavorings), I took away a lot of knowledge about the fast food industry.I had no idea how companies like McDonalds and Pepsi are giving schools funding in exchange for advertising and selling their junky food to the students. Reading this made me sick!The book also goes into great detail about what goes on in meat packing plants. After reading this section, you'll think twice when you go to order that next hamburger.Overall, an interesting read. Unfortunately, a lot of it was slow, so for every compelling section, there was another one that would put me to sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"You have to read this book!","review":"This book has changed the way I look at food. I havent eaten fast food since I read it and will not ever again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review for my economics class","review":"I'm so glad that I read this book. Even though I can never enjoy fast food the same way, it was worth it. Schlosser is incredible. At times, the book was very slow, otherwise it was just disturbing to read. The way he presents the his evidence is so convincing-- especially the part about the dairy cows. I rete this book a 4 out of 5 because it was a slow read. Also, Schlosser digresses quite a bit, and sometimes it's hard to tie back his evidence to his original thesis. I feel that this book is very moving, and has the potential to turn the fast food industry up side down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing!","review":"A must read for everyone!!! I even offer this book as a choice in my nonfiction unit... 10th graders eat it up! I love the way he handles the topic and how he leaves the reader feeling hopeful about the future. READ IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative","review":"From the the original McDonalds brothers restaurant to how they push to keep the unions out their restaurants now, this book will tell you more about McDonalds than you ever thought there was to know. From how they came up with the process for making french fries to the dangerous slaughterhouses. While McDonalds is not the only corporation holding down and eliminating the 'little man' in the battle for the public's buck, it is certainly one of the worst offenders.Some of the figures are hard to slog through, but they paint a picture that too few people will see because most of America is busy handing over their hard-earned cash to the underpaid teenagers working the drive-through at their local fast food restaurant."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed my life","review":"After I read this book, my way of life in which I just ordered a hamburger without thinking about the consequences changed. This well-written, witty book really exceded my expectations. We learn about the slaughterhouses where workers are injured as their boses move the line of the dead cows faster to make more money. We meet hard working fast food workers who are obviously very poor. You learn about the dangers of Mad Cow as well as how McDonalds are ruining our landscape. This light read really has a very deep message that I responded well to and has changed my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could use some Secret Sauce","review":"Fast Food Nation is a very powerful read, but Schlosser's writing is very dry (could use some gravy or secret sauce). Lots of facts and figures, not enough anecdotes, or first hand interviews. Schlosser mentions lots of different food agencies, goverment agencies, unions representing workers and restaurants, and farmers, and then just gives the acronyms. Pretty soon you can't remember if the IPAs or the GMC or the ICP are on the same side or opposite sides, etc. I'm glad to say that I was not put off eating French Fries, but I probably will hold off the s**t burger in future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and interesting...","review":"...But too much of a manifesto. All together a fascinating and well researched read, but in parts becomes more of an examination of the American political system rather than the fast food industry. True, the two are linked, however the author indulges himself and at times uses his research to blast the Republican party. I would rather have read more about other elements of the fast food industry, such as the paper products and fresh produce. That said, though, I will never, ever fail to consider the 'big picture' when I sit down to eat. A must read for anyone interested in globalization issues, human nutrition, or the food service industry. I read it while on a trans-pacific trip and thus at the mercy of airport (fast) food, and rapidly lost my appetite, so I strongly recommned this book be read whilst you are at HOME."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ewww Fast Food","review":"Eric Schlosser's book Fast Food Nation is a book that everyone should read weather they eat fast food or not. Much of the talks about franchising, how hamburger meat and potatoes are producted, how fast food industries are anti-union and the science of food which I think everyone can learn from. The section about the science of food was especially interesting to me. Schlosser is a modern day muckraker much like the ones who found dirt on monopilized industries in the past and gives good evidence to back what what hes saying with his notes. Reading about the meat packing idustries was discusting but was the one of the most enjoyable parts of the book to me and I now think twice about going to fast food places. I gave this book four stars instead of five because the beging was too slow for me. I wanted to get into the discusting facts about fast food but feel like I had to wait a little too long time before Schlosser talked about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shockingly Refreshing","review":"There are tons of things that we tend to take for granted around us. Few should concern us as much as the details that surround the food we may be eating every day.Eric Schlosser did an incredible job of collecting tons of dirt on the fast food industry. This book takes its readers of a shocking and endlessly informative journey through a vast and often surprisingly strange world. Filled with historical references, privileged inside information, and endless statistics, Schlosser manages to satisfy the mind on many different levels.Written in true muckraking fashion: blunt, informative and critical.I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a book that informs and stimulates thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"jana from santa monica calif.","review":"i thought the book was very well researched and it showed me how much the fast food industry really influences our lives. It has many interesting parts, but some paragraphs get too long and a little boring. It doesn't go into exact detail when u want it to, like about the artificiall and natural flavor. It was a good book and overall very interesting and informative i would recommend it to everyone who is not scared of finding out what really goes on in our food industries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Informative","review":"I bought this book for an English 100 class I am currently taking. What I have read so far has been very informative and makes me realize the devastating consequences eating fast food can do to one's body. I recommend that all parents read this book to finicky eaters to get them on the right track. I pretty sure most will be disgusted to know that what flavors are being tasted are actually genetically modified in a lab."},{"rating":"1","title":"For mr. jimenez","review":"I liked this book.

It is very useful to understand the progression of what has become a huge catastrophe of unhealthy food!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye Opening","review":"This book has changed my life for the better. Before I used to eat fast food whenever because it was convenient, but after reading this book. I am now aware of the dangers of fast food.

I recommend this book to anyone that has ever eaten fast food before."},{"rating":"2","title":"thise is home work","review":"FastFoodNatiom.

Well I really don't know why he did it , because now I'm really not upto eating some re-frozen peace of meat. But it's always good to find out what where eating now a days.

I will never look at a hamburger, cow or fast food restaurant in the same way again. I don't know that I will become a vegetarian because of this novel but I may never eat hamburger again. Just the thought of it is enough to turn my stomach now!I am recommending this book to everyone I know - not because I want them to change they way they eat or read their lives but to provide them with a little \\"food for thought\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed the way I eat","review":"The book is incredibly well-researched and provides good insight into the origins of the fast-food industry and the resulting \\"fattening\\" of America.

This guy goes on and on ad nauseum about the golden arches and the way they are overtaking our society. Get over it! Capitalism allows freedom to eat or not to eat fattening french fries, the good news is that Americans have the CHOICE to indulge in such fare!

Come on, live a little!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST BOOK EVER COMPLETELY ONE SIDED","review":"I had to read fast food nation for my civics and economics class in high school I was scared to read this book because every one that had read it did not want to eat fast food afterwards. But I read it and disagreed with many things Mr. Schlosser said. He only pointed out the negative of fast food, in order to learn anything you must know both sides. it is impossible to determine what you believe if you only know one side.This book was also extremely boring to read, and made democrats like Bill Clinton seem like gods, which they are no where close to.I hated everything about this book. If you like fast food and don't want to read something redundant, monotonous, and boring, DON'T READ FAST FOOD NATION!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Socialist Propaganda","review":"This book is cleverly disguised as being about fast food. It's not about fast food. It's about how evil conservatives are and how capitalism is the cause of all that is bad in America.

Very one sided view of a business.

Not defending Mcdonalds in any way, this book is inaccurate in some of its accounts. I have been previously employed by the big M and the accounts in which Schlosser tells of are isolated incidents. What goes on other than that I am not wholly sure of. However, young girls don't work all day till their exhausted, as well as the other \\"select\\" stories Schlosser has in his book. I know that much of the book is true, but that does not make up for the 1% occurance of the information he portrays as normality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Even though I'm not a fast food fan and certainly see some interesting/helpful research presented here, I still think this book is a horrible collection of polemic. Most of the good in this book is already known intuitively by your average reader. And most of the bad, is, really bad. He has a political agenda and attempts to put the worst spin on everything, so much so that even things like efficiency and a desire to reduce margins of error is portrayed as insidious.The sum of Eric's argument: Fast food companies are efficient, successful, rich, hire low income workers, don't train them enough, and are not altruistic, and therefore evil. Probably not worth reading unless you think McDonalds is the forte of gourmet food and really healthy for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be classified as Fiction","review":"As a senior exec for a large (non-fast food) franchisor, I am well aware of abuses in the industry, and have little love lost for franchising. However, Schlosser's disregard for facts, poor business knowledge, and manipulation of statistics is alarming. How is it possible that a book under the guise of being \\"non-fiction\\" can get away with the miseducation of unsuspecting readers?Not out of concern for the fast food industry (don't like it personally), but out of a concern for mass-market misinformation on the scale of Hitler's propaganda machine do I feel I must warn potential readers to treat this book as an allegorical comment on society rather than a balanced account of an industry operating for profit rather than public good. Read Schlosser's notes in the back of the book very closely to understand that his comparative statistics are not always mathematically sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"grossly informative","review":"Though there was alot of info in this book that I already knew, there was also a good amount that was new. The most telling thing I can say about this book, is that I haven't touched meat since reading it shortly after it was published years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the money","review":"Interesting read. Nice history of fast food, I enjoyed the read. Mild review of slaughterhouses and how Macdonald changed things and how the government could not. Very sad indeed how america is run by corporations but then again if you didn't know that you're out of the loop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done -- much more than about fast food chains","review":"This book surprised me because it wasn't just about fast food chains. It went into great detail about the processing of food in general. And it wasn't just about meat; he presented important information on issues such as \\"natural\\" and artifical flavorings in all of the convenience foods we buy. Furthermore, he brought to my mind the constant advertising that is pushed on our nation's children. The book was well researched. I found a few parts to be a bit dry due to the detail, but I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening and informative","review":"It's not as though we are all going to become vegetarians, but this book really puts you to think twice about eating at fastfood places. Here in PR, almost every street block has one fastfood joint or another. We have them almost everywhere, from the beaches up to the highest mountaintops. Even though the books highly points out the facts that deal with health and the absence of healthy methods in the preparation of food, another important fact is the human factor in all the process. The data concerning the way immigrants are exploited in the slaughterhouses, the anti-union attitude of the powers that be, the subhuman working conditions for the employees, etc., should make everyone consider and reconsider before buying in these places. Again, it's not as if we are going to become vegetarians, but we should fully analize the data and do our best to try other alternatives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Text Enabled","review":"This sounds like an interesting read, but I won't buy any Kindle title which is not text-enabled.

While in \`The Jungle', Sinclair was discussing the merits of socialism amongst the poor and hungry in Chicago's meatpacking industry in the early 1900's, I am not exactly sure what Schlosser's overall message is. Perhaps I was distracted by thinking about all those times I have eaten at Burger King and McDonald's. I will certainly think twice before hitting the fast food place for a meal again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"This book would have been much better if Mr. Schlosser was not slanted one way; the left only. He failed to mention the legislation that the Democrats have passed to ruin FDA inspections. He should have reported both parties inequities or left them out. The book could have gone deeper into the improprieties of the fast food industry, instead of just scratching the surface. The book was a good read with out the political slant; It could have been excellent with leaving it out or including it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who's afraid?","review":"Every year, 280,000 Americans die as a direct result of being overweight. This figure includes children aged six to ten who die from heart attacks caused by obesity.

Do you believe in a democracy in which every citizen is equally entitled to health and dignity?More specifically, do you want to know how to make informed choices concerning your own health?If so, read Fast Food Nation.

It's not a 500 page rant on food safety, advertising, exploitation of food workers, or animal suffering.Rather, Schlosser's vivid writing covers all of these topics and more, in entertaining and informative sections that cover each topic in 20-30 pages. And he's convincing. I love chicken nuggets as much as anyone, but the fast food industry will have to continue their unseemly business without me-- it's now a rare day that I give into the fast food urge, and I suspect that other readers will enjoy this beneficial side-effect as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling reading","review":"I had already picked up Stupid White Men and enjoyed it immensely so I knew I was in for a treat. This book doesn't fail to satisfy, Schlosser's insights into the fast food industry are not for the faint-hearted to say the least. What makes it all the more gruesome is that he expands in great detail on subjects that we suspected were true but didn't want to believe, like for example the hygiene standards in these so called restaurants. The arguments he presents are at the heart of some of our major national problems: obesity and lack of corporate responsibility. Greed in every sense of the word! Read it, you'll be compelled too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A modern-day Jungle","review":"To say Schlosser was convincing is an understatement. He methodically proceeds from a history of the fast food industry to an expose of the meatpacking industry, an explanation of \\"flavorists,\\" discussion of the people who work in fast food restaurants and their effect on community, and finally a brief discussion of obesity.I found the book more or less fascinating and a very quick read. I tore through it in an evening, staying up hours later than planned. Schlosser is thorough in his research, clear and to the point, and an excellent story-teller.I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Investigative journalism at its best!","review":"Truly an outstanding book -- first-rate investigative journalism! Perhaps he very best in its genre -- extraordinarily insightful, articulate, and full of the emotion that the subject well deserves. Schlosser is the modern-day Upton Sinclair. Let's hope his book has a similar impact on American public policy.Schlosser helps us all to appreciate the current status of American capitalism and the fast-food culture that it has spawned. Schlosser provides a nice balance of statistical information, historical background, and a recounting of contemporary developments in the food industry over the previous century. For the general reader, there is much to be gained from the many anecdotal stories that help us understand the human dimension. For the activist, there is plenty of ammunition here to motivate the masses.

While a good indictment of the fast food industry, the book was more interested in the plight of the average fast food worker than it was in how the food actually gets processed. I was expecting more information on the processing tactics of the various companies and was extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast food is slow death","review":"Schlosser's expose of the fast food industry is an eye opener. But he shows only the tip of the iceberg. Weston Price, Denis Burkitt, and others, showed years ago that when people ate their traditional food, they were free of the degenerative ailments that are rampant in our society, such as cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, etc., etc. These pioneers also showed that, when people abandoned their traditional diets and ate our junk food, they came down with the same ailments that we suffer from. Sally Fallon, and Mary Enig explain this fully in their book, \\"Nourishing Traditions.\\" That being said, Schlosser's book is a welcome addition to the growing number of books helping people see the truth about junk food. Everybody should read it. Thousands of lives could be saved if they did. Fast food is slow death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Review","review":"Fast Food Nation by Eric Schlosser is a good book to read. It is an overall attack on the Fast Food industry. It is an excellent source of information that talks about what's inside the food and how it's made in fast food restaurants. After reading this book it may change the way Americans feel about fast food."},{"rating":"2","title":"well worth the time","review":"Fast Food Nation accomplished what many books I encountered did not: it was a fact-filled book that did not cause me to put it down and reluctantly turn on \\"Friends.\\" Schlosser, while biased, does an excellent job throught the entire book, providing infinite background on everything he explores: free enterprise, chemical flavoring, meat, Carl's Jr, and, of course, McDonald's. The information he so assuringly presents to the reader is disgusting--and oh so alluring, causing you to want to tell everyone you know about that Ocean Spray juice they are drinking as part of their \\"diet.\\" I highly reccomend this book to anyone who is yearning for knowledge and trying to improve their eating habits, because after this book is finished, fast food places strategically placed along busy intersections and highways will not seem so tempting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This isgreat","review":"it is one of the best books that i have read. i really loved the facts and statistics that this book was filled with. i think it is not possible to live without reading this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal","review":"One day I was trying to buy some books in the book store, then I saw Fast Food Nation this book. First, I was extremely interesting in the title of the book, because I do not really like any fast food in any fast food restaurant. Second, the style of the cover catches my attention. Then afetr I read the book, I realize that it talks about the dark side of the fast food that makes me feel even more unique and interested. Then as I was reading the book, I was surprised by the statistic numbers that contains in that book; Americans spent $110 billion on fast food in 2001. Also I am impress of how those smart people commence to make some great ideas of producing food in the fast speed for the busy people. And I feel how smart they are by using commercials to make more and more children and adults to buy fast food.

And unlike so much of the investigative journalism genre, it appears to give a balanced picture of the fast food industry. What a fantastic story: the beef plants in the U.S. are truly horrible, but market forces require that this horribleness not reach a magnitude sufficient to turn off customers. So it's not human health concerns that are winning out, but rather McDonald's buying power. Should we be at all surprised? Not really.A terrific book with many human stories and fascinating tidbits. Did you know that McDonalds was the third largest purchaser of chicken (in addition to being #1 in potatoes and beef)?Fast Food Nation is a very quick read. Well-informed, well-told, very well-researched. And the best part about the book is that while it has undoubtedly reduced my consumption of fast food, I feel relatively safe in giving in to my occassional yen for fries."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Eye Opener Full of Statistics","review":"This book has had such an amazing effect not only on me but on my family as well. Every time I came across something that was worthy of yelling out I did. I have eaten at fast food restaurants across the nation since i was a little toddler. It never came to my attention of the \\"god-awful\\" things that these business put into making the food that I love. The biblical quote, \\"the truth shall set you free\\" is the exact feeling that came to my as I finished the book. I have never read such a book that delved into so my different background stories. The fact that the author spent so my time alone researching for the book proves that he felt strongly about what he was trying to prove. The most important aspect in this book are the effects that the fast food tycoons have over the nations. And how many of the technology advances and businnes studies have their foundation in the fast food business.

Schlosser does a great job! All of my friends had read it and said I should as well. But I thought this book would be boring and dull.

It is informative and heartbreaking about the animals, the industry and the way we treat fellow human beings."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book, but not exactly what I thought","review":"I thought that this book was good, but it was totally different from what I expected. I thought that it would literally be about fast food; burgers, fries, etc. it was but it also talked about everything that encompasses those burgers and what goes into them (how the animals are killed and all of that good stuff.) I never really ate at fast food places to begin with, and after reading this book it gave me even more reason to continue to not eat there. It's unhealthy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enlightening","review":"FFN is the best book I've read in years, and I read at least a few books each month. I was deeply impressed by the writing style and the depth of the author's analysis. After reading it, I am in awe to learn that the author still eats meat. THAT disappoints me, because eating meat (any meat) supports the horrors (for both workers and animals) that the Mr. Schlosser so impressively details. Tolstoy said that vegetarianism is the taproot of humanitarianism, because we all have a choice to make, each time we sit down to eat--cruelty or compassion; mercy or misery. Schlosser details this choice, and then falls short himself. The book is still brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"Great read!

It investigates and illustrates every aspect involved with the fast food industry including it's history, marketing, production, sales, and the effect it's had on our economy, landscape, workforce, and peoples mental and physocal state. The domination of the fast food market is a vast and extremely relevant problem that is often over looked, but plagues all of us.

And go to In-n-Out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read!","review":"This book is a Must Read! It takes you into the slaughterhouses and makes you want to write your congressman about OSHA, USDA, FDA and so on. Eric Scholosser also made note of all his findings so that the reader knows he's just not attacking any one particlular political party or business. This book makes you want to have congress impose VERY strict standards on the food we consume. Can you believe, it is easier to recall a defective toy or tire than it is to recall meat? Something has got to change. Scholosser also talks about the administrations that fail to protect consumers by not implementing and providing funds to agencies that regulate and enforce standards upon slaughterhouses. It's shameful & Disgusting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing focus","review":"Perhaps I misinterpreted the review I read of this work. I was expecting Schlosser to examine fast food restaurants and use their business properties, health qualities, expansion patterns, etc. as a springboard to examine and explain the American psyche. This he did in the introduction and somewhat consistently in part I, although his histories of Carl's and McDonald's drifted a bit too long. But in the more lengthy part II the book went into the same old story of: American farmers and ranchers and blue-collar workers have lost their power, lost their independence, have been turned into efficiency machines by big business. And this is spreading like some terrible disease throughout the world.Schlosser's points are valid but they're not the reason I picked up the volume, so it became a bit of a skim-a-thon. Oh well."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is very good, i like it much.","review":"Ask most people who protest eating at McDonalds why and they will probably give you an answer like because they kill lots of cows.

Some parts are, but the rest of the book just goes on and on and on. Schlosser needed to do more editing on this book.The book had anti-business tones sprinkled throughout and the author believes that the Fast Food Industry is responsible for peoples health problems and obeseity. Whatever happened to personal responsibility? Whoever doesn't know that fast food is not very good for you is quite ignorant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like \\"The Jungle,\\" but not just a Gross-Out Expose'","review":"This book has been compared in other reviews to Upton Sinclair's turn of the last century work, \\"The Jungle,\\" but, like Sinclair's work, this one is more than just an attempt to expose the more sickening aspects of the fast food industry. The author does an excellent job of exposing the devastating socio-economic impacts of corporate farming. However, he doesn't sink to the level of political diatribe. He examines his subject through the eyes of people that the reader can identify with and care about. As an aside, being from Pueblo, Colorado, I was intrigued to discover that a large portion of this book centers on people in and around Colorado Springs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, although not entirely fast-food related","review":"This a very solid book related to a frequently referenced market. Extraordinarily thorough, the research lends insight to the practices that contribute to the final product that are rarely discussed (e.g., production, workforce, consumers). Well written with moving graphic images of some of the \\"consequences\\" of the Fast Food movement. At times, it does seem as thought there is an underlying axe to grind, and the purist business fan might get disinterested in the detail provided on the meat industry. After the first third of the book, the focus shifts behind the scenes, and the actual organizations move into the background, to the dismay of anyone interested in the fast food industry. All told, it does build on prior research, and is a pleasant read."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are what you eat, God help us all","review":"This book is more frightening than any work of non-fiction. It reveals the immense power over world economics and culture that the fast food corporations have wielded and the lengths to which they have gone in the name of profit. It's greatest strength is that it is not an unsubstantiated polemic nor is it the rant of a disgruntled iconoclast. It is a carefully documented treatise on the triumph of greed over reason, justice, and integrity. Read it and shudder, all ye who have eaten at McDonald's!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheesburger anyone?","review":"This book put so many things into perspective for me, and made me question more things fast food related, like how many illegal immigrants, or just immigrants, were hurt while making my big mac. Also, how many ranchers are not making enough money to support their families because meat companies are controlling the prices. These are the kind of questions presented and answered in this book. Fast Food Nation, The Jungle of our times, shows how food safety and food health issues are still current issues in this powerful cosmopolitan world of ours. I recommend this to any fast food consumer, not to make them quit eating fast food, unless you want to, but to become more aware of what goes on in the world, especially on the home front, wherever that may be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"This book was absolutely wonderful, it finally explained the whole workings behind the evils of McDonalds.

Readers go behind the scene of the hard but unskilled workers and learn about the unhealthy and gruesome conditions at the slaughter houses. This book will help you understand why it is so important to carefully choose what you eat. As good as that double-double may taste, you get what you paid for in the long run, as you read to uncover some of the tragic stories of people that have been victims of tainted food. As Schlosser states in Fast Food Nation, \\"the real price never appears on the menu\\" (9). To better educate yourself about what you're eating when you hear that voice say \\"may I take your order?\\" pick up this book! You will be surprised to learn how dangerous one meal can really be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing-too much one sided rhetoric","review":"It's all about selling books folks-in this case,Schlosser compiled as much \\"dirty laundry\\" as he could,\\" in order to line his own pockets.

This book is no exception. The author apparently is mathematically challenged when he riles about the markup costs on the one hand and then claims too low labor rates on the other. He might also look at MD's bottom line. Put those facts , together with the obvious fact that the fast food business is without doubt the most competitive industry we have, and hisclaims of gauging become laughably nonsensical. The only gauging I see around here is the price of his book. After reading his hysterical comments about the dangers of that McD hamburger, I would expect to see lines ten miles long of very ill customers waiting to lodge a lawsuit against Ronald McDonald. Well, guess what? They aren't any lines. Save your money and but a couple of hamburgers rather than this book.

At multiple points through the book I stopped and wondered, \\"Where's the story?\\" There was nothing there, unless you think it is big news that the REAL reason McDonald's puts playgrounds at their stores is to <gasp> sell more food! Or if you think it is wrong for fast food restaurants to hire young, unskilled workers because they can pay them less. Or that the ability for restaurants to provide tasty, inexpensive food is somehow moving America in the wrong direction.While the history of fast food presented in the book was fairly interesting, the commentary was bland and unconvincing. The author yearns for the time when workers hadn't a care in the world, and everybody lived well; in other words, this book is nothing more than nostalgia for the imaginary.

It's never fair or balanced.And here's the main problem; McDonalds is good - I'm not ashamed to say it. So I feel sorry for Mr. Schlosser because now he can't go into McDonalds without feeling like a hypocrite, and I bet he's dying for cheeseburger.Perhaps working conditions could be better, and animals could be treated more humanely. But for every teenager making 1,000 hamburgers for lunch for $6.25 and hour, there are 1,000 people who bought a good burger for $1.00. That's a good thing, isn't it?Sure, fast food is bad for you in large quantities. Brie Cheese is bad for you. Booze is bad for you.

I'm guessing here of course, since I haven't actually read the book, but if the author had their way we'd all be waiting in line for food to be served at a relaxed, unhurried pace. In this day and and age, this is simply not going to cut it, since many people depend on being able to get their food as soon as they order it, sometimes even directly through the window of their automobile. I'm not sure if the author is aware of this. Call me confused, but if you take that away from people, they'll probably revert back to bringing packed sandwiches from home, perhaps with a flask of their favourite beverage, since they won't have the time to buy their food from the long-winded commercial outlets. Don't blame the food - it's just trying to keep up with the general pace of life nowadays..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This author truly has an agenda.

I once traveled to Australia and was dismayed about the prevelance of American fast food chains. Looking for foreign culture is difficult when the closest restaurant to your apartment is a McDonald's.Fast Food Nation simply and eloquently presents the disgusting cultural homogenization that America has become subject to. Mr. Schlosser's graphic descriptions of the Meatpacking Industry are overshadowed only by the parasitic nature of Fast Food chains and their ever-expadanding empires.A testament to social awarness, Fast Food Nation is an eye-opening account of good intentions gone awry and a culture that is dumbly unaware of its own internal corruption."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Disturbing!","review":"This book is a chilling depiction of the fast food industry. It also discussed the history of how we got to have so many fast food restaurants.

Sadly the writing here is so sophomoric that I couldn't even manage to get through it. Trite and over-worked characters caught up in a silly,soap-opera-ish and gushingly romanticized plot coupled with cliche driven writing and limpid prose with illogical character development was enough for me to stop reading after page 25.If you like this genre,Gordon Merrick (The Lord Won't Mind) writes far better pot-boiler romantic melodrama than this and has the distinction of being the ground-breaker in this style way back in the 60s.Try his Peter and Charlie trilogy-infinitely superior to this silly novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great help","review":"Gordon McComb gives a fantastic explanation on the workings of speakers that will make one feel like a pro once finished reading the book.

Whereas, I will recommend to my friends that we watch my Warlock movie, Warlock: The Armageddon I intend to hide somewhere at the bottom of my DVD collection; I consider it an embarrassment to own.

Sadistic as ever, and with shorter hair, if you like seeing women getting all their hair ripped off then you should watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Middle of the road. That's it, and that's all!","review":"This movie is nothing more than an attempt to cash in on the first one's success. Julian Sands once again returns as Satan's son, but he seems to be sleepwalking this go-round. Two disposable teenage actors (Paula Marshall and Christopher Young), play two descendants of Druid warriors who are the ONLY people who can fight the Warlock and prevent him from releasing Satan into Earth. Oh, and there are six rune stones or something he has to possess to unlock Satan from the bowels of the Earth (etc.etc.). You get the idea.Anyway, this has some pretty decent effects, and some pioneering computer animations, but all in all, it's a very weak film, and, putting the special effects aside, there's not much left but incompetent acting and cheap thrills. If you like the Warlock films or love Julian Sands, buy this one, or if you're curious, buy it, but overall, you could skip it without really missing anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought I was buying","review":"Disappointing.

That was only a minor problem though.After 5 months of using the case, I took off the case to sell the psp. I kept my psp in perfect condition but after taking off the case, I noticed areas all over my psp were scratched up. The parts above and below the screen were scratched and the back was scratched up. I realized the case had scratched it up because this case is too tight over the psp and pushes against it.In the end, this case damaged the exterior of my psp more than if I hadn't used it at all.

The Muppet Movie is such a wonderful movie. Funny, smart, literate, warm...every reason to give it great packaging.This new edition, unfortunately not only doesn't contain significant new material (Kermit featurette unsatisfying), it robs us of stuff on the previous release!In the early DVD release, we got James Frawley's test footage. Also, we could choose to run the movie in French with captions in French. Although the words didn't match exactly, it was a great way to boost learning the language, particularly conversational French. In this edition, we have the spoken language only. I recognize that not a lot of people will be disappointed by this, but maybe some will.The lost material is not enough to keep me from buying The Muppet Movie, but it is enough to make me scan e-bay for the earlier, superior edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Muppet Movie","review":"The Muppet Movie - Kermit's 50th Anniversary EditionAfter looking for this movie in local store's and not finding it, all I had to do is go to your website and there it was!

Well anyway, 'Muppet Movie' is hilarious at times, very well-written, and Paul Williams' musical score ranks up there with 'The Sting' and 'Saturday Night Fever'. (How the HELL is this not available on CD?!!!!). The celeb cameos are spectacular (Rich Pryor, Dom DeLuise, Steve Martin, Milt Berle, Orson Welles, Mel Brooks, et al).

When hurricane Sandy hit us and we ran out of gas, I siphoned gas out of the small engines in our garage rather than wait in line for four hours. Kept us going for a few more days. I use it more frequently in winter than I do in the summer because it definitely helps cold starts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good info but too heavy on the pomp","review":"I read this as part of my Master's program and found it to be helpful overall. Vella explained many concepts that most might find difficult or intimidating through good examples of teaching. While I enjoyed her refreshing honesty at flubs and not-so-great experiences, I did not find her hearts and flowers emotionalism and pomp as exciting or stimulating.Her writing style varied greatly within examples from over-blown academic writing to the best of simplistic styling. But it became too much to handle and made for slow reading.Additionally, although I enjoyed the varied and multi-cultural feel of most of her examples, many in my class did not. They felt (wrongly, in my opinion) that those examples did not apply to them in any way because the examples were so far removed from the US."},{"rating":"2","title":"12 Principals of Adult Education that will Inspire You","review":"The 12 Principals of Adult Education set forth in this book will inspire any Adult Educator.

It is written with such a command of wisdom gleened from so many mystery schools that each page teaches as well as entertains.The author's character development works in the case of each individual as well as in the ecceltic group that they form as the story unfolds.This book has a smart ending that left me anxiously awaiting Ms. Gillentine's next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"The book interested me from the start because of the material it covers -- pyramids, Akashic Records, etc. The artwork on the front jacket is also a real eyecatcher, I have to admit. Beautiful!But as I started to read, I kept running into many poorly handled changes in the characters' points of view, the first being in chapter one where I wasn't sure if the POV was that of Alex or the dog. It turned out to be the dog. I tried to ignore these occurances and just let the story carry me on it's own merits, but it just didn't work. These mistakes kept jolting me back into reality or just plain confusing me. I'm afraid I have to give the book only one star because of lack of craftsmanship. The use of a sharp pencil during the final editing of the manuscript would have helped the book tremendously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Read you guys' reviews and buy this. Upon receiving this I am disappointed. It is not worthy 30 dollars(plus shipping). The cover is made of some kind of cheaper materials. And it is really small.

Although, the shipping was fast from the company, it took more than 3 weeks to arrive from UPS. The pillows were hard as a rock, smelled and so noisy that the 'crunching' of the pillow, was so bad, it woke me up from a dead sleep. I returned both pillows and found out Beans72, not only, charged me for shipping both ways, but also for having 'tested' the pillow within the alloted time given which was 30 days from arriving. I only received 1/2 of what I paid. In other words, I paid close to $60 for using a hard pillow that sounded like grape nuts and smelled like dog food. Think long and hard before purchasing this product and from this company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smaller than expected.","review":"While seller indicates that pillow is 13\\" by 20\\", this size applies to a completely unstuffed pillow. The pillow size that you receive with the buckwheat inside is 11&1/2\\" by 18\\". While this is a small pillow, it still suits the purpose and is of apparent good construction and packaged well. It is very hard initially (actually received a stiff neck from it!) but seems to be getting more comfortable (maybe it just takes acclimating to it).

The pilllow is much larger than the one I had, and it has a zipper allowing access to the buckwheat. They ship it with too much buckwheat.

Very cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise I love it!","review":"It is much firmer than any other pillow I've used, but it does shape to my head and neck.

I start on my back, sometimes switch to side but both ok. If you have back, neck or shoulder pain try this. I had already switched to left hand side mouse for computer but still had neck pain til I tried this. Only one week and big improvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, so far.","review":"Three nights into useing the buckwheat pillow and I can say my experience is good. It is different than using a standard pillow, much more firm (but then it would be), but that is what I like about it. I tend to wear out pillows quickly so thought I would give this style a try. I cannot smell any scent from the buckwheat hulls and I do not find them to be loud/noisy once you are settled on the pillow. The size is fine for me, I do not require a huge pillow - really how much space on the pillow do you need? Buckwheat pillows do not need to be folded or puffed to be used night after night, unlike a feather pillow which tends to need to be bunched after a while.So far I would recommend this pillow, it takes a few nights to get used to though. Once would not call it soft....but it is not a brick either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pillow.

I have had continuous neck pain and was looking for a solution as I am a side sleeper. What a disappointment! I ordered the Japanese size since the measurements were 14x20 and that was almost the same size as my current pillow. What they fail to mention is that it is measured from seam to seam, so the pillow dimenstions after being filled end up being barely 12x18. When I emailed the beans72, I was given the a very generic response with a lack of concern. Even more disappointing is that the costs in shipping for returns defeats the purpose of a return policy. It is almost as much as the pillow's cost after you factor in the shipping to receive the order and ship back. I am now stuck with a very small pillow that isn't going to be used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible chemical odor","review":"Very disappointing to order something that purports to be organic, and have it smell _strongly_ of toxic chemicals.

From the start the young vet has his work cut out for him, not only with the animals and the quirks of the Yorkshire country folk, but also with his volatile boss Siegfried, brilliantly played by Robert Hardy, and Siegfried's fun-loving and ever-mischievous younger brother Tristan.

After reading the description, I believed I was ordering a balanced, representative viewpoint from both the civilian and military side of historical aviation. However, what I received out of the 23 hours of advertised \\"non-stop flight action\\" was a pathetic one hour (not even that much) of a 1909 Wright Brothers Flyer, and the rest nearly all military-based.

I used a straight razor, cluelessly, 30 years ago, and am trying to teach myself how to use one correctly now. I tried this razor and gave up for months, until it occurred to me that I had nothing to lose by trying to sharpen it. The visible grinding marks on the edge should have been a clue; the problem was NOT me!I'm giving this product two stars because I got mine at a local beauty supply shop for $10. If I had known it was not really a finished product, that would have been a good deal, in context. If you have any idea how to sharpen something like this, $27.99 isn't bad.

But it has been shown there; hence the \\"Banned in Iran\\" brag on the cover is only partially true.Well, on the one hand, it does offer a look at something few Westerners could even imagine: what day-to-day life is like in an Iranian women's prison. Come on: how many of you could imagine what the inside of one looked like?Yet the film is stiff and boring. The direction is heavy-handed and inept, the story uninteresting, and the characters, only sketchily developed.

Now, here is how it works: 1/3 of the screen is lighter than the rest; after 15-20 minutes the picture goes totally white (but I still get sound at least). To get the picture back, I have to turn it off and let it \\"cool down\\" for 20-30 mins. Then I'll get the picture for another 15-20 minutes before it goes white again.I called their Tech Support and to have it repaired out of warranty would cost a flat rate of $130, and would only get another 90-day warranty on the repairs. For $130 I could buy a new one.

Full of golf lingo and references to past tournaments (you *do* remember the surprise ending of the Such-and-Such tournament in 1988, don't you?), it will leave new golfers scratching their heads wondering what's the point of most of the stories presented here. Other than that, the book is very poorly written and even more poorly edited, with far more than its share of misspelled words, run-on sentences and sentence fragments. Certainly there is a need for books on how to conduct business on the golf course, but there have to be better books than this one on the subject. My advice is to keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is worthwhile!","review":"The is a quick read and a must-have for developing business relationships.

The skirt is definitely not as long and full as the picture shows. We did fluff it up after shipping, stretched out the tulle, but still no where as shown on the picture. The size is VERY small. This won't fit my 3 year old at all. Sizing on the packaging would have been helpful if it was listed on the amazon listing. Probably would have helped me decide on what size to buy. It will fit my 2 year old. The arm holes are VERY small and tight. I don't know what 3 or 4 year old could have worn it. I had to take it to a person to cut the elastic and re-sew the arms just to fit my 2 year old. The workmanship is very poor also. The seams around the crotch area are all crooked. Definitely not top-notch product here. It's fine for dress-up around the house."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for Mekong River travelers","review":"Milton Osborn's account of the French explorers setting out from Viet Nam to explore the upper reaches of the Mekong River is both engrossing and sad. In the 19th Century, it appears, there was a mad scramble to explore every nook and cranny of the earth for commercial exploitation and for glory. The explorers in this book never achieved either but their story is well told by Osborn who has a detailed knowledge of the cultures of South East Asia as well as an understanding of the period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliance Cooked To Critical Mass","review":"This book stalks sure footed through the dense thicket of modern American literature, with The Novel and Nelson Algren firmly at its center. It is at once entirely personal and, sonehow, universal at the same time. What it has to say about about writing evokes the kindred spirit shared by all great writiers, vastlty differing though thier style and temperments might be. Each exquisitely realized chapter is peppered with excerpts of their prose in such a way that it fairly leaps off the page, providing a critical mass of context and vibrancy to the very difficult subject of what it is that writers do and do best.

The plot... disguised, English speaking, German commandos infiltrating American lines during the Battle of the Bulge had potential...but when reading this genre, I expect the author to get the history right. This book is filled with annoying errors of fact, WW2 militry organization, and the type of accurate period detail that made it impossilble to \\"travel in time\\" to the final days of 1944 when so much hung in balance. The book simply ends and fast forwards ten years, leaving the reader to wonder how some of the protagonnists managed to end up where they ended up .Jack Higgens in his early WW2 fiction, Fredrick Forsythe in his early work, and Gerald Seymour in all of his work \\"get it right\\" creating interesting believable characters and a gripping plot line with attention to detail.

Fast and entertaining with some hooks into German WWII mythology."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Tried Hard To Really Like This Book... But To No Avail!","review":"The WWII thriller is my favorite genre and the plot of The Second Objective seemed like it would be right up my alley; i.e., a special group of twenty German commandos who face almost certain death to achieve a \\"second objective\\" during a last ditch effort to defeat the western allies in late 1944. However, Mark Frost's unbelievable, one-dimensional main characters, coupled with the unrealistic, flawless American-style English dialogue they speak and their ability to have at their fingertips minute details of specific aspects of American life, took away the pleasure I was hoping to get from reading this book. Further, while the book has its share of murders, Frost describes them in a pretty actionless and unexciting manner. Obviously, I was highly disappointed in The Second Objective and do not recommend it to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not great, but good enough!","review":"The book on CD of Mark Frost's latest novel \\"The Second Objective\\" is very well done. The reader is quite competent, and does a good job with the various characters. Of course, the cd version can only be as good or bad as the book on which it is based. I was a BIG fan of Frost's two previous novels, which featured Arthur Conan Doyle in \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" pastiches. They were a great mixture of adventure, mystery, and the occult. I was a litle disappointed that for this book Frost decided to go to World War 2 and Otto Skorzeny's plans to assassinate Gen. Eisenhower. The field has been done MANY times. That being said, Frost does a very good job, creating a well paced adventure with some very good characters. Plus, any book that has Otto Skorzeny--even as a supporting character--is OK with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done","review":"A fast paced historical piece set in Europe after the Normandy invasion.

After the show I listend to his disc on the way home and was a little bummed to find that he has a band. It was all acoustic when I saw him and I have to say that his disc doesn't do him justice. He was even better live. But, anyways, his songwriting is fantastic. Great melodies and fun, sing-along lyrics. I'd give this disc 4.5 really but now that I've compared the live performance to his cd I have to say that he's capable of even more. But Im a fan now and I'll continue to follow his musical endeavors.

I understand Sondre was like 15 or 16 when he recorded this CD. Remarkable! No one that young has any business making such brilliant music. Romantic, catchy, poppy, and simple- yet sophisticated. I don't like- and I don't think it's fair- to categorize music, but Sondre seems to be a mix of Badly Drawn Boy, Burt Bacharach, Tahiti 80 and a touch of Weezer. Gorgeous pop music! I won't go through all the songs, but there's really not a weak track on the CD. Buy this CD, tell your friends and neighbors!

Fish products played an especially important part of soup recipes, such as miso soup. The alteration of traditional macrobiotic recipes in this cookbook to excise fish means that the authentic macrobiotic diet is actually not being represented here, and the fact that this cookbook does not discuss that omission makes it even more out of balance with mainstream macrobiotic thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Macrobiotic diet simplified","review":"I purchased this book for a friend living with ovarian cancer because I am convinced that following a macrobiotic diet since my ovarian cancer experience12 years ago has been an important component of remaining in remission and because I find books by Aveline Kushi and Wendy Esko easy to \\"digest.\\" The principles and philosophy of macrobiotics, including eating locally grown, organic foods in harmony with their season, is explained well and clearly in this book and there are hundreds of simple, easy to follow recipes for anyone who is inspired to explore a macrobiotic diet for healing and health.Dawn Nelson, authorMaking Friends With Cancer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Changing seasons","review":"Didn't really like..Nutrition factors should have been noted at the bottom.Also with macrobiotic cooking you spend alot of time cooking.

It's small enough (about 6 inches tall) that she can hold it or cuddle with it, soft enough that it feels warm and cuddly, and has a very friendly look.

I cannot believe this woman wasted her time writing a book about her obviously spoiled daughter. There was no excuse for this girl's behavior, and maybe if her mother had set standards when she was twelve or thirteen, rather than wallowing in her own self - pity, none of this would have ever happened.Living in a slummy neighborhood surrounded by poverty and crime, it disgusts me to see such a privilaged girl living in Marin County, the wealthiest county in the United States, thinking she was so persecuted, when in fact she lives better than most children in the United States.

A mother stands up and tries to do what is right-takes action and does something.It is very annoying to read how this mother excuses her own (and her daughters behavior) without EVER learning a thing. Whatever Morgan does, mom grounds her, sends her packing to another relative-does everything but mothers this girl.

He hires a nurse who was previously cleared of murdering her own husband to take care of her.The acting is pretty bad for a \\"mainstream\\" movie, making it seem like an excuse for the excessive nudity and R-rated sex scenes, but the plot thickens and it's interesting to see if the wife's suspicions will bear out, and who is really trying to kill her.

I agree with the other negative reviews - it's extremely basic, and assumes the man is not wholeheartedly committed and that the couple is just rushing into this uninformed and fly-by-night.

I found it to be very poorly done and actually scared me about moving in with my mate. A much better book I would like to recommend is _Unmarried to eachother_ by Solot and Miller also offered here at Amazon. It is a good resource which discusses all kinds of reasons that people decide not to get married and includes all kinds of different relationships. It discusses financial and legal issues.

The soundtrack is the best I've ever heard for ANY movie. I especially love how throughout the movie Joe West/Eddie Wilson acts as a tutor of sorts for a speed-metal playing, self-flattering guitarist. He bestows gems of wisdom like \\"Music's gotta live; it's gotta breathe.\\" A true modern-day classic movie. If Amazon can help get this movie on DVD it would be great.

Anyone who liked the first movie will love this video. The songs are great. It's a musicians movie. I say this because it is the real theme of the whole movie. There are alot of inside things that Eddie says that will appeal greatly to musicians. I am hoping for a DVD. My video is a \\"Long Play\\" speed video.

I mean I was grossed out at the fact that the madman was putting everyone in heck with slaughtering them, but that's about it.Nothing in the movie was scary, really. The only reason I gave this movie a 2 was because it could pass as another genre, but it was supposed to horror. It could have been an action movie but they made it sound like a horror movie.The special effects were good but the acting slowed it down.

Especially the ending with the desert road and synthersizer music. The same kind of magic is present in \\"The Hitcher\\".A young man is almost falling asleep on the road, early in the morning. He stops to take up a hitchhiker. From there on event follow upon event with nightmarish logic. Literally. (Maybe it all is a nightmare?) Great acting by the main characters. Actually very good acting throughout the film. And Hauer is cold as ice as the hitcher/madman.The fine synthetic music and beautiful nature pictures sets the mood. Add some action, and good dialogue scenes. This horror/action/thriller is not for all tastes, but it is very well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Story has more than meets the eye...","review":"A few quick remarks: this is not a horror movie, this is not a remake or tribute to Spielberg's \\"Duel\\" and this movie works precisely because it does not fall neatly into such categories.The movie's screenplay was said by it's author to have been inspired by the Doors/Jim Morrison's song, \\"Riders on the Storm\\". One recurring element throughout Morrison's poetry is images of the desert. Another recurring element in Morrison's poetry is the significance of myth in human life.So considering the above, the success of the movie is due to the \\"mythical\\" qualities of the screenplay's story and characters combined with superior acting, an excellent and complimentary soundtrack by Mark Isham and vivid and well crafted on location photography.As for the meaning and philosophical/mythical metaphors of the film, you'll have to e-mail me. An above average, interesting and unsettling film, if you don't see the quality here, I'd say you just don't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gripping...yet really, really long","review":"Hitcher takes a great story and turns it into an unbelievable, frustrating mess. Murphy's Law is definitely the premise of this movie. It becomes so frustrating watching everything go wrong. The problem with the movie is one that is just so unbelievable. I have this problem with a lot of movies but this one just takes it so far that it totally ruins it for me. The killer manages to be everywhere with little explanation of how he got there. Not only that, but he seems to be able to move and kill silently without anyone noticing until an opportune moment when he suddenly appears. The only good thing about this movie is Rutger Hauer who plays his part perfectly. And it is occasionally suspenseful when you're not too busy laughing at it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull movie","review":"This movie was not at all as I had expected. It was supposed to be scary but I found that I was not at all scared. I mean I was grossed out at the fact that the madman was putting everyone in heck with slaughtering them, but that's about it.Nothing in the movie was scary, really. The only reason I gave this movie a 2 was because it could pass as another genre, but it was supposed to horror. It could have been an action movie but they made it sound like a horror movie.The special effects were good but the acting slowed it down...... You might enjoy it a bit, but it is slow and not worth the wait.Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"PURE TERROR","review":"This movie has a single-minded purpose: to scare the living daylights out of you. And on its own terms, it does -- and mightily so. Rutger Hauer possesses that mix of seductiveness and pure evil of the devil himself, and the mounting terror has you turning white. There are artistic choices here; the lonely open roads that instantly entertain thoughts of hitch-hikers become the backdrop of this weirdly claustrophic story, weirdly so because there is so much distance traveled, yet you feel you, like the Howell, cannot escape. The ending is viciously cruel, and yet seems in line with the film's obscenely effective premise. An excellent Halloween weekend treat for those who love to bite their nails, and have no problems sleeping in the dark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly intense scenes; Rutger is superb! two thumbs up!","review":"The movie builds to peak frenzy, as you discover the truth about the hitcher's activities. It shows how a nobody can get caught up in someone else's life and death stuggles, with no alternative but to take the matters into his own hands. A great psychological thriller!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THRILLING!","review":"I bought this movie years ago. It is one of the best thrillers, period. Not just from the 80s. You may have noticed a lot of the 'scary movies' today suck. This one does not fit into that category. Frightening in parts. I will never forget the Finger!! That's all I will say, though. I DO NOT want to spoil the movie, though I don't think I could. It's so creepy you will be absorbed by the film and won't be thinking of any \\"spoilers' you may have read. ENJOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What is going on between those two?","review":"One of the most underrated suspense movies of all time, Hauer and Howell deliver the performances of their careers (with Howell that's not saying much). It was criticized by some for not explaining the relationship (if any) between Hauer and Howell, as if all filmgoers need to be spoonfed. All in all, a great screenplay, well edited, decent cinematography. Best scene: Hauer and Howell face to face in the cafe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Criminally terrible DVD quality(The movie is great)","review":"It's a shame this movie has never gotten a decent DVD release, much less a blu-ray like that god-awful remake. The movie is great, but until justice is done and it's given a proper restoration you should stay away from this DVD like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is nothing wrong with your television set....","review":"The two-star review is for the transfer. While the movie itself is pretty good, the transfer for this DVD is awful. It looks like they burned copies from an old VHS tape (that happened to be in widescreen) and turned around and sold it to the public for consumption. Sorry I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop watching after 20 minutes","review":"The first 20 or 30 minutes of The Hitcher are really well done and genuinely frightening. After that it breaks down into a film of strung-together, ludicrous plot devices and nothing more. The film does nothing but turn your stomach for the remainder. Many people enjoy it, but I'd see it first before purchasing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Anyone Who Rates This Movie With More Than 2 Stars: Huh?","review":"I want to know what movie they were watching, beacuse this is not that great a film. Some suspense, a lot of bad acting, and way too many scenes when you say out loud \\"OH, come on\\", like falling out of a moving car at 60 MPH and then getting up without a scratch. This movie, it's just OKAY. RENT IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Logic takes a back seat ...","review":"I bought this on a whim, having heard good things about it.It starts off well with Rutger Hauer suitably understated and menacing. However, by the first half hour the movie gets lost in la-la land with \\"The Hitcher\\" apparently having the killing and survival power of Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator.On top of the body count he racks up while hitching on the freeway, he also manages to take out a bunch of cops at a backwater police station (all killed apparently in total silence while our hero is taking a nap in one of the cells).At this point, it took all of my energy not to switch the movie off in disgust. It's too ridiculous to be thrilling. This sort of thing has been done so much better in numerous other films. Steven Spielberg's Duel being one example. Even Breakdown with Kurt Russell was more convincing than this.Despite the occasional effective moment, my advice would be to give this one a big miss ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heres a movie that you scare the day lights out of you","review":"Everytime i watched this classic it scares and i cant sleep for days.

I can tolerate DVD releases that skimp on extras like behind the scenes documentaries and director commentary, but I do demand good picture quality. This DVD fails to deliver. It doesn't look too bad when the scenes occur in daylight, but when you reach the point in the story where darkness falls and the scenes were shot at night, the extremely low quality of the film print and digital transfer come shining through. I haven't seen this much grain and artifacting since... well, ever. It's even worse than the \\"gray market\\" DVD of the Twin Peaks pilot episode. Buy if you must, but as for me I wish I'd held out for a better edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"The original!!!!!","review":"One of the best from the 80's.Rutger Hauer is great as the psycho.Screw the remake,go out & rent/buy the original,trust me,u will love it.o.k. laters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good B movie","review":"Rutger Hauer dominates this classy thriller, with a performance that matches his role in Bladerunner. Every twitch he makes is scary and from the start of the film you are left in no doubt that this guy is seriously deranged. Occasionally some of the other actors wern't quite up to the same standard, but in general this is a well acted film.Forget about plot and any sense that this could really happen. Think more of Halloween and translate Michael Myers as the Hitcher and you'll be closer. Its well photographed with some images that have almost become iconic.What surprised me about this film was the way characters that you might normally expect to survive (in a Hollywood film) did not in The Hitcher. So credit where credit is due, not only is this a short and punchy thriller, but it does the unexpected on more than one occasion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rutger scares like no one else","review":"I absolutely love Rutger Hauer. He can be so scary and this movie is perfectly acted by him. You won't be disappointed. It will keep you on the edge of your seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"in my top 10","review":"I love this movie. It falls into one of my top favorites. Very suspenseful. I'm not going to rehash plot, you can read it from others. There is no other than Rutger Hauer to play the roll so CREEPY. He truly does a wonderful job. C Thomas Howell does too. There is a part where the sheriff says \\"I don't know what the connection is between you two?\\" And you don't till the end. The ending for me always has me questioning is John Ryder (Hauer) Just a man or a little supernatural?? My only complaint is quality of DVD could be a little better. Choose this over remake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly an original","review":"There was no need to make a remake. This movie is compelling, thrilling, chilling and will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat.I remember the first time I saw it at the age of 21--My chest was tight, my heart was pounding, and I never picked up a hitchhiker again.You must add this to your collection of thrillers.Good cast, and convincing acting.This is truly an original!Stephen John BecciaAuthor of The Treelanders"},{"rating":"2","title":"South Texas Romance at its best!","review":"In Blue Plate Special, Cheri Jetton has blended a mix of down home truckstop wisdom, true southern values, and cattle ranching family wholesomeness into a compelling story about two hearts finding a home.

She is working on analyzing written and filmed texts ranging from Freud's theories in \\"The Interpretation of Dreams,\\" \\"Beyond the Pleasure Principle\\" and \\"Moses and Monotheism\\" to Paul de Man's post-structuralist literary theory to Alain Resnais's film \\"Hiroshima Mon Amour\\" to understand how these texts theorize trauma.

It's so dreadfully written that I can't read more than two pages before putting it down again, wondering why, oh why, did this bad writing get past editing. This makes even Larry Niven's characters believable, and makes me reconsider how bad I thought Dayton Ward's Vanguard novels were. In contrast, those were quite good compared to this Star Trek novel.

On top of that the shelf spacing was odd in that if you had DVD's on one shelf you couldn't have them on the one directly above or below it (only fit CD's). As the title of the review says, the only good thing about this product was the customer service, they said they will send us a free shipping label so we can return the product.

Only thing I would change is the back panel is put on by screws and it was too hard to keep them straight so we ended up spliting some of the wood as we got to close to the edge. Nails might have been easier. There were extra parts which is nice and even had a part to connect it to the wall as it is a little tippy. Pretty good overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Soundtrack","review":"The Accompanist is a fabulous soundtrack.

Ignore the critics: this is one of the top 10. It has perhaps the most believable villain, and some genuine moments of vision of a happier world. The United States had just entered WWII (notice the red, white and blue cover) and Brooks seemed to be counting some of his peacetime blessings. Brooks' (Freddy's) pathetic poetry is almost absent. Illustrator Weise, who delivers irregular performances -- possibly devoting more effort to the books he likes -- here produces highly detailed and complete drawings.Freddy is not always on sound moral ground in the series. Here, he confronts an ambiguous adversary with self-examination and fairness. Some positive thinking from an age of America which is now rapidly fading behind us."},{"rating":"2","title":"301 Garmin still as good as ever","review":"After many years of fine service, my old 301 no older had a relationship with a heart rate monitor.

Why is he killing people? No idea. Too bad the script is such a mess, because they had the makings of a decent b-horror flick for the first half. The girls were cute and you start to care about some of them. The acting is poor but not offensive, it was filmed pretty well, but the script and plot holes are what really hurt it.

Montgomery Clift turns in a superb performance as Father Michael Logan, a priest who hears a confession of a murder. Shortly thereafter, Father Logan himself is suspected and, eventually, accused of the murder. Of course, he knows who committed the murder, but he can't break the seal of the confessional even to save his own life! Anne Baxter plays an old girlfriend who tries to help, but ends up making things worse. Karl Malden is very good as a police detective determined to solve the murder.This is one of the best and most Catholic movies ever! I am a priest, and I encourage all of my brother priests to watch this movie. It is an inspiring look at the kind of priest that God has called us to be. It is also an excellent reminder to all Catholics about the great gift we have in the Sacrament of Reconciliation."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER FIND FROM HITCHCOCK!","review":"This was another one of Hitchcock's movies that I had never seen, but I'm glad I did! Montgomery Clift, as a priest who knows a terrible secret, is wonderful! (What a great actor he was - I have never seen him give a poor or mediocre performance in any of his films. It's such a pity his life was cut short)Karl Malden and Anne Baxter give good performances, as well, but the movie is all Clift's. The movie has an interesting premise - a murderer confesses his crime to a priest, who is bound by his vows not to reveal anything told to him in the confessional. There was a little too much talk in the film, but the surprise ending more than makes up for any minor complaints I may have had. Alfred Hitchcock's movies are wonderful - classy and intelligent as opposed to some of the rot being churned out of Hollywood today. A great film, a great cast, a great viewing experience into the dark sie of human nature!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Directorial Magnificence","review":"Others have told the story of the plot and its contrivances and of Montgomery Clift's peculiarities. All good and true. But for my money its Hitch's direction that carries the day here. In fact, I'll go further than that. This may be Hitchcock's best directed film (possibly exceeded only by \\"Psycho\\") in terms of pure visual narration. Is it the nimbleness afforded by whatever black-and-white cameras were used? I don't know. But the fluidity and grace of his cuts, the rich rhythm of the shots used (varying beautifully among close/medium/distant) and some powerful individual framing spell directorial magnificence. See for yourself. The next time you watch this, pay close attention to what this man is doing and marvel at his mastery of cinematic grammar.

Well, it's quiet, yes..no doubt because the internal fan is so insufficiently small that it only sends mist out a couple of inches before it plunges directly down to soak anything underneath it. It would do this at either the high or low fan speed, not dispersing the mist whatsoever.

We've tried the most expensive to the least expensive and they all have one major problem - they get dirty, even with daily cleaning, and the filters have to be changed.I love the Medisana because there is no filter to change and it stays so clean. It is perfect for one night by the bed. This is the second one I've purchased because I like it so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I purchased 2 of these humidifiers from the sharper image. I am assuming they are the same type and model with the sharper image logo. This was absolutely the best humidifier I ever purchased, it was convenient, easy to use, and compact enough to sit on your nightstand. My dissapointment came that when we took them out to use for the 2nd winter season they only worked a few days. We followed all manufacture directions using distilled water and cleaning them daily after use. The went from turning off after a few minutes to not working at all. Sharper Image assumed no responsibility for them since they were a year old and the only help I got was to send them in to a address to be repaired with no phone number. I had no idea where they would go, how much it would cost, nothing. So, great idea but expensive if they need to be replaced or repaired every year. I almost purchased 2 more but decided it wasn't cost effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away","review":"This humidifier quit working in less than 2 months. It does not lid or blowing any mist.

And I have this one thankfully beecause it's a good solo effort from buck d. Of blue oyster cult fame. In fact some songs sound like boc and some are more poppy. But all in all it's a solid rock cd from the early 80's, which is a good time in the history of music actually.

It is really ashame he passed away recently. For years I was impressed with the black & white movies with Basil Rathbone. I never imagined he could be beat in his rendition of Holmes. Nigel Bruce indeed played a clod, and although somewhat amusing sometimes, I much prefer the newer version of Dr. Watson done by Burke and Hardwicke. I hope in the future that Granada or whoever produces these DVDs do a quality job. This production suffered sound and picture quality problems. I don't regret getting it because of Brett's and the other magnificent performances, but I'm very disappointed that such an excellent series was thought of so poorly by the DVD producers.

If you have ever read the original Doyle stories or even if you are familiar only with the Rathbone years, this is the ultimate adaptation of Sherlock Holmes's legacy. The stories are adapted faithfully and completely, perfectly encapsulated in the one hour format. Brett's sometimes subtle, sometimes overblown performances capture the dysfunctional genius of his character. Somewhat close to 50 or so episodes were filmed before the masterful Jeremy Brett's untimely demise, and the only complaint I have is that only four have been released."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment...","review":"Grainy transfer from 16 mm, bad sound on two of the four episodes, and an absolutely unviewable trailer really do ruin this DVD.

I like these #2 tri-write pencils because with their triangular design, they don't just roll off the edge of a work bench or board when you set them down. They also tend to stay in place more securely when set behind the ear as well. These are normal sized triangular pencils, not the really big triangular ones that kid's use in the classroom.I've tried the pencils that Staples sells under their name, but they are cheap Chinese junk made from soft, poor quality wood with leads that break constantly when you write with them and even when you try to sharpen them. The eraser on them is also some cheap waxy rubber compound that smudges more than it erases. I ended up using them for kindling in our Chiminaya this summer. I'll be sticking with name brand pencils like Ticonderoga from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small for tiny hands","review":"I hadn't read the reviews carefully and I was disappointed when they arrived.

ELIXIR, by Gary Braver,is such a book. It is one of the few thrillers I WILL read again. Chris Bacon is a trained biologist in search of medicinal plants, but returns from Papua New Guinea with the 'Fountain of Youth.' Now Braver poses some very big questions. Would living for centuries, maybe forever, be too much of a good thing? Where will everyone live if people don't die? Suppose members of families disagree? What will be the new policies? Who decides?The author draws you in to this potentially changed world, but unfortunately some things never change. Greed, corruption, jealously, murder, all play a part in the compelling plot. This book should be a movie. Someone once said, Man is Nature's sole miatake. Braver shows us why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gary Braver has created a stylish thriller for the ages .","review":"\\"Elixir\\" is a stylish and highly satisfying biomedical thriller about the creation of a veritable elixir -- a substance seemingly capable of prolonging life indefinitely.

Braver vividly delivers clever plot twists and engrossing characters in a well-written, well-crafted story that will make you think and will also scare you. \\"Elixir\\" just may make you reconsider any desire you may have had for eternal youth.

The writing is solid, characters engaging - you can definitely feel their turmoil and pain, and the story is thought-provoking. To age and die or live a long,long time in your prime? Hmmmm. The scientific aspect is well done - enough information to make it believable and gripping, and at the same time not too much as to confuse and bore. This book pulled me in so deeply that I couldn't put it down, and finished it in 3 days. That hasn't happened in a long time!

Chris Bacon and family, on the run from everyone from bad-guy drug barons to the U.S. federal government, have to split town at the drop of a dime. As they go, author Braver skillfully weaves in background info revealed for the first time with the actual chase scene, so that the action is tautly suspensful and intellectually interesting. This culminates the carefully built structure of the novel as a whole, which does not neglect the moral implications of the scientific discovery of possible immortality, against death as a defining human consideration, perhaps what keeps us human as we know it.

There argument is very few southeners were slaveowners. That is correct. So what does that say about the fools who fought, bled and died so that the rich elite could own their slaves?Sorry boys, but you book is pure nonsense. The south was very wrong. And it remains wrong to this day. Consider the South Carolina flap over the Confederate battle flag. They speak of Southern heritage. That damned flag was put up in 1962, at the height of the desegregation fight. The south, I am afraid, is nothing more than a pit of hypocrisy, just as it was in the days of slavery.

About half of the book is devoted to telling us what really happened in the War for Southern Independence.

This book dispells the Northern myth that the Union came down to save the slaves from the \\"evil\\" Southerners. It also shows that Abraham Lincoln was not so honest; in fact, he was an early Hitler or Huessein. This book is not just for Southerners.

Just because a side 'wins' does not mean they were right! It only means they 'physically' won!The constitutional rights of the southern people were trampled on, as well as thousands of innocent civilians (which generally marks the evil that most win wars by)!

They have no idea how to do historical research, their arguments are full to the brim with meaningless statements, their sources are flimsy to say the least, their references lack any authority whatsoever, and their approach is so dripping with partisanship and anger that I find it difficult to believe how any reasonably intelligent and objective person can take this stuff seriously.

Where to begin with this one. That 'history is written by the victors' garbage is meaningless in a society like ours. Anyone who is educated understands that writing on the Civil War was dominated by southerners (especially Virginians) until well into this century.

I do not think that the economy has anything to do with this. It is plain and simple racism, ignorance and hatred.

With that being said, however, this book provides much food for thought with many facts that are put forth. Before reading this book, I couldn't imagine that any black person would side with the South during the Civil War. My history texts in school derided the idea.

The authors quite rightly have a very deep - rooted pride in where they come from, and this shows constantly throughout the book.

I started peeling (very gently) from the top, when I noticed that the adhesive was staying on the wall and not the decal (which means I couldn't relocate it). About an inch later (the dino's chin), paint was coming off with the decal. Removing the sticker was a disaster. No matter how good it looks on the wall, it's not worth the damage it causes upon removal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Original--I couldn't put it down","review":"What a great read.

The second in a trilogy, this book was an enjoyable read even though I hadn't (yet!) read the others. Susan Carroll builds a believable world in which a nineteenth-century family is rumored to have magical abilities--rightly so! The naive heroine hides from the bleakness of her life by pursuing an interest in legends. When she meets the hero in his magical form and mistakes him for the ghost of Sir Lancelot du Lac, she thinks she has fallen in love. No way, then, will she accept the Bride Finder's pronouncement that the hero is her One True Love. The hero's dilemma, in which his rival is HIMSELF, is priceless. Plot twists and turns add spice throughout, right through to a surprise ending. Please excuse me while I go purchase the other two books in the series,The Bride FinderandMidnight Bride: A Novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointed","review":"This is not a narrated video that explores the phenomenom of near death experiences. The video consists of several individuals, sitting down, telling their story.

When I contacted Julia's Pantry about the fact that it was expired they accused me of confusing the lot number with the expiration date. It clearly said August 1, 2011 on the lid.

It isn't that it doesn't have a good flavor, but basted our ribs all day in it, and the ribs had no sauce on them at all, looked rather unappetizing and now we are left with a case of something we don't like.

Well, it is certainly stylish and attractive enough to appear in a National Geographic photo shoot, but will likely fall off of the wearer's wrist as soon as the cameras are off! I purchased the item last year as a spare and put it into service this spring. After four months of use, it tries to fall off even when I'm sitting still. The velcro strip did not provide a very vigorous closure when it was brand new and it steadily lost its grip even further over time. If the most strenuous \\"expedition\\" you have planned is a chaufferred trip to the mall, and you regularly replace your watchband every few months, then you'll do fine with this band. Otherwise, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and Informative","review":"This is the interesting autobiography of one of America's greatest poets.

I felt like the political/historical part of this novel was the main focus of the book, with a romance sort of tacked on. There wasn't any real chemistry between the characters, and the author never really made it clear why they should fall in love with one another. That magic 'spark' that makes a romance work just wasn't there.After being bored by two of this author's books, I don't think I'll be trying another. It seems that historical/political plots with a back-burner love story are pretending to be romance novels when they're not. If you're looking for a moving love story, this isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly remastered!","review":"I was really looking forward to replacing my scratchy album with this CD. The disc says \\"Remaster in High Definition\\", but the sound is AM radio all the way.

If I was gonna be more diplomatic, I think I enjoy this one more during the mellow bits, but it's nothing they didn't do MUCH better earlier on albums like Floating World and Kites. It seems like they were adhering too closely to a New Age aesthetic. Just look at the song titles....\\"Evocation\\"....\\"Timeless Journey\\".......\\"Night Of The Shamen\\"? Cliche.And by the way, for the guy (girl?) who was asking if the lyric \\"And it's alright, sitting in firelight\\" was Jade Warrior, yes it is, and it's the first song on Last Autumn's Dream (my favorite JD album), \\"A Winter's Tale\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product; Needs Upgrade!","review":"The DDSS is a collection of several screensavers of great appeal to Deadheads.

There are even some shots of the full-bodied model in pantyhose -perhaps taschen will get their act together and compile a 'Taschen Book of Tights' to capitalise on the huge popularity of pantyhose.

One worries about the futures of all the characters, most of whom are so flawed as to inspire only pity for their respective beloveds. The deus ex machina ending, in which Portia conjures happiness all around out of thin air -- except, of course, for Shylock, is merely bewildering.Yet _Merchant_ should not be forgotten. One gets the impression that Shakespeare *wanted* his audience to be uncomfortable with some of the horrible prejudices depicted, and one definitely feels challenged. In addition, the extent to which we have moved on from the anti-Semitism so apparently cavalierly brandished in this 'comedy' leaves us with the responsibility to remember and be aware of prejudices that could be recalled to life, given the wrong stimuli.I bought my Kindle edition for a \\"Shakespeare Sundae\\" dessert + reading, and was very pleased with its formatting and readability.

It worked great for the first 9 batches of popping (over several days). Then it burned out. It doesn't turn on at all anymore. I should've read the directions more thoroughly. You can only do two consecutive batches. Then the machine needs to rest 10 minutes. This is good to note if you want to pop more than 1 cup of kernals, or two-days worth of coffee. If you go for batch number 3 (which I did), you can say goodbye. At least it was cheap... and now headed for a landfill. rrrgh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inferior product","review":"I just returned this product to the store, after a month of use. It only popped about 40% of the kernels, leaving great numbers of the unpopped kernels in the collection bowl as well as on the floor.

I tried holding a paper towel over the exit chute like a matador facing off against a charging bull, but to no use. Those hot kernels come shooting out like bullets.

Then there was the bright RED glow coming from underneath the unit. I quickly unplugged it. That's as far as I got. I guess the motor over heated and burned up. It wouldn't come back on even after I let it cool down. So....I returned it and don't think I want to try a replacement. I'm not recommending this to anyone.

In the 4 or so times I've used it, it popped less than half of the kernels. The unpopped kernels wind up in the bowl or on the floor.3. It is impossible to get the popcorn to go into the bowl.

I ended up sweeping the kitchen floor and cleaning the dinning table (even though, I placed a large bowl directly in front of the popper). I was highly annoyed with the amount of unpopped kernels that came out compared to the total amount I measured (about one-third was unpopped). In addition, I had to reuse the popper because the amount that did pop was simply not enough not even for one serving.Soon after the disappointing purchase, I returned it. Sometimes, it pays to do your homework and pay a little extra money for a good quality product.

Shoots mostly unpopped kernels (extremely hot) out the shoot and sends them all over the counter.

It might be good for roasting coffee beans, but as a popcorn popper it fails miserably. Usually left anywhere from 1/3 to 1/4 of the kernels un-popped and blew the popped corn everywhere. We just bought the Presto Orville Redenbacher hot air corn popper and it is worth every cent. Do make the same mistake we did......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flying kernels","review":"I agree with most of the people who commented on this popcorn popper. I used mine yesterday for the first time, and there was popcorn everywhere.

I thought the Toastmaster 6202 popper could be a replacement. Using the Toastmaster on same bag of popcorn 75% of the kernels failed to pop at all. Most popcorn is shot all over the room along with hot kernels of unpopped popcorn. Getting a larger bowl or using different brands of pocorn does NOT fix the problems. I finally spent $10 more for a name brand hot air popper. No special bowls. No special popcorn. I get 95-98% of the kernels pop INTO the bowl not over the kitchen floor.

It is a violent machine that sends popcorn in all directions with a force that is frightening. I have to hold a paper bag OVER the opening in order to catch the 50% popped and 50% unpopped kernels.

The directions said to use 1/2 cup of corn. I did that and had about 1/4 cup corn unpopped. I have used this unit only 4 to 5 times. As soon as I can find another popper, this one will be put in a box for donations. I spent all afternoon trying to find one, but no one seems to carry them like they used to. I miss my old popper.

To say that Tara Reid can act is the BIGGEST understatement of this decade, not that anyone should be surprised by that cooment... but her non existent acting really kills every scene shes in. She's the ONLY purely serious role in the entire movie and it just does NOT fit well.

This one is a must read for all."},{"rating":"1","title":"She cannot write","review":"Danielle Steel is one of the few authors whose TV miniseries versions are better than the books themselves. Her characters are all rich, beautiful, smart, and somehow it's very difficult to care about these people's fates. Jewels proves to be no exception. Her characters seem cut out of cardboard boxes. The villains and villainesses are comic book caricatures, and the heroes and heroines are all beautiful, noble, intelligent, and selfless. In other words, quite unrealistic. I decided to read the book after watching the miniseries, but what a mistake that was."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"So Danielle Steel is a NY Times bestseller, is she not? Unless you have been living in a cave for the last few decades, you know the name Danielle Steel. So I thought I would try reading one of her books.

The mirror finish doesn't last long when you begin cooking on or even boiling water. The bond use to stick the bottom plate to the bottom of the pan is odd. When 1st heated it makes a few popping sounds. I didn't expect a great quailty product due to the cost of the set. Finding everything that I needed and used was more important. The set does heat evenly and cook well it's just overall spotting and stains are an eye sore.

Told husband to not even take all of them out of the box. They are not heavy as you would expect 18/10 cookware to be. Then did some more research on reviews & product description. Amazon's description of this cookware contradicts itself. One section states the pans can withstand heat to 450 degrees while further down, it states it can withstand heat to 500 degrees.I checked the Cuisinart website for this collection to find it sells for $249--not the $670 Amazon lists it for.

I've been impressed with this set. Enough pieces to suit every need, just the right weight and feel. Definitely not heavy like some others, but definitely not light weight No problems cleaning - maybe a little more attention to cleaning but they clean up well. I've had to break out the Bar Keepers Friend only on a couple of occasions and it easily did the trick. I only do that on the insides. The outside keeps its mirror finish with just soap and water. And cooking is fun - I feel more in control of the flame with these."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"Was a little disappointed with the gauge of the sides, thought it would be heavier.

The product itself is excellent. We love the way it looks and how it performs. It does everything Cuisinart says it will do.

So far so good, and the price was right when compared to other similar items.My main concern was not to eat long-term from food prepared on typical Teflon coated cookware, and also not to eat long-term from food prepared on aluminum items either; this set seems so far to be the best avenue to avoid both at the right price. Wish me luck with them.p.s. Another nice benefit with cookware of this quality nature is the need of only very little cooking oil to avoid food sticking to pan. The dense and hardened stainless along with its high polish all helps with this attribute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Cooks even and fast, easy clean up if you follow directions, and looks great. Exactly what was advertised on the site."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Christmas gift!","review":"My husband just bought these for me as an early Christmas gift and I love them!!

They clean up great, look good, are pretty sturdy, cook pretty evenly on the cooking surface, however the sidewalls of the every piece are way thinner than I thought. This causes some uneven cooking throughout moderate-large amounts of liquids so if you're trying to simmer for a long time you'll be doing plenty of stirring. Overall I'm happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"sending them back","review":"I was very happy to get my new pans. after just one use though, one of the pans began to pit onthe inside bottem. after more use it just got worse! called their hot line and they were very nice and askedme to use the rest of the pans to see if they too would pit. so far all but the frying pans are gettingthe pits in the bottem. seems to me it is when you boil water in them. i am calling back and will send them backto them. i just hope i can still get their pans back, i do like the way they cook and look."},{"rating":"2","title":"All I hoped for","review":"This set is great. My previous set was 30+ years old and showing a great deal of wear.

You would normally expect to pay at least twice this for what you get. Everything came as advertised and so far i have been able to use every piece in the set. Heat distribution is even, and scorching is minimal. The finish on the outside and on the lids is bright, shiny, and durable, and the finish on the inside is matte. One thing i did notice was that the inside was a little easier than i expected to scratch. I would have figured that the stainless would have had a bit of a harder temper on it....so be careful stirring with metal spoons etc. (duh) If you are a decent cook and know how to use your hardware i would definitely recommend this set because there is a lot to be appreciated here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We're cooking now !!","review":"What a great addition to our new kitchen appliances.

They cook evenly and are pretty easy to clean if cleaned right away. They feel like a quality set. I would recommend this set to the average person.

But in my opinion, for the money this set can't be beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Unless you're a professional chef, save your pennies and get these instead of All Clad. No, they're not the same, but from a value measurement these pans can't be beat.They have a heavy base bonded to relatively thin sidewalls. The handles are well shaped, unlike All Clad. This makes them very easy to maneuver. The bases disperse heat evenly although they do run a bit hot. (If you've got a high output stove top you're probably not considering these pans anyway.)They look really nice as well. They resist stains and are quite durable. I've put them through their paces and they've held up admirably.Pick up the nonstick 12\\" frying pan (kinda spendy) and the 6 qt. saute pan (very spendy) and you've got a complete, near-pro cooking setup at a fraction of the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great everything you need cookware set","review":"Beautiful, and surprisingly light weight.

Bought it a month before my move-in date so I couldn't even test it out until a month down the line. Finally took it out of the box 5 days ago and...it kind of sucks. Made eggs the first day with some butter; it stuck. The next day decided to try eggs without any butter or oil; it stuck. Today I tried to use some canola oil; yeah, it stuck. Never EVER had a problem with eggs sticking with OIL in any other pan, so what's the problem?And then I thought to try one of the saucer pots to make some mashed potatoes. I cooked the potatoes first, and guess what? While cooking, some of the \\"stainless steel\\" cover inside the pa came off and now I have black marks that aren't going away. They're not just stains, they're basically holes. WTF?I can't even return it now because it's been over 30 days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graduation Gift","review":"I think that this set is great!

And so far the end of the handles haven't gotten super hot, so that is nice, you can pick them up sometimes. Ummm, I don't really know what else to say.

Unfortunately the Del Fuegos broke up after this disc and never broke through to the big time but they made some great music while they were together.

They faded away for a while until Smoking in the Fields came out in late 89. This one rocked a bit harder than Stand Up and is another one of those should-have-been hits. My favorite songs on the disc are Friends Again and Down in Allen Mills. All four of their albums are worthwhile so what are you waiting for; go pick 'em up.I saw them in concert a couple of times and the last was with the Georgia Satellites and Tom Petty; now that was a great triple bill.

There are 5 National Parks that are highlighted. There is beautiful scenery shown, with a bit of a drawback that there are some of the same scenes repeated in short order. There are lots of scenes of the ensemble playing, perhaps more than of the Parks themselves. The music is very melodic, especially the sole wind instrument player who plays at times very haunting melodies, using flutes and related instruments.And yes, the smiling Tim Janis on the piano can wear a bit. But all the members of the ensemble seem to really be enjoying their efforts.In a bit of a surprise, the bonus music section perhaps contains some of the best pictures, especially if you like flower scenes. It perhaps is easy to miss this if you simply put in the DVD and push play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"We own several videos and DVD's that show spectacular scenery and have awesome music. THIS is not one of them. We purchased this DVD after reading the back cover, expecting to see the beauty of America's National Parks. What you WILL see is a scant few seconds of scenery, followed by endless images of the orchestra and musicians. It was so irritating that I started counting the seconds that scenery was shown and then how much time was spent on the orchestra. When it got to 6-8 seconds of beautiful scenery (just enough so that you started to relax and enjoy it) only to be followed by 25 seconds of musicians in the studio, we turned it off. It was not relaxing. It was irritating. I was actually surprised that someone with an appreciation of the outdoors would devote so little time to showing it! Don't waste your money. Desert Vision is a far superior selection if you are looking for beautiful imagery with a soothing music background."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Title & Description?","review":"When playing the dvd I expect to see our beautiful American sceneries instead of the orchestra playing. Why call it Beautiful America when there is hardly any sceneries? Our country have tons of them, more than any other countries in the world. We care about the music and the scenery but not the repeated images of the orchestra members."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see..","review":"I happened across this as a PBS special and was intrigued immediately. The music is hauntingly beautiful...actually brought tears to my eyes. The video of the national parks was so peaceful and serene. I would have liked to see more of the video and less of the orchestra, but overall I think this is a much passed over program. Everyone will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"horsepower\\" of a different color","review":"With all the media attention on the Balkans and the Middle East, the situation on Cyprus has faded four decades into history. Or has it? 007 gets pulled into a situation when M's boyfriend is murdered by a serial killer, and as the old saying goes: \\"way leads to way\\". He winds up dealing with a new terrorist group dedicated to ridding Cyprus of the Turks and the more moderate Greeks. One big feature about this book is that the hostility between Bond and M has faded quite a bit. She actually calls him James a few times. Oh, yeah--about the allusion above. Remember that scene in \\"Wizard Of Oz\\" where the horse pulling the carriage in the Emerald City keeps changing color? They explain to Dorothy that this is the famous \\"horse of a different color\\". Well, Bond's new Jag does the same thing--with the flip of a switch. Beats the Aston Martin he had in Goldfinger--the one with the changing plates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bond's greatest foe revealed - his name is Raymond Benson","review":"I am shocked that anyone would give this novel more than one star. I am a lifelong James Bond fan and have read every Bond novel. The two written by Benson are easily the worst. I read this one because I refuse to give up on the Bond tradition but it was a painful read. Bond's dialogue is embarrassing, the story is underdeveloped, and the writing is amateurish. Did Bond really call an enemy \\"Fathead\\" in this book or was I just on the verge of falling asleep?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Facts of Death","review":"Now this is a lousy rendition of 007's life and death adventures. Sure, it's Bond, James Bond, and sure, he arouses basic insticts in women he meets--be them friend or foe--but this tale is surely lacking in inspiration. The author even brought back Felix, and the two spend an extraordinary amount of time drinking. (Can't people enjoy life without soaking up the booze?)The plot: evil doers are sending toxic poisons all over the world in \\"live\\" sperm cases. They, of course, have blackmailed a young fellow into being a carrier. And, guess what? One of the baddies is a strikingly-beautiful woman, who Bond, James Bond, somehow manages to seduce (What? James Bond the seducer?) one of the prime villans within the first several pages. B-o-r-i-n-g ! (Figuratively, that is.)Charles A. Reap, Jr., author, \\"Devil's Game\\" and \\"My Friend Sam.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"James Bond or Austin Powers?","review":"What can I say about this book other than it is poorly written. The only thing it has in common with the great James Bond's novels of the past, is that Mr. Benson was allowed to use the character name. Benson should stick to writing computer programs.Do not waste your time or money with this or any of his Bond novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least he's consistent","review":"This is the best I can say for Mr. Raymond Benson. Unfortunately, he is consitently boring, and I hate to say that about a fellow Texan. For those of you who have not yet read Ian Fleming's books, spend your time and money on those instead. They are wonderful. And for all of you diehard Bond fans, I suppose you'll read the book anyway. I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads Like It Was Written For Sixth Graders","review":"While I originally welcomed John Gardner's departure from the Bond series, I'm growing increasingly annoyed with Benson's simplistic writing style. Even more so than Zero Minus Ten, this book reads more like a James Bond movie than one of Ian Fleming's classic novels. Benson claims to be a big James Bond fan, but except for a few gratuitous references to earlier Bond novels (from Fleming, Gardner, and Amis), Benson seems to have taken his Bond straight from the movie screen.Come along, Mr. Benson. Stop watching Bond movies and read Fleming's classic novels to find out what the character is REALLY all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad writing; bad story; just plain bad.","review":"Recently I observed a fifth-grader trying out instruments for the following year's school band. The band director, trying to get a sense of the kid's musical aptitude, sang a series of varied notes to the kid and asked him to sing them back. The poor kid sang back exactly the same, flat tone each time. Apparently he was truly tone deaf, unable to distinguish a C from an F sharp from a B flat.The people who are giving this book 5 stars are the literary equivalent of that kid. That anyone could put such a poorly written, unoriginal, and boring effort as this Benson story on the same level as any of the original Fleming books... well, I wouldn't have thought it possible. But then I didn't know anyone was as tone deaf as that kid.I don't have perfect pitch, but I can tell the difference between two notes an octave and half apart; and likewise, I can tell the difference between a 5-star story like \\"Casino Royale\\" and a .005-star story like \\"The Facts of Death\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant updating of 007!","review":"Raymond Benson has done a most engaging job of updating James Bond to the 90s and beyond. While the book feels like one of the films, it also feels like an original Fleming with the literary Bond's sensibilities. Benson takes the best of both worlds and combines them. Great plot, terrific characters... This is a must!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Benson sometimes make me yearn for Gardner","review":"I don't why so many don't like Gardner. The man wrote more Bond novels than anyone else, and while of course Fleming was the original and the best, Gardner turned out some very good books (as well as the inevitable bad ones.) But he was a good, established writer, something Benson clearly is not. He's just over his head trying to write novels. Gardner was not perfect, heck, he had me wanting something much more plenty of times, but he at least had a good formula going often, which is what Bond is all about in book and film--formula. The writing from Benson is so bad, and his attempts to recall Fleming are almost pathetic. Perhaps another British spy novel writer can take over this franchise, because I do not want to see it in Benson's hands for too much longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad. Very Bad.","review":"That so many previous reviewers have given this book high marks shows how far our literary standards have fallen. I give it one star only because Amazon hasn't provided for a zero-star rating. The story was trite and embarrassingly derivative of Fleming's Bond stories. But above all, the writing is horrendous. This book would have improved 100% if Benson had simply hired someone with average writing skills to do a sentence-by-sentence rewriting. Again, I am appalled than so many of you actually think this is a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like Fleming, give Benson a pass","review":"How did Raymond Benson convince a publisher to print this garbage? This, in every sense, is a poorly written novel. The writing reminds me of a very earnest 10th-grader. This books' title character bears NO relationship to the James Bond created by Ian Fleming. I realize that the James Bond films have influnced millions of readers. Fine. That, however, is no excuse for a story that reads like a (bad) action-movie screenplay. Mr. Benson has created a poorly realized, Americanized Bond that has nothing in common with the original character.I could keep going, but the review only allows 1000 words. In short: This book is a pathetic attempt to capitalize on the James Bond franchise. Read Fleming. Or watch one of the movies, but don't waste your time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ludicrous","review":"BENSON WRITES thrillers \\"featuring Ian Fleming's James Bond\\". Packed full of perfunctory sex and predictable violence, with an improbable plot, an absurd baddie and an obsession with brand names and hardware, this is an uninvolving confection that never manages to transcend the imaginative limits or warped authenticity of the original Bond films. Sporadic bursts of exciting narrative suggest that Benson should ditch the fossil and write his own books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old story","review":"It was just ok. This book seems to follow a James Bond formula: two or three women, detailed explaination of the meal, fast car and typical end confrontation. The novel also lacks the rich description, and story development of Fleming novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Benson misses the point...","review":"In trying to copy Ian Fleming's writing style, Raymond Benson relegates himself to writing a pulp-novel of the late 1950s with technology of the 1990s. The results aren't great. What Benson has missed is that just as the Bond films of late have had to change with the times, so do the novels. Megolomaniacal bad guys may have been entertaining thirty-five years ago, but they've gotten pretty stale in the meantime (Ironically, the villain from \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\", the latest film that was not scripted by Benson was much more contemporary and believable). As for biological weapons, that was done to death years ago. With competition like Tom Clancy and Stephen Hunter, Benson can't afford to be pretending it's 1962. The Bond novels always seemed more believable than the films, but try to imagine one of the movies featuring a scene in which Felix Leiter charges his electric wheelchair into the gunfire at a militia warehouse. I can't do it either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Esoteric appreciation of the Bard","review":"Martin Lings has once again brought his erudition and uncompromising critical mind to a perennially fascinating author and playwright.

We stumbled upon this book prior to her surgery. She read it over and over again. It became her favorite book for quite a while. There is no question that this book helped her prepare for this stressful event. The pictures and text manage to provide frank and detailed information about getting tubes without being frightening. Parents will probably want to preview the book prior to reading it to their child, in order to tailor/edit the book to the child's developmental level.My wife and I would definitely recommend this to any family going through this process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tubes not up to par","review":"I bought this book for my five year old granddaughter who was preparing to go into the hospital - even she found it boring. Would NOT recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"IV's and Vomit....not my idea of easing a child's fear.","review":"I ordered this book for my 4 year old but decided not to read it to her. I don't know why the author talks about an IV. My daughter's tubes didn't even require an IV, and if so, they place it once the child is under anesthesia, so they don't even know about it. Another part I didn't like was when they show the little boy actually throwing up when he's recovering. Again, doesn't happen most of the time, and even if it did, what child wants to look forward to that, especially with an actual picture of vomit coming out of the child's mouth? I found that very unnecessary. I chose not to read this book to my daughter before her surgery so she wouldn't get scared of those things."},{"rating":"2","title":"The FDR administration and the Jews","review":"The book clarifies questions that I had concerning why, in the case of the Jews, the expression \\"the conscience of the free world\\"can be viewed, from an historical perspectve, as an oxymoron.

Of course a few more tracks wouldn't hurt, but in the end a good mix of new songs and old hits.Its a very intense and high energy concert all the way through.Especially drummer Greg Upchurch is stunning with a hard-hitting super performance.The video is great shot and awesome quality, only to be topped by the sound. All instruments are so clear and loud.Negative Things:The song \\"Drift and Die\\" features a guest guitarist with a long solo thing and it just ruins the song for me. Too bad.Some will find the acoustic set great. But I like the electric versions better.Conclusion: If you like rock and/or POM this dvd won't dissappoint you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Performance","review":"The reason I rate this 4 stars instead of 5 is because at times, Wes' voice could be a little better, but you've got to remember that these guys have been playing with all their energey for almost 1 and a half hours. The performance overall was amazing, it really rocks.If you get this DVD, check out \\"Abrasive\\", which isn't listed, but is played right after \\"Bring Me Down\\".As for the acoustic set, all of the songs are great, except the way \\"Think\\" was sang, I thought was kinda annoying. Also for the live and acoustic sets, the guest guitarist for \\"Drift & Die\\" may impress some, but in my opinion, I think it made a pure rock n roll song turn phony and lame... just an opinion.Well, I'm not very good at writing reviews, and at this hour (3 AM), I don't really feel like trying.

You need to go in and kill the peeps in power, and a volunteer relief fund will get you there in about 7,000 light years.

In fact, this is about the only Thriller book that I didn't enjoy at all in the last 5 years. This is my first review and I'm writing it because I don't want people see the 5 star reviews and waste their time with this book. It's truly awful. It started off okay and then the characters and the plot take a horrible nosedive. I've never felt so cheated out of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed But Not Ready to Give Up","review":"(...) unfortunately I started with Dead Eyes. I felt as though I was reading a suspense story from a beginner romance novelist. The dialogue at times was laughable and I agree with another reviewer that the ending was thrown together. The few sex scenes were like something from Barbara Cartland. My biggest complaint was the portrayal of the cop Jon Larsen - he came off as an incompetent dolt. Through the entire book, the stalker was one step ahead of him to the very end. However, this writer gets such high praise from other reviewers that I'm not quite ready to quit and plan on checking out the Stone Barrington series."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was glad this book was given to me.","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I had heard of this author from friends. Someone gave me a copy of Dead Eyes, and I must say that of all the crime-type novels I have read, this was one of the worse. There was not much in the way of character development. It was boring. Yes, I was surprised at the end, but getting there was not very exciting or suspenseful. I don't think I'll be reading anymore of his books. It's back to Patricia Cornwell for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead Eyes - Dead in the Water","review":"Certainly not up to standard for this established writer.

Now, 7 weeks later, two phone calls and several emails, I have been informed for the 3rd time that a return shipping label will be mailed to me and somehow the other two were lost in the mail.

I highly suggest that you put the money toward another brand such as KopyKake pens or Americolor.

Probably only took 30-45 mins to put together. It's actually fairly lightweight...one person can drag it around, or two people can easily lift and move it.Cleans up really well from the elements. Hopefully the finish will last a long time (and ten years from now, if it needs it...it would probably spray paint really well).Only negative I can say is that some of the slats are slightly uneven...so when you go to set a glass down, it's not perfectly level. It's only a couple of them (think it has something to do with the slats that support the legs and stuff underneath). It's not enough to make your glass fall over on it's own, but I notice it immediately, and then move my glass to a level surface.Even with that problem though, I'd still buy this table again.

Since the pans come with a lifetime warranty, I am going to attempt to get Cuisinart to replace just these two instead of trying my luck with a third full set - the problem is they say send money to ship back replacements/repair so they better be willing to cover that too since its right out of the box broken.The pans are packed and stacked inadequately to protect from normal shipping bumps and what not which appears to be the cause of a majority of the issues with scratching/rubbing to the point of exposing core."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous","review":"I bought this set and I love them,The only thing is that I think one of them has been deformed a little bit and the door can not be opened completelyBut it's okay,It's not that badI think this set is more healthy than Steel ones,Buy them and enjoy cooking with them"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cookware","review":"I love this cookware set.

Only 12 pieces were in the box! I am missing the 3 quart sauce pan and lid. I called GOURMET KITCHEN GALLERY twice and have not heard back from them. In addition, they only have voice mail, so it does not sound very professional. I am very upset as I need this cookware for holiday cooking and was very upset that I ordered 14 pieces and only 12 came. This is very poor quality control and very poor customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot be used for induction cooktop!!!","review":"When you perform a google search for induction pots and pans the Cuisinart 66-14 shows up at the top of the list. Yet, these cannot be used for induction cooktops. None of the literature states these pots and pans cannot be used for induction purposes. Beware, Cuisinart will not allow you to exchange this item for credit or induction cookware. Fortunately, Amazon is more consumer oriented and issied a full refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best cookware I have owned","review":"I bought this set about a year ago and it is still in great condition. My only complaint is I don't entirely agree with it being oven safe. I put the large pan in the oven and it warped after the first time. The heat was not to high (350) and I take care of my pans. I hand wash them, I never wash them right after cooking when they are hot, and I don't use metal utensils so I am sure that is how it was warped. It was just a tiny bit but I can tell when I place it on the burner. I also noticed that if you do use non-stick cooking spray that you need to make sure to clean it really well otherwise it will leave a sticky residue. I use3m Company 498 \\"Scotch-brite\\" Scotch Dobie Scrubberand it works really well. I do love these pans though they are the best set I have ever owned. The non-stick surface is awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuisinart is equal to Calphalon Hard-Anodized Cookware","review":"I have owned top of the line Calphalon Cookware in the past and recently purchased a 17 pc Cuisinart Hard-Anodized Set of Cookware. After using it for the past week I find it to be equal to the $699.00 set of Calphalon. I highly recommend Cuisinart Cookware to anyone at any skill level."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY FROM CUSINART","review":"I thought HARD anodized would be HARD! It claims to be metal utensil and dishwasher safe yet I only used wood and washed them by hand and STILL the \\"coating\\" inside flaked off and Cuisinart was unwilling to work with me unless *I* paid to have the pans shipped to THEM where THEY would decide if I abused them ??? (they were 2 weeks old) and then I was expected to pay to have them shipped back to me.Oh NO NO NO Find ANOTHER brand and buy different cookware! This is not the Cuisinart from years gone by, their customer service is abysmal! RUN RUN RUN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lid SHATTERED on first use!","review":"Today was my first time using these pans. I lifted the lid of the pan while cooking to stir my casserole and the lid exploded in my face. Hundreds of pieces of glass everywhere. Thankfully, I didn't get cut anywhere, although our lunch has been wasted. I have never in my life had something like this happen. The description on the product actually claims it's shatterproof, which in my case is definately not true. Amazon customer service has been great in returning these pans thankfully."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice and heavy","review":"Nice stuff! Only thing we don't like is there are no vent holes in the lids. Otherwise, this set isperfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even heating even on gas range","review":"I've very impressed with the performance of this cookware! There are no 'hot spots' in the pans cooking on a gas range. There's no need to have the heat on high either. It washes up easily. I especially like that there are so many lids so there's no having to improvise on lids when using 2 of the same size pots and pans. The strainer insert for the stock pot is awesome! It has gotten me spoiled and I can't imagine being without it. Actually, this whole set has me spoiled! This set was a gift to my boyfriend and I'm wishing I would have gotten it for myself! Hahaha!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't know they made pots and pans","review":"My wife and I have been using our Cuisinart cookware set for about a month now and we can't say enough good things about it. We're getting good even cooking temps on the entire surface of each pan. So far there are no scratches. And they're a breeze to clean. This set would have been a bargain at full retail. They were a steal at what we paid. And all this time I though Cuisinart only made food processors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really nice finish and value","review":"The only con for this product is that it can't be placed in the dishwasher, but that seems to be the case for all nice-finish cookware sets. The finish looks nice and the pots, pans and lids are all sturdy but maneuverable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Woot","review":"I got these on sale last week from Amazon at [...]. Totally worth it. They are nice and heavy, heat evenly and the non-stick is amazing. You can put them in the dishwasher but it makes the outside of the pan turn a chalky dappled grey color. You really should hand wash them unless you don't give a crap how the outside looks.The metal and glass lids can get hot while cooking but that's why they make over mitts but the great thing is, since these pans do not have the rubber coated saftey handles you can transfer from stove top to oven for a broil without having to worry about ruining your handles [like the old Revere Ware].Update: 2009 and the pans have not yet fallen apart. The larger cookpot is showing some wear on the nonstick finish after heavy use. I also admit to using metal utensils on the product. The lids are in great shape and have not cracked or chiped and all the metal handles are still bright and shiny and not loose depite me washing them in the dishwasher."},{"rating":"1","title":"A year later, already flaking","review":"For the first few months, I was really happy with this purchase. About two months ago, I started noticing that the pot we use for sauces had little flecks on the bottom. Upon closer inspection, it was actually the black non-stick coating which had flaked off-- exposing the silver of the pot below. We only have plastic stirring spoons (even though these claim the be resistant to metal utensils) and I imagine it is just use and acidity of the food (tomatoes, onions, etc) causing the erosion of the non-stick layer. I would have expected much much better from this brand and this price point, but so far my verdict is that these cant even withstand a year of medium-level use. Already looking for new ones, so I don't have to worry about the coating flaking off into my food."},{"rating":"2","title":"cooks Deleight","review":"What wonderful value,quality and I even enjoy washing them with such ease if you cook a little or a lot you deserve to invest in this set.

Another buyer had posted this same problem. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!","review":"After 3 uses, following ALL instructions Food STICKS. Eggs, meat, vegetables and don't even get me started on pancakes. Stay away from this cookware set"},{"rating":"2","title":"Book review","review":"Don't miss this book. It's a winner. This work is so entertaining both the amateur as well as the seasoned collector will derive great pleasure reading and viewing the great photographs. You dare not miss a word. Atypical, odd, comical, extraordinary and life-like pictures fill the pages (over 300 pictures) with these remarkable figurines. The author and the book each deserve five stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads easily but has very little substance","review":"The only thing missing from Richard Laymon's \\"Among the Missing\\" is an Epilogue. Had it contained one, this novel would have been very much like an extremely low budget episode of Barnaby Jones.It's somewhat mislabeled a \\"horror\\" novel. It really should be classified as a murder/mystery. The back cover blurb sets up the tale well enough. The story goes something like this: Late night liaison, murder, decapitation, witnesses, police involvement, suspects, twist, resolution. To go into details of any one of these aspects would be to ruin what story there is. This wouldn't be fair to the reader.To his credit, Mr. Laymon has a knack for writing very light prose. This novel can be finished in just under two hours. If you're looking for something simple and not very taxing, this is a novel that certainly fits the bill.It will definitely entertain all of Laymon's fans, but if you're new to his work, this wouldn't be the best to use as a starting point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generally a waste of time","review":"I did manage to finish \\"Among the Missing,\\" but with very little excitement as I read it. The characters are uninteresting and badly developed, the plot is awkwardly laid out in many places, and there was never any real sense of menace or suspense associated with the killer until near the end, when it's way too late. This novel also reinforces something I've observed to be true in the past: that it's always a bad sign when a book has a positive blurb quote from Stephen King on the cover (as this one does). I've enjoyed many of King's own works, but have also tried several books with his quotes on them in the past - and they've all been terrible! So a King blurb will be useful for me in the future -- if I see a quote from him on another author's book, whatever his quote says, to me it will mean \\"Put this book down immediately and walk away.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A fast-paced read","review":"Once again Laymon takes us on one hell of a ride. After a woman is discovered headless on the beach, Sheriff Rusty Hodges and his daughter-in-law deputy embark on the trail of the killer in this half-mystery half-suspense novel. Laymon treats us to some great scenes, a lightning quick pace, and a handful of unique characters. Definitely worth a look!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Asleep at the switch","review":"If you've read a lot of Layman, you had to be deeply disappointed in this book. In fact, out of the 391 pages, only about 10 pages of Layman. The rest could have been tossed off by your Aunt Bertha. If you've come to Layman by way of Come Out Tonight, The Travelling Vampire Show, or The Midnight Lair, I would urge you not to bother with this book. Not one single character has been drawn well. The ending is totally a waste--and speaking of which, did anybody else get the idea maybe Mr. Layman just ran out of typing paper? That's it? When he's on his game, he is the master. He does best with teenagers of which there were only two in this book and they served minor roles. If you have three hours to waste, by all means, read the book. Then pick up Come Out Tonight and read a master at the top of his game."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Word: Ugh!","review":"I couldn't get past chapter six before putting this piece of junk down. The author must be completely oversexed because it comes through his writing. Either that or he doesn't have much respect for women. Every female character acts like a brainless bimbo and bares their chest and the men ogle them. Even the responding officer makes a comment about how sexy the dead decapitated murder victim was. So disgusting. The responding officer made every mistake known to man when being the first officer on a murder scene. I only spent .33 cents on this book due to it being sold at a used book sale. It was .33 cents more than I should have paid for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not My Favorite Of His, But Has A Great Ending","review":"This one turned out to be much better than I thought it was going to be. The twist at the end certainly took me by surprise! I honestly didn't see it coming and I think it saved the book as a whole, since it seemed a bit more crass than the other Laymon books that I have read. Still, all of his books are fast reads and definitely entertaining page-turners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Detailed Human Physiology","review":"This is a very detailed book on human physiology.

This makes cleaning alot easier for me. I can't get on my knees to scrub anything and I have to take breaks about every 15 minutes or so and I think this steamer is a blessing for those of us who have mobility problems.I bought it direct from the company because I couldn't find it anywhere else.

I bought the product based on the lies I was told by their customer service person. It was quite obvious that they did not want to be bothered when I spoke to them. I was told that this product was molded to fit my truck and was pre-drilled. All I had to do was attach the fasteners, which never came with the product. The splash guards came with an empty bag. I wound up just buying the OEM part, which was a lot more expensive, but lived up to its reputation. When I emptied the box that these guards came in all I found was two blank pieces of plastic. If you have a farm truck or a jalopy, these guards will be acceptable, but if you have a nice vehicle, I recommend that you just spend the bucks and not degrade your truck."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH THE MONEY","review":"This product is cheaply made.

Those scenes were vivid and showed the seriousness of war through the eyes of civilians who could do little but try to get out of the way. I recently came across my copy and reread it, this time paying more attention to the actual battle scenes and am even more impressed with the story. Coyle chose to write the story of one unit's battles and what they face in fighting World War III, creating an intimate look at what war means to the people who actually fight it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best war novels out there","review":"Team Yankee is quite an interesting book. Harold Coyle describes a war between the Warsaw Pact and NATO in 1985 in great detail. But don't expect this to be like Red Storm Rising, this book focuses entirely on small unit tactics with zero politics. The action starts immediately at the beginning of the second chapter, and it never stops.The battles are realistic and the tactics are described in great detail in the text as well as the maps that are in the book. The maps really help you figure what's going on and what platoons are moving where, etc.The story focuses on Captain Sean Bannon of Team Yankee, a military unit deployed in Germany during the Cold War. When war breaks out in 1985, he must lead his unit to victory. There are several other main characters including several other tankers, and an infantry sergeant. This is definetly a book you don't want to miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic modern warfare","review":"Just an incredibly interesting, smart and realistic novel about a potential modern warfare - that is, before the east block collapsed !You just have to read it one shot !"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best He's Ever Written!","review":"This is a serious sleep stealer as well. I was spellbound by it's depth and intensity, with beleivable characters and plot, and a feeling of apprehension as to what was going to go wrong next, which is just about as realistic as it gets. Mr Coyle has written a great one here, too bad some of the following books he wrote did not measure up. If I wanted a soap opera I would tune in \\"Days of our Lives\\" He should stick to the hard hitting action packed stuff he seems so good at here. I own most of his soft covers, but stopped buying them because they were in my opinion going downhill fast. I actually started using my library card instead! To me, this is heracy!

And, man,it is certainly realistic! The battle scenes on the ground are well told, and easy to follow, complete with battle maps and an explanation of all the symbols and terms used. The descriptions of soldiers in combat are also very realistic; once again Coyle shows his knowledge of ground warfare has been well researched. And it also shows that war can screw people up, especially the families of those who are in combat.

However, the book is not simply a beautiful retelling of the same story portrayed again and again by author after author. Marion Zimmer Bradley, unlike many writers, put great effort into her research to produce her book to produce something believably authentic, yet she is not a slave to the traditional retellings. The main character, Morgaine, is depicted is as a likeable human with good intentions rather than the one-dimensional cardboard cut out of an evil witch that Hollywood favours so much. The other characters are similarly given a depth that many interpretations seem to lack - each character has its flaws that make them more relatable for the reader. Marion was a brilliant writer and amazing woman; it was a great tragedy that the world has lost her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mists of Avalon by Marion Zimmer Bradley","review":"This book has a good mix of fantasy and real historical significance to the pagan religions and their comparisons to Christanity. I beleive that Ms. Bradley expertly pieced together history and fantasy to make this an interesting book set in the time of King Arthur. It was entertaining and let me see a new perspective on the King Arthur legend. It was very different from any other King Arthur legends I know of though. Still, I recommened this book for anyone interested in the mystical if not fantasy-like side of religion. She is a great storyteller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful World of Women","review":"This book is absolutely wonderful. I love the fact that the women in this book are so real. They are all flawed, yet they are all perfect. This is definetly a book for women who are tired of male dominated visions of women in fantasy. The charaters are so rich, deep, and complex. If Camelot had ever been a real place, this is surely how things really happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this Book!!!!!","review":"This is one of those books that you Can Not put down!!!

You'll notice that Marion Zimmer Bradley doesn't quite keep to the myth and often goes off in her own directions, but that's what makes this story so interesting and unique. It has a flavor to it that is hard to resist. Once you start, you won't want to stop! Take my word for it, this book is one in a million and definately worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A contrary opinion","review":"I feel like I'm swimming against the tide writing anegative review of this book, but in all honesty Ididn't really enjoy it. I found the characters to bevery one-dimensional. All of the Christians were stupid,dull and brutish. All of the goddess worshippers weregentle, wise and interesting (unless they became Christiansin which case they became stupid, dull and brutish).The idea of writing an Arthurian romance from a women'sperspective was a good one, and some of Ms. Bradley'stwisting of the legend was well done, so I haven't givenit the lowest review.

It is a very long, comprehensive read and requires a lot of diligence and effort on the part of the reader to remember names and places.I enjoyed the movie as well although the two were quite different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goddess Worshipper's Rejoice","review":"If you are a Witch, pagan, magician, feminist, or just a plain tree-hugging dirt worshipper, this is the book for you!Marion Zimmer Bradley (MZB)was a practicing Witch and Priestess, and she knew the Goddess. This amazing retelling of the Arthurian legends shows that women and the Goddess played just as much a role in the course of events as Merlin did. \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" gives hope and a tale of inspirational wonder to any who know the Goddess.MZB's life as a Witch and Priestess also gave her the incredible talent of putting the use of magick, and the workings of psychic energy onto pen and paper. Although there are many books out there today on Witchcraft and magick, this book offers a special glimpse into the potential ancient mysteries.This book is for all those who knew in their hearts that Morgan Le Fey was never an evil sorceress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book","review":"If you love fantasy, but hate that the characters are almost exclusively male this is the book for you! I have always loved the King Arthur legend and this version made it so much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Warning For The Men","review":"While there's no question in my mind that Bradley is an astounding writer, I urge all men, especially fans of the cold and brutal legends of King Arthur to NOT read this book. Bradley takes romantic reworking to new and rather appaling levels in this retelling from the women's point of view. As an example, she somehow manages to make every rape, including the one of Arthur by his sister, into a beautiful, romantic affair. As an aside, it's notable that much of the book is almost documentary worthy descriptions of Wicca and its practices. Books with this much religious sympathizing of Christian practices are classifiable as \\"Christian Fantasy\\". I actually started to feel preached to after several hundred pages of it.Men, read with caution. Or stick with Malory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely overrated","review":"I can't understand why there are so many positive reviews of this. I began reading this book at the suggestion of a friend. I anticipated stories about the powerful women behind the men of Arthurian legend but instead found it to be more a typical story of the chauvinism of the era. I found myself constantly frustrated with Igraine as she constantly doubted her own powers of \\"Sight\\" and questioned her own judgement and allowed herself to be pushed in directions she was at first unwilling to go. All right already! She was so wishy-washy as was every other female character and the men were just oafs. Thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting point of view, but boring...","review":"I have read many arthurian legends...from Morte'de Arthur to all the way to Isolde...and so when I heard about this book...i had to read it...but i was terribly diasppointed...the book is about 900 pages...but even when i got to the 300th page...i found no climax...or even a hint of it. The story seemed to drag on forever...and i found myself just reading it so that i could be done with it...(i can never put a book down once i start>>>unfortunately...)If you know the arthurian legend all too well...like me...than u will be disappointed because you end up anticipating every move of the author..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional!","review":"Although of course it predates it, Bradley's \\"Mists\\" reminds me of an Arthurain version of \\"The Red Tent\\". The story flows effortlessly, drawing the reader in from beginning to end. It is truly a \\"storytellers\\" book, with rich details, characters who evolve, and some unexpected twists and turns. One aspect which particularly surprised me is how Bradley created a medieval feeling without getting overly bogged down in medieval language, wording, etc. Mostly, I found the writing to be fantastic. At times, for example, I was astonished by how subtly Bradley created a male character to mirror each female character. When we see how Gwen rails against her lack of freedom, we get the same counterpoint in Arthur. However, I found the dichotomies in the book occasionally obvious, and the last 1/6th of the book seemed to drag, probably because I knew what was going to happen.I recommend this book highly!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best I've Read, & I've read a lot!","review":"All I can say is that I am normally not a fan of Aurthur/Camelot stories. The book was loaned to me and my friend kept pestering me to read it. I picked it up and was hooked within 5 minutes! Then as some other reviewers have said, I couldn't put it down!The story is compelling, thought provoking and while you may not like all the characters, you will certainly feel something for them, whether its admiration or hate.I read the book before I saw the \\"TV Movie\\" and while the movie was acceptable, the book draws you in, the movie could not.If you have nothing to do but read for a couple of days, READ IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The War Between Pagans and Chistians","review":"A great book for the Pagan and christian alike.

Morgaine, the protagonist, was weak, confused, amoral and inconsistently drawn. And she was about the best of the lot. Bradley hid her frail characters behind a mist of voodoo magic and New Age mistique... Peel that away, and there wasn't much of a story left.On the bright side, at least \\"Mists\\" wasn't riddled with grammatical errors. (However, in my view, removing a good 500 pages from the book would have been a wise move on the editing front.)In a nutshell: Hopeless, disturbing, confusing and dark... And far, far too long.Honestly, I'd rather have a root canal than slog through \\"Mists of Avalon\\" again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs some polish to be lackluster","review":"Let me start as so many other reviewers have: by saying that the ideas behind this book were intriguing, but the actual book fell fall short of its promise. And now for my responses to the standard topics.Length: Could have been cut nearly in half. Writing style: Rich and descriptive, but often too much (see above). Historical inaccuracy: Didn't much bother me. It's a fairy tale; it doesn't have to be perfect. Religious inaccuracy: See above, and add enough ignorance on my part that I didn't really notice it. Anti-Christian bias: I found a lot of the pagan opinions on Christianity to be interesting and thought-provoking, and the fact that they were as petty as the Christians more or less erased the bias in my mind. Characters: Loved 'em when they weren't scheming or being tragically obsessive (about a quarter of the book). The idea that this book spawns life-changing bursts of feminism in its readers scares me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a feminist book","review":"People who consider this a feminist book are mistaken. Bradley's depiction of women in \\"Mists\\" is insulting to say the least. Women in \\"Mists\\" are either manipulative harpies or whining fools. All are small-minded, all are insecure, and all are incredibly self-centered.I am so tired of this idea that to be a feminist means that you dislike men. Since when is a \\"strong woman\\" a woman who puts down and manipulates men at every turn? I have better words for women like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This a disappointing book. It focuses way too much of its energy on the female participents. Without the male characters there isn't a legend to write about. I love strong women as much as the next guy, but the entire story isn't about women. I also don't like all the focus on the battle between the mother goddess and Christianity. By the time Arthur came on the scene the people of Britain had embrassed Christianity. Also I don't think there is any evidence to support a mother goddess cult in Britain. Also Miss Bradley portrays the Druids as these nice smart guys. In reality they were just as pagan as everyone else. She doesn't even touch on the fact that there is evidence that the Druids performed human sacrifices. The book is also way to sappy. It almost reads like a really long soap opera. Other than that it was a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tell me a story not an agenda......","review":"I rarely every stop reading a book. I slog through them because I feel committed. This book made me want to not only stop reading but give up on fantasy. I've read the Arthurian Legends in their many incarnations and wanted a feminine point of view. The story could never get through the agenda of how terrible Christians were. When in the beginning nuns were discribed as the \\"slaves\\" of priests I knew it was going to be bad. The reality was that the convent was female world where women promoted learning and controlled their lives, especially in remote parts of Britain. Then there were the historical inacuracies. When reading a blending of history and fantasy I give a lot of room for playing with facts, but some were so bad they made me scream. It made Dan Brown look like a rigid, fact geek."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated tripe","review":"The popularity of this book continues to amaze me. Like many books written to make a particular point, the author overreaches and undermines her purpose by using a heavy hand. If you want a more balanced Arthur, try Parke Godwin's Firelord."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very unfair portrayal of Christianity","review":"I have heard so many good things about this book, but I didn't like it as much as I thought I would. It disappointed me in providing a totally unsympathetic, bigoted view of Christianity. It is true that the early Roman Catholics were harsh and intolerant, but the principles of the Church always were full of insight, intelligence, beauty, truth, and love. This book largely contributes to the stereotype of Catholics as drab and unreasonably demanding. If modern people would just look past all of this, they would find a truly amazing faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shipped in perfect shape","review":"No need to say more. The book arrived well packed, in early than specified time in perfect shape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad, truly sad...","review":"I will not go into a lengthy critique of why and how this book gets one star...this was more than adequately provided by other critiques. Let me just say that it was truly a pitiful depiction of the Arthurian myth and a shameful presentation of women, and it is my intention to burn it with the rising sun at Beltaine as an affirmation and celebration of life and of the Sacred Feminine."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Base of Feminism","review":"I think it is true that without this book, to days feminists wouldn't be fighting for equal rights. The Mists of Avalon is pretty much the base of today's feminism. And yes, I am a guy.But my thoughts on the book are as follows:It was very entertaining; it took me weeks to read it but I did and it took even more weeks to reread it again and again. I'm working on my 5th time. Lone and behold that I have read other material in between.There are a couple slow parts and a few confusing mumbo jumbos but other than that it was delightful.

I like only a few fantasy books/series, and love a lot less. This was definitely not one of the books that impacted me.Although the book starts out well, it grows increasingly stale after that. The Arthurian legends have been incorporated into so many fantasy books that a book has to really execute fresh ideas in order to stand out from the crowd. None of the characters are particularly well drawn either.If you really love Arthurian legends and can't get enough of them (is there anyone really like that) maybe you might want to read this book. Otherwise, i wouldn't recommend it, to fantasy fans or newcomers."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"I read this book last year and I loved it so, so, so much that I am reading it again. The character I liked best was Gwenhwyfar (believe me), and I think her a great woman, a strong one, despising some bad things she did. Morgaine too made bad things and anyone complained about that! But, anyway, the 2 are the best and I care for them very much. I gladly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"*yawn*","review":"after 20 pages of describing the sun set, i gave it up.

Then I at least got to watch Michael Vartan in bed. The book after the movie was too long, too slow, and followed very much the same story. The movie had beautiful imagery and was other-worldly. So I stopped reading and watched Alias so I could watch Michael Vartan again. But if you want to read a LONG book with great characters, read the Time Traveler's Wife instead. It is a much better use of your time and portrays a much better love story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big book-little reward","review":"I read this book as a member of a book club. It is very long, 900+ pages and I did not find it worth the effort. Other women in my club really liked it, but I found it depressing and dark.

I was unable to finish it. I sloggedthrough 3/4ths of it before giving up. It was quite awhile ago so I can't go into too many specifics but i do remember flat,unsympathetic, un-likable characters. The women all seemed to view themselves as victims. Strong women, even if victimizedusually don't have the time to wallow in self pity as these characters seemed to. It all became too irritating & honestly too boringfor me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is feminism?","review":"I read this years ago and while I don't exactly want to fling it across the room, I was extremely let down. It is vivid and the characters are memorable. Unfortunately what I remember about them is that they are all shambling wrecks of humanity. The main character is weak and indecisive. She allows herself to be manipulated and blown by whatever comes, never making a stand, never deciding what she truly believes or acting to get what she wants. I am mystified that this is somehow seen as feminist."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Book in What became a Wonderful Series","review":"Marion Zimmer was born in Albany, NY, on June 3, 1930, and married Robert Alden Bradley in 1949. Mrs. Bradley received her B.A. in 1964 from Hardin Simmons University in Abilene, Texas, then did graduate work at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1965-67. Writing for over 4 decades, she is best known for her Darkover science fantasy series and her Avalon series. She also edited anthologies for 14 years and published Marion Zimmer Bradley's FANTASY Magazine.She died in Berkeley, California on September 25, 1999, four days after suffering a major heart attack.This book is a re-telling of the Arthurian legend with the plot focusing on Morgaine or as she is often called Morgan Le Fay. The author portrays her as a woman who is fighting for her Celtic culture in a world that is slowly but surely turning towards Christianity. Britain is turning from the old beliefs and the druidic way of life and it seems that nothing can stop it . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful and rich perspective of the arthurian leyend","review":"The mists of avalon is one of my favorite books. I've read all vertions of the arthurian leyend i've been able to find, and this is the most complete and explicit one (in my humble opinion). But this is not only a book, not only a novel, this story offers a way of seeing the world much differently and magicky than how he oftenly use to. I'm a celtic fan, i've been studiyng the celts for more than a quarter of my life and i had never seen a story so richly performed. In an esotheric library they put this book under \\"iniciatic novel\\", now, I know why. I LOVED IT! it's not only for celtic lovers, or arthurian or middle-age lovers.

To read about the realm of King Arthur from a woman's point of view was unique and beautiful"},{"rating":"2","title":"A romantic's romance","review":"This book I read and re-read when I was a 20-something romantic. It is a feminist re-telling of the Arthurian legend, from the point of view mainly of the women, who in the 'traditional' tellings are either subsidiary or 'distaff', as in sinister or evil-doing beings. As a librarian I found high school girls were the main audience for this book, and budding pagan feminists. If I had reviewed it 20 years ago I would have said it was my favourite book at that time. It is still on my shelves, but I have read better since, hence the 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you, Marion Zimmer Bradley","review":"This book changed my life forever.

Good bye, Marion, and thank you. Thank you for everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to my taste...","review":"This book is well written, but too long. Perhaps as a male I need some more action in my books, but this book really could have benefited from having about 200 pages cut out.

I must say that I found the religious argumentation quite interesting, but overall it was not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought it would never end...","review":"I selected this book for a class I was taking about \\"Medieval in the Modern.\\" It took me, someone who can devour a book in a day, almost two months to read. And I'm not blaming my slow plodding through the book on the length. I'm sure if I was interested, I could have whipped through it. Unfortunately, I wasn't. The story is a retelling of the Arthurian legends from the women's viewpoints, namely Morgaine and Gwenhwyfar. I often felt like the author was trying to make a page quota, because there were hundreds of pages of dialogue (lots of inter) that could have been taken out. The beginning bored me. The middle bored me further. The end picked up and got me interested for a while. However, overall, I was pretty disappointed. I don't think I'll be picking up anymore of the author's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated It.","review":"Maybe this is meant to be a woman's book and that is why I don't like it (I am a guy).

HOW could one person slaughter Arthur so badly? It's the absolute worst representation of the story I love that I have ever read. It's an abomination!

The plot was paper thin and mainly consisted of people wandering around angsting and rehashing the same arguments over and over. 50 pages could have been cut from this book and no one would notice a thing. This book was utter tripe.If you like Arthurian ledgends, do a search for Diana L. Paxon instead.

I hope that the world doesn't believe that all feminists think the way that THE MISTS OF AVALON suggests that they should."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Perspective is unfurled","review":"Marion Zimmer Bradley has got to be my favorite author. The hate, the love, and the compassion shown through the eyes of Morgaine really got me thinking of how women were of little signifigance at the time. I cried, I rejoiced, I resented.

I recommend this book to anyone who is willing enough to witness a magical story through the eyes of the unimportant."},{"rating":"2","title":"A striking tale","review":"The Mists of Avalon is a powerful and interesting re-telling of King Arther's court. The book gives a very unique point of view because it was the first to be narrated by the women of Camelot. Much more exciting then the TNT movie, this novel is exciting, poetic, and a definite page turner. I would recumend it to anybody with an imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mists of Avalon","review":"This is the first book I've read that concentrates on the Arthurian legends from the viewpoint of the women involved. I found the perspectives of Morgaine as the priestess of the old Druid religion and Gwenhyfar as the champion of the new Christian religion fascinating. While neither is presented as all good or all bad, I think Christianity comes out with perhaps a worse name than it deserves. Nevertheless the book was a compelling page-turner and the attention to detail of the period was excellent. I look forward to reading more of Marion Zimmer Bradley's works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"This lengthy book is tedioius and uninspired. The style is awkward and the recurring italics are destracting. I have never seen so much brooding packed in a single book. Do we need to know all of Morgaine's thoughts?The characters are cardboard cutouts and love scenes exude no passion. I fail to see what so many people think is so great about this book. I approached it with a lot of goodwill, almost all of it dissipated by page 60, then I read on a bit more and that was that. I continued to turn the pages, reading passages here and there, but it was the same thing. I found no new insights here about Christianity or the pagan beliefs of pre-Christian Britain.

Everyone has their own weaknesses, especially Morgaine, the central character. I have to say that I was reluctant to read a book that contained so much paganism in it, but I quickly came to understand exactly what paganism is.

It is a rich tapestry interwoven with many threads of gold and silver--the land, the conflicts, the people. I believe this book should be considered as an important part of the literature in the legends of Author. If you haven't read this book, read it!

However, when I began to read this, I loved it. I read the entire 900 or so pages in four days. The characters just pull you in... This book is also good if you do not have a background about King Arthur (even though these stories are quite different from Sir Malory's). The characters are memorable and interesting... even though by the end, you'll feel like wringing Gwenhyfar's little neck!

The point of view has always been that Morgaine was out for 'revenge' and that's why she seduced her half brother Arthur. Ms. Bradley's version is believable, and plausable. The saga of the romance between Lancelet and Gwenhwyfar is breathlessly romantic and heartbreaking. The book could stand on its own as 'simply' a romance novel. However, it is so much more than that. How the lives are interwoven, and the relationship between Avalon and Camelot, are detailed. There is also, if you take the time to notice it, a commentary on early Christianity and the insistence that it be the 'one true' religion. Ms. Bradley has obviously done her historical homework, and for this reader that is very important. This is an enthralling book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure inspiration","review":"I believe this is the best book Bradley has ever written--or is ever likely to write. It is absolutely inspired with the kind of writer's magic that only comes from writing from the heart. A story like this cannot be coaxed from the head alone. The interweaving of the characters, the struggle between old beliefs and new, the historic timeline all dovetail beautifully to create a tapestry of myth, magic and emotion. I wish I had written this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great book, lots of detail","review":"I love this book, just reread it after several years. I recommend this book to anyone who likes historical novels"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book","review":"I first read this back in 2000 and it's been a favorite of mine ever since. I bought this for a friend who I knew would love it. There is so much depth, I highly suggest it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well written book. Need I say more?","review":"I wouldn't need to waste words describing how wonderful this book is. There is plenty of that in the past 173 or so reviews. Although the length of the book may become a burden, anyone who can't take it might as well missed out on an epic tale. She has told a story of such immense size is a very short book. And I mean short. All 1000 pages of it. In just the first 300 pages I felt as if I've read a book twice or even three times a long. I'm not commenting on its lengthiness. In fact, I'm amazed at Marion Zimmer Bradley's ability to put so much into such a small book. This is the first of her books that I have read and I have thoroughly enjoyed it. I would believe you would too, but that is as always up to you to decide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastick","review":"This book is one of the most well written and enchanting pieces of literature that I have ever read. The characters draw you into the story and the plot entangles you in it self. This was the first MZB book I ever read, at first the thickness of the book was daunting, but I was determined to read it, and boy am I glad that I did! Since then, I have read every book by MZB that I can get my hands on but this by far is her finest achievement. From the moment I picked it up I couldn't set it down until I reached the end, and even then I wanted more, an enchanting read!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than 5 stars","review":"The BEST book!!!

I hope this doesn't give too much away, but I thought the womans perspective to the story of King Author to be really refreshing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"The Mists of Avalon is a truly delightful, enchanting book for those who enjoy Arthurian Legend. Alas, though I am only on about page 405, I just had to write a review. Morgaine(also known as Morgana Le Fay in Brian Froud's books and many other legends) is a priestess of Avalon, or was. This book is basicly like a study book of religion and Arthurian Legend, so you can learn alot from it. I loved the movie, but I have to say that the book is so much better because of the details left out. The only BAD thing is Gwenhwyfar. I know that sometimes she is right and I actually sometimes agree with what she says, but she is such a stubborn brat. She always has to(and does) get her way. But she has her own personality. Well, I recommend this book for fantasy lovers, because it is a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written but upsetting","review":"I got approx. 1/3 of the way through the book and had to put it down. The lies and incest were just a little too much for me. I was also disheartened by the story which I thought would be one of great women. These women while powerful were victims of the goddess. I did not like this book. Although it was very well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Singsong story-telling and fraught with error","review":"This book has long been recommended to me by friends for its wonderful story and character development. While the first-half of the book is masterfully plot-driven, it is not enough to cover for editoral mistakes. Further in the novel, the hypocrisy of the characters really grated on my nerves. Bradley quite obviously hated Christianity, but after reading this novel, how could anyone ever consider neo-paganism seriously? She completely destroyed her own thinly-veiled objectives. Additionally, the characters were not really developed at all and popped in and out of the story-line like soap-opera characters, without attention to previous plot. Not glad i spent the time on this as my first foray into Arthurian legend. NOT RECOMMEDED!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother--not worth it!","review":"I have long loved Bradley's 'Darkover' novels, but as an Arthurian scholar I was sorely diappointed in her treatment of my favorite legends. Rather than retelling the legend from a feminine (ie: Morgana/Viviane viewpoint) she has produced a pointless soap-opera of pseudo-Arthuriana and bad paganism. If you are into good Arthurian fiction try Mary Stewart's \\"Crystal Cave\\" series or Gillian Bradshaw's \\"Hawk of May\\"/\\"Kingdom of Summer.\\" If you are a budding neo-pagan and you want \\"real druids\\" (as so many fans of this book seem to think it has) try a history book or face the fact that this is both bad history and bad fantasy. Try Parke Godwin or Persia Woolley for good fantasy with good historical background. Go back to Darkover, Marion, and try again--this book was not worth the paper it was printed on and the best hope for those who liked it is they may grow up eventually and discover real Arthuriana."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book Full of Weak Characters","review":"The first time I read this book, I was impressed by the depth of knowledge it revealed but at the same time I couldn't stand the way some of the characters were portrayed. The great King Arthur was actually weak and let himself be led around by the petty Gwenhwyfar, who was too dense to see anything past her precious Lancelot and her blind opinions about her religion. This book seemed to include men solely for the purpose of being used by the women. Although this book provided an interesting point of view on the Arthurian Legends including its relationship to Avalon, I highly recommend that you read anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"And the fairy yawned...","review":"A slow read indeed. While one can appreciate the amount of research that went into writing this tale, it's easy to overlook that because it's so damned boring. The legends of Arthur as told through the women involved and the magical lands they come from is an interesting idea and had potential to be an interesting story. But Zimmer-Bradley's writing is dull, repetitive and flat. The characters lack dimensionality and the A to B mode of story telling does not serve her well. If you are really into the Arthurian legends you may want to check it out, otherwise I'd recommend passing this one by."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok but definatly long winded!","review":"this story was ok, just ok. it was pritty dry as far as i was concerned. and it was very much a book more for girls than for guys although not dramaticaly so. it was just boreing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bottom line: do not let children read this","review":"there is a child molestation scene that my daughter read at 12, she spent the rest of the day cringing and she had nightmares about it for months and was afraid of \\"the sinewy old hunter\\".

Maybe I hate it cuz I'm only 13, but I have a high reading level, so its not that this book is too hard, its too boring. Here's a summary.At the begining, Morgaine's mom falls in love with a guy even though she's married. Her husband dies, she and the guy have a kid who's Arthur. Morgaine gets sent to Avalon to be a priestess and meets Lancelot and falls in love. Morgaine ends up having a kid w/ her brother, but she doesn't know that he's her brother. Lancelot is in love with Gwenevier who's married to Arthur, but still flirts with Morgaine and plays with her emotions. Gwenevier is baiscially a barbie because she's an air head that's afraid to be outside walls, even in the courtyard she's freaked.The book is the most horrible one on the planet. Don't read it unless you like being bored. Trust me, it isn't worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"will it ever end!?!?!?!?","review":"I had to read this book for enlish honors two, and I was so mad at my teahcers cause I thought this book moved waaaaaaaaay too slow. The book could have been much shorter. Some things just weren't necessary. Half of the information she provided us with didnt have anything to do with the final out come. This book was too long and boring and I pitty all sophmores that have to read it over summer vacation, because it pretty much ruined mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"To different","review":"I read this book for a school book report and i found that it was completely different from the other versions of the Arthurian legneds. I saw the book to be too flodded with feministic views. The reason I say this is becasue Bradely i felt was trying to make the women seem important in this. I just dont like how she changed the story. Im not saying that women aren't important or anything like that, im just saying you dont change a legend like this to make women seem more important."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings Mythic Characters to Life","review":"Marion Zimmer Bradley created a masterpiece in this book. She manages to breathe new life into the Arthurian characters. The men and, especially, the women in this book are vivid, alive, and some of the most believable characters I've ever had the pleasure to read. The magic is beautiful without being too over the top. This is one of the few books that I was sad to finish...I didn't want the story to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the younger Generation","review":"...I'm about 200 pages away from the end.

This book consists of an intricate introduction followed by a fascinating plot which ends with a captivating end. From beginning to end there is no real way one can describe the pleasure of this reading experience. Any reader regardless of whether or not they admire science-fiction novels well most definitely love this book. The Mists of Avalon portrays the role of women in the Authorian legends, a role rarely seen in films of today. This one novel does great justice to women as \\"molders\\" of the world, and gives new meaning to the word mother. Overall there is no one who cannot find joy in reading this outstanding peace of literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best reads, EVER!","review":"If you love Camelot, witchcraft, and a spellbinding read, this is the book for you. Based in Arthurian times, \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" takes you through the rise and fall of King Arthur in a manner that's easy to follow and hard to put down. The thickness of the book is daunting, but you'll find as you curl up with it over a nice, warm mug of tea that you won't want to stop reading about Arthur, Merlin, Vivane, and Morgana. I sure hope you pick it up because this book is a must for anyone who ever believed in Camelot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelieveable","review":"It is amazing how much one book can change your perspective. I was given a copy of \\"Mists\\" by my english teacher, senior year in high school. I tried to read it several times, but each time I found myself having trouble getting into the story. Finally, after reading everything in my library, I sat down and forced myself to read it. This time the book grabbed me and hurled me into a world that I never realized existed before this book. I found myself reading about 50-75 pages a night. Sitting up until all hours of the morning reading, looking at my clock and saying to myself \\"Okay, it's 4am. How long is the next chapter? Can I finish it and still get enough sleep?\\" The characters are so real and Mrs Bradley paints such a vivid picture of the lands and the times, that you almost feel like you ARE the characters. You share their hopes, fears, desires, and most important, you feel their pain. Any book that makes me feel the characters emotions is a special book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written, but distasteful socio-religious agenda","review":"Marion Zimmer Bradley's novel of Arthurian Britain is undoubtably well-written, but is made one step above repugnant by the heavy-handed feminist, anti-christian story lines. The only men not condemned by Zimmer-Bradley are simpering druids who allow themselves to be dominated by the oh-so-wise priestesses of Avalon. And every Christian is portrayed as either a brutish, opressive lout (if male) or a submissive yet jealous shrew (if female). Arthur himself, far from being a heroic warrior king, is portrayed as a weakling torn between his Christian (in name only) wife, and his pagan sister. If you're looking for Arthurian historical fantasy that is not filled with ridiculous neo-modern tripe, go read Stephen Lawhead's excellent Pendragon cycle."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh...","review":"As you can probably tell by other reviews, most people either hate this book or love it. I'm of the former school. While I acknowledge its importance as a \\"feminist-revisionist\\" approach to Arthurian myth, I'm just not a content-over-form type of reader. This book is abominably didactic, not to mention **very** poorly written. The dialogue is horrible. MZB's prose is stilted & amateurish (at best) & the whole thing just reeks of that cheesy neo-Druid goddess-worship that calls itself feminism. And those who accuse MZB of religious bias are correct. The anti-Xian stuff is a given, I think, but expected considering the book's subject matter. I wasn't bothered by it. However, Bradley is also pretty harsh on atheists & agnostics (like myself)-- in fact, she's pretty much harsh on anyone who doesn't subscribe to a very specific sect of paganism... Anyhow, there's better stuff out there, but if you're into all that pagan-\\"feminism\\" stuff, this is probably the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting waste of time","review":"After enough years of being told by various friends that I should read this book I finally did so over a long break. While it was vaguely interesting enough to hold my attention until the end (with a lot of skim reading and skipping around) I did not find it to be the life affirming, Goddess invoking be-all-and-end-all novel that so many have found it to be. I mean, have they not made it all the way to the end? By the time the tome draws itself to a conclusion, all of the \\"evil Christians\\" have been absolved and the \\"pious pagans\\" brought to shame and obscurity. Huh. I don't get the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not quite worth all the hype.","review":"While this is a truly interesting take on Arthurian legend, it is not worth all the acclaim that it gets from its readers. The characters are all self-serving and shallow. I was unable to finish this book, due to my disgust at Gwenivere's mistrust and narrow mindedness. To all those who make the claim that nothing better in Arthurian legend has ever been written, I suggest that they go out and read some Arthurian legend in order to back their claim."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Book itself is much better!!!","review":"Ok, so I saw the DVD first, read the book book second, and then downloaded the abridged version thru iTunes. I definately recommend reading the book first, watching the DVD second, and then hearing the audiobook last. The audiobook starts with Morgaine being brought to Avalon. It completely leaves out the whole part of Igraine and Golois and then Igraine and Uther. This audiobook is a bit of a disappointment. I would definately consider buying the unabridged version of this (if they made it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convinced me I am really a faerie","review":"Have you ever had premonitions of the future?

Strength and courage, love and compassion, understanding and tolerance. There are definitely lessons to be learned in this retelling of the Arthurian Saga."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am mortal","review":"The hours I spent trying to read this book will not be returned to me at the end of my life. Those were the thoughts that raced through my mind as I read past page 100 on the third attempt to finish this book. I am very sympathetic to the concept of strong women and a review of the Arthur legend in that light. Which is perhaps one of the reasons why I was so disappointed. The women seemed feeble to me, and I could not spot any real drive - which I really think you should be able to after 100 pages of a book. So, with the lack of motivation inside the book, my own motivation outside the book got lost. Life is short, and this book is long. If you are not into feeble women's court intrigues, this book ain't for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A haunting retelling of the Arthurian saga","review":"The Mists of Avalon is a beautifully written novel chronicling the lives and loves of the famous women of Arthurian legend. Morgaine of the Fairies, eternally misunderstood by conventional sources, tells her recollection of the events leading to the rise and fall of the High King of Camelot. Surrounded by a rich cast of characters, including Arthur, Gwenhwyfar, Lancelot, and the mysterious Lady of the Lake, the tragic heroine recounts her heavy destiny as a disgraced priestess of Avalon fighting against the Christianizing forces overtaking her beloved Britannia. Feminist in ideology and spiritual in nature, the novel is genuinely influenced by the personal life and beliefs of author Marion Zimmer Bradley. The only slight flaw is the inconsistent pacing of the story towards the latter half. Though arguably more fascinating, the heavily plot-driven conclusion contrasts sharply with the deliberate and contemplative flow of early tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing for a Fantasy Fan","review":"With this book, I found that it moved along effortlessly from the viewpoint of Igraine, through to Viviane, then Morgaine and Morgause, leaving me at the end with an impressively wide perspective of the events of about 50 years. At the end I found that, although I could not remember the journey, I knew where I'd been. This is an amazing book for anyone interested in King Arthur and the knights of the round table. If you were a fan of Tamora Pierce when you were younger, this is also for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"still one of the best fantasy novels out there","review":"a well researched Arthurian novel with its emphasis on the socio-politico-spiritual status of women in the British Isles at the onset of the Dark Ages, especially with respect to the complete and abject dominance of the male culture over women's lives, which effectively denied a woman's basic human rights for the twenty centuries following the establishment Roman rule in Europe......"},{"rating":"2","title":"reconnecting to the mist","review":"wonderful to have this copy of Mists of Avalon in better shape than mine was in"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, but good","review":"Although this version of the Camelot saga is a little different from what I am used to, it is very well written and VERY creative. The author did a great job of describing every aspect of this fantasy world without going overboard on everything. It does seem a little bit like some sort of cult-culture, but it was an interesting change from the normal vaque descriptions of fantasy worlds in novels. One of the only complaints I have is the descriptions of Morgaine's, er, um, \\"social activities\\". I don't mind a little bit of \\"laying\\" with each other, but it got really old and descriptions were really trashy; I felt like I was reading some high quality romance novel. Overall, the book was very intriguing and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a different, creative fantasy book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Arhturian Sage ever written","review":"This story is a definate must for any lover of Arthurian History. Marion Bradley's telling of the story of Arthur is unlike any I have ever read. The story is told mainly by Morgaine (Arthur's half sister) and Vivianne (Arthur's aunt)and the lady of the lake. They fight to keep the old (pagen) reigion alive in Brittania. Arthur is sworn to be the Defender of Avalon who will keep the Goddess alive in the world of men. Plans seem to go correctly until Arthur marry's Gwenyfar(a pious and Fanatical Christian) who manipualtes and persuades Arthur to Betray his oath to Avalon. Written in perfect detail the characters seem almost non-fictitious as this book will capture you relentressly from beginning to end. Their are not enough words in the world to describe the impact this book will leave."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've ever read!","review":"Bradley made a beautiful work writing this book. The characters are alive, and I really liked them. I loved the book so much I read it already 3 times since I bought him (and it was last year). I recommend it gladly and say that Gwenhwyfar is the best of all there! AMAZING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking","review":"Even though the characters referred to in this book lived centuries ago, their perspective still offers insight into the minds of females today. On the one hand you have Gwenhyfar, the subservient wife bound to a man who she cannot love, and on the other hand you have Morgaine, the independant and liberated woman who cannot find happiness. This book is one of the first retellings of history from a female perspective. The Mists of Avalon is a feminist masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Well, i must start out by saying that the Mists of Avalon is one of the best books i have ever read.

I would say this is one of Marion Zimmer Bradley's best book! She brings you right to the time period in what every fantasy lover wants. You will lose track of you own time. You will fall in love with Morgaine and her family. The magic with sweep you off your feet and leave you thirsty for more. Margaine learns as well as teaches you all about her life and others as a priestess. This is about as close to the Arthurian series as can get to truth. I totally recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful twist on a classic tale","review":"A wonderful twist on a classic tale - I've loved Arthurian legend since the first time I saw Camelot performed with Julie Andrews and Richard Harris. Ever since I've read any version of the story I could get my hands on - which have included various tellings form Arthur's point of views as well as Gueniverre, Lancelot and of course Merlin. The Mists of Avalon is by far one of my favorites because here the usual villan, Morgaine (a.k.a. Morgan La Fay) is the main character and are lead through the tale seeing it through her eyes which as you can imagine sheds a completely different light on things.

It took me several months to read, but when it was over I felt a pang of greif, as the charachters I felt i had know for years had dissapeared from the pages. But now, years after I read that book, they are still with me. I will wish to visit the fabulous Camelot, and make that ever more difficult journey to Avalon.

Unfortunately it is just too feministic and \\"mystical\\", with the characters worshipping the \\"Mother Goddess\\"; something that sounds just a bit familiar today.

Before this I had read T.H. White's The Sword In the Stone, which I also enjoyed, but this book expanded the legend so much, revealing a side of the story which is very rarely talked about. The imagery is lovely, and the story itself is fascinating.One note. In a catalouge a few months ago, I saw this book and the reccomended age was 11 up. This is not a book for 11 year olds. Mature 13 year olds at the youngest. Besides the fact that it is sexually explicit (not, however, in a pornographic way), the story itself is advanced.But overall, I wholeheartedly reccomend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reveiw for Kindle edition","review":"This book has tons of reviews, and it is a good, just fun read to escape for a while.

Out of all the Arthurian books that I have read, I loved this one the most. The Mists of Avalon is more about the females then the males in the story, it goes from Igraine to Morgaine, to Viviane, to Gwenhyfar, and Morgause. There is so much romance in this story, must of it tender and loving, some of it forced. This is not a book for younger audiences. It is an excellent refrence to the priestesses of Avalon, and the druids, not to mention Britain becoming a whole christian land, and the fight to make it not so.

'Pensees' is much more than an apology for the Christian faith, it is an investigation into and search for levels of temperance in all areas of human endeavor.

After reading through pensees i understand why he isnt praised everywhere and approached very reluctantly by the high caliber intellectuals. I have to admit that besides he is being boring to death, his thoughts are not without some insight, especially the non religious and shorter ones. He seem to be in a constant war against himself (and against Montaigne) by the christianity at his league.

However it really should come with something to protect the surface it sits on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great salt server and spoon","review":"I do tend to read other customer reviews before ordering. Some reviewers stated that this server was hard to hold and others said it did not have a thumb tab on top for opening, it does.I can't imagine a better product, unless the server was made out of solid stainless.

I couldn't find any solder or a weld joint.To echo the some of the other reviews this is most definitely NOT the one used by Alton Brown.

I normally kept my salt in a dish with a lid. Well one day I was watching YouTube episodes of, you guessed it, Good Eats, and saw this amazing salt server on the show. I decided that the one handed open mechanism was better that pulling off the lid every time I needed to salt something. It's stainless steel stand and glass dish look nice, but the best thing is the seal around the lid. The tiny spoon is adorable, but I probably won't use it much. The price was a lot cheaper at Amazon than anywhere else I looked. Most places were selling it for 25 or 30 dollars.

I don't want to sound ungrateful at all but this is not at all what I had expected it to be. It is NOT the same as the one Alton Brown uses on his show. Which is hard to see that from the photos (when I first looked at the item there was only 1 photo), now there are additional photos of the item which shows that is has basically no handle to hold the salt cellar. The seal on mine keeps the lid from closing and it looks like it is ajar and will allow moisture in. When I tried opening and closing, when holding by the \\"handle\\", the lid of the cellar I about dropped out of my hand. I don't know about anyone else but I'd prefer not to spill a bunch of salt and have broken glass in my kitchen, because of a poorly designed item.

Since the handle is flat, it is difficult to pick up the server and then open the lid with one hand. The secret is to place the thumb on the lid tab with the fingers under the handle, and then open the lid by pressing the thumb down before, or at the same time as, you lift the server. This is very stable and you can then carry and use the server easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"BETTER THAN THE OLDER MODELS MUCH BETTER.","review":"THESE NEW SALT CONTAINERS ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THE FIRST ONE I PURCHASED 3 YRS AGO.

A very noticeable difference in mine is that the clear rubber flange that rings the inside of the top has half a dozen small rubber anchors that push through holes on the top of the metal lid. While I'm sure this helps keep the rubber flange from falling out, the rubber nubs that are visable on the top and are NOT pictured on the online image look stupid.

For those of you who may be misunderstanding the concepts and experiments in physics, this book will help you. It mentions a topic more than once and allows one to understand it.

This book is the revised version, as there have been many, many changes to our knowledge of astronomy and physics since the 1960's. The book is interesting, fun to read, and closely follows Gamow's style. While you may not fully understand a certain concept from the chapter where it is introduced (like time/space relativity), you get more information and examples in later chapters that help to get the big picture. It is recommended for 11 year-olds and up, but most adults interested in physics would benefit from reading this. There are some math equations, of course, but they are there mostly for the person who needs to know why and how scientists make their deductions, and do not necessarily take away from the concepts if you don't understand them."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Hollywood Squares\\" Goes to the Movies","review":"Twentieth Century Fox and Warner Bros. pooled their resources to create a perversely watchable disaster.

Inexplicably nominated for Best Picture, this skyscraper soap opera makes \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\" look like \\"Battleship Potemkin.\\" A blockbuster cast generates \\"take-the-money-and-run\\" embarrassment - except for the inimitable Fred Astaire, who exudes class in the cheesiest of surroundings. (Few things are cheesier than William Holden's red velvet tuxedo.) Stirling Silliphant's ludicrous script includes the most unintentionally hilarious dialogue this side of Ed Wood.

This book is almost entirely about rug hooking with fabric, not yarn. I'm assuming there must be differences. At any rate, it is not at all what I am looking for, nor does it seem as comprehensive as the other reviews state. The section on hooking techniques does not show how to actually hook anything... rather it indicates how to go around corners and various shapes.

However, the trading advice that the author gave was still relevent, after all these years.I am sure you probably heard this sentence, and I may not say it with the exact wording, it is something like \\" in wall street, the more things changed, the more things remain the same\\". This sentence is probably more than 100 years old.We have all the fancy things coming out since the book published: the internet, the day trading, the new trading methodologies, etc. however, the real trading methodology along with advice for trading psychology that can stand all the test remain the same, and those are written in this book.if you really serious about trading, buy this book and read it at least five times.

It was a sad mistake because I felt let down by the quality of the writing. Soros explains that he is an expert on the subject and able-minded to write such a book because he has sympathy for the future of the world. I believe that is his only qualification in that this book lacks any reason behind the statements. Soros makes blatant remarks about US and World institutions without ever providing an example to back it. I was mostly interested in his SDR's topic but then found that he glazed over it and never fully explained what he expects them to help. Quite disappointing. He lacks basic essay writing skills although I am sure some of his other books are up to the standard."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bit portentous","review":"Mr. Soros certainly deserves our consideration at least as a currency trader, but his prescription for world economics is tainted with a naive, Utopian world view.

This book, however, has the appearance of having been ghost written by an academic hack who was desperate to move on to some other(in his opinion) more important project.The constant footnotes (almost every page) are irritating and should have been collected in the back -- possibly revealing just how little substance there is to the book.Supposedly this is an inspirational book. It could and should have been. The issues are important. However only the most dedicated will slog through the deadly dreary writing. And having done so they will wonder why they bothered except as an exercise in self-discipline."},{"rating":"2","title":"good read on the world economy","review":"I had been told that Soros is a socialist. I didn't get that impression from this book. He may be more on the liberal side with some of his ideas. However in this book he is expressing some very good advise on dealing with the financial aid to underdeveloped countries, on what countries such as America, Great Britian should enforce when giving financial aid and on what IMF, World Bank and UN roles should be. I'd say the guy has a better understanding of the world economy than any politican and at least he is giving solutions instead of just stating faults of the past. In this book he demonstrates a capitalist view not socialist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evolution of Tantra unfolded","review":"Written by a very knowledgable scholar, this book unfolds the historic evolution of tantra.

Of course, scent is always a personal preference, but to me, this one doesn't have much scent compared to the other, and didn't fit in my loofa/washcloth holder that I use the way the other one did.

Society has placed an image in our minds that this was and is the most important thing in a relationship. Melinda, showed us that not only could you be independent, but also have certain standards.

I also sort was pulled in by the thirteen-minute [almost annoying] \\"Tweedlebug Jamboree\\" which, in fact sort of maybe reminded me of like a mutated Gong.

Alas the version on DVD is NBC's with two guys who were apparently sports commentators. These bobble-headed boobs yammered through the whole thing like they would at some football game and talked over all the music and sounds. Several of the most spectacular parts were glossed over.

For this historic and compelling event, we are treated to the annoying voice-over, with edited visual production exactly as it was broadcast. The 2008 Olympics Opening Ceremony deserves a much better treatment, and that is an understatement. I don't know what is happening with the post-production, but the existing media to view the event with is disappointing. One would think that with all of the cameras recording the event and with the amount of resources dedicated to the production, a more authoritative and rewarding review would be made available.

The audio, on the other hand, appears to be just 2 channel Dolby stereo, and sounds more like mono. (My DVD player shows it as Dolby 2.0.)

With all those cameras you would think they could have included new footage and changed the perspectives. This is not the full 4-hour Opening Ceremony but portions of this magnificent program. Volume I is of the Opening and Volume II is of the athletes marching and Closing. I personally wanted more from Volume I and was disappointed and I think the at home viewer who wanted to see more than the TV broadcast will not be satisfied.

Why do the commentators feel that they need to give their boring interpretation, over the music, over the spoken word? Utterly disappointing. Yak, yak, yak. And on top of that, NBC sticks their logo over the picture, which is itself a distraction. How is this different than a TIVO recording, with the commercials edited out? And it is incomplete, too. The whole thing reminds me of the chatterbox style of the original space launches, where the announcers talked over the astronaut communications. Just shut up and play the show!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"In light of the event being probably the single most spectacularOlympics ceremony one is ever likely to see in this lifetime thisproduction is tragically bad.One would have thought they would have the consideration to topthe on air production by providing the extra footage you know they have.They should have provided alternate sound tracks so we could not have tosuffer with the NBC blathering and annoying commentary.I'm glad I viewed the original broadcast in Hi Def on my big screen and am extra glad I bothered to record the broadcast with my laptop/MM system.The DVD presentation falls flat after seeing it in HiDef.It is a damn pity NBC ruined this production.Not impressed and you would be better off finding bootleg hi def copy of the original broadcast.Stupid move nbc."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Blu Ray over Beijing\\"","review":"Hopefully this dvd wil be available in Blu Ray version in the near future.

While this is better than nothing, I agree that the discs are inferior. Low bit rate, mediocre sound, no CC or subtitles, no ability to remove the often disruptive commentary of Bob Costas, et al. This is an artistic accomplishment helmed by the great film director Yimou Zhang (also responsible for the impressive Forbidden City \\"Turandot\\"), and it does not need endless wall-to-wall sports commentary (come to think of it, sports coverage seldom needs endless blather, either). And, add insult to injury, that obtrusive NBC logo is permenently inset in the upper right hand corner (hope you don't have a generation 1 plasma). Why these guys couldn't go back to the raw feed to create a more satisfying home theatre experience is beyond me. It does seem just another way to make a quick buck from NBC home video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Complete and Not HDTV","review":"I'm going to return this awful item.

Out of interest I decided to purchase all the movies (Comanchee Moon is not out yet though).... Dead Man's Walk is true to the storyline of the book. That's about as nice of a comment I can make about the movie. I feel generous giving it two stars even. The musical score is dreadful, and despite the storyline occuring in the wide open the movie feels cramped visually. The acting is so poor it makes one wonder how the big name stars in it ever became famous. The corny acting is embarassing to watch through most of it. The movie is slower then a hot afternoon in Lonesome Dove.

It gives a view of the early days when Captains Call and McCray were Texas Rangers. This movie helps to explain some of the why and how in their relationship and their personal relationships with the women in their lives. Though the actors of Call and McCray did a good job, they had huge shoes to fill after seeing the characters played so well by veteran actors, Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duvall. If you have not seen Lonesome Dove, it is a must see, but I would advise to watch this movie first and follow the characters chronologically through all of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is no lonesome dove but....","review":"I will say this movie is no lonesome dove but it is a fine movie it dose go through a few historical events (Although these events where fictionalized and the time lines don't add up) and it is a good western. if your a fan of the lonesome dove movies and books you will enjoy this.

Scholars who have questioned the historicity of Jesus don't usually make it to Professor status, as the book admits. So most \\"scholars\\" take the historicity of Jesus for granted, and then make up various versions of Jesus of their own, which seems acceptable to the western academic world.

I don't mind the misogyny surrounding the story, because after all, this was made a long time ago, when times and societies were drastically different. This was written in Shakespeare's early years, so it's not as poetic or charming as his later ones. But still, it's full of wit and some highly entertaining moments here and there. There are some problems I have with this play, but I'd be nitpicking if I explained what they are. I'd say the biggest problem I have with this comedy is that there are a few scenes that drag on for too long. Despite that, however, I still like The Taming of the Shrew.

While it is true that the pan handles do not get hot- it is not so with the lid handles. We learned this the hard way. Ouch! I have never had pots and pans with lid handles that got hot! However, I do love this set and the price I paid was well worth it.

Also nice to get rid of the odd collection of cookware and have one complete set that stacks and stores well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cook like the pros for a fraction of the price!!","review":"I have been using this set for almost 3 weeks now. I'm very impressed with the non-stick features of this cookware. I've made several recipes and so far, not a thing has stuck to these pans. Machine dishwashing is not recommended for this set, which isn't an issue for me, but it's something to consider if you hate washing dishes by hand. The handles of this cookware do not get hot, but I've found since they're a lighter weight aluminum compared to the pan itself, it can be somewhat of a balancing act to move a filled pot. Overall, I'd definitely purchase this set again. It's a large collection of very useful sizes and the overall quality cannot be beat for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Cookware","review":"This is our second set of this cookware. After a goodly number of years we wore the nonstick lining pretty badly on the original set. We were not unhappy with the service we got, but do think it is a shame of nonstick lining that it will always eventually deteriorate. The pans themselves remained in excellent condition. Several things particularly stand out with this product. First, stuff don't stick to them. Second, they are thick, strong and solid without being overly heavy so they spread heat well and cook evenly. Their ability to go from stove top to oven is great and to tell the truth, I have taken the deep skillet from oven to table when making one dish meals that have a \\"look\\" out of the oven that I don't want to disturb. Finally, they are a good looking product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love These Pans","review":"I have been using my new Cuisinart Cookware for about a month now and I love them. Very easy to clean.

I would definietly recommended getting them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non stick means the coating doesn't stick to the pan","review":"I purchased an entire set of these pans and was thrilled initially. After a short time, the non-stick coating started flaking off. Last week I was picking pieces out of my food, I could literally grab an edge and peel it off the pans. Set looks nice, but invest in something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"I bought this set in March of 2007.I can not tell you how pleased I am with this set !!!I wanted to wait to review till I had them for awhile to see if they hold up with alot of useThey are truly my favorite set of pans I've ever owned .They are NOT dishwasher safe ...but it doesnt matter they clean so easliy even burnt items wash out very swiftly I can not stress how happy I am with these pansIf you buy them you will love them !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT LONG LASTING","review":"I have had these for less than 2 years and the non-stick is dulling and flaking off. I don't use metal utensils, hand wash only after they've cooled, and never heat beyond medium. I am so disappointed and wish I had spent more money and gone with another brand. I would've saved money in the long run. I cook a lot and these pans are obviously not meant for daily usage!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite pleased with my new pots and pans","review":"They are just as described. And I love that they all have lids, don't have to worry about mixing and matching while trying to cook. If there is anything I'd change, they would be slightly heavier, but I'm really glad they aren't because the older I get, the harder it is to handle heavy pots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk. Cause cancers.","review":"I bought my set in 2008. My frying pans were first to go. I had to toss them since they started to tear off the black particles from the surface. They only lasted about a year. Then, I started to notice other pods had black particles coming off from the surface too. I read online that these black particles would cause cancers. STAY AWAY.I had to get rid of the entire set up until now and bought another cookware set. This set just helped me waste my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, Heavy, Quality, Variety... the list goes on!!!","review":"This cookware is truly gorgeous and the weight is very impressive for the price point. The heat distribution is very even and food cooks quickly. Low heat cooks like high heat in cheaper made cookware. Practically no oil, butter, etc is needed to cook with this set. The hands are long and don't get overly hot. The lids are heavy duty, and they have nice bridged handles to as keep your fingers/knuckles from being burnt. Over-all, this is a fantastic value for all of the pieces you are getting and the quality of the cookware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I had read an earlier review stating that you can't choose the color of the bank. This is indeed true and very disappointing. The bank also comes with a set of keys, however, they don't seem to work which was one reason we purchased this for our child.

Unfortunately, the keys are identical, just a flap of metal to turn the release mechanism. That would be OK if buying only one, but I wanted each to be different, so they're going back. I may buy adult lock boxes with padlocks. Oh, and I have to say, \\"Must accept any color\\" == LAME.Update: For about the same price, I bought 2 SentrySafe CB12's. SentrySafe can make real cash boxes, with real keys, much larger (increased material cost), and sell for about the same price. A way better deal, and the kids love their \\"grown-up\\" cash boxes.

I have one of these from when I was a kid (80's) and these are an almost exact match. All metal outer construction, bright paint, mechanics work without a hitch (not really a secure box, but just fine for a child). Only difference between these and the ones from the 80's is the plastic liner: 80's version is a harder \\"swirled\\" orange plastic, this version is not quite as hard but is up to the job. Great treasure box for kids from 3+ (I even used it in college for coin-op laundry money)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I bought this on 2009 as a christmas present for my son but as he was too young to play it at that time the guitar was storaged in his closet during one year.

In a battle of good versus bad an entire star cast comprising Ranger Smith, Boo Boo, Huckleberry hound, Snagglepuss, Cindy Bear and many more are working harder to try and save the lodge.

It's important to recognize, however, that any nature documentary imposes a biased, human perspective on the natural world. How can we avoid it? We can't, and we shouldn't. Just know that there are different approaches to storytelling, and embrace as many as you can to learn as much as you are able. Nothing replaces first-hand experience. The Leopard Son is a work of art and entertainment that pushes the boundaries of nature documentary. I too, have my doubts about narrator's understanding of what motivates the leopards, but it's a darn good movie with top-notch music by Stewart Copeland; I think it will do more to stimulate curiosity than to diminish appreciation of nature and wildlfe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring your Hankie","review":"If you like Animal Planet, you're a sucker for this tale.

The narration mythicalizes the leopard's existence, and the story revloves around comparing the leopard's journey through life to that of human maturation.By portraying non-human life as somthing that is human, filmmakers patronize the organism(s) that are being represented. This film, pitched as a \\"real-life lion king\\", is a poor example of Natural History film. Those who wish to appreciate and respect leopards and other forms of non-human life that are represented through film and video should avoid this film. It merely provides a cozy narrative within which humans can \\"identify\\" with the leopard; simplifiying its existence so that it is easily consumed by viewers who want a happy story."},{"rating":"2","title":"My mouth is open, my book is shut.","review":"I had never heard of Jawbreaker until reading an interview with Blake - then in Jets to Brazil - in Giant Robot magazine back in 2001.Fast forward three years.

And if you try to cut the edge off the strip to make it narrower, it instantly unravels completely, rendering it unusable (and I assume unreturnable.)To their credit, it's a nice design, with the strip that goes through the pins being nice and thin, attached to the surface of the wider thicker black webbing strap.

I definitely feel like the story was rushed, and a lot of moments were glossed over or missed completely.The ending was a COMPLETE disappointment. I understand that not every book has a happy ending. Fine. But the sad event at the end of this book didn't even have any great emotional resonance. I, who cry at the drop of a hat, was left feeling robbed and cheated, not teary and empathetic.I am sad to report that Hidden Family was very much a disappointment; I wish the author could do a rewrite, maybe add 300 more pages and do the story right.Oh well...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop now - this series goes very far downhill","review":"The books in this series are not very separated from each other, so there's no good place to stop - and stop you should.

They never feel quite in the best spot for optimum sound due to the free flow adjusters also one side is always lower or higher then the other. I think if they added some kind of measuring system and locks they would be much better. Also the build quality is very good,but it doesn't really feel that way. I am very genteel with them because I don't want any of the things happening to it I read that happen to them, twisting cords, breaking cords at the head piece and y splitter.

To this I say I've been wearing over-the-ear headphones off and on for about 25 years and some of them were far more uncomfortable than the SR80. With the SR80's the weight is reasonably low, there's no vinyl skin covering the foam ear pads that gets hot and uncomfortable (not to mention sweaty) with extended wear, and the headband doesn't try to apply so much pressure around your ears that it feels like they are trying to crush your skull. If you get the SR80 just be aware that the foam ear pads are on the rigid hard side, but if you find this isn't to your liking you can buy some inexpensive softer replacement foam ear pads if you want the additional comfort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Beautiful","review":"Pros: Crystal Clear Sound, Good Price, Comfortable for most...Cons: None, these headphones were worth every penny"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing Sound","review":"By now you probably get the picture. These headphones out-perform anything out there in this price range. It's not even close.

They rub against one of my ears. You may get lucky and have flatter ears than me but you should be aware.- These are open headphones. They do not block out room noise.- Flaws in your music will be revealed. Don't throw crappy mp3's at these headphones. You will hear digital distortion if your files are not lossless. It's a fact that comes with the territory.- No bag or case. If you plan on taking these with you you will need to purchase a case seperately.If these were more comfortable to wear I would rate them five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice!","review":"These headphones are great! The sound quality is still improving after a month. Also, a plus is that they give that vintage look on you. Only bad thing about them is the cord is way too long and isn't recommended for that purpose. But, as studio headphones, they play great classic rock music and anything old."},{"rating":"2","title":"great headphones!","review":"A good entry-level set of cans. if you're thinking of transitioning into hi-fi, get this over the sr60i. Comfortable enough, just adjust accordingly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Quality.","review":"Before I used these bad boys, I was using some really crappy ear-buds. The difference was of course, staggering. If you are like I was and coming from low quality crap and aren't a headphones connoisseur then I can recommend you buy these without a second thought after two warnings. First, the bass isn't great. I'd give it a 3.5/5, while everything else is 4.25/5. Second, these things hurt my ears like crazy when I first got them. It hurt so bad I briefly considered returning them. I stuck it out and eventually I stopped getting it.If you can live with those two gripes buy these now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Headphones","review":"I purchased the grado sr80s last month and have been impressed by the great sound. I listen to various types of Music, including classical, and ambient, where detail is important and find them above average for the price compared to other models I personally tested including the much more expensive bose triport set. The only negative I can see is that they are advertized as over the ear, and they fit on the ear, other models feel a bit better during long use periods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent option to more expensive phones","review":"These give great high and mid sound, the bass is there but for those who listen to the more digital type bass these are not for you. I listen to a lot of jazz so I want to hear everything, even the stroking of the strings between actually playing a note, the inhale and exhale of a sax player, etc.. These are just perfect for this type of detail. I will not write something negative just to be negative. These leak music because they are supposed to,\\"OPEN AIR\\" headphones. Please buy \\"NOISE CANCELLING \\" If this is a negative for you then you had no idea what you were buying from the start. They have a retro look, this is their \\"SIGNITURE LOOK\\" . If this is a negative for you , then you have no idea about the Grado history. Grado is about sound quality, and less about looks....saves you money. I've had mine for 4 years and cannot do without them. I have a pair of Koss Portapros when I'm in the mood for digital bass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound sound","review":"I purchased a pair of SR60 headphones for my wife to use for movie watching on her laptop, and would occasionally use them for my keyboard. I really liked the sound of the 60's and decided to buy a pair for myself and use with the keyboard, iPod, videos, etc. I went for the SR80i model because based on some of the reviews that I read, the 80's have a little better bass response than the 60's, and I wanted a fuller sound from my keyboard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, with help","review":"These suckers are amazing, they have relatively comfortable ear foam pads. They aren't designed to envelop your ears, just sit on top.The sound quality of these headphones are fantastic, I think my only gripe with them would be bass response right out of the box. They do not sound tinny, but the bass is pretty weak until you do a little sonic shaping with an EQ, but once that's taken care of, they deliver like a champion.I'm currently using these as studio monitors and they work great for that, but just as well for small audio devices as well. I'd highly recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grado makes great headphones these are not quite up to standard","review":"the construction is great, the sound quality is a little sub-par. I would recommend going the next step with the Grado line,"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality...","review":"These Grado SR80is started out OK but soon (about 1 week) developed a crackling distortion in the left ear.I returned them for repair but the crackling was back in the left (repaired?) driver after a few days. Not wanting to return them again and pay more I tried to bear with it but it got worse. It would completely distort and eventually lose volume altogether, while the right side remained ok. Now the left ear doesnt work at all and a slight crackle is developing in the right ear...so I can't use them. I feel like I was taken for $100 + shipping costs for repair.I have a pair of cheaper Sonys that work without a problem on the same system and same music but I use those at work because they are closed design.These are definitely not good for bassy music.I consider this fair warning.I know i will not be buying another set of Grados."},{"rating":"1","title":"falls apart","review":"I owned a pair of sony's that i bought in 1991 and lasted a decade. A friend turned me onto these Grado Labs and within two weeks it came apart - the headphone fell apart out of the rod. I lay in bed and watch shows with the headphones. I do nothing that should warrent it falling apart like this. Say whatever you want about the sound quality - it means nothing if one of the headphones falls off the rod continuously. It's like a kid manufactured this. I want my money back. If anyone from this company is reading this, please contact me. I want a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consumer reports got this wrong","review":"I've been looking for a new pair of headphones for quite awhile. When I saw the great review in consumer reports I thought I found the ones I would like. Boy was I wrong. 1st try out of the box was with some AC DC. The bass at higher volumes was distorted and the sound was awful. Now I have a pair of old Sony's that are 20+ years old. They where not cheap when I bought them but not near 1 hundred dollars either. They sounded way better. I switched back and forth and tried differant CDs and all I can say is Yuck. You would like the Sony MDR series better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me!","review":"My first use, on a very long flight, of the S80i proved to be a total disappointment. I had high expectations after reading so many positive reviews, but the sound quality did not seem any better than from my ear-buds that came with my iPod. One of the cushioned ear pieces came off - never to be found again. The excellent part of this transaction was the easy return."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent headphones","review":"Excellent sound.

My music has NEVER sounded so good. The best way I can describe it is like seeing a HD TV program for the first time. These are truly amazing in sound and price. I use them on my computer for music and games plus my iphone. They are comfortable as well. I highly recommend these."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Sound You'll Hear for Under $100","review":"These headphones are truly an experience. When I first bought them I wanted good sound that could really take advantage of my growing FLAC collection and these headphones delivered. They give incredible sound quality that I have yet to hear matched by anything around the price range and are sturdy and durable enough for regular use.Pros: Has both 6.25mm and 3.5mm jack connectors (You can take off the 6.25 and a 3.5 is underneath which saves you money on an adapter)Incredible sound qualityComfortable (For a while)Cons: If you wear them for an extended period you will notice some soreness in your ears as if they've been flattened. The feeling only occurs after a few hours of continuous wear and will go away after a break for a few minutes.Overall I haven't regretted my purchase in the slightest and have recommended these to anyone I know looking for a great sound experience on a budget."},{"rating":"2","title":"If sound clarity is important.","review":"Whether it is listening to classical, rock, or hip hop these headphones deliver the clarity you do not experience unless to buy a $4000~$8000 set of speakers. At $100 you get the same level of quality. But a word of warning; these will change the way you listen to music as they will make your ears more discerning to the clarity of music. I absolutely love them."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is nothing like it - except a Grado SR60. And nothing better....","review":"I loved my Grado SR60 and when I had a chance to buy a used Grado SR80 I did so. I can't tell a huge difference between the two. I keep one by my bed to listen to Beethoven quartets late at night. The separation between the instruments is lovely. The quality is wonderful - very smooth and lifelike. I can't imagine a better set of headphones. There is a clear difference between these and my cheap earbuds - although I can lie on my side with my head on the pillow with the earbuds and with these I have to stay on my back.The other set of Grado I keep by my rowing machine. On that set I listen to loud rock and roll or traditional Irish music. It never gets harsh as i turn up the volume and it sounds great. There are more expensive cans out there but I doubt the improvement would justify the higher price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sound, except for the weak bass","review":"After listening with my Grados for 4-5 months, I have to say that although the sound is quite good, the lack of bass is disappointing. I'm not a hip-hop basshead, or a dub reggae specialist, so I don't need headphones to rumble my insides, but I do need to hear some bass. And too often, it's just not there. Just now, I'm listening to an Eric Dolphy album, and there is just no low end, even with the bass frequencies pumped up on the EQ.I'm thinking of purchasing a headphone amp (Cmoy style) to see if that helps.Again, the sound is clear and the tones are often beautiful, but with the weak bass maybe these phones are really only meant for classical music or new age....3.5 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grado Prestige Series SR80 Great Headphones","review":"These are awesome headphones, especially for the price. You can hear the mid's, hi's, low's and everything in between. Expect the headphones to perform as the manufacturer states they perform. I am happy with mine and would recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice after two years!","review":"Ok, so these cans are ugly and not super confortable (not bad though), so what? They lean more toward a Lola racer than a Rolls. These are a very open, supra-aural, design so they wont protect others from the music. Nor will they protect you from ambient noise, it's just not their job. They are built to sound great without breaking the bank. After all, I use them with portable sources so I don't want to haul around a mint. Many phones nowadays kick-up the bass (to simulate band-pass woofers installed in a teeny-bopper's ride), these don't. All you hear is your music. Very flat and crisp. No colorations. It's very hard to find anything that sounds so transparent with such tight, well defined bass, in this price range. These things love to Rock. The only issue I ever had was a bad plug (I replaced it with a Switchcraft part). Rough around the edges? - Yes, but they sure sound sweet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, but they rattle.","review":"My headphones have developed a rattle at 140-150hz at normal listening levels. Apparently Grado headphones are notorious for this. Before you buy these headphones, do a Google search for 'grattle'."},{"rating":"1","title":"good value, cheaply made","review":"I bought these based on a review I read in a hi-fidelity magazine which touted their value. I would agree that they provide really good sound at a reasonable price. My reaction upon opening the box was that they felt cheaply made. I bought them for my 12 year old son and they broke within the first week - the stem that holds the earcup came apart. If you are careful, they might be fine. Given how they are made, I would not recommend them for children/young adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"crappy plug","review":"Overall, I liked the sound and feel of the headpones. However, the cable is heavy and puts a strain on the plug and the sound quality is affected because of the inconsistent contact of the plug. I tried it with the larger adaptor in the stereo (versus computer and iPod) and got the same problem. Now I have to see how good their customer service is...after 10 days. That stinks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Right Headphone Fell Off","review":"As I said in the title the right headphone fell apart. They should have made it sturdier for longer usage. Other than that these are a boon for low budget audiophiles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great with my Ipod","review":"I moved all my music to my IPOD 5.5 gen at AAC320 and swapped out the earbuds (painful) for the Grado SR80s (comfy after a slight adjustment). Great sound and more than enough power for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best for the buck","review":"These are not the best portable headphones, these are not the best studio monitor headphones, and these are not the best DJ headphones. What they are is by far the best value in home headphone listening around. The detail in the sound is comparable to a well-driven pair of home floor standing speakers in the $2K-3K range at a small fraction of the cost. The sound is well balanced, and with a good recording has a very intimate and live feel. Fans of British or Danish speakers will likely approve of these headphones. Grado also makes superbly made and priced turn table needles, and the sound of both combined is wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better and better","review":"These are my 3rd pair of Grado headphones (over the last 10 or so years) and they keep getting better and better. I use them every day at work and while I loved the sound of previous generations of SR80s, they would leave my outer ears sore. These are super comfortable and still sound beautiful.Because they are designed to allow sound to escape, as well as to play into your ears, you will probably irritate people who are sitting close by. So, don't get these unless you have a room for yourself.For better or worse, the look on these is pure geek sex appeal. If you remember Radar from M*A*S*H, trying to stay warm on cold nights with the military headphones wrapped in socks, you will recognize the look of these.Comfortable, fantastic sound, oddly attractive ... for about $100. What a great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"State of the art sound!","review":"I bought these stereo headphones as a gift, and according to the recipient, they are perfect. The Cadillac of headphones--amazing sound, technologically perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"All I can say is the best $ 99 I ever spent on headphones. The sound is truly amazing. I just got them today and they havent even \\"broken\\" in to. Compared them with my noise canceling bose headphones on Chesky audiophile jazz songs and Grado definitely sounds superior.Note though these are open type therefore not to be enjoyed in public places."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best under $100 open cans","review":"If you're shopping for open-style headphones, these are as good as it gets under $100, and I can't imagine a reason to spend any more unless you're the kind of person who thinks expensive cables sound good. In which case, you weren't looking at $100 headphones anyway.Full punchy bass, rich mids, and crisp highs. Cable won't connect to an iPhone if you use a case - you'll need an extender because the jack connector is well build and bulky. I appreciate the 1/4\\" adaptor too. If you listen to music loud the people around you will head everything. High quality transducers, little to no isolation. Exactly what I was looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sound!","review":"This is my first set of high quality headphones and I'm very impressed with the detail that they are capable of producing. I never thought headphones could produce such involved and entrancing sound! Bright highs, powerful bass, and excellent midrange. The earpads are a little uncomfortable, but are getting better over time with break in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blown out speaker and came back still broken from repair.","review":"I bought these along with a NuForce amp. They worked for a couple of months. Then at one point the right ear started making a dirty noise. I finally got fed up with it and sent the headphones in for repair. I described the problem in a letter (sent in with headphones) and over the phone when I originally made the complaint. They came back a couple of weeks later stating that there was nothing wrong and to check my amp. Well I did and the amp is fine. I tried the phones with 3 different sources and still had the same problem. Overall I'm very unhappy with what I understood to be a fine company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design.","review":"The plastic holding the earcups to the headset are thin and fragile. Mine lasted 7 months before they cracked at the most vulnerable point, where the metal shaft entered the \\"C\\"shaped earcup holder. I was always a careful user. I can't believe a trained engineer actually designed such a flimsy setup.Sound quality was very good, but cannot makeup for such a short life span.I returned the earphones to Amazon.com and received an 80% refund [since they were broken]."},{"rating":"2","title":"red wine to light beer","review":"Why I chose Grado.I was going to get a pair of beats but didn't want to be seen wearing them. So I was doing research online and found a company that made headphones in the US. Cool. Then I learned they were in Brooklyn. Excellent. Then I learned that they are said to be one of the best. Awesome.Why I chose the SR80i specifically.I googled beats vs . . . And all the regulars popped up, Bose, Sennheiser, Sony, etc. And for Grado the sr80i was the model that challenges the beats according to the google. $200 vs $100Anyways . . . my buddy has some Beats and he loves them. I love my Grados. I like red wine. He likes light beer.I like to listen to the pickup selector popping on Jeff Beck's guitar. He likes listening to Poppa Roach. I like to think if you have a record player you wear Grado, and if you torrent music you wear Beats.But I agree that the Beats have more bass. So naturally, the SR80's sound more . . . natural."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poorly Constructed","review":"The sound is acceptable for the price from audiophile standards. The treble is a bit tilted up and could be smoother. It is clearly not accurate sound. it's more like Hi-Fi. They are seriously uncomfortable and require a break every hour; absolutely terrible. I have had them 2 months and they are broken in. The construction is horrible. The lettering is coming off despite the fact that I handle them with extreme care. Also, unless you are very careful, the earpiece cords will twist since the earpieces stupidly rotate 360 degrees. Also, the factory has an arrogant attitude about solving problems. They say they care, but hey don't respond unless you are spending more money with them. At this price point, I would spend a little more and get a better built product. AKG is one example. More comfort and better construction in their studio monitor headphone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality, horrible cabling.","review":"The sound is great but the cable often tangles and will not straighten itself out.

He found them to be uncomfortable on his ears. I ended up returning them. I didn't find them too uncomfortable, and am kicking myself for not keeping them for myself, the sound is very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay... Don't Believe the Hype","review":"I bought these headphones under the impression that they were the best headphones you could get for ~100. I bought them through one call, and I have to say, they had amazing customer service. These headphones were okay, but the problem I had with them was that the bass was horrible. My $20 Skullcandy Titan earbuds had more bass. I listen to mainly rap and hip-hop, so I probably picked up the wrong headphones for that. I recommend headphones that are designed for hip hop if that is what you listen to. IF you do not care about bass, these headphones may be for you, otherwise, I wouldn't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing sound","review":"I'm no audiophile, but these headphones sound incredible. I'd almost lost interest in listening to music, but now I'm going back through all my old music. They don't look or feel high-end, physically, but I'm sure that's the only reason they're so reasonably priced. Grado has to economize somewhere. My laptop and iPhone 4 are perfectly capable of driving them, but -- naturally -- better quality recordings sound better. I tend to digitize my CDs at the highest possible rate. My favorite listening experience so far has been Rachmaninoff's 2nd Concerto, though, streamed over Grooveshark. Magnificent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for mixing.","review":"This review is for those who mix music through headphones on budget systems. I have Sony MDR-7506s.Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm HeadphoneGood headphones for tracking but the highs and mids are very pronounced. SR80's are more balanced. Very good bass response. I am using both headphones in tandem with the Focusrite VRM box.Focusrite VRM - Virtual Reference Monitor Box. This is the best way for me to create a good mix given my budget. Very pleased with the SR80is. My friend bought AKG 271 which are over $200 and I think the SR80s sound better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great performance for the price","review":"I've had these for going on 18 months and for the money they are fantastic. The clarity is just fantastic and over all they're a pretty good set. Are they perfect no, initially they are very uncomfortable but given time they'll break in and you can wear them for hours on end. The audio is designed for people who love to hear the detail in their music so if you listen exclusively to Rap and Techno then you probably need to look elsewhere. Once you break them in the bass response does get better but these are never going to produce that really deep low end bass.If you listen to rock, jazz, clasical, pop etc you should be fine. As with most headphones they have a very distinct signature sound but I found that I truly do like them. I later purchased a pair of 325is Grados just so I could get a stronger bass response without loosing the detail but that by no means diminishes the wonderful performance these provide for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only lasted 3 weeks","review":"The sound quality was amazing and the earphones were pretty comfortable.

I'll admit the sound is genuine, but these headphones only work with certain genres and its appeal starts to wear off when you realize these headphones are a one trick pony. Comfort isn't great but was never an issue, my problem is the build quality. After nearly a month of purchase, the left channel started buzzing like crazy! For no reason, they were very well taken care of! Now I'm having to ship these headphones to Brooklyn to have them repaired! From what I've read Grado takes incredibly long to actually do the repairs, and many of them come back with the same issues that plague them before shipping!Buyer beware!!!These headphones are nothing but hype, and are certainly not worth 100 dollars.YOU WILL REGRET THIS PURCHASE"},{"rating":"1","title":"uncomfortable and the ear pads don't last long","review":"I'm not even going to pretend I'm some kind of audiophile. I mainly use headphones to listen to highly compressed throwaway pop songs while I'm writing computer software at work. I've had the Grado SR80 headphones since around 2000. Since then, I've had to replace the earpads 3 times - and the earpads are not cheap at $20/pair.Additionally, they make your ears sore after wearing them for a long time. It's not like I have especially large ears. The earpads are just uncomfortable and expensive to maintain. They are made of a fairly rigid foam that starts to crumble in 2-3 years.In 2007 I have replaced my SR80 headphones with a pair of Sony MDR-V6 headphones and have not looked back since. They were about the same price, much more comfortable, and much more durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst headphones ever","review":"I had been encouraged by the good reviews, and bought this item.

The details of Victorian England were seemingly spot on (having never lived in Victorian London), especially down to the fact that they were always on the look out for new and needless inventions and their morbid fear of being buried alive. This book can be read by anyone wishing to escape their lives and live a life in Victorian London watching a master criminal at work. This book also shows that the ideas of the time, that was only the poor that commited crimes was wrong, Edward Pierce was seemingly a gentleman and he went out of his was to see that no one knew who he really was."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Waste of time!

Looking for pure Crichton fun? Read Sphere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a Junior High History Assignment","review":"I am an avid Michael Crichton fan and have read pretty much everything he has written aside from his nonfiction books. Crichton's writings are often full of action, complexity, character development, as well as a deeper underlying theme or message about society, technology, and human nature. The Great Train Robbery was either lacking or painfully deficient of every one of these elements. As I expressed in the title, it is written more as a historical documentation of an event rather than a traditional novel and is frequently interrupted by lengthy explanations of historical perspective. The Victorian criminal slang used (although brilliantly) to tell the story makes it a slow, and at times, unintelligible read. I give it two stars because it is obvious that Crichton has written a well thought out, well researched book; I only wish it didn't feel like I was reading his history report."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Great Train Robbery","review":"If you want a fun filled book with lots of action, then this is the book for you. The book is placed in Victorian London with the main characters Robert Edgar and Edward Pierce. The master minds behind the great train robbery. They are planning to do what no one has ever done before. On the way it takes some turns that you don't really under stand until the very end.My favorite part of the story is when the main character Edward pierce is over at the train station manager's home trying to get the location of the 3rd key to the strong box. It is not as easy as it sounds.The main idea of the book is to show you that any thing is possible if you try hard.

A must read for Chrichton fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Captivating Novel","review":"The book was incredibly captivating and exciting. It's about the Great Train Robbery in Great Britain in the mid 1800s. The book had an exceptional plot and sensational characters. It started off with an introduction to a master con-artist and introduced other characters as the plot un-ravelled. It truly brought you into hte criminal's head which made the plot easy to understand. The book contains some mature parts, however so I would recommend this to any teen or older. Everyone who read it in my class, enjoyed it and I believe you will too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Crichton at his best!","review":"This book is a must read!

A group of men in 19 century England that are bent on robbing alone of the most heavily guarded shipments of gold in the country, and they will do anything to get it. The whole book is not just the fast action read that the train robbery part is but also the exiting buildup to the robbery.

This book bored the hell out of me. I'm sorry to have to disagree with all the people who thought this book was great, but YAWN!

OK, this is why I didn't like it. I couldn't concentrate on the characters, I didn't LIKE the characters, the beginning of the book was confusing, the plot was confusing, and it just plain didn't hold my interest. If you've never read Crichton before, DO NOT start off with this book. He's much better at science fiction and modern real life. Read \\"Jurassic Park\\" or \\"Sphere\\" first.

Whether you are a homophobe, homosexual supporter, or a christian, it doesn't change the fact that Jesus himself was against homosexuality. By making him homosexual dipicts Jesus as a completely different person. It is like dipicting Ghandi as a soldier. Jesus should remain true to his character.

This band is not great for a smaller wrist. The velcro at the end of the strap does not hold tight to the band, and it catches on the cuffs of sweaters and fleeces, making them pill. The issue is exacerbated by the wideness of the velcro bit - it doesn't taper and is not rounded, so it catches easily. My husband (he's 6' 2\\" but not heavy) found a similar issue when he tried it.

Previously had one on my old Timex Ironman and loved it. Superior to the Timex line of nylon/velcro bands. Had to get one for my new G-Shock.The G-Shock has 16mm mounts so installing this strap took some force and patience. But it certainly can be done and the watch is solidly secured. What I really like about the Voguestrap is you do not have to overly-tighten the band to keep the watch from rolling. The natural flex of the band and the adjustability of velcro allows you to keep your watch secure without feeling tight or pinching. Also, the band (or you wrist) doesn't sweat.One egg off because there isn't a lot of tightening play for my thin wrist (6-1/4\\"). As others have noted, it probably works best for those with thicker wrists. But it does fit me without overlap.

It drew me in quickly, and I was able to get used to yet another world's \\"rules and regulation\\" (mages are kinda sorta immortal, magic is something that mages store up and deplete, and so on). And it was going pretty well, with the first half of the book about inter-character relationships, and the second half being a journey-type story. But toward the end, I swear, the two main characters are spending more time apologizing to each other than anything else! The amount of time that they spend worrying about having hurt each other's feelings made me wonder if the author has some personal emotional demons that she was trying to deal with through her writing. Toward the very end (I decided to finish it to see if it redeemed itself), I read every other page, just to be able to stomach all of the namby-pamby bull. What a letdown!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An enthralling read.","review":"A great story line with realistic characters. Miathan the greedy tempermental archmage plots to destroy a young mage who has a passion for adventure. I highly recommend this book to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating","review":"When my boyfriend bought \\"Sword of Flame\\" he did it just because its Italian edition was out of print. I was so curious about the reason why the third book of a fantasy series should be impossible to find that I decided to buy \\"Aurian\\". And then I understood. This book is captivating, I couldn't put it down. When the protagonist is forced to sail to the Southern Realms the setting suddenly becomes exotic... and exciting. It is well plotted, even if the characters are fully developed just in \\"Harp of Winds\\". I strongly advise everyone to read it, even if they find its 'first' pages (until Aurian and Forral become lovers) not so intresting, for a story of about 2000 pages needs some time to be brought into real action. Definitely worth reading. I just hope that there won't be neverending sequels."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST!!","review":"This book is one of the greatest books that i have ever read! The story line is always changing so that is a a complete mystery of what is going to happen next. Although Maggie Furey does seem to make the Mages a litle too powerful, she takes you mind off of that thought with richly colered detail down to the last rock in the wall of a stony castle. She keeps you on your toes, making you WANT to read on and find out what is going to happen next. I often found myself up at 11:30 trying to finish the next chapter. And even i am not too big of a reader. This is my second time reading it and it would still have to be my favorite book ever!! A MUST HAVE!! Enjoy. I know you will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aurian","review":"Aurian is an exellent book. It has an exellent storyline, and it will make you want to keep reading to find out what will happen next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just a \\"chicks\\" book","review":"Strong character and plot development says it all. Ms Furey's imagination knows no limitations from the Magefolk to Mortals to Winged Folk to Phaerie to the Leviathans all are developed with attention to history and detail of their race. Oh, dont forget the dragon! You are brought into a world that is hard to leave or in this case put down. If you like David Eddings, Raymond E. Feist and Terry Goodkind, you'll like this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute gem among fantasy novels..","review":"This book amazes me. I haven't been this engrossed by a fantasy novel since Ursula LeGuin's Earthsea Quartet. The characters are lovable and easy to relate to, and Ms. Furey has a writing style that will have you really getting emotionally involved in Aurian's adventures. I haven't read the whole series just yet, but if they're anything like Aurian, then I don't doubt that they it could well be the best series I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent first novel","review":"Engaging story line and a well-developed fantasy world. Thought the characters were a little simplistic, from \\"black to white\\" without any intervening shades of gray, emotionally-speaking (e.g. Shia, from \\"I hate all humans\\" to fetching Aurian's sword for her in the space of, what, 10 minutes?) but the book is well worth reading and I've already ordered the sequel..."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like a soap oprah than a fantasy","review":"I liked how the writer of this book drew me in and enjoyed the book untill Aurian got to the academy. From there on it wasnt much more than a soap oprah. This book was more distastefull than enjoyable. The only reason I finished it was because I liked Anvar (he reminded me of my husband) and because a friend let me borrow it.It also had way way to much drama in it. I like having peroids to rest and enjoy the story but this was just one drama episode after another. It was like a bowl of soup that had to many crackers in it, dry.I find the Dark Angel books much better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book which you feel through the heart","review":"I loved this book in a way equal to how I love Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time. It was a different love however - I loved knowing the characters, and feeling how terrible it would be to lose the one I love, like how Aurian lost hers. Any book that can make you feel the love inside a character as if it were you is one to be treasured forever. Anyone that is blessed with knowing Real love will understand. You become a part of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those who are interested in this book","review":"I must say when I read Aurian I was a little unsure it was going to be good. In fact I was surprised that although it is not the best book I have ever read it's a good book when you have spare time. Even so, my friend's and I all agree that some of the other characters are cooler than Aurian like Shia, Anvar, and Zana. If you like fanasty or anything that provesd to be an interseting read, get Aurian, you won't be disappointed (a word from the wise, make sure you get the sequel too, Ms. Furey loves to give cliff-hanger endings)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good light read","review":"This wasn't fantasy at its worst by any means - interesting, well-developed characters, a good plot and a nice break from your typical epic. On the other hand, it is a fantasy epic, with a plethora of overpowered characters, and lacks the morals that make a Lloyd Alexander book work well. Serves as a good page-turning light read, but don't expect depth or shades of grey. Melodrama about as good as it comes though."},{"rating":"1","title":"My purchase of California king sheet set","review":"King size sheets are very expensive.

I ordered one set of California king sheets (300 thread count) at the price of $29.00. I was very pleased with my order for two reasons - the inexpensive price and are excellent sheets. So I then ordered 2 more California king size sheets (300 thread count) at the price of $19.99 each. And as I long as I purchase at least $25, I don't have to pay shipping and handling!!

Most of it was \\"Please pity me!\\" or \\"How DARE you pity me!\\". The usual whiny politically-correct stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely book!","review":"I read the \\"Sherbrooke Bride\\" and I'm looking forward to read more books from Catherine Coulter. I agree with a reviewer that wrote that this isn't earth-shattering literature, but it's a trully enjoyable read, fast-pacing, funny and with witty dialogues. Of course Douglas may sound as a beast at the beginning, but he's so outrageous that the whole affair seems hilarious. It is a fun read after all and not Dickens.Alexandra is a great heroine, loving him since a child and willing to forgive his mistreating her since she realizes that he feels trapped in their marriage. I like it when one of the heroes can see thgrough the other's point of view and not stick to their own beliefs and sentiments.The book is a most enjoyable read, one you never want to end and one I'm certainly going to read again!!! If you are not looking for serious historical romance try it. Else check mrs McNaught books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It","review":"I love all the books in the Bride series, and this was the best (although all are great). I've already re-read it and highly recommend it. Fun, funny, erotic and a harbinger of delights to come through the entire series. I love the Sherbrookes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"I've read at least 15 books of Catherine Coulter. I only gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 because unlike some of her novels, this one had a weird male lead who sometimes act like an idiot and a savage person. Another thing, no one could possibly be that beautiful and perfect, as far as the heroine's sister is concerned. Melissande was a typical character who is very attractive so she's spoiled and rotten due to all the attention she gets. But the book still managed to provoke feelings such as happiness, sadness, irritation and excitement throughout the time I read it. I would not tell the story so I won't ruin it for those who have not read it yet but it is delightful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First Time","review":"I am a devoted reader of Johanna Lindsey, Jude Deveraux. And recently Andrea Kane and Julie Garwood. Since I have read almost all their books I've had to find other authors that compared to them. I now can add Coulter to my list. I've now read quite a few of her books recently, and just like any other author some of her books are great and some aren't. To me THIS ONE IS GOOD! It always depends on the reader and we get from the book. I would like to see any of us write a great outstanding book every year. If you don't like the book, find something else to read and leave the author alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful and lighthearted read!","review":"This book is and has remained for four years, my favorite of all. The humor is laugh out loud funny and the more touching moments cause your heart to constrict in your chest! Dougless has a superior but harmless veiw of himslelf that causes him to lord his expertise in all areas of his life. You all but feel sorry for him because his monologs are so ridiculous. You can almost see Alex rolling her eyes. Alex on the other hand is quite sure of herself despite her sisters \\"throat aching\\" beauty. All she wants is a chance to prove she can be a good wife. What follows is undeniably the funniest words ever put on paper!

I read the book once years ago and disliked it. I ran across it in the bookshelves and had forgotten the plot. I re-read it. . .and I still found myself concluding that the misogynist hero was unlikeable. I never got the feeling he deserved the heroine and was unsure as to why she ever forgave him for the way he had treated her. If I were choosing a Catherine Coulter novel that I enjoyed reading, I would avoid the entire \\"Bride\\" trilogy (which had a tendency to use marital rape as a plot device-- an unfortunate Coulter tendency). My favorite Coulter romance is perhaps \\"The Nightengale Legacy,\\" and I enjoyed her mystery \\"The Maze\\" as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites!","review":"This was the first Catherine coulter book I ever read and I completly fell in love with it. This is the first book in the bride trilogy, and it is my favorite. Douglus and Alex are two headstrong and very entertaining characters. Alex has loved Douglas since she was 15, however Douglas is infatuated with her older sister and entends to marry her. Douglas, having to complete one more secret mission, sends his cousin to marry Alex's sister by proxy to him.Through a twist of fate, Douglas finds himself married to Alex, and is furrious because she is not the bride he wanted.I think coulter is a terrific writer, and I have yet to be dissapointed with any book of hers that I have read (and I have quite a collection of her books!). If you buy this book and enjoy it, you must continue reading the whole trigoly, because the other member of Douglas's family are just as entertaining.

In the book's conclusion, Daniels changes the myth to provide both her contemporary heroine and Niobe a redemption they deserve, and that we, the readers, need.

As a programmer that wants to learn how to write a device driver, I thought the hardware section was especially useful. It covered all the major components that can go on a board, and explained the difference between the different processors to choose from and the different types of memory. It also taught me how to read a schematic and other electrical diagrams. The writing in this book is really simple and clear, and things are explained very well.

It's neither instructional nor a comprehensive handbook. The attempt to cover hardware [...] is far less successful than the software part, which provides some good coverage of OS, middleware and application layers. Coverage of tools is weak. Fonts for some codes and graphs are too small to read. I suggest beginners go to one of those hands-on books targeting one microcontroller, and those experienced go to those more specialized books.

I was very disaapointed to find most of the book devoted to very basic hardware concepts. Much of this information is obtainable from sources cheaper than a $70 book. For example, the MPC7450 PPC Reference Manual is over 800 pages and is free (check out Freescale or IBM websites) - you will learn about microprocessor architecture too!. There are two chapters in the book (Chapters 1 and 11) that have a weak discussion on architecture, and after a lot of hand waving, finally refer you to some other books (see page 533) that actually discuss architecture.So if you know nothing about hardware or were sleeping in class, you might find this book useful.

Sadly JBs last!","review":"SNL, 1941 and The Blues Bros. are all fine acting endeavours Belushi and Akroyd teamed up in, in the 1970s and early-80s. But Neighbors was obviously little more than an excuse to maintain their duo-hype. It didn't work and it shows here! Simply put: This one was D.O.A. when it was released back in 1981 and, unlike the interest in Belushi, there hasn't been any reviving it since!! What makes this film even worse is the fact it was John Belushi's last and what a heinous way to end a brilliant, albeit short-lived, career of terrific physical comedy AND future potential. Blah. At least Akroyd was lucky...he didn't drown in the NEIGHBORS toilet.

After Captain Vic and Empress Ramona move next door, Earl begins on a 24 hour journey to save his soul - to be released from the stagnant swamp of dead-end living - and 9-5 working.The swamp scene behind Earl's house is a powerful and mythic metaphor of Earl being \\"sucked down\\" by outside forces. It's also where he becomes baptized into a \\"new world\\" where he will reign.This follows many of the Joseph Campbell tests and trials of the mythic hero. Both Belushi and Aykroyd expand their acting by switching their normaly stereotyped roles.Great performance by Oscar-Nominated (Raging Bull) Cathy Moriarty as the temptress.An often over-looked film.

No serious comedy collection is complete without this masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it at least two viewings","review":"When I first saw \\"Neighbors\\", I didn't get it.On the way home, I found myself tranfixed by lines and scenes in the movie. After seeing it a second time, I was hooked. This is one of the funniest movies Belushi and Ackroyd made.Without sounding too high-brow, it is an excellent character study of the up-tight white suburban male. Earl(Belushi) struggles to maintain his calm, normal lifestyle in the face of a nagging wife, wild teen daughter, and zany neighbors. However, in the end, he gives up and goes along. It would never work to have the reverse (have Vic, become the straight one).As I said in the title, you have to watch this a second time.

After sweating for three hours on a sample exam, it would be nice to know how you scored. The CD doesn't add anything significant either. It contains the same sample tests as the book. Sure, I guess there's the added convenience of having your computer time you, but it still won't score your exam.

Toward the end he recommends the advantages of the Hebraic tradition of obediently following \\"the one who goes before\\" to find the Almighty.

The former West German soldiers now stand side by side with former East German enemies to stop the Americans. And the Americans must follow their leader in a march to the sea or surrender.

One thing I didn't like about this product was the smell, it was very strong and after a while nauseating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as effective as Jungle Juice 98% DEET without the chemicals","review":"I used this product on my last trip to Tanzania after previously using Jungle Juice I purchased at REI (98% DEET). It has lemongrass and peppermint scent which I found pleasant and wears off after initial application. The spray is a little messy so I end up spraying the liquid onto my hands and rubbing it in. I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skin reactions","review":"This product is a bit more thick, and sprays onto skin less in a fine mist, more of smaller jets of whitish fluid.It seems to work, in that bugs don't bite you while you're wearing it. My kids seem to like it just fine. I have tried it 3 times now, and won't be using it again because it causes my skin to have an itching and burning feeling. As it is absorbed into the skin, it becomes more difficult to wash off, and so the burning feeling persists. It's not extremely painful, but it's quite irritating, much like putting something like vaporub on yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT USE if allergic to bees","review":"I am severely allergic to bees and this stuff REALLY attracted them. My yard has very few bees. . I sprayed this stuff on as I also has a mosquito allergy. Oh man. What a bummer it was when I got stung for the first time in 10 years. Not only that it attracted many gnats and other small flying creatures. I will never ever use this stuff again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish it had worked...","review":"I used this product when I heard a mosquito flying around my room while I was trying to sleep. They usually go for whatever they can get to, ie my face! So, I sprayed herbal armor on a tissue, and dabbed it on my face.Whew, the smell was waay too strong for me...and I like essential oils...But I wanted to endure it because it's deet free.So, we're talking one mosquito to fend off...and it bit me twice on my face almost immediately!Does anyone know if there is a non toxic repellent?2 stars because it's a great idea! Wish it had worked."},{"rating":"2","title":"it works!","review":"I like this bug lotion, ... i like the lotion better than the pump spray version because i feel like i often lose more of it with the spray... miss my arm or something. also when it gets low i would have to open it up and pour it out. with this container i feel like i use it up and waste less. i like to use it on my kids to avoid bites, and it really helps. it smells strong, and my 2 year old complains about wearing it, but we have had no skin reactions to it. it is cheaper on amazon than in my local health-food store, so i stock up and get the free super saver shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"No matter how much you shake the bottle, it doesn't come out right.","review":"No matter how much you shake the bottle, it doesn't come out right. It shoots out in foaming bursts and you have to rub it in with your hands. And then that awful bug spray smell is on your hands. I will be moving on to other natural bug sprays."},{"rating":"2","title":"seems to work","review":"i get eaten alive everytime there is even a mosquito remotely around. So i really needed something to protect me in the mornings and nights. This product does seem to work and i like that it is natural however i do whind up smelling like a citronella candle. also it does fade after about an hour so reapplication is necessary. The other thing is it isnt a spray it is more like a lotion that comes out and you apply it as such. i will continue to use as long as it protects me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works Great BUT Attracts Bee's","review":"I am really pleased with this product in regards to Mosquitos, Fleas, and the pesky sweat-nats. It washes off with no lingering smell easily enough. The only downside is that, for me at least, the product seems to attract bees. They tend to swarm around both myself and also items where my hands, after application, have rested. (Lawnmower, lawn tools, and event the bottle)While I love bee's, I prefer not to provoke a fight with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I doused myself and my son in this, and got bitten all over. I was so excited by all the positive reviews, but it did nothing to keep the mosquitoes away. It is also pretty greasy. I should mention that I live in Michigan, where mosquitoes get pretty bad in the summer. We ended going back to the DEET products, which are the only ones that work for us. :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Florid style covers up any actual information book may or may not contain","review":"When I got this book, I expected a history of our calendar and its links to the ancient world written for regular people as opposed to scholars. The writing is fluid, but so florid that it's hard to get actual information out of it. The writing is so self-indulgently flowery that it disguises the message rather than delivering it. Since the subject matter is in fact nonfiction, this is not a particularly effective style.There are a lot of books out there on the history of the calendar that ARE readable, even to the non-academic. This one is not worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not What it Seems To Be","review":"I came across this little paperback tucked in between more impressive-looking tomes at the bookstore in the European History section. If not for the subtitle, \\"A Miscellany of History and Myth, Religion and Astronomy, Festivals and Feast Days,\\" I'd never have bought it, because the title proper does not satisfactorily describe the content. I am not interested in TIME, per se, but I did write a master's thesis in folkart and am very interested in all kinds of folklore, genealogy, ritual, and comparative religion. So I bought it and have loved it...great bedside companion on these wintry nights. A huge bonus is the beautiful writing style of Mr. Judge - he makes pictures in my head - the highest praise of this artist/folklorist. The book justifies the deep human yearning to celebrate the cycles of the natural world without having to deny one's more conventional religious upbringing (no doubt a growing concern since paganism is one of the fastest growing religions). Comforting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that hot","review":"I was looking elsewhere, seeing this stuff rated at 500,000-700,000 scoville units. I don't think so. I can put a spoonful of this directly on my tongue, and the burn is very mild. It's also very sweet. If sweet with a mild burn is what you are looking for, go for it. Otherwise try something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holds Plenty and Looks Great","review":"I bought this as a gift for a friend after overhearing her tell someone that she doesn't wear all of her earrings because it's too hard to find the pairs. The next time I visited she wanted to show me the stand with her earrings in it. I was amazed at how many pairs it held and thought it looked very pretty sitting on her dresser. I got the black one. It's sturdy and looks really nice. She's really thrilled with this item... I'm thinking that I want to buy one for myself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Earrings Galore","review":"This is a nicely made product but much larger than I expected -- to large for me... but is great if you have loads of ear rings!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Earring holder","review":"The earring holder works great and it is so nice to have earring all in order and easy to find."},{"rating":"2","title":"the perfect gift","review":"I ordered this as a gift for my mom for Christmas, and she loved it. It is extremely functional, while a very good price. You can't find anything like it elsewhere, and I have found no earring holder (that's not plastic) for near this price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who would ever want a jewelry box?","review":"Excellent for organizing all of your earrings. I hate scrambling through a pile of earrings to find two of a kind. Now you can see every pair of earring you own and it looks really sharp too. (Warning, it is fairly large so don't expect it to look insignificant on your dresser). Now if only they had also included a section for hanging necklaces/bracelets and you have the perfect jewelry organizer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect, except for those long earrings","review":"I purchased this item about a year ago and love it. It's got style, has a nice weight behind it, and holds many pairs of earrings. The only issue I have is that my long, dangly earrings definitely don't have enough room to hang here, nor do the big hoops. If you're a hoop person, consider finding an earring holder that has a bit more space between the different levels, which are about 1.25 - 1.5 inches apart.One other thing I noticed is that several of the bars have an odd number of holes in them. It's more of an A-type thing than anything else, but those extra holes go to waste for me because I don't want to hang one earring on one bar and the other earring a rung down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"It's a very nice piece, although it was bigger than I expected. It's about a foot tall, and will definitely hold plenty of earrings. I needed an item like this, because my earrings end up in a pile and tangled. This is good to hold all types, hoops, studs, and dangly earrings."},{"rating":"2","title":"love these vitamins","review":"I was given some by surgeon to take before/after surgery and decided to give their regular multi a try since I felt so amazing taking the surgical pack. The price is definately worth it... I wake up feeling great and am no longer sluggish during the day, especially the afternoon. There was a 2 week period after I finished the surgical pack and was waiting on these and I could tell a difference going back to my 'regular' vitamin routine. I will be sticking w/these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money and Time - Don't Buy This Book!","review":"I purchased this book without looking through it first and am extremely disappointed. While it did provide some good advice on what not to include in a personal statement, the sample essays provided seemed trivial and senseless. Also, the book seems to be written for kids still in college and recent grads, and focuses mostly on medical and law school admissions. It totally ignores working adults and people seeking admission into other graduate programs, such as human services and education. The time I wasted reading this book could have been better spent actually writing my own admissions essay!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"Horrible book. The title should read \\"Perfect personal statements for law, medical and graduate school rejections\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless and insulting","review":"Do not buy this book.It's advice is useless at best, insulting at worst. It is full of idiotic phrases such as \\"use your creativity to...\\" that are too abstract to be actually helpful. It relies on jargon and a casual tone, which good writing books eschew. The only concrete advice it gives is so obvious as to be disconcerting. What graduate school applicant wouldn't already know not to misspell the name of the university? What kind of mutant would find this book helpful?Only the collection of actual essays and responses from admissions boards at the end of the book made me not wholly regret spending $4 (including shipping) on this waste of trees. Still, I wish I had my $4 back, along with my belief that the pool of graduate school applicants weren't foolish egotists with no social skills, self-awareness, or basic understanding of the expectations the professional world has for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Giving Away","review":"I just glanced at one essay in this book and I found horrible grammatical errors such as failing to Capitilize the name of a university. I'm glad I didn't buy it and hope no one else does either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plagiarism","review":"There are whole sections of this book that are lifted, word for word, straight out of Burton Rose's Clinical Physiology of Acid-Base and Electrolyte Disorders, without any attribution. Just sayin'."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK overview, but better alternatives exist...","review":"The book offers a good overview of information security, though with a lot of \\"talk\\". I found myself scanning 75% of the paragraphs for the meat....I'm a software engineer, and have read \\"Secret's and Lies\\", which offers a much more thorough and better review of the subject. Buy it, instead. Not only will you get a better education, but you'll actually read the entire book instead of skimming most of it....Neither this nor \\"Secrets and Lies\\" will offer much specific information on security loopholes, i.e. how to hack or avoid being hacked. \\"Hacking Exposed\\" does that, however, and is a good read, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inside Internet Security: Inside the heads of Hackers","review":"This book is must for any IT manager, Security Officer, or even CIO, who wants to get inside the heads of hackers and industrial espionage agents. While the technical content is rather modest, the book provides something much more valuable. It gives you insight into the motivations and m.o. of script kiddies, hackers, and other denizens of the cybernetic dark side."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"These movies are wonderful examples of the genre, but the worst transfers I have ever seen. If you want to be reminded of what these movies looked like on late-night TV in the 1970s, this is the collection for you. The movies look like they were duped off a VCR/DVD combo. Images are grainy and washed out. Sound is scratchy and subpar. And to top it off, there is a logo in the bottom right corner of every frame of every movie that resembles a cable TV channel logo. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ultimate Film Noir Collection (5 DVD Set)","review":"This would be a great set if good copies of the films were used to make the DVDs, but they weren't. The movies are full of scratches and are very choppy due to missing footage. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movies - Bad copies.","review":"These are ten classic film noirs. Unfortunately the video and audio quality of these DVDs is very poor. Get these films in other releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"film noir","review":"a very good collection of classic gangster films and dark drama.if watching movies like these at night in the dark is what you like to do then check these out."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Pay For What You Get..This Is Worth It","review":"A fine way to familiarize yourself with great movies.A good value that should be picked up as a first step in exploring.Some such as KC Confidential, Martha Ivers were OK while others, Too Late For Tears, DOA, Scar were no better nor worse than other PD releases I have seen.Since viewing, I found myself purchasing a better copy of the Stranger and since some of these films are rare and classics you can't complain.Naturally one hopes that more and more film noir gets released by the \\"biggies\\" with all the commentaries and extras but sets like this one is almost a public service."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Did They Say It Sucks In The 1949?","review":"Interesting selection of films few have heard of. The quality of the prints transferred to these DVD's was poor to OMG - what were the last 5 words the actress just said?I should have demanded my money back.

The top keeper on this disc is the Black Crowes' track... the dominant acoustic accompaniment is a PIANO, not an acoustic guitar (though the guitar is in there). Nice to hear it this way, and I love the studio version.Queen's tune is also good, as is Greg Lake's and Eddie Money's."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Reference & Learning Tool","review":"This book has examples of any type of close-up photography you can imagine, plus tips on how to take pictures of each type of object.

I would recommend it to anyone needing to assess their current Help Desk structure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpectedly Great!","review":"This was the first time I read anything by this author. I loved it from the minute I started it - right to the very end! Read the book in 2 nights! The book was truly suspensful to the very end - I had no idea \\"who done it\\". It was very, very good and I look forward to many more books by this particular author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT READ","review":"I usually figure out mysteries right off the bat. This one had me guessing until the end. Cool setting. Cool heroine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tonight You're Mine Book","review":"Excellent book, suspenseful, a definite page turner. This is another one of Carlene Thompson's many well written books. She has become my favorite author as she satisfies my strong desire for intrigue, along with a bit of romance. She portrays characters who come to life for the reader. Received in perfect condition, and quick and easy transaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nay sayer","review":"From the posted reviews, I am in the minority it appears. I found this book a hard read that failed to hold my interest for any length of time. The characters are unappealing, the dialoge (especially the child, Shelby,) unbelievable, and the romance between Nicole/Paul, Nicole/Ray, what romance? The really love interest does not come physically on scene till close to the end and there was no chemistry between them and little interaction that holds interest.If it is a suspenseful romance your seeking,I can not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb heroine, slow plot","review":"This book annoyed me so much that I had to stop reading it 1/3 of the way in. For someone supposed to be a smart, caring mother, Nicole does some really dumb things. Someone in a wolf mask climbs their 6-foot high fence to peer in through her daughter's bedroom window and she doesn't call the police, because oh, it's probably just one of her students playing a joke? Her soon-to-be-ex drives their daughter home while drunk and she doesn't call the police??Combine that with \\"Well, as you know, when I moved home seven months ago...\\" dialogue, and you've got a mystery that's really not going anywhere. Give me a feminine protagonist who can look after herself *and* knows when to call 911, please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok~ Not one of the best I have read","review":"I am a true fan of psycholgical suspense and horror books, this one was just ok.... There wasn't anything in particular that made it just ok~ I don't know It didn't grab me like other novels have.. my 2 cents"},{"rating":"2","title":"inspired and psychologically compelling","review":"Dr. Thompson's fiction is always written with profound insights into both normal and non-normal human nature.
