I think this was his first was this book and while this one isn't my favorite or as memorable as say One More Day or Have A Little Faith. These honest books get to the heart of matters and always make me cry at some point.This is a quick read not because it is just simply written but because I eagerly wanted to learn what was next. I love that the author always meets such interesting people to write about and they are such regular people, people you want to know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read - even the second time around.","review":"So, I had to read this for an assignment on death and dying in nursing school. I had read it as a kid for school so I knew what it was about but it was still great to read again. Worth spending the money on (I lost my first copy)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Simplistic","review":"I read all these great reviews on this site and bought the book. I expected it to be some kind of life changing/revealing experience. I did not find it to be so. I empathise with morrie, his suffering and everything but my gripe is against the author and his dull writing style. The kind of revelations the author is supposed to have got by talking to morrie are so fundamental that you dont need to have to talk to a dying person to know about them. Even simple philosophies of life can be written well. I was not terribly moved by reading about it too. At some points in the book, I even wondered if Morrie was indulging in too much self-pity. Agreed its a terrible disease to live with but the author/book just could not evoke the kind emotions in me."},{"rating":"1","title":"mindless slush of the worst order","review":"A silly book, with echoes of the bridges of madison county, overwritten sports metaphors (he's one of the worst offenders as a writer in the sports pages). It really makes life into a schmaltzy slush, while avoiding any real issues. Perfect for the exurb bush fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rid Your Home of Pestilence and Dispose of this Book.","review":"In my L.A class this was required reading. When I picked up this book, I wasn't hoping for much. A few heartfelt memoirs, perhaps a charming anecdote. What I recieved was pure filth, right in the kisser. It was an emotionally manipulative and a blatant marketeering of a slow, heartstring-pulling death. I learned absolutely nothing about how to live. This is a sad and pathetic attempt of piggybacking off of someone else's suffering in order to attract those in want of a tear-jerker. I find that Mitch is highly insensitive to Morrie's plight, and flew down there only when he was in need of a story. I have read many teary books as required reading, and am thoroughly fed up with this new age, sympathetic trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational","review":"I grew up reading Mitch Albom articles about sports in the Detroit area and nationwide. He is one of the most thoughtful writers of our time, and communicates in a simple fashion that makes it easy to interpret his logic and conclusions. He applies this same, simple writing style to this book in a manner whereby you feel like you are experiencing what he is experiencing firsthand. I have to say, after reading this book, I started to look at the world a different way and I really need to keep it nearby for every major stage in my life going forward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tuesdays With Morrie","review":"Thank you, Thank you, Thank you,This book was inspireingDuring the fits of laughter and wiping away the tears i was totally inspired by this show of courage and commitment to life.More of this please Mitch"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I don't understand the glowing reviews this book has received. Mitch Albom's writing style is unimpressive and Morrie Schwartz's aphorisms are trite. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1, because the book is an easy read and it does give some insight into the process of dying. It also helped pay for Mr. Schwartz's medical treatments and, for that alone, it's worth purchasing. There were several paragraphs that tugged at my heartstrings but, overall, the book failed to touch me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite and unconvincing","review":"Superficial and soporific, Albom's book is strong on sentiment but weak on substance. Riddled with ridiculous aphorisms such as \\"When you're in bed, you're dead,\\" this book left me feeling like I had just read a high school student's unstructured freewrite. Having finished the book, I couldn't care less about Mitch Albom; more sadly, I couldn't care less about Morrie Swartz either. Because I am not cold-hearted by nature, only the writer of \\"Tuesday's with Morrie\\" is to blame for my apathy."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Morrie's Thousand Little Truisms.\\"","review":"After reading Tuesdays with Morrie, I felt throroughly unsatisfied. The book was more like a self-help book--something along the lines of \\"Life's 101 Greatest Lessons.\\"I think Mitch Albom had an immediate instinct to deify Morrie...not that there was anything wrong with that, but he certainly lost some perspective.I'm glad that others have found a great deal of inspiration in the book; virtually all of my friends have flocked to it as well. However, as a piece of literature, it simply doesn't stand up...it's more of a pop-culture phenomenon. I'm surprised that no one else has shared my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take a tip from Morrie","review":"Take a tip from Morrie and go live your life rather than waste it on this horribly written book. To sum up the book...\\"I'm dying...this is what its like to die..dying...the end\\". There is no substance to this book and nothing to learn. Nothing is learned from the dialogue and it makes me wonder if the author even learned anything from these Tuesdays sessions with Morrie. I grew tired very quickly of reading about Morrie talking about not talking about death. Save your time and your money by not reading this, and you will be living a better life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"'Tuedays with Morrie' was a wonderful read. I laughed and cried with Mitch and Morrie. I have known a young person who died from ALS when she was 45, My mother and I used to visit her on Sundays. Morries' Story is an inspirational one and makes you appreciate the simple things in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Im 17 and i weaped when i read this book","review":"Ive read the book and seen this movie and i must say it brought me to tears. The lessons within this book are priceless, as we all are looking for the big question : what is the meening of life. Ive spent a lot of my time lately on building a business and a career. Im not out of highschool and i spend 3-4 hours daily running it. I havent talked to my parents for more then 30 seconds in over a year. This book HAS changed things for me and it WILL for you. We all will die someday, the question will become how we lived. Thanks for listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"Tuesdays with Morrie was simply wonderful. It really was able to bring out the best in people and show just how important the time we share together really is. It did tug on the heart strings quite a bit, but was so inspiring. People can get caught up in so many things that are just not important to the real meaning of life; to love one another! I didn't want the Tuesdays to end, but was very blessed by the time Morrie gave to us through the help of Mitch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Morrie's book, then try Rousseau","review":"Life's Greatest Lesson seems to be that the person with the most publishing connections and gets to press first wins the prize.Morrie is a wise and wonderful man. His only mistake was to share his thoughts with Mitch. It continues to amaze me that Mitch has made so much money off Morrie while Morrie's own book has languished.Read Morrie's own book, then move on to the philosophers who influenced him."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great story to show you what is important in life.","review":"This book was an awesome read. You feel totaly conected to Mitch and Morrie. In each chapter I found something that was either applicable to my life now or I know it will be in the future. I feel that everybody who reads ths book will decide to take a step back to look at their life, and reevaluate where they are, where they are going, and what they really want. The reader really can feel the love that Morrie has for everyone in his life and for his life. And you can feel the transformation that Mitch goes through during this last class. This book is a must read for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want to understand Kuhn: buy it.","review":"I've been a big Kuhn fan for years.

This gem is a debate among some of the most interesting philosophers of science in the twentieth century-- all trying to make sense of Kuhn, most concluding that his ideas are deeply flawed.The criticism helped me advance my own interpretation of Kuhn, but it was Kuhn's reply to the criticism that brought the whole thing into technicolor 3D.

I've been in a tactonic hypnotic trance at work the past six hours since spinning Agaetic byrjun. I can't understand a word, yet understand exactly what they're saying. Never heard violins and nuclear explosions intermingling simultaneously (#6 -- Vidar vel til lottarasa). Never have I cranked out more material at work on the keyboards -- yet I haven't answered a single phone call for fear of leaving the tunes.Sensational.

Sounds so beautiful it will make you weep. Get the CD. Put the kids to bed. Plug in the headphones. Close your eyes. Play the CD. See the angels coming down to earth, singing the most heavenly music you have ever heard.For those who just don't get it, I truly feel sorry for you. You are really missing out on one of the most unbelievable musical experiences of our time."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word: boring.","review":"I found myself downloading Sigur Ros' stuff after reading positive reviews of Agaetis Byrjun from Radiohead fans. This is not Radiohead. This is not even music. If a rusty gate was to have an orgasm, it would sound like Sigur Ros' vocals. Tuneless gibberish, and it took 3 minutes for Svefn-g-whatever to get anywhere at all, and even then it sounded like an extended sneeze. \\"Acheeeeeeooooooooo\\". I can imagine the art school kids gobbling this stuff up. If you have a penchant for eccentric New Age claptrap, or if your sleeping pills have been failing you, you'll appreciate Sigur Ros."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dismal","review":"Did they just unwrap their electronic instruments?

Sure, the music was beautiful, but I simply could NOT understand a word the singer sang. I even recorded it onto my computer and tried to play it backwards. No luck. I'm someone who loves lyrics, words, and the message they give us. How good a song would \\"I Love Candy\\" be without words? Or \\"Too Shy\\"? Exactly.Needless to say, until the singer learns to annunciate, I'll be looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a scrawling, pretentious mess","review":"As if it weren't obvious by the packaging alone, this album is the biggest load of pretentious, overrated \\"stuff\\" I've had the misfortune of hearing lately. Svefn-g-Englar opens the album (after a pointless, noodling intro) - Falsetto vocals over bowed guitar and keyboards? What year are we in again, 1975? Anyway, the next track opens with a string section; I think it's written law that if you put a song with a string section on it on your album, you will appear to have artistic merit. This went right out my car window. The arty kids in every local high school will eat this junk up."},{"rating":"1","title":"glacial pretentious ...","review":"Please please please save me from this type of .... this has to be the most overrated album of the last 10 years. you will need a lot of mood altering drugs to get through the album and even then it won't be worth it. i truly believe that people rave about this because they think it makes them look cool-when it just makes them look vapid. i'm sorry to come crashing down on the sigur ros parade but save your money-this is one of the few albums that i actually got mad that i spent money on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elevator Music.","review":"I have seen this band live and shortly after that burnt this cd for a friend. I was like \\"whoa! this aint hard to make at all!\\"Its got a lot of ambience, more than required I think. This is perfect \\"hold\\" music or elevator anthems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Music","review":"I am American and don't have the slightest idea what the lead singer of Sigur Ros is saying but it is the most beuatiful music I have ever heard. This album transcends any language barrier you might have. Don't worry about the fact that it's Icelandic. Just let the music itself carry you away. You will not be disappointed. This entire album is awesome and inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff!","review":"We should probably all bow down to Bill Perez as he is undoubtedly the all knowing god of all critics. Don't mind him, he just needs a hug.Anyway, about the album. Its great stuff. Different. Trippy. Beautiful. Listen to some of their stuff first. If you don't like it, don't buy it.I rated it 4 stars because it is MY PERSONAL OPINION. It just means its great but I like other things better."},{"rating":"2","title":"mmmmm....good","review":"This was a good album, filled with songs that had music and some words. Not too shabby for a group of people from Iceland who eat whale blubber."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly monochrome","review":"As full of interesting harmonic, melodic, and rhythmic invention as a New England sky is full of color in the middle of a week long drizzle. There's no sense of musical progression, of modulation, of forward movement, of the development of a musical idea. Repetitive. Static. Of most overly repetitive songs one can at least say that the first few frames of the endlessly replayed musical scene are interesting at first listen. Not so here. This ablum is a truly singular anti-achievement."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok","review":"They have a sound all their own. You know that lethargic feeling you get when you hurt and you have to run and go to the bathroom but you just can't so you crawl and it takes you forever. This is what the music feels like. Really slow and the singer or whomever speaks jibberish so... I won't even try to make sense out of this album cause you can't and please don't ask me to spell any of their singles names. It has potential to be better if they could.. put a better arrangement together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like whales with gas","review":"The guy I work with plays this constantly.

It's a good job I downloaded it as I would not have liked to waste my money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Painful to listen to, utterly inane, worthless.

With Sigur Ros 'Agaetis Byrjun,' you quickly learn to expect the impossible. Iceland's sons definitely make their mother country proud because within the music you can see the cool weather and sparse yet bountiful landscapes that comprise their home. In every song, emotion is stressed rather than finesse, and they execute it so well that it's hard not to get locked in. Specifically on \\"Virar vel til loft��r��sa.\\" The beginning piano chords and the climax will send shivers down your spine and make your hair stand up on your arms while simultaneously causing goosebumps to erupt. It's a captivating experience to say the least.I gave this album five stars because I believe that it's Sigur Ros' best work but mainly because it's utterly beautiful. It's an icy sunrise; a dive into the vibrant deep; a synaesthetic dream; a bow to an electric guitar."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't get it","review":"I bought this CD after hearing track 2 and samples of the remaining tracks. It's beautiful at times, but at others it's downright annoying. They often use a looped cymbal that is like fingernails on a chalkboard. The production seems unbalanced, with songs often sounding not properly mixed. Their use of horns tends to distract from their sound, and the vocals seem removed from the music. I was very dissappointed in this CD and will probably give it away. Look elsewhere for ethereal music."},{"rating":"1","title":"like this will change anything, but hey","review":"Sigur Ros; Ethereal, hyponotic, BORING. Believe me, ive enjoyed plenty of albums that were similar, but this album was like staring at TV static while taking muscle relaxers. I appreciate that its not so mainstream and it is different from a lot of other artists, but jeezus cripes i cant stay awake through it! I cant distingusih songs apart, and sometimes thats just fine, but this album never goes anywhere. it just drones on like a test screen. I cant listen to more than 2 songs at a time without falling asleep, which was terrible case i was driving! If you want spacey but not so freaking boring, i suggest \\"Back of Beyond\\" by Frank Pahl. And no im not promoting him, just giving a more interesting option that i know of."},{"rating":"1","title":"IS IT JUST ME OR IS THIS STUFF TOO REPETITIVE?","review":"Each song seems to be one or MAYBE two kind of neat, but really simple parts, played over and over ad infinitum... A wee bit cheezy, too, methinks. Sorry, but I was expecting MUCH more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Original, tedious, pointless","review":"Ok, they have an original sound. The lead male singer sings like a female ingenue - which is good as he does a good job of getting the maximum emotional value out of the Icelandic/nonsense lyrics (which serve as a blank slate that you can superimpose any meaning on - which isn't a bad idea, either). A few of these songs do evoke the barren Icelandic landsscape that has plenty of volcanoes, ice, and few (no?) trees. I'm afraid that all of that is not enough to sustain an entire cd. This gets tedious quickly. A lot of droning in minor chords, music that goes nowhere, etc. Yes, it is different. But if it's only appeal is novelty, the novelty - like all novelties - wears off quickly. They need more substance and less surface sheen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Other worldly","review":"I just stumbled across their music on youtube.com. Wow, what a treat... cool, beautiful, haunting, other worldly. Loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good weather for airstrikes","review":"Just about every review of this so far has been lauding Svefn-g-Englar. That's all fine and good but I think the track Vidrar vel til Luftarasa (Good weather for airstrikes) goes above and beyond what SgE does. The depth and emotional quality of Vidrar are unlike anything I've heard before. Seeing the music video for it only solidified it for me. If this is the direction the music world is heading in, then I'll be a happy man."},{"rating":"2","title":"It rarely gets better than this!","review":"Sigur Ros are an excellent, if somewhat weird, band that plays a puzzling blend of rock, dream pop and post-rock. Given that they are from Island you'd expect them to sing in Icelandic but in fact they've \\"invented\\" (or maybe someone has already used it before them) their own language wich they call Hopelandic or something like that. If you want a couple of guidelines to classify them just think about a rocky version of the Cocteau Twins with whom they've much in common in my opinion. The vocals are \\"soaring\\" and sung in a falsetto voice while the overall atmosphere is \\"dreamy\\" and warm. I've also heard echoes of mogwai..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sigur Ros","review":"I was watching Reverb on HBO or one of those pay chanels one night. It featured Brok and Sigur Ros. I'v seen Bork on Sturday Night Live and other T.V. show before but have never had the pleasure of seeing Sigur Ros. I Could not change the chanel. I was hyptnotized by there almost haunting yet soothing sound. My Dad play's guitar in a band and I'v never seen anyone play one with a bow. It was hard to understand the lyrics but maybe thats because I don't speak Icelandic tounge or what ever language they speak but that didn't subtract from the feel of the Music. I would say if your into various styles of music it would be a very nice addition too your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ambient, mellow, haunting and creepy. GREAT!","review":"I don't understand a word of Icelandic and probably never will. Normally I don't like to listen to music when I can't understand the lyrics, but with Sigur Ros I simply don't care. I treat the voices as instruments, like the Cocteau Twins.I love listening to this album on winter nights, with the lights out and a fire going in the fireplace. One thing to warn you about though, there are real dynamics on this album. The music can go from soothing to bombastic in a single moment.I guess this album is a bit like the Bulgarian Voices, even if you don't understand it, you can still get it. If you don't, well, you don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible...at the right times","review":"This is some other-worldly music that can hit you just right depending on what mood you are in. Sigur Ros will likely make you feel depressed and sick if you are in a great mood, and can make you waste your entire day being all melancholic. There are times when I think Sigur Ros is garbage and pointless. Every once in a while, however, I think everyone's soul needs this kind of melodic thereapy. 99 percent of people I know need to just F'n chill out and escape the rat race that becomes their daily life. Nothing will do it like Sigur Ros. this music is not for just listening to whenever. Enjoy it very sporadically, but intensely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good God, Make it Stop!","review":"After reading all the excellent reviews on this album, I decided to give it a listen as I am a huge Radiohead fan. People--This aint Radiohead. This was by far the worst album I have ever heard. Check that, I couldn't make it past song 3? 4? I don't know but it was bad, real bad.

What's so special about this album? The dumb atmosphere? I say you listen to a Madonna or Britney Spears album if you want atmosphere! Sigur Ros are so stupid that they don't even know how to write properly- note how all of their songs are in a made-up language. They thought, \\"Hey, let's be cool and not pass kindergarten and make music with two chords on the guitar and mess around with a piano and people will worship us!\\". Sigur Ros are dumb one-trick ponies who will do anything to take your money.

Creating an atmoshphere in this style of music is important but this band really needs to learn song structure and not fiddle around with sounds until 8 minutes elapse and then call that a song. All in all, this is a worth while album, warm and moving.

I have no idea what the singer is saying but to me his voice is just another instrument -- similar to the way that My Bloody Valentine used vocals as a means to create more diverse instrumentation.If you like Sigur Ros then you may like The Album Leaf too -- check 'em both out on tour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishing work of art","review":"I picked this album up not knowing what to expect, having never heard sigur r��s before.

Start here before proceeding to Mogwai or Godspeed You Black Emperor (I've got everything by both of them and Sigur Ros leads the pack). There is much more interesting instrumentation and production happening here. I especially enjoy the vocals - (unless the artist is Bob Dylan or Dylan Thomas, I just as soon hear a native language or false language that doesn't subtract from the emotional impact of the music).When I head to the ocean to catch the sun and walk in the waves I grab 2 CDs to let my mind float freely away - this one and MBV's Loveless - Try 'Em Both!. It hits that Robert Wyatt chakra where it is a bit abstract but still warm and emotional. In years to come you will melt your Coldplay CDs but you will preserve this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"Basically just another amazing album from Sigur Ros. I can understand how some people dislike the music because it really does take a little patience to get into. The songs are slow and long, so if your in a hurry you might as well pass on this music. With that said, there's some incredibly beautiful music to be heard on this disc and I wouldn't recommend passing it up. Highlights are \\"Svefn g englar\\", \\"Staralfur\\", \\"Flugufrelsarinn\\", \\"Vidrar vel til loftarasa\\" & \\"Olsen olsen\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Enthralling","review":"READ THIS BOOK!

That along with his gifted storytelling, make this an enjoyable read and one you will find hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gripping Mystery meets a Touching Coming Out Story","review":"Killian Kendall is 16, he's oblivious to matters of his heart, and, when his new friend is murdered, he is about to be whacked upside the head with a terrible dose of reality. Josh Aterovis has written a gripping and topical story about one boy's struggle to find love, acceptance, and chosen family in the face of intolerance. Killian is a real winner--I haven't met a character as kind-hearted and fully presented since Billy Sive. This young man's story, told from his point-of-view, is well-executed, so good, in fact, that I read it all in one sitting. It's an excellent story, ably told, and certain to be just the first of many novels from a talented and capable new author. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching and engrossing...","review":"...though you do have to suspend your disbelief a little. Characters do have a habit of suddenly discovering they are gay, and they do have a habit of falling for each other left and right, but if you have an ounce of Romance in you, you will find the book as hard to put down as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating, but a bit overdone in parts","review":"I agree with previous reviews that the book is an engrossing mystery with believeable characters that many gay teens can identify with. The basic plot, the killing of a gay student which the police are writing off as a foiled robbery rather than a hate crime, is one that is developed well. And the \\"who done it\\" is unlikely to be guessed by many.The only criticisms I have is that the author goes a bit overboard in some respects, such as surrounding Killian with new acquaintances who first decide they are gay after spending a few minutes talking with him. Also, the descriptions get to be a bit hard to take in parts (like \\"We walked across the emerald green grass, daffodils waved their cheery heards, and robbins hopped out of our way...\\")"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensual, Exciting, Romantic..........","review":"Lady of Dreams is a beautiful work of art.

From there he traces the history of what was known in the area, who entered the areas, when excavation was etc. complete with pictures on right page and descriptions on left. It is a fascinating history of this areaand if you have enjoyed PBS series on various Native American Dwellings of the past, you will enjoy owning this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Synopsis","review":"This collection of essays by an international team of scholars provides essential background on the administrative, social, and economic, as well as the artistic, history of the Meiji period in Japan (1868-1912). The first three essays investigate the new government's active role in the modernization and re-orientation of the traditional crafts, which was seen as a vital component in Japan's efforts to become a modern country on a par with the Western powers. Janet Hunter sets the scene, describing the drastic changes wrought by the Meiji revolution and the conflict betwen Western and Japanese civilization that was to become a constant theme of Japan's development. Sato Doshin analyses the Meiji bureaucrats' efforts to promote the craft industries by means of trade exhibitions at home and abroad, while Hida Toyojiro investigates the motivations and working methods of the Japanese entrepreneurs who did so much to bring the domestic craft tradition to an international audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"ordered it, never got it","review":"Actually, I never got the product.

She shared her faith in a very sincere fashion, not forcing it onto the reader, at the same time she reveles a passion for God, that is very evident in her writing.

The book is arranged in topics, very accessible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is There Room For Mystery?","review":"Originally published in 1907, Torrey seems ahead of his time in approaching difficulties head on. The book begins with an incredible description of where difficulties arise, with the big one being that we can never expect to understand why the Creator God would choose to do certain things in a way that may go against our 21st century, western cultural sensibilities. However, when Torrey begins to address specific issues, it seems that he falls into the all too familiar trap of stretching the facts to fit difficulties into a tidy, black and white box. When will followers of Christ accept that we will never understand all that is in the Bible - a book written 2,000 + years ago, to a culture we are unfamiliar with, and that has been translated through at least two languages to get to our current English translations. Some things will just have to remain a mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"taste great","review":"We have used Splenda for several years, its our favorite fake sweetnar.Just don't let the advertising fool you it not made from sugar.

Many of the sonnets are quite good. She may be unlucky or unhappy in love, but she is wry about it and not the least bit maudlin or self-indulgent.The poems about the unbearable beauties of nature strike me as overwrought and do not work at all.Her shortest bits sting the page. As an example, this two lines, the \\"Second Fig\\" from her collection A Few Figs From Thistles, describes quite neatly those whose ability to see facts are limited by their wishing them not so. She writes:Safe upon the solid rock the ugly houses stand:Come and see my shining palace built upon the sand!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive Short Stories","review":"One of the reasons that I usually avoid short stories is because of the tidiness for which short story authors seem to strive. Katherine Anne Porter's stories are not cute. They are not clean. And they are not contrived. Rather, she allows her stories to live in a more sincere world, where life continues past the last page of a story and resolutions of the characters' maladies come after \\"The End,\\" if ever.This sincerity is the charm of her work. While much of what is written is sullen and brazen, Ms. Porter's communication to us is that there is life to be found before, during, and after the climax- and we must steer clear of false resolution or find no resolution at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary short fiction","review":"Porter is a great writer and these stories are well worth re-reading. She can be difficult but the effort put into understanding her message is rewarded. Perfect for someone looking for a group of great 'literary' short stories to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dazzling, thought provoking, profound","review":"When I read a K. Porter story, I go to bed thinking about it, and I wake up the next morning thinking about it. Stories like \\"He,\\" \\"Flowering Judas,\\" and \\"Noon Wine\\" make the reader think twice, then again, about his/her reaction to the story. In \\"Noon Wine,\\" for example, a murder (or an accident, depending upon how you look at it) occurs on small Texas dairy farm. Porter masterfully lets us get inside the characters' minds and forces us to re-examine our feelings about emotion, anger, death, and love. \\"He\\" is a brilliant examination of the effect of a mentally impaired boy on his family (notably the mother). Porter's prose glides like a well-oiled lever, but she is never satisfied with dealing with events and human emotions just on the surface. She is among the greats. Also check out her full-length novel, Ship of Fools."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Modernist","review":"Katherine Ann Porter seems to me to combine the strengths of Hemingway and Faulkner. I haven't read enough Faulkner, but that seems like it might be right. This book is definitely a worthwhile read. The language is rich and engaging and at times humourous. My favorite story was Noon Wine. There is a beautiful section where Mr. Hatch, the bounty hunter comes looking for Mr. Helton, and he tells Mr. Thompson the words to the song that Mr. Helton had been playing on his harmonica. That moment is really well written, and it stayed in mind because what happens next knocked me breathless."},{"rating":"1","title":"AN EXAMPLE OF POOR LITERARY KNOLEDGE","review":"THIS BOOK SHOWS HOW THE AUTHOR KATHERINE PORTER HAD LITTLE WRITTING SKILLS THAT COULD BE ACKNOLEDGED"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I was looking for...","review":"I was concerned when I ordered this as there was nothing in the description about how many zippers or how it attaches to your gazebo.

I bought a gazebo that did not come with netting so this worked perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst yet","review":"This is by far the worst Suicide Machines album yet. On this album, the band manages to combine the worst elements of Battle Hymns and their self-titled album. The album lacks the energy of Battle Hymns, or the poppy sing-along qualities of their last effort. Many songs sound like recycled versions of Green Day or Thunk tunes. For those who were hoping that the Suicide Machines would return to their roots of fun ska-punk, this album is a let-down."},{"rating":"1","title":"not too good","review":"when i bought this cd, i was hoping for a comeback of sorts from their last cd(wasnt very good at all). i was disapointed. there are a good songs but the bad outweighs the good. the biggest dissapointment is that there is NO ska at all. there is a bad reggae song(stand up), but no real ska. its all punk, some good some awful. its sad how far they have fallen.... from near perfection to this. it is better than their self titled \\"thing\\" but not much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I am very unhappy with this book but it is my fault as I didn't realize it is an answer key.

This band is very mature and gave an energetic and exciting musical performance here. The CD is immensely satisfying to listen to if you groove to modern rock and a great addition to any music lover's collection. To sample this album you shouldn't rely on the clips above. In my humblest opinion, the best tracks, in the order that I like to listen them, are: \\"Animal\\"(clip above), \\"El Duelo\\" (I'd say this song sets the standard), \\"Intenta Amar\\", \\"Fuera De Mi\\", \\"Aqui\\", \\"Al Final\\", \\"Paraiso\\", \\"Prisioneros de Piel\\", \\"La Luna\\", \\"Krazyworld\\", \\"Dia Cero\\", \\"Mentira\\"...etc. Great album. Other features to be appreciated include an amazing guest star singer (Ely Guerra) who lent her surreal vocals to the phenomenal tracks \\"El Duelo\\" and \\"Al Final\\", and the enthusiastic responses from the audience.

Read was a fascinating character truly worthy of a first-class biography. Unfortunately, this book is not it. The research is superficial and relies on hearsay, fairy tale, and wishful thinking. The author relies heavily on recollections and legends told by Read's descendants, he lacks a working knowledge of the naval aspects of the war, and his text is filled with numerous mistakes of fact. These errors are often the result of lazy research since most can be verified through the Official Records or the surviving Confederate naval records. Where the primary sources are nonexistent the author has no trouble making things up to fill in the blanks. It is a travesty and worthwhile only as an example of fiction masquerading as fact.

The book helped me to realise, as an Australian, how the United States has been at the cutting edge of conscience to obliterate the indignity of racial prejudice. The europeans would not allow slavery in europe, but they dumpted slaves in their colonies - but it was the United States where conscience has gradually overcome economics to systematically the inhumanity of slavery and racial prejudice.

I also found it cheeper other places."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Projection Clock","review":"I use this clock everyday. It not only shows the time also tells you outside temperature. I project the clock on the ceiling. When I feel lazy to wakeup in the morning, I will look it up on the ceiling to decide if I can sleep little more instead of using annoying alarm clock to wake me up. The projection light is not annoying bright and the light is enough to see the time and temperature. Overall I like this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than some of the others","review":"I have 2 other projection alarm clocks. This has a display adjustment. The weather part of the clock has been right on. Being able to brighten time is a plus to my others. Plus being able to project time, outside temp in the winter but show only the time in the summer is great. No room for improvement on this product. Maybe wind speed would be nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sender didn't work","review":"Unable to connect with outside sensor.

Light intensity on the ceiling is easily read without being too bright. Standard LED clocks are brighter. Follow directions exactly as written and all is well. Buttons are sensitive, so be very careful when handling the clock during set up. It is wonderful to be able to look to the ceiling and get the time and temprature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take a gamble","review":"We bought this alarm clock because we liked the ceiling projection and the indoor/outdoor temperature readings. I've been very happy with those features. However, the alarms (both of them) will randomly stop working for a few days and then randomly start up again. Sometimes an alarm will go off and we'll hit snooze and it won't go off again. We've had to get a 2nd back-up alarm and set it just in case. Annoying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read Book","review":"Ms. Dimitra as a incomparable talent for creating a compelling passionate page turner.

The author presents a lot of information in about 300 pages filled with helpful examples. The screen shots are easy to follow and understand. However, may be because of cost reduction, the book is not in color, a feature that needed in graphic books.

I have been a fan of Phil Coulter's for a very long time and have liked everything that I had heard him do, until this.

I was in an overseas boarding school then which involved many emotions since I was away from home. This album always calm me down no matter how I was feeling, whether I was sad or angry or even lonely. Even my brother who hardly touched my CDs secretly listened to it and even got himself a copy. I'm glad I had the chance to listen to it. It's definitely worth it to get this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful and haunting melodies","review":"This an album with beautiful and haunting melodies delivered in Phil Coulter's smooth, harmonic style.

I highly recommend it as one of the most soulful of Coulter's albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST","review":"This is my most favorite album.

And for that reason alone, this is a CD worth having. But there are some real winners on this CD - 'From' a High Window' is a complex, heart-rending insight into letting love go, and then questioning your actions. 'Last of the Working Stetson's is one of the saddest and most honest views into depression that I've ever heard. 'Joy of Living' is simple, beautiful, deep and satisfying. 'Row of Small Trees' is wordy and overwrought, but still beautiful, the violin is exceptional - an poignant and perceptive examination of the process of grief, but listen to the same song also on the CD Summer Lightning where it is paired with a live version of 'Outside Track' - that is a perfect combination if ever I heard one. 'Election Night' is politically dated, but remarkably still pertinent as if the powerful, disturbing 'Young Willie'. Get it! You will be satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the Canon Brand.","review":"I read the product description (says it uses the same mold as the factory) and bought the product only to send it back. I found it functions the same but does not place the batteries in the same area. The batteries are placed into the side of the battery Grip. There is only one plastic door latch that holds the batteries in place.I felt it was to flimsy (for the weight of the batteries) and not the same as the canon model. The canon Grip has two catches that hold the each rechargeable battery and the door latch in the back of the grip. The Canon Grip feels more durable is more robust. The batteries are better secured by the extra latches compared to opteka's single plastic battery door."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Money !","review":"Having owned a previous Canon battery grip I expected a cheap imitation. No so! This is a quality grip and works great! The batteries seem to be a high quality product as well. I would definitely recommend and buy this product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"decent alternative","review":"With no real experience with the Canon brand I find this a fine alternate. The only issues I've had are in cold weather conditions where the batteries need to be under an armpit to warm up. Not sure if this is specific to this brand or overall. But much less expensive, even with 2 batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best little Hoodoo Herb book on Amazon","review":"Use this with Judika Illes' 5000 Spell book and you've got a winning combination.

That was until I read it. Where I thought this would be more of an indepth analysis of the root botannicals used by African American slaves in their spiritual practices. Rather the book focuses on \\"magical\\" information much of which is culled from the author's own research. Some of her conclusions appeared to be quite a stretch yet I do find some of the information in it worthwhile. You're better off mining her website for free than to spend the money and buy this book that is unless your interest lies in \\"magic\\" and the supernatural."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Hyatte Rip Off/Not The First of it's Kind","review":"This book is base of Harry Middleton Hyatte( I'm not sure if I spelled that Right). The book is a complete rip off of this Author. It is not traditional Hoodoo rootwork either. The Author has flooded the web with her web site and it's all Hyattes work. What she has done is read Hyatte and claims to be a Hoodoo exspert? She has no family background in Hoodoo and even spent time in prison. A complete con. The informants Hyatte used you could never tell if they were reliable and the works are very ebonic and impossible to understand. The author has kinda filled in the blanks. The spells don't work either in her book LOL.You would be better buying magickal formular Or you could could buy some Hyatte Books and claim to be an exspert craft some oils off that after being released from prison to make a living.LOL"},{"rating":"2","title":"A valuable resource with hard to find information","review":"When I began to study Hoodoo, I was on the Lucky Mojo site alot. That's where I found out about this book. I was really looking for comprehensive and hard to find information about how herbs are used in Hoodoo.And I was delighted! This is a terrific resource. The book is organized alphabetically by herb. Along with it is a valuable cross-reference of common folk names for herbs. So many herbs I had been reading about, turns out I can get them at the bulk section of the health food store!Yronwode also gives recipes, formulas, and much other magical information in the book. It is jam packed with so much information, I read it for 5 days straight.I would recommend this to anyone interested in the magical use of herbs, not just Hoodoo practitioners. I believe anyone can benefit from learning the folk use of these herbs, whether you practice Hoodoo, Wicca, Shamanism, or a mix of whatever. It broadens your understanding of the plants tremendously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Leave Home Without It","review":"Simply put, this is a fantastic reference book. I do not come from a Hoodoo and Conjure background, my spell-working is a combination of Neo-European and Middle Eastern. However, this book really extended my knowledge in working with many roots, herbs, etc., that I've never worked with before, and therefore, I've been able to include the use of many of these herbs and roots in my magickal repertoire. When I go herb and root shopping I always take this book with me. Just like that Credit Card that I personally never used, when it comes to this book, however, I never leave home without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A treasure.","review":"This book is not only the only credible materia magica of the Hoodoo tradition, it is the best herbal magic book in print.

Cathering Yronwood does an awesome job."},{"rating":"2","title":"This novel is a miracle -- it's even better than Proust","review":"As Gide pointed out, this is probably the only French novel worthy to be considered in a list of the ten greatest novels ever written.Stendhal wrote it in about 50 days after shutting himself away and refusing visitors the whole time. The result is an absolute wonder of narrative, with the ingenuity and magic of a fairy-tale spanning 500 pages.Don't be put off if you didn't like The Red and the Black; in France, people have sometimes been divided up into Rougists (those who swear by the Red & Black) and Carthusians, and truly, the two could hardly be more different.Read it: this book lives and breathes."},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating","review":"The ideas in this book spark a lot of interest: magic, a bishop with a son (who's not even a bastard!), a suppresed race, a kingdom on the brink of war...all revolving around the nobility, church, and royal family of Gwynedd. For anyone who loves midevil fantasy and magic, this book is a must-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Interesting twist","review":"AS one of Mrs. Kurtz biggest fans, i have to say i was pleasantly surprised with the twists of this novel. With the intruduction of Dhugal as a main characters, and managing to tie him in to the \\"family\\" so nicely was simply amazing.

They are very expensive for the 20-30 minutes it takes to read. Many illustrations/photos in this book are small and difficult to see. (ie. making a jig for crown). There is no inormation on casing a door which the title includes. I know that it is the same as a window, however, the author does not mention this.No info on ending a moulding mid-way by making a return.No info on crown for a vaulted ceiling. I returned the book.Yes, I learned one or two things, however, the book title:\\"Trim Carpentry and Built-Ins: Expert Advice from Start to Finish\\" is not Expert or Finish.It should be: Trim Carpentry and ?: Advice from Start .....\\"by Clayton Dekorne"},{"rating":"1","title":"Questionable knowledge","review":"I ordered this book after its cover caught my attention and I read some reviews, but after reading it I returned it to Amazon. The author displayed pictures of using a table saw with the blade tilted towards the fence and ripping a board. This is a very dangerous thing to do and exposes the operator to being seriously injured. Saw manufacturers state in their safe operations sections to never operate a saw in this manner. Another item in the book speaks about wood movement. It is stated that coping reduces the likehood of gaps in mitered corners over a mitered cut due to wood movement or shrinkage. Wood does move in width but never in length. Wood cell structure takes on water as we take on calories and expand. We don't get taller when we gain weight we get wider and so does wood. Also, fine furniture mollding is never coped it is always mitered and there are never gaps during any season."},{"rating":"2","title":"scottwm review unfair","review":"The reviewer, scottwm, has a right not to like this book, but he does a disservice by misleading potential readers. Mr. DeKorne does discuss how to terminate a mouding (p. 58), and yes, he does'nt cover crown for a vaulted ceiling, but this is like saying a book on building paper airplanes doesn't cover jet engines -- it's one of the more difficult carpentry tasks. Indeed, anyone trying it is advised to build a horizontal shelf and install conventional crown below it as a way to trim this difficult junction. But the point is, this is hardly a slight to this excellent carpentry book. What's great about DeKorne's work here is that it's not full a minutia that bogs a reader down in unnessary detail, but get's right ot the heart of doing the work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book - to the point","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

As a result, I didn't have much money to spend on a sub, but I needed a replacement for my 8-inch sub- which I thought was sufficient to do the job until it blew. I did a lot of research for the best bang for my buck and decided this was it. I didn't realize how much of an upgrade this was until I opened the box to see the sheer size of this sub compared to what I had before. I had to sit down and have a good laugh before I could continue. Then I plugged it in.... I set the volume to a little over halfway and watched one of my favorite WWII movies. Within minutes, my neighbor frantically knocked on my door to see if something was blowing up in my house. For the price, this sub totally blew me away- figuratively and literally.

This subwoofer has great deep and strong bass which gives you an amazing experience when watching movies or listening to dance music. It fits perfectly to my Onkyo home cinema system and also has a very stylish design with black wood and silver metal around the speaker. I have heard much more expensive 12 inches subwoofers, and I really didn't see any difference with this one. I guess for a normal living room and not for a studio, you will never really need a better one. For sure it's worth its money. I am living in Greece and I saw it first time while I was in Philippines. Finally I bought it from the US. It's really pity that this Venue series is not yet available in Europe. JBL should treat European market better giving us such a kind of amazing products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Boom","review":"For a room of 220 s.f., this 12\\"-500 watt unit was too much, but it has an intensity control to soften the blow for times when booming bass is not desired.

None of the advice or information applies to a baby.Second of all, this is geared more towards people who feel like they are the only one with a spirited child.

She answered rather quickly and was extemely pleasant and approachable.This book is a must for any parent who has a child who is just a little different and you can't quite figure out what to do.

I sincerely hope Burger King and McDonald's paid her for every time she pimped them as part of a reward system for kids.I mostly took away from this book the following:I cannot change my child. Raising her will be harder than my other child. I can empathize more (hello, Art of Happiness) and I can predict her to a point and try to keep her level and in charge of herself.

Her vivid descriptions of her own family and her mother are the best parts of this book. The historical accounts of women from antebellum times to present are interesting, though not quite as engrossing as her own recollections. It is impossible not to regret the passing of an era in the south as one reads this book and realizes the complexities of women who were so often deemed simple hillbillies. Many women, like myself, who grew up in small southerns towns will recognize their own experiences as they follow the author's. I know I did. On occasion, Ms. Abbott wanders off into feminist interpretations that could get a little harsh. I didn't agree with all of her conclusions, but I really enjoyed reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Re-recordings","review":"The disc I received is a K-Tel disc with a completely different song selection than what's listed here, though the disc has the same title.

This particular cd contains only 3 original versions out of the 16 tracks present. All 13 of the other tracks are REMADE by the original artists.

The best part is the more I listened to the CD, The more I didn't sweat the small stuff. Didn't harbor bad energy.

The music of the harp is so soothing and the instructions are so clear and easy, I find myself on such an incredible journey each time I use it.

And was it ever worth it! Several other reviewers have already given the plot summary, so I won't. The quality of the Blu-ray DVD is superior to the version I had seen, but the best part about the DVDs was the extra footage. BBC America cuts down some programs to add in commercials, and watching the complete program was like watching a different show. I started at the beginning and just kept going. In fact, I got so caught up in it that I watched the last four episodes back to back to back, ending around 2:00 a.m. I found it riveting, and I found myself holding my breath from time to time because of the suspense. If you think you've seen The Hour on BBC America, you haven't. I can't recommend the DVD highly enough.

The content was minor and could be summarized in a page or two. It really never really gets to answer the question. It dies in the details of specific examples, instead of teaching general principles. It is full of contradictions and inconsistencies. There are numerous unstated assumptions. I do believe this is the worst offender in this area I have ever experienced in a book.The style of this book is more that of a rough draft of a book idea. I have never seen so many type-o-graphical errors, grammar mistakes, awkward wording and failed typesetting in my life.

Works fine at the lowest power (5X), but the zoom function only works on the right lens! I'm assuming a got a defective unit -- at least I would hope so. The objective lenses are so tiny (17mm) that at the highest power (15X), the image is so dark it's hardly visible anyway. I checked the manufacturer's \\"Warranty Procedure\\" notice enclosed and it says I have to return the item at my expense and even enclose a check to them for $12.00 to cover the cost of handling! This is no way to do business -- unless, of course, you're selling crappy merchandise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wished I could have loved it.","review":"These bino's are small compact and lightweight. Unfortunately, due to the small diameter opening of the lens, they are very dark in all but bright sunlight. Not very helpful if you are using them in an Arena or Stadium indoors, at night or on a cloudy day. Also for me, they never seemed clear. Everything always looked a little cloudy or fuzzy. Never super sharp. The magnification was great, but for their small size, any movement you have, is also magnified in the bino's. I think you can find better for the price.

I like how the author touches on some science related to composting but does not overwhelm you with it. The author keeps it simple with just the facts you will need to create your own compost.I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking to get into composting. This is more for compost piles and not to be confused with vermicompost. Although the author touches on vermicompost in the book, you are better off looking for a book dedicated to pure vermicomposting, then \\"Let it Rot!\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless Detail","review":"I am a beginning composter and wanted a \\"how to\\" guide that was direct and functional. This is not it. The author spends too much time expounding on details that have little functional application. One wonders if his ojective is to impress the audience with the extent of his esoteric knowledge and intelligence. Indulging such ego needs at the expense (and waste) of the readers money and valuable time is a disservice.

If you like ragas, ambient grooves, trance and devotional chants then you are in for a treat because Rik Sharaj is a shamanic sitarist, guitarist, singer and keyboardist who spent ten years in India studying and playing with top musicians. The result is a transcendental hypnotic journey with Rik accompanied by cello, tablas, violin, kalidoscope, pakhawaj, yucca didjeridoo, bengalis khol drom, bansuri flute, tanboura and other instruments played by both American and Indian musicians.There are eight tracks ranging in length from 2:53 for One Global Village to 13:29 for Govindam Adi Purusham. Every track is a treat. I endlessly play this album. It is superb and truly enjoyable. Thank you Rik."},{"rating":"1","title":"Realy isn't all that great.","review":"This movie isn't all that great. The story is hard to follow, and doesn't make much sense even if you've played the game. The aminamtions are really good, but are a bit off sometimes. The humans look stiff and movement at times doesn't really look all that great. I also hate the fact that the movie wasn't in HD. The copy I was received was in 480p.

If you have no knowledge of the franchise prepare to be lost, in fact even with knowledge of the franchise you will be lost.The story is unintelligible, making the Super Mario Bros. movie look amazing by comparison. The animation is bad, the humans look way to stiff at so many moments you'd think they were robots. It's a bad movie by bad filmmakers, avoid in all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Positives:- I thought the CGI was quite good all things considered. If you really like CGI, it's probably worth watching just for the eye candy. The facial expressions are a little robotic and they can't seem to do wet characters (people standing in the rain, looking perfectly dry for some reason). But overall, good I thought.- Voice acting was good.Negatives:- The plot is so ridiculous you give up trying to follow it about 15 minutes in. FFVII Advent Children had a much more cohesive plot by comparison.- For a fighting movie, it's more than 50% teenage girl angst. No joke. Fight scenes are ok, but not as good was I was hoping.- The \\"lesson\\" is really heavy-handed and trite. Humans shouldn't fight each other. Revenge is destructive. Respect the earth.

How come they couldn't work out the deeds of this dirty little sociopath and figure out what Tom Ripley was up to.I don't want to spoil it for anyone but the last six of seven actions of Ripley and discoveries of the police, in my view, point right to Tom Ripley.By the end I just wanted it to be over.

The hero is the villan, an unusual twist to the thriller mystery novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written","review":"The novel is well written and I enjoyed reading it. I think the story has something very extravagant and is, psychologically seen, such a great work of art. The story is interesting because of the variability of the different people. The different characters are well constructed but in a way not as realistic as in the book.Tom Ripley is a man with too high ambitions but he can't realise his dreams so easily in this world.I think the aspect of seeing through the eyes of the protagonist is nothing special but through the eyes of a criminal. It's very interesting and a great challenge not to lose sight of the right side of life and the importance of the relations between important and true friends. In a way the story aims at the global world constellation because of the relations among the various points of power in the world, like the \\"good\\" and the \\"bad\\" people or the way how you succeed in your life.But altogether it's a thrilling story which I can recommend to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"So many ways to improve","review":"(...) It is pretty straight forward and easy to understand, BUT there are no answers for the exercises in the back of the book. My professor never asked us to turn in exercises from this book so the exercises were useless since there was no knowing if you'd done them correctly.

I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pius the 12th silent?","review":"This book claims that Pope Pius the 12th and the Catholic Church, for the most part were silent during the Holocaust. In a way that is true. The Pope learned early in the war that to speak out against the Nazis only brought about more severe retributions. Even leading Jewish clerics warned him not to do so. Instead he acted behind the scenes to save the lives of Jews, Gypsies, and others. He ordered Vatican buildings,convents and monasteries to hide and protect these hunted human beings from being slaughtered to the best of his ability. He ordered false baptismal and Communion documents to be printed up and given to these oppressed people. He even provided money and gold of his own to purchase freedom for some. Lets remember that the Vatican itself was an occupied country during the war. The fact that the Pope and the Catholic Church saved as many as 800,000 Jews during the war speaks volumns in itself.Would that the rest of the world had been as silent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unprofessional","review":"This is a neat idea, to explore color usage and meaning around the world. But the authors, a writer and public relations specialist, don't demonstrate the know a thing about the subject matter. Mistakes abound everywhere. South Korea is illustrated with Singapore's flag, Germany's flag is upside down, unrelated countries are lumped together. Rather than showing locally produced graphics to illustrate color usage, the authors show paper cups from Starbucks to show Kenya and Costa Rica color usage. While the book is subtitled \\"designing with color for the international market\\", the examples are often U.S. designs that will never set foot in the international market. Even Mexico, which surely has plenty of good graphic designers, is illustrated with only U.S. designs for tourist brochures, Starbucks (again) and a Mexican theme party. The publisher should be scolded for not excercising any editorial judgement."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are they thinking?","review":"Just one question.

Like most live performances from any band, they mix it up a little and don't copy the studio recordings note for note, but that's ok with me as long as the timing and sound is good and in this DVD/concert it is great. The only thing I would change (if I could) is the quickly changing camera shots (mostly in the beginning of the DVD) and add some songs off the new CD \\"Born Into This\\" (although they weren't performing the songs back in Nov. 06). The fact that the Cult records and sells every show tells me they will probably put a DVD out for every tour. Why not?! It's clear to see they take pride in their performances and there are very few bands I'll pay money to see or even buy their music/DVDs.

I got it to learn about the newest version of Visual Basic and its newest features. All the writer does is tells you all the bad things about it. He claims to have written many books on the subject but he doesn't even know what IDE stands for (see page 23).

Get it, study it, learn from it, execute it.Being a 6'3\\" guy with long arms and long legs, why would I want to swing my club like Craig Stadler? Or like Ben Hogan for that matter. I'm an Ernie Els built person and should swing according to who I am.That is what this book deals with. Build your swing around who you are - your strengths and weaknesses. I can't count how many times I read about my specific swing (arc) and said \\"yes! yes! that's me! that's how I swing and where my faults are!\\"I took this swing out to a 9 holer on Sunday and turned my drives and fairway woods into straight shots, and you don't know what a change that is for a banana baller like me. I finally feel like I have the keys I need to make a repeatable swing. In times past I'd drive it straight, but didn't know why. What did I do right? How can I repeat it?With this book I now know WHAT I did right and HOW I can repeat it.Can't ask for much more than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I read the same book!","review":"I thought this book was very, very difficult to follow. There are not enough photos for the descriptions that the author tries to portray. He explains how to grip the club, but doesn't have a photo to show you exactly how to do it. There are practice tips in the book, but again, photos are missing. Also, trying to follow the body type test proved to be a challenge. There were several details left out and I ended up guessing on what the author meant. Again, a person cannot rely solely on the text when learning something so physical as golf. Even Ben Hogan stuggled to match the text with pictures(5 lessons). A person (a least me) requires a lot of photos to understand exact positioning of hands, legs, feet, etc..This book gave me some things to try, but it is not the ultimate golf swing book as far as I'm concerned. I don't think that Mike Adams revealed any hidden secrets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea...but...","review":"All three of the authors have great credentials and the idea is a good one. However, the neat of the book is like eating an overcooked thanksgiving turkey. It looks great but is very dry. I like the idea ofbody types and the authors give great examples of PGA pros who fit all 3 types so that we can fit ourselves into the types. I found the content to be too technical while trying to be reader friendly. It reads a lot like Nick Bradley's 7 Laws of the Golf Swing looks like in illustrations. It just has too much information to absorb. Better luck next time.For a good book try Bob Rotella's Golf is not a Game of Perfect and Pia Nihlson's Every Shot Must Have a Purpose.

I recommend it.It makes more sense to have played Post Mortem before this, but I doubt that it would make a difference if you haven't. Besides, Post Mortem is not the most fun I thought (but it's not too bad).Still Life was REALLY good & I can't wait for the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Careful! StarForce protection installs on your system!","review":"Still Life has a StarForce copy protection scheme which completely spoiled the experience for me. It installs in a separate folder from the game, and caused havoc with my very ordinary system. Five different programs (games and demos) would not run and load. Realizing what the cause might be, I quickly played through the game using a walkthrough, found it to be a \\"B\\" level title, and uninstalled it. StarForce needs a separate unistallation or it stays on your system and continues to cause problems.The game is simply not worth that kind of hassle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"just another adventure game\\"","review":"I concur with Derek. There's really nothing standout about this game. You've seen almost all of the puzzles before, some of which are particularly irrelevant to the plot. The voice acting is pretty good and the dialogue is just so-so...and both are downright poor with respect to the parts of the game that take place in 1920's Prague. (Neither the characters' vocabulary or dialect suggest they're from anywhere but present-day America.) And the story of hunting down a serial killer has been done to death. But the graphics are beautiful, especially the in-game paintings (which are central to the game), and the decked-out killer himself.If you want an innovative adventure game that broadens your horizons, check out The Indigo Prophecy (aka Fahrenheit)--which actually is another serial killer story, but much more interesting in every way--or, even better, get Grim Fandango."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Life","review":"This was a very good mysterypuzzles were not off the wall, ie, some game puzzles have no logic and can only be solved by using walkthroughs.there were no game glitches, every thing worked as it should."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original, cool and creepy","review":"Today I find that there are many more adventure games out there, but the quality of them has gone down. Many games seem to mirror other adventure games and lack originality or just plain suck with a weak plot and bad gameplay. I picked up Still Life looking for a unique police themed adventure game...but what I got was much more. The plot is very original and the game always keep you guessing as you go deeper into the murder mystery. Switching from Victoria and Gus in the Present to the Past keeps the game is extremely effective. Still Life is a quality adventure game that will please any adventure game fanatic.(I only discovered today that \\"Post Mortem\\" was the prequel and I bought it right as soon as I found out.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"Wow what a great game!

It sounded great. I wish I kept the box so I could return it. It gives different music arrangements. and the remote is a catchy idea but what for? If they'refalling asleep the music needs to be very low to be soothing, if they play wiit a bit louder. So, you have to go in the room anyway. My 9 mo. old bangs his hands on it tuning rock-a-bye-baby on and off 50 times, so annoying. It's durability is it's best feature. Want music in your childs room? Put a CD on continuous play. Want the educational purposes, give him a busy box. Save your $$$$"},{"rating":"2","title":"All in all a good toy...","review":"We received this toy when my daughter was about 5 weeks old. She was scared of it at first. Her lower lip would quiver and she wanted nothing to do with it. It took her about a week to decide that she liked it. I decided to hang it on her changing table instead of her crib because I needed something to keep her occupied as I changed her. She is now almost 3 months old and loves this toy. She even has gotten the hang of hitting the botton by herself to start the music. I also love this toy because it keeps her occupied long enough while she is getting changed that changing her diaper or clothes is no longer a stuggle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks fun so far","review":"We have only had the toy for 1 month and our son is only 3 months old. So, it is kind of early to write the final review. However, so far, it has kept him interested in his crib - even for the long version (which I think is 10 songs). The lights and songs together make a great combination. I was even thinking of getting one to go to the babysitters, so it would be more familiar to him.Hope this helps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Think ahead...","review":"One thing you might want to keep in mind... How sensitive are your child's senses? My son loved this toy when we first showed it to him at 3 months of age. He liked the music and lights, for about 10 minutes. After that, he was completely bored. Then, one night as he rolled around, he hit the button that starts it, and we couldn't get him to stop crying for about 5 minutes. When the music plays, the lights also go. His cozy, peaceful crib was transformed into a noisy place with lights flashing at him. Yikes! Also, at 6 months old, he broke it. Didn't seem that durable to me..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A miracle in the form of a plastic toy.","review":"This is late in coming as my son is now 4.5 years old, but about 4 years ago at this time I was a mom with frazzled nerves. My baby would not sleep anywhere except in my arms and I was exhausted. We'd tried the aquarium one and it had no effect on him. I ordered one of these and it came in the mail one day right before i left to go to a Dr appt. I put it on the crib and put my baby in there and he layed and looked at it. Left for my Dr appt and came back to a sleeping baby. My husband said he had fallen asleep right away and slept for a long time. From that night on, he slept in his crib and if he woke in the night, I'd push the remote button and he'd go back to sleep. If I had another child, this would be one of the first things I'd buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real winner!","review":"My daughter has been using her's for about 13 months now- I bought it when she was 10 months old. She absolutely loves this toy! She can't go to sleep without it, we even had to take it with us on our family trip to Peru. Now I'm ready to buy one for me 3 month old son, but unfortunately they don't seem to have any right now. The only thing I would change is that the lights doesn't light up when you use the nature sounds setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best slumber-time music box out there!","review":"I love this music box! The music is so soothing. You can choose from a single song played repeatedly, a medly of songs, or nature sounds. It turns on with one touch of a button - no loud cranking. My baby's mobile played for only 1-2 minutes - he was never asleep that fast! This music box plays for 10 minutes, and you can restart it from the doorway with the remote if baby isn't asleep yet. The volume control is wonderful - most music boxes and mobiles are much too loud. My son loved watching the lights early on and still loves it at 9 months. Now he knows how to turn it on himself, and sometimes even goes back to sleep! We take it on all our overnight trips to have a little piece of home."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son LOVES it!","review":"When my son was 3 months old, I tried EVERYTHING to help him (and myself) sleep better. He would wake up all the time during the night & couldn't fall back to sleep on his own, until I bought this soother. Everytime I turn it on he just stares at it and falls asleep. I have tried many soothers and this is the only one that lasts more than 5 minutes at a time. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who child has difficulty falling asleep on their own. My son is now 7 months old and still enjoys it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bedtime toy for baby!","review":"I bought this when my son was 4 months old. He's now 18 months and still loves it! In fact he turns it on himself when I put him in his crib. It lights up really well, and has many different ways to play it. Ranging from playing just one song at a time, to playing several minutes worth of songs. It also has nature sounds you can play too. At first I thought the music and nature sounds sounded too \\"computery\\", but my son still liked it. There is a volume control too which is great! It comes with a remote control, but I never use it. The only negative thing I can say is that it eat batteries up pretty quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Remote doen't work in all angles !!!!!","review":"Actually it is really a brillant idea of having a remote on a regular crib music toy with light. The Slumbertime Soother is nicely design and will lights up when the music plays. Differnet songs has a differnt light patterns. The only problem is the remote doesn't works in all angles. You have to make sure that the remote is pointing directly towards the sensor in orderr to tuen on the toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"I bought this for my closet and it has been a pain since I put it up.

It also appears to be disigned better to seal out the elements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great camera, if it works!!","review":"This camera is small, nice looking, has good pictures, and cheap ($399 including freight). I was very happy. However, like some of the other users, it broke down after about 30 minutes of use. It keeps prompting for heading cleaning and I know the head is dirty because blocks of noise appear during playback. It happens especially bad during LP mode. Why???Needless to say, I am disappointed. I have also thrown away some of the package (manual in French, registration card, etc.) If the seller won't give me full credit because of this, I can only have JVC repair it. But according to my past experience, once they open up a camcorder, only more troubles to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapionted","review":"Even though this camcorder has many great functions, I was disappointed that I had a dirty head warning after the first 60 minutes of use. Not what I expect after spending 650+. The recorder was new (sealed box). Trying to get the recording on a VCR is also giving me problems. It may be my TV and VCR are Multi-system units but I don't think that's the problem. I am fair with the cable connections and expected immediate success. Things should not be so tough. I have been able to watch the movies connecting directly to the TV though and like the quality of the picture. I'm sure I will get it going and hope head cleaning is not required every 60 minutes of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ticked Off","review":"Hi:I have had the same experience as the other two reviewers that had the \\"Clean Heads\\" warning appear after only a few minutes of use.

This unit had no hum in the audio but the blue cast was still there when using HDMI from the Sony DVD player. It was not the DVD player because when I hooked the HDMI from the DVD player directly to my TV everything was perfect. I am very disappointed in this unit.

First HDMI in/out, and second for the ability to 'up-convert' non-hd components such as a TiVo Series 1 or 2 or a VCR. While the receiver works great, I was sadly surprised that it doesn't actually upscale the signal from 480i to 1080i, which is what I really wanted. Up-converting is basically the ability to change the cable output from S-Video or composite video to HDMI. I only just figured out that what I really wanted was an 'Upscaling' receiver (which is more $$$ of course). The quality out via HDMI at 480i is the same as if I had just kept an S-Video cable attached to the TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good receiver, but has video problems","review":"I like this amp but it causes my TV (Sharp Aquos 42\\" LCD) to lose synch whenever the video has a sudden white flashes (NFL sports transitions, War of the Worlds death-beam blasts, Drawn Together transitions, explosions, stuff like that). The synch loss takes about 5 or so seconds for my particular TV to recover from, which is pretty annoying. When I had the problem I searched the web and found that numerous others had similar problems with this and other Onkyo receiver models, but Onkyo doesn't seem to acknowledge the issue. It's a good receiver, but if you buy it save the packing for a few weeks just in case it causes problems for your TV as well. Given that these problems seem to have been around for a good year or more and Onkyo isn't fixing them, I can only give this 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oracle wait event interfaces","review":"I have to say that i find all books (i bought 4 all about oracle performance) from rampant press under average from the quality point of view.

We went on a 2,500 mile 'road trip' vacation recently and I bought this thinking it would entertain them for part of the trip. It turned out to be my 11 year olds 'go to' disk. I think he only watched 1 other movie during the trip. None of us minded wether or not he kept his earphones on or not because we had fun listening along while he watched. About halfway through the trip he realized he could turn on the subtitles so now I think he knows the words to most all of the songs (at least his favorites!)It's a FUN DVD that can take up as much or as little of your time as you have to watch.

I also love \\"Jurassic Park\\" (parody MacArthur Park), \\"Gump\\", \\"The Saga Begins\\", \\"Amish Paradise\\", \\"Bedrock Anthem\\", and \\"Smells Like Nirvana\\". His original videos are fun too, especially the songs ones he wrote for movies; \\"UHF\\"(from UHF), \\"This is The Life\\"(from Johnny Dangerously), and \\"Spy Hard\\"(from Spy Hard). My absolute favorite from the collection though would have to be \\"Bob\\". Everything about it is simply perfect.The attention to detail in all of the videos is remarkable.

Why not just have the book come with this? There also aren't very many pages, but I suppose it is just for baby puppies and doesn't cover some of the topics that could be considered for slightly more grown up puppies.

Far too many authors do this, and for me, it fogs the story. Patrick Davis tells a good tale (we hope) filled with a bit of espionage and a bit of good raw human feelings for those they love and their past loves as well. His descriptions of the Colonel's former wife show intrigue, hate and still the love and admiration of another human being you've shared your life with, allowing the character to feel all of these things with no reciminations. And he keeps you guessing right up to the last sentence of the book. An all around excellent story! I'm now going to look for more from this great author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enthralling military thriller, keeps you turning the pages!","review":"OK, so the pro critics have some problems with Davis's characterizations. However, as an active duty AF officer I think Davis prior service makes his authenticity on the money for the most part. Some military novelists leave me groaning with their numerous errors and faux pas. Davis is adept at making you turn the page, particularly transitioning from chapter to chapter. At night I tell my wife, \\"I'll come to bed at the end of this chapter\\" and generally mean it. With \\"The General\\" and now with \\"The Passenger\\" Davis makes me a liar. He is masterful at leading you to the next piece of the story compelling you to keep going. I can put Clancy's stuff down and forget it for months, not so Davis.

He loves the blade saw with the realistic sound effects, and the fact that he can hammer in nails and screw in screws.

This little charger definitely exceeded my expectations.I recently used this charger on an out-of-state car trip. Even with streaming audio or using the GPS function of the phone, the charger still filled up the battery really quickly.The only con I have noticed is that plugging in the charger tends to create a high-pitched whine on certain AM radio stations, but I've found this to be a common problem with any car charger.I purchased this item directly from Amazon, so perhaps that's why I didn't receive an incorrect item as others have reported.

Mendez was a pioneer for the start of many efforts to save the rain forests. Unfortunately, his efforts were cut short when the son of a cattle rancher shot and killed him at his home.

If you want to read an over inflated ego that loves to try and shock you by exaggerating and/or embellishing on unsupported or extremely dated information, then by all means read this man's books. If, on the other hand, you want something that is alot more factual and substantial, then stay away. If I need drama in my life, I just watch the Bravo channel on tv, I don't turn to tabloid style trite that tries to pass itself off as serious research/advice. A.J. hasn't had a serious relationship in years, so I can think of alot more advantageous sources of relationship information for Pagan couples out there.For the record, I am not a large fan of Buckland either, but at least he doesn't try to be sensational and controversial just for the attention. Maybe A.J. should write for the Enquirer or Sun, those publications seem more his style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly Awful","review":"I was shocked and severely disappointed that this book actually had very little to do with developing a family tradition and more to do with two things:1.

As a guitar player, I know a good guitarist when I hear one and John Mayer IS a talented guitar player. John Mayer may be a passable guitarist, but he is a horrible singer and a mediocre songwriter...I think he stinks. He needs to shut his mouth and just play guitar.

Well I am here to say that is a complete load. I love blues rock and people who innovate ( reread ...i n n o v a t e..) in the said genre. This album does nothing of the kind. What I hear is not the passion and emotion you people hear...i hear someone struggling to be something he is very obviously not...much akin to all these white kids trying to be black. Thats not to say you have to be black to play blues. There are numerous examples of white guys playing blues, and doing so quite well. Simply put, JM is not one of these. I hear no soul. The emotion you say you people hear comes off to me as contrived.The songwriting is uninspired, and the playing even more so. He does nothing new, and what he does do is done better by your average club player in Austin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thing I've heard in years","review":"I was there when the three man band hit the airwaves. Hendrix, Cream and a host of others both big and insignificant. This album is huge! Brought me right back to the first time I ever heard a three man band. Mayer is gritty and fills in the sound with his whole chrord, note, trill thing he has going on. The interplay between him and Palladino will bring back memories of Clapton and Jack Bruce but it's not as combative, more of an understanding interplay. Mayer struggles a little with his innovation...trying too hard... but it will come. The album is as raw a sound as I've heard since I was a kid and how a 'kid' like Mayer, born so long after the fact, is able to capture so well the entire feel of the live cranked show is beyond me. Go Johnny go..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who did you think he was?","review":"Wow this guy is shrewd. He establishes a fan base, a radio airplay base, an economic base, then comes out gunslinging with his rock and roll soul. What a feat. I LOVE this album. I certainly like the softer \\"pop\\" side of John Mayer and have purchased his prior CDs on that basis. However, I am an absolute Hendrix/Vaughn/Winter/Duarte/Kravitz texas blues style guitar acolyte, and the stuff on this CD just blows me away, ESPECIALLY coming from John Mayer. Sad to see some reviewers rating the CD poorly based on the pop parameters they'd like to see JM bound by. On the other hand, I do think it's reasonable to warn the young teenaged girl fans out there that this album is a (fantastic) departure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swish","review":"John Mayer had always bothered me. I disliked his image, his fanbase, and even some of his singles. But man can he play. He has always shown his skills of in concert (don't miss \\"Lenny/Man on the Side\\" from his previous live album), but his studio works have been up and down. TRY! is fabulous. Just listen to the guitar solo on 'Gravity' and enjoy. He's got two world-class musicians up there with him, but he completely steals the stage with some tenacious and beautiful stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am no critic","review":"Seems like most rate this with 5 stars or 1 star. I find the 1 star reviews more interesting to read. Critically I don't know if this album is good or bad...I don't care. I like it. JM can play the guitar and now that I know it I will pay more attention to him. The dudes playing bass and drums are top shelf guys. I wonder if Mayer came on the scene with an blues/rock album like this, would he be as popular? He ain't Clapton, yet. But Clapton is a guy that can be as much blues/rock as anyone. He can also dish out some sappy stuff, too. I hope John Mayer puts out more music like this with his Trio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Display of Guitar Skill","review":"I'll give John Mayer critics one thing; John Mayer is no SRV or Jimi. But in a time of music that is full of power chords and computerized background music, it's nice to hear a guy show off his obvious skill in a good live album. I'm not sure how many of you actually play guitar, but the melodys he throws together are not easy to pull off. Also given the fact that most of them are probably improvised, I only wish I could be blessed with those skills. Overall I would say this is an excellent album for those who can actually appreciate GOOD guitar playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Try!","review":"John Mayer is is not appreciated enough for his guitar talent nor for his efforts at bringing the blues an updated sound palatable to today's generation of young music lover's.

As mentioned earlier his vocals are way too fluffy to give weight to songs of this nature .

I know he has passion for the music, but i dont feel he has the soul to do it justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"As someone who has been a die-hard Mayer fan since 'Inside Wants Out', I found this new sound to be fantastic. To all of you that say that this isn't the real John, I feel as though you are sadly mistaken. These are the sounds that originally inspired him to become a guitarist, and just because it isn't mainstream pop like it used to be doesn't make it anything less than great. I recommend this cd to anyone that actually has a taste in real music =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A technical horror show.","review":"John Mayer Trio's music is great.

It is nice to see a telented young musician use his new found fame o break away from mind numbing junk and explore ond fashioned rock & roll. There's nowhere to hide when all you have is a guitar, bass and drum kit -- LIVE. Try! is reminiscent of Hendrix, old Clapton and Stevie Ray. It is the best album I've bought in a very long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jazz fan","review":"... I like John Mayer's pop music better than others out there. Your body is a wonderland although simple is a great song I think. But this record proves Mayer is a real musician. Palladino and Jordan are too good for them to play on a record that wouldn't be worth it. Plus Mayer has worked with Herbie Hancock. what else does he need? Mayer deserves the respect of listeners and musicians alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"...we've always known he was an awesome guitartist, and he fonally put it all together. one of the better albums i've bought in a while. as long as john mayer keeps putting albums like this he will be held as one of the better musicians of the 21st century."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the guys","review":"Finally some John Mayer a guy should not feel embarrassed to admit they, not only own, but LOVE! This is modern electric blues rock at it's finest. Lyrics are meaningful, guitar is wonderful and articulate, bass jumps out at all the right times, and drums rock a beat. The fact that this album is entirely live makes a great addition. Some live albums just plain suck. This is not the case with TRY!. This album is better because it is live. Wish it was on vinyl!Wish one day to see another Trio album."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Mayer at His Best","review":"John Mayer has really matured since his first breakout in 2003??

Its all a lot of copped SRV and Jimi Hendrix riffs (there are others he rips off , but ill leave it at those two for example purposes). Its one thing to want to do a blues album cause you love the music, its another thing to put another generic blues album out there that does nothing but slap history in the face and also does nothing to move the genre forward in any way. And a little humbleness huh john? You arent the best guitar player in the world (not even close) , and you never will be .... so quit acting like you are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable","review":"For pop music this is pathetic. For blues music, its even more so. So i dont care what he is trying to \\"crystallize\\" , the point is he has taken dispirate styles and melded them into something that does justice to neither. Combining styles can be done effectively, but is not done so here. Nobody will remember of care about this guy decades from now, while this may impress some of those who dont know any better,,, time will close the book on this travesty , and nobody will care about john mayer any more than they will about britney spears."},{"rating":"1","title":"No soul, no tone","review":"What the heck hapened to the blues? I was raised on them, and I always thought it would be around. I was wrong. The best way to describe this album is LAME. I'm all about an artist growing. I really enjoy that part of music. I have enjoyed seeing where Johnny Lang is going. However, this isn't growth, it's regression. If this was a demo tape, no one would listen past the first 5 seconds. Where's the heart? the passion? Am I the only one who needs this in their music?"},{"rating":"1","title":"you dont know blues rock","review":"Hey George Costanza! You dont know *#$ about blues rock. If you think Kenny Wayne and Johnny Lang are anywhere near the top of the list of great young blues rock guitar players, you must be smoking crack. Neither of the two can even hold a candle to the likes of REAL blues rock players like Doyle Bramhall II or Mato of Indigenous. Heck even Henry Garza of Lonely Boys blows KWS Johnny Lang and John Mayer out of the water ...and hes is nowhere near as good as Bramhall II or Mato. Do yourself a favor and listen to the real deal before you go talking about things you obviously know nothing about."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very impressive","review":"this dude went to berkely school of music...that is not where you learn to play the blues!Blues comes from the soul, not a textbook and a chord chart. He is so phony . The vocals on this album are not gruff or sincere enough for blues, theyre fine for his acoustic singer songwriter thing, but not for this style. The band as a whole is fairly loose. It sounds like 3 individuals , who while all talented, are not a \\"band\\". He shouldnt do any more Jimi covers, its atrocious . Dont attempt a song by a master unless you can do it justice. Overall i was highly disappointed in what i heard, although it was what i expected,...decent guitar work and rhythm section with mediocre songs and vocal execution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!!!","review":"This is one of the best live albums out there. I am not a big Mayer fan but this record is hot. The music is great. These guys can really jam. Hopefully Mayer will quit the solo thing and go full time with the John Mayer Trio. The Music industry needs this type of record. Buy it!!! You won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another 'Live' bust from John","review":"I believe John to be a very good live performer but just once I would like him to produce something where a buck or two was actually spent on the sound quality of the production. Yeah I get that the screaming young girls are all part of the 'experience' but the sonic quality always sounds absolutely horrible. I'm a fan, and all the more as his body of work grows and matures, just give us something that doesn't sound like it was recorded through a microphone smuggled into the concert concealed in the bra of one of his teenage fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of Mayer By Far!!!","review":"I've been following Mayer since his Room for Squares album. I like all his stuff, but have found that this album tends to hold my interest for a longer period of time. The others were entertaining, but this album hits your senses in a way the others didn't quite accomplish. His new songs, Vultures and Gravity, which will also appear on his next release, \\"Continuum\\" are in my opinion his very best. I couldn't stop playing Vultures for weeks!!!!I guess I'm out of the loop. I've been reading a few reviews and was surprised by the amount of controversy surrounding this guy. Why everybody feels the need to crown or crucify him is bewildering to me. Just take the music for what it's worth. He's a great songwriter and a fantastic muscian.P.S. I meant to give this 5 Stars. Sorry. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"Reminds me of when I was in my 20's. It takes me back to a great time in my life when music was pure and raw at the same time.

Thanks for the great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!","review":"The John Mayer Trio should be praised for their live album TRY! I was not a john mayer fan before I bought this album, John Mayer was always known for being a pop artist and im sure he got tired of playing music the people wanted. This is when he expanded deep into the roots from Classic Rock, to Blues john mayer really gives the people everything you'd expect from old Ray Charles songs such as I Got A Women, to Hendrix's axis bold as love songs such as Wait Until Tommorow. This serves a great purpose for the music scene. Their are countless numbers of solid jams and creativity on this live one! I could probably write a book on how great this album is but im going to stop with this. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great guitar","review":"For those of you who, like me, first heard John Mayer as another nasally, self-indulgent pop singer, this album is a revelation: excellent blues-rock guitar throughout and passionate renditions of Mayer songs. There's a delightful cover of Hendrix's \\"Wait Until Tomorrow\\" and an equally refreshing cover of a Ray Charles song. This album made me a believer in Mayer, even though I'm a long way from his generation."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you expect to be rattled as if by SRV, be diappointed","review":"Typical effort by someone who's obviously been influenced by the great ones (SRV, Hendrix...)and has alot of talent but has absolutely no soul. He can play some licks but is unable to put them together to provide the needed meaning and depth which this bluesy type of music demands. Spend your money on the lesser known greats such as Buddy Guy, Son Seals, or Magic Slim.

This has to be one of the most contrived, self-absorbed records in the last 20 years! I cant believe all the raves this disc is getting. It does not deserve that much praise i will tell you that. I listened. I analyzed. What was my conclusion? That this is a mockery of a wanna be blues album. Nothing about it impressed me. Go back to your testosterone-less acoustic phlegm, you cant play the blues mayer, and when you do ...its so obvious you are a boy trying to play man's music... and not doing a very good job of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"bland, contrived vanity project","review":"not so impressed. john's playing is pretty much a slavish imitation of stevie ray vaughan on this disc. i'm sure he loves the music, so do i, but for god's sake at least wait until you have an original voice to contribute before you run the risk of being yet another pasty white trainspotter diluting the integrity of the blues as a musical artform. yeah i'd rather 15 year old girls listen to this and maybe go from this to srv, albert king and so on than listen to matchbox 20 or some garbage, but judged against real blues musicians this is just so bland and so contrived, it just shows a disrespect for the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad quality recording","review":"Okay, I'm disappointed. Very disappointed. This sounds like it was recorded off the mains. As far as I can tell, there was no post-production, no mix, just a couple mic's stuck hanging from the rafters (at least it's in stereo). The vocals are buried, there's something banging along in the background which sounds like a drum set. Can't really hear a bass at all. Every once in a while John's guitar gets punched a little to make it out of the muddle, but all in all, it's a .. recording effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"go listen to real blues","review":"basically... john mayer is one of the worst excuses for a blues guitarist ive ever seen. i mean sure hes got a little speed but he's pathetic in comparison to pretty much any other guitarist out there! i've heard him compared to the likes of SRV. whoever thinks that is plain deaf. if you want some real hard hittin blues guitar.. go listen to stevie ray, freddie king, albert collins or johnny winter. i feel bad for any music fan who wastes their money on this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Try!

I know guitar playing. When i hear john mayer , all i hear is repetition, nothing sincere. It is sooo obvious he went to Berkely school of music, his playing is well....too technical..not enough emotion...it just sounds fake to me. He just isnt the real deal. Its the same way clapton always sounds like an outsider, he's good just like mayer but he never had that special something to take him to the next level. Im afraid mayer shares his fate. I know i will get JM fans hating me for this review, but oh well...i dont hold the man in the same regard as they do...i just dont see what they see i guess.

Well it ain't what it turned out to be , at least for me. John mayer just doesnt have any SOUL!!! Now I dont mean LITERALLY no soul , like he's some kinda demon or something. No the kind of soul im taling about is the kind associated with Marvin Gaye and Albert King and Shuggie Otis and Stevie Wonder etc.etc.etc. As far as that kind of soul....nowhere to be found .,.these blues are so whitebread and plain you might as well have titled this album \\"wonderbread\\". People who dig this keep talking up all the \\"emotion\\" that is in JM's playing on this album, well it didnt sound much like that to my ears.

These blues is killin me."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont sing ANY more!","review":"His 'Stupid Mouth' is the most appropriate song he will ever write. He really sounds like he has a towel stuck in his mouth. His voice is horrid. His phrasing is off. He's a good guitarist, but there are so many that are better. He's a poser and likes to take things from other guitarists. His lyrics are not well written. He throws words together and his own material is bland and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat, boring , pretentious","review":"...The cat's got no soul. He's like a cardboard cutout . His sound is completely derivative , and in no way unique or innovative. He can play some decent stuff...but is is all like as if im listening to someone playing back all the riffs they know like theyre some kind of living tape player. And dont get my started on his breathy singing , which while okay for pop, is totally weak for blues/rock. Keep \\"trying\\" john, maybe another 10 years you may have something to say thats not a total rip-off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great material from the John Mayer Trio","review":"This is a wonderful new album by John Mayer and his all-star trio. First of all, there is none of the crap with copywrite protection that Sony has on all of their other cds now (Where you can't burn it onto your iPod) so you can listen to this cd anywhere :-) I love how different these tracks are from most of Mayer's other stuff (at least his well-known radio hits \\"Your Body Is A Wonderland\\" and \\"Daughters.\\" I highly recommend this cd to anyone who likes blues, rock, or any of John Mayer's other stuff. Also, the sound is very good if anyone was wondering, considering all of the tracks are live recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"John Mayer is evolving and I love the result. There are some good covers and original work on here. I'd love to have a DVD of this show because Mayer is maturing in all aspects of his writing and performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Truth about TRY!","review":"...When I heard that Mayer was putting out a blues album, i was very anxious to hear what he could do, especially with the \\"trio\\" aspect, which implied a purist approach. I like that. But therein lies the problem. I had heard about a BLUES album. This is not a blues album. As the artist clearly indicated, this is a pop album intended to introduce blues elements. John Mayer knows his audience very well. To put out something raw and traditional like a genuine blues guitar album would place Mayer in the poor house. I commend him on this album for emphasizing these elements. And although the album does not appeal to those outside the mainstream, i hope we may soon see some real blues from the young pop-star. Frankly, the guy doesn't need to lay down any more groundwork in the radio-friendly arena if he's ready to live up to any of the guitar legend allusions concerning his technique. Some of which i believe absurd, as many compare him to stevie Ray. Even Mayer knows thats wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty much what i expected","review":"i came into this expecting to be underwhelmed, well ..in fact , i was. I have heard some killer guitar players in my day...dudes with serious tone, timing, and soul. Now the kid has SOME chops, but he has got a long road to hoe in order to ever have any hope of living up to our universally recognised guitar heroes. A marginal first attempt at making this kind of record for him. I would honestly be more interested to see what kind of stuff in this vein he can pull off in the studio, since his live stuff to me is fairly pedestrian for this genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Playing","review":"First dont think of a standard JM album, he is not who we think he was, this is the work of 3 tight musicians. Other than Gravity this album is definately solid. Your not gunna love it the first time you listen to it, but give it time and you will be hooked. I recommend skipping the first track and saving it till last if you were a John Mayer fan before, its extremely different. The work of jordan and palladino are amazing, as expected, and should not be overlooked in the listening of this album. Mayer's playing in the hendrix cover, wait until tomorrow, is extremly tight esp for a live preformance. The Ray Charles cover is a unique touch, but definately added flavor. Any true lover of music will appreciate this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mayer, Jordan, & Palladino --- Tasty!","review":"Love it .......

Mathematics is useful, necessary, and enjoyable. Marilyn Burns takes common topics found in the elementary and middle grades and shows how they are useful and even necessary in daily life. Although I think the last chapter on mathematics phobia is weak, this chapter still highlights some startling statistics and the need for everyone to rethink their own level of mathematics literacy.This is an easy reading book that should help parents understand the trends in mathematics education and give ideas how to help their children to enjoy mathematics rather than the situation where children hate mathematics."},{"rating":"1","title":"cogent and misguided","review":"Burns is both right and wrong. She is right that a really good math teacher can teach ideas and make children like math without all of the drilling. I am sure that she herself has experienced this and perhaps taught other math teachers to do the same. But the approach assumes math teachers are more talented than most are. With less talented teachers her approach is a disaster. Students learn neither the ideas nor the basics, like the multiplication tables, that the less talented teachers could have taught.

They're busily depicting firehouse activities in a way that is meaningless to a really little kid.And then, actually to the credit of the authors/editors, there are no really defined depictions of the fires, which leads to confusion about what the fuss is over. I appreciate that it is difficult to pleasantly depict what firemen do but this book was a pretty bad exposition of it.

Most early fire truck books sanitize the actual firefighting ( I don't know, too scary or glamorizing fire perhaps?) but those just left my kids confused. What do firemen DO, Mommy?The trucks are quite dated in the pictures - circa 1945 perhaps - so purists might object that they aren't what one sees today, but my kids have never noticed.

There are also several activities it shows which are either puzzling or, more likely, simply bad or dangerous practices.

Living where neither the sun nor the soil (limestone) is benign, it is imperative I purchase plants that can handle my cllimate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meandering and disjointed","review":"Ms. Hancox is all over the place, jumping from brief bios of Elizabethan figures to snippets about zoroastrianism, the Kabbalah, mathematics and alchemy. I think this hodge-podge of a text is somehow supposed to support an opaque theory of hers that ties together Elizabethan theatres, magic and aristocracy in a kind of vaguely-defined mystical knot. When she's not deviating wildly from this bumpy train of thought, she's lambasting the builders of the Globe reconstruction for not listening to her advice (whatever that is) about the design of their theatre. To give her the benefit of the doubt, since she also keeps coming back to the topic of cryptography, it is possible that the entire manuscript of her book is, in fact, a coded message to aliens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked for me","review":"The theme of this story is lesbian D/S in a \\"scool\\" for the education and training of young slave girls. Ms. Valeria and her staff of mistresses use their students services to their satisfaction, and also we follow a few of the \\"students\\" as they're sold off to some of the scools rich clients. The plot is in many ways similar to \\"Private Lessons\\" or \\"Bad Habits\\" by Lindsay Welsh, except for a number of water sport scenes, which is included in this story. And it's in many ways picking up the pen after Gil Fox' great period with Midwood in the seventis and early eighties, when he was writing as \\"Dallas Mayo\\" and \\"Kimberly Kemp\\".All in all quite a strong porn story, varying from \\"gentle\\" love to cruel abuse, not too well written, and with poor caracter development. But since this is one of my favorit settings, the book worked for me. Frankly, I loved it !Waiting for a sequel from Greer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A new lower low .. I can't believe it ...","review":"In the 185 pages of this book there is no reference of any kind to any man or male whatsoever. That makes this a first in my book. The story deals with an elederly, greying, slightly pudgy wealthy woman, Thea, who learns that her young maid, Yvette, is leaving because she can not find fulfillement for her dominant fantasies in the home of Thea. In a panic that she may loose the lovely Yvette, the mistress of the house agrees to buy her a slave from a special school of training.Needless to say, I am convinced that the author must run an obedience school for dogs because the slaves are trained exactly the same as their four legged friends would have been.Appart from the obvious sapphic excercises in this book a lot of the sex is bathroom related, I guess the girls at this school aren't given much to drink that comes in a glass.Not to say there isn't a market for these books but I mean this book has gone over the top for kink writing ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Equal Rights Before It's Time - Girl Style","review":"This series Zanbanger, Zanballer and Zanboomer are about a girl named Suzanne who is constantly told she can't play sports that are supposed to be \\"boy sprots\\" football etc. This one is about football and how does she take to the idea she can't play. Well she forms her own team and proceeds to prove a lot of people wrong. If you like stories about determination, hard work, and winners this is the series for you! - I also read this back 20 years ago and even still have my copies. Fantastic BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Answer to prayer","review":"I had been praying about finding some instruction on playing more interesting electric guitar parts in my local church worship band. I came across this and purchased it immediately. Each time I watch it, I find something new I can try to add to the electric guitar part. I wish they had an \\"Electric Guitar 2\\" to take this series further. I think some of the examples are a bit tricky to apply but it could be just me. For example he will play an electric guitar part from one of Paul Baloche's songs and it sounds awesome but it doesn't exactly show you what you can do to help apply this to other songs. I suppose just taking time to really learn the fretboard and the CAGED system will pay off over time. Overall its very helpful and useful!Its an excellent DVD and I'd recommend it to anyone new to playing electric guitar in a worship band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Homonyms!","review":"Excellent book for all language arts teachers in primary and middle schools (use for review).

You'll need to disassembly it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Pleased with this keyboard stand!","review":"We bought the Casio PX120 Privia digital piano for our 6 year old daughter. This stand was the perfect addition, giving the keyboard a real piano look. It is stationary and stable which is outstanding for my busy 2 year old son! I love the classy look (and it's black colored so it matches our bench), size (small and lightweight) and it was very easy to put together - perfect piano and stand for our beginner and the whole family!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice. Worth for the Money","review":"Once figuring out the way, it's easy to assemble it. It looks very nice with my 6 yrs old daughter's PX-110 and even sounds better when she plays.

Inside the box were the sides of the table made of particle board. It quickly became clear that a major project was in store to put it together. The instructions came in multiple languages -- the English bit did not seem to help much. The table screws into the Privia (major negative). I finally gave up and sent the box back. It was even hard to get the parts back in the shipping container!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Casio Piano Privia PX110","review":"This is a great item. We purchased it for my daughter to start piano lessons and it is great! It doesn't take up too much space and the sound of it is like a real piano you would hardly know in Piano mode it was an electronic key board. Great value for the money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Understand, My eyes have been open after many years","review":"I really liked this guy and bought all his cd's and after many years of struggling those tunes that I liked so much believe me it has been along journy these past few years and I can see now that many people try to reach losts souls by giving them styles and trends that sounds just like the current rhythm as before, and that proves they are mislead themselves. After watching a manafeat music video ,I think this song it had trever from tfk. I was so shocked to think that I actually thought manafest was born again. I completely stopped listing to his cd's and startedto research music and Christian contemporary music , after 5 months of knowing this secret about the emerging church and CCM. I BEG YOU , read the facts over at, wayoflife. Org , Holy Spirit can open you up !! Be SaVeD brothers :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get too excited about this one","review":"If you are looking for all around quality I would advise you to pass on this one. Although lyrical content is Manafest's strongest asset the CD is lacking on the production and innovation levels. Unfortunatly most gospel Hip-Hop artists have quite a ways to go to match those of the secular world in terms of a quality product in whole. If you are not too picky you may wanna check it out. Peace -J. Mathews"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool heavy rock tunes...","review":"This is the third solo album from the hugely talented legendary guitarist of Texan rock band KING'S X. He is known for his amazing smoldering wild guitar riffs and solos but here, on his solo work he tends to slow it down. It is all about great well written tunes here, with good guitar riffs, ctachy choruses and very unique vocals. There are many fine tunes here, and it is probably his most rocking solo album, but still retains the more laid back cool vibe his his solo work. Very good classic radio rock sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ty Returns","review":"Ty's Rock Garden is an excellent album thanks to Ty's return to just rocking, along with some cool effects in the Alien Beans mix. I can do without a couple, but the remaining songs carry the release. Ty returns to some great stylistic soloing that has been missing, along with some great layering. If you remotely liked Moonflower Lane ( I loved it) and kinda liked Safety ( I hated it) you have to have this one. Not that I would see this happening, but if King's X calls it a day, this very tastefully produced release sets Ty up for an even better next set of songs for the listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just get it already...","review":"Come on. It's Ty. Just buy the damn thing. If not for the sheer sake that the guy's brilliant at every aspect of making music. Is it as good as Safety? Hmmm... Probably not. I mean, touching the depth of Safety would be tough. Anyway, you know what? I'm gonna shut up, and you just buy it. K? Oh, and grab the new King's X as well. Not quite as good as Ogre Tunes, but..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great new side project.","review":"Ty does it again with another new side project. I honestly wish that when King's X gets together that they would go back to the sound, style and writing of the first four recordings. This project seems to have more of that feel than King's X does. A great buy for any fan of good song writing, recording and the Beatles flavored rock style that Ty seems to always put out on his own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic album! Thumbs up! :)","review":"Well-crafted songs and a delivery that you have to hear to believe!Melissa's tracks are refreshingly original, memorable, and catchy. With great lyrics and chord progressions, Melissa Rapp has made her mark as a talented songwriter.\\"Sweet Revenge\\" showcases Melissa performing her own songs with great passion and spirit! Bravo! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read something else","review":"This plot was unbelievable, the ending even worse. This was the first Ruth Rendell I've read and I'm told by my book club counterparts that she's an excellent author. If that's really the case I would recommend starting with some other books of hers because this one was lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay characters, virtually no action","review":"As a devout fan of Elizabeth George and P.D. James, I figured this would be great company while I caught a few rays. Unfortunately, such was not to be the case. The plot, such as it is, is static, and the prose overwrought with stodgy vegetal descriptions (oh, the English and their gardens!) and infinitesimal minutiae on London geography.It was a chore slogging through it, to say the least. I will try one of her other \\"genres,\\" the Wexler stream, which promise more action."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"Ruth Rendell really outdid herself with The Keys To The Street... It is a good read if you're in to mystery, intrigue and a touch of romance. It might be a little slow starting off, but one you get into it, you'll hardly be able to put it down. Added bonuses are the plot twists and action. The ending is especially interesting, as it is totally unexpected! You must read this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Round and round we go","review":"Inner circles, outter circles, terraces, towers, paths, ponds, clouds, trees, plants..........but what about the story? This book was a confusing mess for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither a drama nor a thriller","review":"This book was a disappointment to me - the author apparently couldn't decide whether to write a drama or a thriller, so she combined the two and didn't do justice to either. pity - I've really enjoyed some of her other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Death Metal Diamond to be treasured!","review":"For those of us old enough to appreciate the advent of hardcore death metal, this collection of tracks hails the emergence of the mighty Celtic Frost and the ingenuity of its founder \\"Tom Warrior\\". Sorrowfully, the era of Celtic Frost came to a tragic and premature end!!! Nonetheless, these songs epitomize a sense of mysticism and despair of the human condition that, I believe, represents its quite special emotional expression. These songs are intentionally raw and should be appreciated as such. Maybe \\"Tom Warrior\\" will suprise us with some original and interesting material with Apollyon's Sun."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love these sandals","review":"These wedge sandals are so comfortable. I have never worn a shoe that feels this good. I actually ordered these in black from shoebuy.com and paid $38.95 for them.

This was my first experience with the Aerosoles brand, and it will definitely not be my last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book....hard to get ahold of.","review":"I really loved this book as a child and wanted to own it again, but would suggest looking in second hand book stores, because paying $20 for this paperback was WAY too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best stories of imagination and friendship ever!","review":"I first read this book when I was in 3rd grade, having found it in my teacher's book collection. I read it so many times that eventually the binding fell away, and my teacher was kind enough to give it to me. I still have that rubber-banded copy, and I cherish it. Read this book, and give it to the young people in your life - there is something in it for all of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"My #1 book ever","review":"Recently, was at the book store helping my 10y son look for a book to read, I ran across a copy of \\"The Headless Cupid\\" I bought it and asked to order \\"The changeling\\" but they couldn't get it for me, So I turn to the internet (Got to love eBay) and found it. I read it as soon as I received it. I've ordered several more of Snyder's books as well. Maybe my kids will enjoy them as much as I have.I was 12y. at the time I first read it. I wasn't a \\"reader\\" this was one of the first I had ever read that I didn't force myself to finish. I lost myself in the pages. I felt a huge connection to Ivy our life's were so similar, she had a better outlook on life one I longed to have. Since then I have read a fair amount of books but none ever touched me the same way."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can the publisher who owns this book be thinking?","review":"The popularity and impact of this book is truly astonishing. Just read the reviews! Most of these people haven't been near a copy of this book for ten, twenty years or more. And they've all checked in here, bypassing the dread words telling them that it's out of print, and hoping beyond hope that they'll be able to get their hands on a copy to pass on to their friends or younger family members.Zilpha Keatley Snyder writes best when she is writing about outsiders--and about outsiders just on the cusp of adolescence, about to make that dangerous plunge away from childhood towards the complexities of becoming an adult.That's what she does in this book. The result is magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite children's book","review":"I can't believe this went out of print; I had to contact Ms. Snyder to get a copy (she has a web page & is nice enough to answer e-mail). It is, as someone else said, the greatest tale of young-girl friendship ever written, with a lot about how we becvome ourselves. One of the ten most important books I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astoundingly good--Sharon Gless is amazing!","review":"What an amazingly intelligent, well-written, and well-acted series. Seeing Sharon Gless back on the screen was as exciting as the show itself. Why this woman isn't making Oscar-winning films or starring in an excellent series is a mystery. She was and is one of our best female actors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective DVD tracks","review":"The last 2 episodes were defective. The DVD player message suggested cleaning DVD. I have purchased several DVDs in the past few weeks. They have all played fine except this one. I purchased an Endust for Electronics CD/DVD/Blu Ray/Game Console Lens Cleaner 262000 but it was not able to remove or repair the problem. A review of my recent purchase history will verify these comments."},{"rating":"1","title":"The State Within","review":"I chose this title based on the on line reviews. Unfortunately, in my opinion, the story did not live up to the hype. Every scene was melodramatic which spoiled the characterization and distorted the plot. There was no build up of tension. Instead of it being a cerebral thriller, \\"State\\" presented itself as a high-pitched melodrama. Not my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preachy BBC series","review":"Is this an espionage mini-series or a polemical documentary about all that is wrong with the U.S., from British eyes ? I quickly became bored with this series as it went from one scene depicting U.S. \\"human rights abuses\\" (including the death penalty), to the next. Preachy and ideological in content, somber and depressing in tone and even in color (was this thing shot during winter in Britain, or does the sun ever shine in D.C. ? ). Very typical BBC production in which the bad guys are neo-cons and the U.S. \\"far right\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ths State Within","review":"This is the DVD of a mini-series shown on BBC America.The Los Angeles Times stated that the series lost audience when shown in Great Brittan as a series of 6 one hour episodes.On BBC America it was shown as 3 - 2.5 hour episodes.I found the long episodes confusing.There are a lot of characters in the story - so it is very comples.I did enjoy watching the show on the DVD.Sharon Gless and Jason Issacs are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth fast paced","review":"Jason Issacs was wonderful as Mark. Some times I wanted to ring his neck because he didn't seem to know what was going on around him. Sharon Gless played her roll well."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"This was not necessarily bad, just nothing special. I love BBC series/mini series so I was very excited about this, but did not even bother to watch the second disc. I agree with another reviewer that the first 10-15 minutes are filmed in a very jerky style, almost unwatchable, but luckily that does not last long. I think it was just to add to the chaos of what is being portrayed. Also, found the story lines are kind of all over the place. If you are looking for a good mini series, try \\"State of Play\\" which is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"The BBC ain't what it used to be","review":"A mere 30 minutes into the first episode and these utopian leftists had already piled on every simplistic negative stereotype of Americans in existence. A plane is blown up and the \\"hicks\\" in Virginia round up all the muslims? That's funny, I seem to remember a little plane incident on 9/11/01 and no such round-up took place. And of course the black Brit war hero on death row is innocent--aren't they all?!? LOL, what naive drivel. The only thing entertaining about this schlock is how sophisticated its creators imagine themselves to be. Bollocks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware -- Shakey video spoils the show","review":"Neither my wife nor I could watch this DVD. The camera work shakes to excess. On our 73inch screen, the constant and unnecessary shaking gave my wife vertigo in less than 10 minutes. I lasted about 20 minutes before developing a splitting headache.Although a few minutes of the shaking video fits the story, the video shakes, zooms in and out of focus, even in scenes where all the characters are sitting around a table in a conference room. It as though the director only had one camera and never heard of cuts.I've never before seen a movie which has had this effect on me."},{"rating":"1","title":"stale 'n thin","review":"One star for finally making Virginia into a British colony. One star for decent cinematography and pace. Minus 2001 points for boring moonbat paranoia.Aside from the brave phlegmatic British Ambassador hero (and his soon to be mistress) all the characters are totally one dimensional stereotypes. Soul-less fat American politicians and business people, pretty dark-skinned people trapped by racism, flamboyant British gay traitor. And who knew that the BBC suffered from a writer's strike in 2006?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound and fury signifying nothing","review":"Really a waste of time. Full of pumped up editing and music, but, ultimately highly predictable, right from the plane crash. There are far to many layers of plot, and needless complications. And the ending is an absolute cop out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent acting, Prime example of BBC's anti-U.S. bias","review":"This mini-series is a prime example of the BBC's anti-American bias. The American people are portrayed as unintelligent hicks and the American government is portrayed as a racist and inept. The only high point is Jason Issac's acting, which, as always, is superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and suspenseful series - not to be missed","review":"Take the adrenalin from 24 and put it in the world of diplomacy and world politics - you get The State Within. Energy and drive throughout the whole series, and with shocking opening."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed this!","review":"This was one I had not heard of. Nice plot, good follow through.

A gem among the TV series available for streaming.Just watch it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Predictable \\"Complex Political Thriller\\"","review":"After watching the first half hour of this barker I knew how it was going to play out. This film packs in every Brit/lefty-paranoia-conspiracy-anti-American trope you can think of.Staggeringly ignorant, think of it as a less nuanced version of \\"V for Vendetta\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's exactly what you'd expect from the BBC...","review":"If you're part of the loony left that believes that 9/11 was a vast conspiracy between, Vice President Cheney, the NSA, Exxon, Haliburton, Zionists, the Queen of England and the Tri-Lateral Comission, you'll love this movie! Otherwise, it is completely inane."},{"rating":"2","title":"RCA Country Legends/ Skeeter Davis","review":"RCA, this time through its subsidiary label, Buddah, has released another compilation of songs by lovely Skeeter Davis.It duplicates some of the hits contained in a previous one entitled \\"The Essential Skeeter Davis\\" adding more of her hits and duets with singing partner Betty Jack.Skeeter's voice has enchanted me for decades. Her versatility in style is just amazing. She could delight you with pure down home country music or charm you with her inimitable girl group sound, both of which are represented in this latest collection.Like the previous tribute to her talent, this CD again leaves the listener wanting more re-issues from her extensive RCA catalog. Don't hesitate to buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as Good as Season 1 & 2","review":"I'm a huge fan of The Lost World and have watched all the episodes many times. Season three went down hill after first losing Malone, then Veronica (due to some contract issues with the Austrailian Gov., not the actors themselves). The writers tried to keep the story going by having Malone appear in a cameo appearance as a ghost and Veronica coming back in the final few eppisodes. They tried to replace Veronica with a new character from the future named Finn, but it just wasn't the same show. I do hope if the show comes back the get Malone and Veronica back on the show. Other than that, I think this is one of the best TV series Ive ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Excellent Choice!","review":"This is an excellent series whose actors do a wonderful job of bringing the great writing to life. The special effects are totally awesome and the action scenes are fun to watch. This show has it all action, adventure, drama, comedy and for those who are interested in that stuff it even has mushy crap! If you dont' get this you will be LOST when the new season arrives."},{"rating":"2","title":"ACD-Lost World Season 1-3","review":"Love the show.

I am running it on a Windows 2000 computer so I just plugged it in and it was recognized (no drivers to install). In Windows, each card slot is assigned a drive letter. I think most of the multiple slot card readers work that way. The media cards just plug in and out - there are no buttons to eject the cards like on some devices. The USB cable is long enough to stand the reader on top of a tower case and still reach USB ports in the back of the cimputer. Overall, this is a pretty good card reader for a low price.

When the CD arrived I popped the CD into my CD rom at work and as very disappointed to learn that the CD only contained a link to the website where the CD could be ordered.

While the broadway show and the movie should be judged as two separate entities (due to casting), I enjoyed the broadway soundtrack because there was a sense of joy, enthusiasm and fun in the voices of the cast. This cast, however, only seems to be \\"singing\\" the songs, but the feeling just isnt there. While everyone is praising Queen Latifah, I found her renditions just lacking any emotion. Dont get me started on John Travolta...and Amanda Bynes? Michelle Pfeifers version is just too droll....but Zac Efron does a very good job of bringing his songs to life. If this is any indication of the movie, I might be avoiding it."},{"rating":"2","title":"gift for niece","review":"My niece just loved the soundtrack. She has been wanting it for sometime.

I love the new songs that were included just for this soundtrack. There is an amazing group of people that joined the cast and they worked hard on it. It really pays off.

It's worth every penny!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic album!","review":"I have been listening to this wonderful album ever since I purchased it three weeks ago. The only song I don't really care much for is \\"Cooties\\", but other than that the songs and music are as infectious as the movie is, and overall, are delightful. I think all the actors did a great job with their vocals, (James Marsden REALLY surprised me with his great vocals) but I especially love Nikki Blonsky, Zac Efron, and Elijah Kelley. Each of them knocked their songs out of the park! If any one of these three release albums, I will definitely purchase them.My favorite songs on the album are:\\"Good Morning Baltimore\\"\\"Nicest Kids in Town\\"\\"I Can Hear the Bells\\"\\"Ladies' Choice\\"\\"Welcome to the Sixties\\"\\"Run and Tell That\\"\\"Without Love\\"\\"You Can't Stop the Beat\\"\\"Come So Far (Got So Far To Go)\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"You Can't Stop (Listening to) This Recording!","review":"The new \\"Hairspray\\" movie soundtrack is phenomonal and makes me want to twist and shout!The movie casts hold thier own to any stage performance of this timeless musical. Performers that really stand out are Nikki Blonsky as Tracie, Elijah Kelley as Seaweed, Queen Latifa as Maybelle and James Marsden as Corny Collins (who in my opinion is the best I've ever seen or heard in this role).The whole cast is great and the orchestrations are amazing and superior to that of other cast recordings, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Can't Stop The Beat","review":"I love love love this CD.

Judging from the soundtrack, that opinion bears out. Of course, it's not fair to judge without actually haven't seen the film, but when I listen to the soundtrack in future, I'll probably skip Travolta and Walken's wan \\"Timeless to Me\\" and definitely Michelle Pfeiffer's nasal rendition of \\"Baltimore Crabs.\\" (Why the filmmakers retained this, the worst song in the show, while jettisoning \\"Mama, I'm a Big Girl Now\\" is as ludicrous as it is mystifying.) Queen Latifah's OK, but I wish she were Aretha, and James Marsden's Corny Collins actually sounds pretty terrific. But it's the \\"kids\\" that make this soundtrack soar. If Nikki Blonsky, Zac Efron and Elijah Kelley are as exciting and fun as they sound, movie musical nerds like me should be in for two very sweet hours come July 20, 2007."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Expose' of our Medical Maffia","review":"A good friend introduced me to this book back in 1996, just 2 years after its publication. We tried to order more copies but was told the government had come in and shut down its publication and confiscated all the unsold books. It truly is an inside story. Unfortunately, it (medical maffia) only gets worse. This book gives a great inside look into our mainstream medical philosophy in general and aids in particular, and yes, why we never would have won the war on aids. Fortunately, the aids epidemic in the US has slowed, not due to the efforts of mainstream medicine, but through peoples self education of what aids really is and how NOT to treat it.Truly a great educational read if you can get your hands on a copy.

This album shuffles blindly and halfheartedly into the latter category. The starkness of the old synth-pop arrangements remains, but all the punch has vanished. It's understandable that orchestral music doesn't always lend itself well to DM's danceable angst, but where this revisioning should've introduced a more mature sadness or a powerful majesty, there is only a light, soft blandness.Too faithful to the original songs and too faithless to its own potential, this album is an empty bit of nothing. Bear in mind, this judgement comes from not only a DM fan, but also a fan of remixes of all stripes. It's not just how bad it IS that disappoints me... it's also how good it could have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossibly Bad","review":"I've given this album one star only because there isn't the option of giving it negative stars.To get a proper feel for this album, picture a spoiled twit with zero musical talent. Now give him a rack of halfway decent synthesizers without telling him how to adjust any of the preset voices and let him download Depeche Mode MIDI files off the Internet and play them through his new toys. Voila, you have this album.There is nothing original or imaginative about this work. The choices Mr. Huetter makes in electronic voices (he has the NERVE to call them an \\"orchestra\\") are unilaterally poor fits for the feel of the original tracks--parodies at best. Muzak could do better.I picked up this album at a local record store, hoping it would be listenable, and the only reason my copy isn't on the rack at the used record store is that I could neither, in good conscience, accept cash for this garbage nor inflict it upon another unwitting buyer.It does, however, make an acceptable coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Horrible","review":"When it comes to tribute albums it's either hit or miss.This one alone doesn't even show up on the radar.I got this in anticipation that it would be intense. A symphony doing a tribute to one of my all time favorite bands. I was way too quick to judge it a stellar performance before I even brought it up to the cash register.Got it to the car and popped it into my cd player and drove off to go home.The first track sounded okay and symphonic, but everything else after just sounded all synthesized and cheeeeeeeeeeezy.It doesn't even deserve the star I gave it.It reminded me of some sort of crappy Wyndam Hill compilation from the 80's or something.Maybe if your a John Tesh fan or Yanni you might like this but this was absolutely disappointing and an utter waste of 13.99."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word to describe it...","review":"Elevator?

There should be a disclaimer on this album that says: No microphones were harmed... or used during the recording of this record. Even if the \\"symphonic\\" instruments were real, there would still be more electronic instuments on this CD than the last REAL Depeche disc! Poor renderings of good songs, bad interpretations, less melodic than karaoke versions, you can't say enough bad things about this one. For real Depeche Mode fans, you can all pass this up. Here's one CD that deserves NOT to be copied or listened to, You have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Symphonic?","review":"DM really deserve a symphonic tribute, but this one is so far from it, as only one can imagine.

Although there is some minor background noise making it no substitute for a cable at home, it was very acceptable for automobile use.I did notice immediately after receiving the product how shoddy the manufacturing appeared to be. The device itself is very flimsy and is certainly not what one expects from the shimmering metallic photographs on the websites.After less than a month of regular use, it stopped working properly. The digital display now fluctuates, and it does not transmit a signal properly.It does appear that other manufacturers such as Belkin and Sony offer similar products. I would recommend purchasing such devices from these more reputable companies.If you're still not convinced, check the reviews for the older models (the 300w for example) and there you will find similar complaints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad product","review":"When I received this product it worked properly for only two weeks of regular use, after that the signal got weird, I would not recomend this product. You are better off buying a car stereo with an auxiliar input rather than dealing with this kind of product, no matter how good thay are you hear static sooner or later. You wouldhave to replace your car stereo, but believe me it is worth the hassle. Luckily I already had an old aiwa stereo with the auxiliar input and it works perfectly. My stereo cost me only a hundred dollars, and I am very satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty product, manufacturer shameless","review":"I sent this unit back after it failed to broadcast. Irock Customer service department did not answer phone calls, did not answer voicemails. After I returned it to them, via email tney claimed the unit was fine. They sent it back to me and after 2 days of use it stopped working, just like the first time. Perhaps this unit is okay for other users, but it is clear that if you end up with a faulty unit, like me, there will be no responsible customer service backing this product and you will be stuck with a non-functioning purchase. I would not trust this manufacturer since for me the product was flawed & manufacturer did not stand behind their product with adequate customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"I-Rock 100","review":"I have been using it for about 2 weeks and it performs as advertised.

Even though the battery operation no longer works, the mini plug had to be replaced and finally the on-off swith sticks, the four transmitting channels still work. I recently noted that Irock introduced the 450FM model capable of transmitting within the full spectrum of the FM band. I bought one right away. It worked nicely but, alas, for only one day! After I changed over between the battery mode and the in-car power supply mode a couple of times, the device ceased transmitting and the display showed only 3 unreadable digits (should be 4 plus a decimal point)!

I get almost no static with it, it is cheap and looks cool too! The sound quality is not what it is when you have headphones direct, but it is close!

I send my unit back to them and after TWO MONTHS and 6 emails I still haven't heard from them.I don't know what to do, I feel like I just wasted my money (when I bought it was $39.99).Bottom Line:+ it's small+ it's cheap+ works well- could stop working after just a few days- HORRIBLE costumer serviceTake your chances, but before you do, keep in mind that getting a replacement or your money back could be impossible (I'm still waiting for mine...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb when the radio signal isn't crowded.

His identity was revealed in 1996 and later in major newspapers and magazines when he died in 1999. His Italian heritage from Louisiana is very well known by now.

I looked it over a bit, and noticed the character design as well as the storyline was created by 'Ryo Mizuno'. Ryo Mizuno is also the creator of Record of Lodoss War and Legend of Crystania, which are both great animes 'especially Record of Lodoss War'.I, of course, already started to have high expectations for Rune Soldier. It is awesome, it's pretty funny, and less serious than it's counterparts.

It may have to do with the relatively narrow social and geographic context in which he develops so many of his plots and characters. Putting aside those arguable limitations, however, few American authors - and no lawyers I can think of - write with such precision or insight. Auchincloss exploits the descriptive depth and wealth of written English, and it is a delight to read. While I have enjoyed many of John Grisham's stories, their appeal certainly does not stem from the obvious quality his prose. It is difficult to imagine Grisham using a word like \\"machicolated\\" with the unfeigned and unpretentious ease of Auchincloss. Not every story in this collection is great, the standard Auchincloss achieves in most of his writing, but enough of them are to make this book well worth the reader's time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of great information","review":"I bought this book when I first moved here.

Not as boring as \\"The Firm\\" or \\"Paranormal Activity\\" but almost as boring as said movies! The only reason, and I put the emphasis on ONLY, reason that I give this more than one star is because there is ONE redeeming factor. That one redeeming factor is Zoe Trilling, who was one of the prettiest girls (both body and face) of the late 80's and the 1990's. She was also very underrated. She only has two scenes and her first scene is the ONLY good thing about this movie. She plays a lesbian, and the main character catches her in his shower and her big tits show, frontal nudity to the camera, for about 1 and a half seconds before she quickly covers up. Although she plays a lesbian, there is no lesbian boob grab and no lesbian kissing.The rest of the movie, is so bad that I can't even tell what is \\"supposed\\" to be funny.If you're not a fan of Zoe Trilling, or don't embrace of the beauty of women, don't rent this movie at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just right","review":"Use these for basketball to protect hamstrings, and the last pair worked great for two years, so got another.

The worst part is the preposterously wide hose connecting the filter and pump.

It is however, hands down, the worst book I've ever read...and I've read a lot of really bad books. This book gets 2 stars from me as opposed to 1 because it was so poorly written that it was actually funny. I haven't laughed out loud that many times while reading a book in a long time. Unfortunately, I don't think that it was meant to be a comedy. It read like a 13 year old wrote it. The dialogue was unnatural, the social commentary laughable and unbelievable, and the characters unsympathetic. By the end I was wishing for the book's villan, \\"One-Eye\\" (yeah, I got quite a few laughs out of that appellation), to actually succeed in killing all the other characters.

I have to wonder about some people's reviews...some people seem to look for the negative, even exaggerate it.

This album has a lot of good joint like \\"Myah Angelow\\", \\"Memorial\\" with the reggae-king Eek-A-Mouse, \\"Black trump\\" with Rae and \\"Game of life\\" with FLOW. Telling the truth, I liked all the songs. my fav. is \\"Back 2 life\\" with that Mobb Deep sample. It sounds phat! I think this album is aight but not a \\"Dah Shinin'\\".

I've never gotten that \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" feel from any other movie that's been produced since the forties, and that's not just because it's shot in B&W. This movie also will keep you in stitches as Moses (O'Neal) slowly discovers how clever a little con artist Addie (Tatum) really is. Her wit and sarcasm would make this movie equally entertaining if you turned off the picture and merely LISTENED to it. It's that good. I also adore Madeline Khan and Trixie Delight IS a delight.

Back then I didn't know her name was Tatum O'Neal and this was her debut-film and that she won an Oscar. But I know this movie was the one who got me interested in movies. Ofcoz I've read about how Tatum O'Neal's life and career has turned out, and it's kinda sad. But I will always hope the best for Tatum, for her role in 'Paper Moon' will always be in my heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paper Moon","review":"Good show. Good acting.

(I don't have a problem with any other DVDs.)Unfortunately I waiting too long before discovering the flaw so I'm stuck with it. Just posting this in case others have just ordered a copy - be sure to try it out promptly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frank D. Roosevelt says we're all feelin' a lot better","review":"What a classic. The writing. The acting. The photography. The stark Kansas landscape. The music. It all comes together in this funny and poignant tale of a con artist and his unwanted traveling companion, set during the depths of the Depression. The fact that Tatum and Ryan O'Neal are daughter-father in real life adds a layer of authenticity to the film. Tatum won an Oscar for her performance, but Madeline Kahn nearly steals the movie as Trixie Delight. I have watched this movie at least 50 times since it was released, and I always find it thoroughly entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I don't have it...\\" \\"then get it!\\"","review":"1st things 1st...Tatum O'Neal should have won the Oscar for Best Actress not the Supprting Oscar and the magnificent Miss Kahn should have won the Supporting Oscar...Now that I said this...It is just a perfect film on all levels! The photography is super and the old scratchy 78's used for the film's score is wonderful. Bogdonovich's direction is pitch perfect and the acting...well, even the tiniest roles are played to perfection..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Endlessly appealing!","review":"I have loved this film since I saw it at the age of 7! Tatum O'Neal is wonderful, as are all the cast. Kudos to Madeline Kahn and Ryan O'Neal. Great nostalgic atmosphere. I loved the 30's tunes and 'Jack Benny' off the radio. The character of Imogen is a hoot! There are so many great scenes and quotable dialogue (\\"Yes, Miss Trixie\\", \\"This little girl give me a fi' dollar bill and I giv'er change!\\", \\"Of course ya' know everything is in the bone struct'cha...\\"). I never get tired of seeing this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It Seems Like It Might Be A Timeless Film","review":"I had seen this movie when I was a kid back in 1973. I remembered it as being good back then. I found the DVD for $9.99 and decided to give it a try. I was suprised that the film stills holds up and is still good. Many films become dated and are not as good as you remember them. This film is still excellent. I give it 4 1/2 stars **** Not quite 5 stars. Shot in Black and white, it gives you the feeling that you are in the midewest in 1935. It is a good movie, the acting is very good and I enjoyed watching it. It is a good buy for $9.99 and a good film for families. Tatum O'Neal is very good in her role. I recommend this film. It's still good. Just have to see how it is 10 years from now. Now I need to view \\"Last Picture Show\\" again and see if that is still viable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for preschooler","review":"Book came quickly, short little devotionals keep my 4 1/2 yr olds attention, and make simple direct points.

When he was just a baby, we began reading theses beautiful verses and stories to him. As he got older, he read them to us. The illustartions are beautiful and the stories are sweet and gentle and exemplify how we can apply God's Word and wisdom in our daily activiities. Our church loves this little devotional so much that we have given out over 300 of them to children who are in need. I hope you will add this beautiful little book to your home library and read it with the children you love.

We still read each day's devotion to all three of our kids, who are now 7, 8 and 9 (and like to take turns being the reader as well.) We're on Amazon today looking at devotionals for older kids since our 8 year old asked us last night if we could find a book like this written for older kids. Although excited about the idea of a new book, our 7 year old asked if she could still keep this one. A light-hearted, touching devotional that teaches little kids about God's love and grace using age appropriate situations and prayers. Sarah's best gift ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great for our family!","review":"We purchased this for a family Christmas gift for ourselves! We now have it placed on our kitchen table, generally we all eat at least 1 meal together (myself, hubby, son age 4 and daughter age 2). After me or hubby finish eating we read, and if we forget our son reminds us because he wants to hear the story and see the picture for the day. It has created some great discussions already. It is short enough to hold attention.

We use this each night at bedtime and my daughter loves the pictures and stories about the kids. There is always a message involved. Sometimes we talk more about it, sometimes we don't have time. She is 5 and working on memorizing Bible verses for Sunday School and preschool, so I like to read the passage that goes with each message. We then say the prayer in repeat-after-me style. I am getting this book for all of my Godchildren.

I purchased this case to help protect my tablet while in my bag traveling from point A to point B.While the sizing and inner 2 pockets work great for my Graphire (as I'm sure they would for an Intuos of the same dimensions) the zippers are sometimes sticky and at one point the teeth behind the zipper separated in the first week of use. I was able to backtrack the zipper and so far it has been okay, but this does not bode well for long-term durability.Finally, the outside padding is fairly thin -- I think it's made of neoprene or the equivalent. So the main benefit of the travel bag seems to be protecting the surface of the tablet, but not as much for protecting the tablet itself from bumps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this bag","review":"This is a cheap piece of neophrene with a zipper.

It's hard to find toy cars that are safe for babies and toddlers, and these definitely fit the bill.

His aunt got him these. What a hit! My son can't quite stack them himself, but he knows how to nest them and sure does love knocking them down when I stack them.

I am amazed at how long my son will play with these!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Son Loves These!!!","review":"My 11 month old received these last Christmas and he instantly began running them along the floor and playing with them. He is now 22 months and I have taught him his colors using these and he STILL loves to play with them. One got run over by an electric scooter and it didn't even break! All parents should get these for your baby. This is the one toy that will NOT sit and collect dust!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy together or separate","review":"My now 1-year-old has loved these vehicles from a very early age. When he was just a couple of months old, he liked watching us take the little green car and move it back and forth on the tray of his swing. Then when he was old enough to hold it, he loved to hold the little one and shake it (it rattles). He still zeroes in on that rattle. Now he likes to crawl around running the cars on the floor. And, he'll sit and just move the wheel on the top of the police car for what seems like a long time as he watches the colors change. Don't wait to open this one. It's useful from very early on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for infants gross and fine motor skills development","review":"I bought this last month for my 6 month old son, and it continues to fascinate him. It is fabulous to encourage moving and crawling as I set them around him and they slide away as he reaches for them -- its been invaluable in encouraging him towards crawling and scooting. When he does get hold of them, exploring the ladder on the fire truck develops his fine motor skills too, and he like chewing on all of them and shaking the rattly little one! He'll probably soon be able to work the sun roof. It will be a stacking toy later too! Great value for money..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased mom of a 4 month old","review":"This is an excellent buy for the price! There are several different activities you and your infant can enjoy together as they grow with this toy. The cars are hollow on the inside allowing for easy pick up by my four-month old (The cars being hollow also allows them to be stored inside each other). We also have fun when I stack the cars and she knocks them over. As she grows up I envision her stacking them herself, while practicing numerals 1-4 as they are clearly marked on each car. Each car does something fun - the smallest car is also a rattle. This has been a great buy that we will get a ton of mileage out of!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One missing from the nest!","review":"The Nesting Action Vehicles were purchased as a gift, but it happens that one of the vehicles was missing, which wasn't reported to us until recently.

Perhaps my baby is too young for this toy at 9 months, but she showed no interest in this toy whatsoever. After 2 weeks of ignoring this toy, I returned it to the store. The car on top never stayed there, it seemed to fall off the top way too easily. These seem cheap and are hollowed out cars that do not roll well at all when compared to the other Fisher Price cars for babies. The paint comes off easily, which seems very dangerous for babies, who put everything into there mouths!

I would go with something heavier that handles better around curves."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Paint Comes Off of the #2 Blue Car","review":"Fisher Price Should be ashamed of itself! This is a toddler toy and everyone knows that toddlers put toys in their mouths. There's a white roller thing on the top of the number 2 car (all the cars have something different to play with on the top of them). Unfortunately, the top part of the blue car is white because it's painted. I found my 11 month old baby had white paint chips all over her mouth after sucking on the top of this car! Yuck! Also, these cars have stickers on them. You can forget about putting these cars in the dishwasher if you want the stickers to remain on them. The concept of these cars is brilliant. They stack. They come in different colors. Each one has a number on it. They roll. It's too bad that children can eat the paint off them. I consider that to be a serious problem with this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of a boring toy","review":"Neither of my boys, ages 3 and 1, take any interest in this toy at all. I bring it out and show them the different things it can do and they still don't find it interesting. It could be an educational toy if you can get your kids interested in playing with it. I tought my boys would be because they love cars. As far as being durable it hasn't broken yet, but that could also be because it has not been played with."},{"rating":"2","title":"My granddaughter loves these cars.","review":"I bought the nesting vehicles recently because I was sending some Amazon products to my daughter and I wanted to includesomething for my two year old granddaughter. She was thrilled to get her first cars. She plays with them by pushing them on the floor. The fact that they can be stacked and restacked just adds to her fun. They are cute as can be and I plan to buy more for my youngest grandchild. I'm sure he will love them too.Annie J. Grandmom of 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy!","review":"My son has had these since he was 6 months (he's 21 months now) and has loved playing with them since then - first to bat the little car around, later to nest them, and now to watch them crash into each other or take drives over the furniture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made a mistake with this toy","review":"I bought these cars for my nine month old thinking she'd like to roll the cars along the floor and nest them inside each other. She only liked the smallest car (and for only a couple of minutes) which was easiest for her to pick up and rattles, unlike the other vehicles. She hasn't looked at them since the day I bought them so they have been given to her grandmother in hopes that she'll find them more interesting later on. The vehicles don't do anything besides roll IF you push them (they won't roll on carpet if you don't continue to hold onto them and push). The idea behind this toy is good but I didn't think they were very fun either so I can't recommend this toy. I think the box for this toy said six or nine months and up, but I think perhaps it is a better toy for older toddlers, not babies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stacking fun","review":"My son actually bought this at a garage sale. It was the only toy he wanted and he's enjoyed it since the day he brought it home. His early education teacher LOVED it and said that it's highly used when they work with children. Great way to teaching small vs. large, numbers, and it uses their agility and hand/eye coordination skills. Not to mention it involves strategy for them to discover how to stack vs. nest the vehicles together. Overall a great toy that has educational and motor skill value. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute...","review":"My son has played with these from 6 months old, and still likes them occasionally (18 months now).

My son loves these vehicles! We got this when he was 6 months old. We stack them on top and he loves to knock it over. We nest them and he loves to find the surprise vehicle underneath. Now that he is 8 months old he is figuring out that the wheels move as well as some of the other moving features on each vehicle. I highly recommend this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves these cars","review":"This is one of my son's favorite toys. He loves to knock them over when I've stacked them.

Simple, interesting, and fun. No electronic junk. Easy to wash. I wish I could find more toys this great for this price. This is a favorite toy for my 4 yr. old to play with the baby with.

My 7 month old son absolutely loves the cars. He stops and looks at the fire truck when the ladder makes the clicking sound and loves to shake the green car with the rattle. One of the nicest things about this toy is that the vehicles \\"nest\\" so they don't take up a lot of storage space. It's an easy toy to fit in the diaper bag, and you're getting four toys into the space of one. I think that he'll use this toy for a long time since he's hasn't even discovered that the cars can \\"drive\\" yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the toy I dreamed of!","review":"This is one of those toys that I imagined inventing (yeah right!) if I couldn't find it at the store. I figured there had to be a toy somewhere that incorporated the fun of cars and the stacking and nesting skills that are so fascinating at around the 12 month age. My son loves these cars: their cute eyes, 'sun roofs' that allow you to see the car underneath, and the way the little ones fit perfectly in the hand - with a little rattler inside. Hooray for Fisher-Price on this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best toy ever.","review":"My mother-in-law is crazy over Fisher Price and so am I. This is just one of the many Fisher Price toys she has given my son, but it is one of the best! I got it when my son was about 6 months old, and believe it or not, he's over two now and he still loves it. He keeps discovering new ways to enjoy it. At first, he loved throwing it down while I was stacking it, (a lot of fun, from a child's point of view), then he learned to drive them along the kitchen floor, and stacking and hiding, playing with the different activities on each piece, etc. There's just so much to do with it. They got lots of banging around, but they're in perrrrfect condition. They're colorful and cute. Recently, I was amazed to see how perfectly he stacked them and then drove along the floor with all cars stacked! This toy is worth at least twice the money. Hooray for Fisher Price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple yet brilliant","review":"I rate these cars up there with the all time classic toys like the ring stacker and blocks. These simple toys that don't have electronic bells and whistles and gadgets and sounds, but rather allow a child to use his or her OWN imagination to grow and learn and make their OWN sounds.

My boys and their friends absolutely loved it and had so much fun. But within a few hours, the boogie board had a hole in it. The tubing around the pool area also has a small leak. Sometimes the slide and pool come apart if my kids went down too \\"hard.\\" One more negative is my 2 1/2 year old isn't quite big enough to jump up to the height of the slide.

For the first use it was great. We've used it 4 different times and we've head a new seam puncture after each use. Patching the seams bandaids the problem for that use, but it continues to deflate. It's a fun product but due to the poor durability it will not last for next year."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!!! DONT BUY!!!","review":"I bought this for my kids and it was TERRIBLE!! I set it up..and the first time they tried to go down it, it tipped right over on my 3 year old. You have to stand and hold it as each kid goes down. The sprinkler hardly works so the slide doesnt get very wet, which makes for no fun!!! Havent used it again..they would rather jump through a sprinkler then try this again. DOnt waste your money. When the company contated me they said I could return it..but I had to pay for SHIPPING!!! Just dont do it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"IT TIPS!","review":"The idea of this slide is awesome! Even the pool alone is nice. But everytime my daughter tries to use the slide it tips to the left and she goes off the side before making it to the pool. It's in no way dangerous...but the slide is not sturdy at all! We had to prop two lawn chairs on either side of the slide to keep it from leaning to the side. Once we did that the kids had a blast...but clearly too much work for something that should be more simple! Great idea though!

They loved it but it only lasted 2 uses (about a 1/2 hour each time) before it developed a gaping hole along the plastic seem of the slide. We had owned it for less than a week. In between uses, we emptied it of water and stored it in our garage, out of the heat and elements. We also put down a plastic tarp for the slide. My children were very disappointed. We returned it and bought a nine dollar slip 'n slide at W*l-M@rt. Do not buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it!","review":"We bought this Splash slide in hopes that it would give our kids (ages 9,4, and3)lots of fun, but unfortunately,it only lasted so little time. first, the slide part ripped so we had to use it as a regular little pool. then, the pool ripped where the thin plastic is joined.

Than the second time I set it up the inside seam that keeps the water and air parts from merging broke. Yep I now have a slide that is useless. There is no right side. so they will fall off and there is no way to have water hooked up to it. It was a complete disappointment. And Toys R Us will not return it and the company just does not care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic idea - horrible manufacturing","review":"The slide itself is a huge hit. Unfortunately, the durability can't even pass the test of a 4 year old girl. We've used this slide for 1 month, we now have a hole in the boogie board, a tear at the bottom of the slide, a hole in the slide part of the pool, a slow leak in the pool itself and a rip on the bottom of the pool. All this happened even though we've taken special care of the slide, and it stays in the grass only. I don't even know how so many holes are even possible! I have never seen anything so poorly made. This slide won't even last all summer. It is great fun if you can get it to last, but considering how thin the plastic is, I doubt anyone can get it to stay in good condition for more than a week or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of fun if you can get it to blow up...","review":"The pool/slide was pretty fun once I got it all blow up.

My 4 and 6 year old barely lasted 10minutes with it - the pool at the end is way too short, the slide attaches to the pool in one of the most poorly designed ways, velcro on top. As the kids slid into the pool, the small velcro adhesures came undone everytime. Often, the whole slide would tip as a child was going down it because it is poorly balanced - the water runs on one side making that side very top heavy. Then, by the end of the afternoon, both pieces had holes in them and deflated. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone and think Banzai needs to hire new engineers for their products in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time to blow up!!!!","review":"Bought this for my 8 and 10 year old boys. It is so small, they would slide on the little surfboard that is included and would already be half way out of the pool. The water that is constantly running from your hose sprays straight down on the slide part. It does NOT spray into the air like the box shows. The water that is coming off the slide and into the pool part does NOT go into the pool. The little plastic flap that connects the two is so small the water runs right off the sides and into the grass. This was a total waste of time. They played with it for about 20min and that was it.

However, it is rated for 5-15 years. No [...]year old would fit on this. I would say ages 2-10 maybe. The slide part would not stay up due to plugs not staying plugged therefore the water that you are supposed to weight the bottom down would not stay in. Also the plastic is not durable at all. Grass clipping punctured it with just one use. Too bad it was not made better because it would have been a fun thing for hot days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Banzai Cannonball Splash Water Slide","review":"This Water Slide was fun while it lasted, however we were only able to use it once. The second time we set it up and connected the hose the part were the water sprays out of poped on the inside and caused the right side of the slide to fill with water therefor making the slide unuseable. It is unfixable cause its on the inside and paying how much we paid for it is not worth only one day of play. I wouldnt recommened buying this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF MONEY! CHEAP, BROKE WITH SECOND USE","review":"Please do not waste your money on this cheap piece of junk. I will be boycotting banzai products from now on. It is badly engineered with the drainage right by the slide entry into the pool and WILL cause injury. The slide doesn't stay put and keeps flipping over. The water springs in the wrong direction on the slide. The seams broke on us with the second use.Banzai won't replace the product unless it is within 30 days and requires your receipt. I tossed my reciept after I used it once since in their instruction manual, they tell you that the store won't accept returns after you have used it. I contacted them after my second use resulted in the broken seam. Now they tell me the return is dependent on the store's policy. Anyways, I was stupid to have tossed the receipt and to buy this piece of trash but I hope you'll be smart and not purchase it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun while it lasted","review":"I bought this water toy a week ago, My 4 year old and some of the little neighbor kids used it for a few hours and had a blast! A couple days later they wanted to use it again only to find the the slide had a gaping rip in it, right ona seam. No patch kit came with the toy, so we used one we had lying around but it wasn't large enough to patch the rip. Now i have a lame little wading pool that no one will use and a ripped and deflating water slide I cannot return to the store. I've sent an email to the company, but I'm not getting my hopes up. My advice: buy a pool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"We bought this for our 2 & 3 year old sons. However after the first 20 minutes of use the right side went flat. Prior to that it kept tipping over when they would go on it. The picture on the box makes it look like the slide is about 3 feet wide. In all actuality the body board barefly fits down the middle of it and it's probably about 16 inches wide. The slide and the pool section hook together with 3 pieces of velcro which are about 3 inches each and unfortunately it comes undone constantly. I called the company the next day and they are refunding my money with my reciept and pictures of it. I put a picture of my son next to it so the lady could see how narrow the slide REALLY is. The pool area looks quite large on the box too according to the size of the kids playing in it. However, it also is quite small. The only thing this really lives up to is that it is 13ft long. However the width is a serious issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGER - BEWARE !!!","review":"Besides being a complete rip off for the price. My son nearly paralyzed himself on the slide. Using the \\"boogie board\\" went sliding down and hit the area where the slide velcros onto the pool part, instantly stopped went flying head over feet, twisted his neck and fell into the pool. We stared fearfully as he came splashing down. Luckily he was fine. DON'T BUY THIS for your kids.

I think better construction could have been done with attaching the ramp to the pool-- the velcro kept slipping loose causiing the water to drain down the side instead of into the pool, but the kid's didnt seem to mind. I would recommend buying extra inflatable boogie boards, like we did. Saved us lot's of headaches. All in all... if the kids liked it, I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Received Just What I Paid For!","review":"I ordered this waterslide for my 3 year olds Birthday Party.

The only quip that I have with it is the day of our party...we had a slight off and on breeze. The slide velcros to the pool but kept coming undone with the slight wind we had.

It took an hour to fill with air, with an electric air pump. After filling it, we hooked it up, and the sides of the slide deflated making the water not even hit the slide. Thinking maybe we didn't fill it properly, we tried it again a few days later, reinflated the sides, it did the same thing. Thank goodness I was able to return it to the store and get my money back. Also, there are no steps to the slide, so I had to bring a stool over so my three year old could get up to the slide.

Our 11 year old next door neighbor played several times and loved trying to see how far past the end of the pool she could slide. Not recommended activity. The yellow slide is too tall for most children to navigate. The pool is very shallow and not very long. A better use for the unit would be to disassemble and use the slide with a traditional swimming pool and allow the babies/toddlers to splash in the blue pool.

Read the reviews on this, but for the money it was well worth it! Had my 4yr old son and neighborhood kids play w/this, they all loved it! It was so hot and humid this weekend, the blow up body board makes it nice and easy to slide down the slide. It did detach once in awhile, and the kids did slide off the slides several times, but landed on grass and made them laugh more. Hubby figured out how to angle it just right since our backyard is at a slope, so that fixed the problem w/the slide and pool detaching. No holes or rips yet, hopefully i can make it last into next summer, but w/these toys I never expect them to last past one summer. Also, didn't burn the grass! Tons of fun, even more so w/water toys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"Do not buy this product. I bought this as a birthday gift for my son last year. He and I were both very disappointed. The slide kept falling over and had to be reset. When it was standing, it would lean to one side, so the water would not spray evenly across the slide. There was an uneven seam that eventually ripped on the 1st day. I ended up throwing it away on day 2. Complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marginal","review":"Not to good.

This one we decided to just put up because he was ready to swim and we were destroying his day. So we attempted to patch the holes in the pool part and he was in business. It lasted exactly one use with a 4 year old. The whole thing went to the trash the next week because the slide seams were all laking air making it junk. Such a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS JUNK!!","review":"This item is a COMPLETE waste of money!!! I bought this slide for my three kids ages 5,6,and 8.

I gave one to my grand duaghter who is only three. She knows how to swim. Anyway, from the onset, the pool seam had a hole, gaping. So I gave her the second one. Guess what? It would not hold water but could not find the leak. Talk about thin plastic. My freezer bags feel thicker. Luckily, Praise GOD!! I bought them online at Walmart. No problem in returning them to the store for a full refund!! Do not buy this item. Invest a little more and get the much thicker better Bonzai slide.

Great idea, but disappointed that it didn't hold up."},{"rating":"1","title":"lots of fun, for the few uses you'll actually get","review":"We bought this slide less than a month ago - couldn't resist it because it looked like so much fun for our 6 year old and 3 year old. The idea is great and the kids love it, but the VERY FIRST TIME we used this the boogie board got a leak in one of the seams (and it was not over-inflated). our kids weigh 45 pounds and 35 pounds, so it can't be that the boogie board was over-stressed. 2 uses later the ramp inside the pool got a leak on one of seams and the pool itself developed a slow air leak. After about 5 uses now the only part that doesn't have a leak is the big ramp. Great idea...very poorly made. Don't waste your money on this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP OFF!","review":"MUCH smaller than they make it appear.

This also happened with my friends kids. This toy is so dangerous!!! Please consider buying something else!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy","review":"This is by far the worst pool toy I have ever had. The slide does not stay put. It takes forever to blow up (and this is with an electrical pump!). The pool looks much larger than the image shown. It really was a waste of $49.95. After a horrible afternoon of fighting, we are throwing this in the trash. The kids were so upset by it. They will be so happy with a plain old cheapy rectangular family pool. I would give it 0 stars if possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for 1 Day of Dangerous Fun","review":"I bought this pool for a playdate for my almost 3 year old son and his 3 1/2 year old buddy. First one side of the slide already had a hole in it as it kept deflating over and over again which made the slide totally unsafe. We had to take the kids and forcefully throw them down the slide because if they were to do it themselves they would fall off the side. Then the rest of thing thing had holes by the end of the day. So yeah, if you don't mind spending $50 bucks for a day of fun then go for it. The kids did have fun though, I'll give it that...but 3 year olds also could have had just as much fun if we stuck them in the bathtub."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I bought this for my 9 year old son's birthday party. First of all, I'm a chick and am not good at diminisions, but the pic on the website/box made it look bigger than it was. This wasn't a big deal, but when the kids started playing on it, it lasted about 20 minutes. I was furious. I figured it would have at least lasted an hour or so. It developed a hole in the slide part which filled up with water and would not attach nor stay up because of water weight. Very big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible design","review":"This is the worst toy I have ever seen. The slide does not slide well and the pool is too small for the slide.

I do not deny that for the kids that is is a very fun toy when it is inflated. The problem is that it is not a very durable toy. The plastic is not very thick and the smallest abrasion is more than capable of inflicting a pin hole leak that makes the toy deflate and therefore unusable. The decision on whether to purchase the product needs to be based on if one is willing to spend the money knowing full well that this will be a one season product. If the expectation is that this product will last over a number of summers, then that expectation is unrealistic and should discourage the purchase of the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money- not what it appears to be","review":"My wife bought this on clearance (not from Amazon), and thebox art makes it look SO much bigger. The directions are unclear as to what is filled with water in the \\"base,\\" and the water sprinklers to wet down the slide are on only one side of the inflatable ramp, causing it to go lopsided and make kids veer off the slide.

Having grown up around the LA area I'd seen them live before the album dropped. They are a great band every song has a certain crispness to it. They do sound a bit like Tool, but they are not anything like the carbon copy I've heard people say. They have very intelligent lyrics, mixed with a 3 guitar attack, and a good back bone with the bass, and drummer.

It was the best decision I've ever made! There are no words to describe just how amazing this CD is because it honestly gets better with every listen. And it's so dynamic, the melodies are so beautiful, the guitar riffs mind-blowingly awesome that you will never tire of listening to this CD. Take my word for it, because I've listened it through so many times I swear the CD will wear out soon! Simply put: the sheer greatness of this album can't be conveyed with words.

And God help you if you try to call their customer service center! All they tell you to do is spend YOUR money to ship back THEIR faulty products. They refuse to do anything the least bit helpful, claiming it's \\"Not their policy\\". Not their policy to satisfy their customers?! Apparently not, because I am FAR from satisfied.PLEASE reconsider buying anything by Philips!

I've had this model for a few months now and have had no unexpected problems. It does play both -R and +R discs perfectly, and easily records to anything but DVD-RAM. If you've been experiencing playback problems, then the issue is most likely with the write on the disc itself. On the downside, and like most every set-top DVD recorder, the recorded discs probably won't play in other machines without reauthoring. And, the remote control is lacking features commonly found on others. But, overall this is a fantastic recorder for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why make DVD recorders when you can't make them right?","review":"I made the fatal error to buy a philips recorder last year. it started screwing up after 7 (!) recordings so I took it back. It did the same after 20 recordings and I took it to be serviced for a second time. When I got it back it wouldn't even read the disc!!! I had to yell at them to get a replacement and I got the 3355 model today! It did exactly the same thing that user Brad Smith described and YES it is a really frustrating experience. Avoid Philips products or at least their DVD recorders!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Still going to hell in a hand basket","review":"I have been a Steve Allen fan since the late 50s. He was a comic genius, a so-so composer and a poor author. Most of this book is devoted to endless transcripts of the Madonna appearance on David Letterman, HBO's \\"Sex and the City\\", and rap lyrics. This is the kind of stuff that most people just naturally turn off and go on with their lives, but Mr. Allen seems to have taken a great deal of umbrage at them. It is easy to complain about how standards are being lowered. The hard part is figuring out what to do about it. Mr. Allen doesn't have much to suggest other than government censorship. He doesn't make a very strong case for censorship so the whole book comes off as a crotchety old man complaining about how bad things have gotten. You can get this kind of stuff for free from your grand parents so why pay $20 for it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"grumpy old man","review":"With \\"Vulgarians at the Gate,\\" fifties TV fossil and self-proclaimed genius Steve Allen attempts to explain why he has not had a job for 30 years.It can't be a lack of talent, after all this a man who authored over 1000 songs,(name two), countless books, (name one besides this one), and hosted several failed TV shows, (remember the one where he sat around with actors dressed as Jesus, and Freud?)Allen blames the demise of his career and Western civilization on Howard Stern, Madonna, and David Letterman. Allen cannot stand the fact that these show-biz powerhouses whom Allen, of course, views as far less talented than he, are successful and he is not.Allen makes a case for the criminalization of off-color entertainment that is about as convincing as his toupee. For Lawrence Welk fans only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vulgarians at the Gate","review":"I think this is possibly one of the most important books I've ever read. It made me understand the reasons for the demise of current television and film and subsequently the family unit.

I shall be eternally grateful to Steve Allen for writing this book and for his wife and son for talking about it on television. This book could be the catalyst for a kinder world."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book took courage","review":"I think Steve Allen made an absolutely convincing case in \\"Vulgarians at the Gate\\" that American culture has been measurably coarsened in recent years -- and that TV is the most powerful medium in establishing the new, oh-so-low standards as the norm among children. All you have to do is watch a little TV to see how obviously right Steve Allen was. But one thing about this book is not so obvious: the COURAGE that Steve Allen showed in speaking his mind. He had to know that in the close-knit Hollywood community, which is so intolerant of criticism, his career would be hurt by the stand he took. How many other stars of Steve Allen's magnitude have uttered even one word of caution about the sweeping away of moral standards in the media that have made them fabulously wealthy? Steve Allen stood virtually alone. That took a lot of guts, and parents and grandparents owe him a debt of gratitude for the courage he displayed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A voice in the dark","review":"The late Mr. Allen's posthumous book is a tour de force in common sense and thoughfulness. He has the courage and wisdom to state the obvious, and we should all take heed. The media are as malevolent as they are benevolent. Crass and vulgar radio and television have \\"better\\" culture on the ropes, and it is time we all (those of us with a concern for basic human decency) referee that ring or suffer the consequences of what is \\"good\\" and \\"noble\\" in life going down for the count."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starbucks Barista Single Cup","review":"I own the single cup version of this coffeemaker and I have had to return it 4 times in 3 months!

I have read some of his books and I liked them, but I am not crazy about him. However, this book offers his fans a chance to look through pictures at the most usual places described in his novels and this makes the book interesting and worth looking at. But it is not a photo-guide book of pictures as I have imagined it was before buying it. On the whole, if you have read many novels of this writer and are familiar with the Cairo shown in them and want a glimpse at real buildings and streets, I recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice collection of Photos","review":"I found this to be a nice collection of photographs detailing the Old Cairo featured in Naguib Mahfouz's stories, mostly the Palace Walk trilogy. It would be handy to have it as a companion while reading the novels to familiarize you with setting. For those readers with some familiarity with Cairo, this collection leaves us wanting. For example many photographs are only loosely related to sites in the novels. I would have preferred a more closer connection. A map would have also been valuable. The introductions by al-Ghitany were interesting but brief and rather superficial.

It is difficult for the child to see that their action made the toy perform. For the price, I think you can get a more entertaining toy for infants.

You have to be rather precise to actually hit the key and make it work -- not easy for chubby five-month-old hands/fingers/feet (and by the way, he's NEVER tried to play it with his feet!); and2.

He bores of it pretty quickly though. I only get about 10 minutes of \\"free time\\" if this is his only stimulation. Also, it has a high and low volume switch, however I still feel the low is loud. He would never fall asleep to it! It has endured endless kicking and hitting (especially in his sleep when he turns 180 degrees in the crib), and shows no wear. I have gone through new batteries once, which is great - you just have to remember to shut it off when it goes into \\"sleep mode\\". I have not used the 2 other setting yet, just the first one.

He is now 14 months old and has never kicked the piano in his crib, nor paid much attention to it otherwise. He likes to touch the lights and tries to get into it and see what's behind it, and that rather takes away from the buttons he's supposed to push to make the sounds. This toy was too expensive for my son to be so disinterested. Maybe he'll grow into it, but so far, he hasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as fun as commercial makes it look!","review":"My son was given this as a gift when he was 4 months old -- we hung it up and thought he'd play with it and have fun since he loved the Sparkling Symphony but he never thought it was fun.

Don't waste your money --"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Like Fun but Doesn't Keep Baby Interested","review":"I thought this toy would be stimulating for my child but she rarely plays with it. We bought in when she was 2 months old. She liked the lights and music and would fall asleep to it sometimes. It doesn't have a timer and it will turn back on if the baby rolls over while sleeping and bumps it. When it turned on while she was asleep it would wake her up. Also, I have never seen her kick it to activate it and she is one year old now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice toy, but, needs some adjustments","review":"This is a nice toy because babies love to kick their feet.

She has not used it once. She won't kick against it and doesn't know that the kicking causes a sound. I realize that maybe she'll like it when she's older, but for now, this toy is just collecting dust for us. We sometimes turn it on in her crib for her to listen to music, but it doesn't have a timer, so it's not good for putting her to sleep. It also doesn't have volume control."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful for just listening","review":"While some musical toys have a \\"tinny\\" sound, this one is so soothing to both my 3 month old daughter and to me!

Moreover, there are absolutely no extras. Finally, this concert was shot as if it was a Lou Reed solo show, not a Velvet Underground show (e.g., when Sterling Morrison takes a solo the camera focuses not on Sterling but on Lou WATCHING Sterling soloing).

I tried to transfer to a VHS but results were less than stellar.Of all the Priest concerts now on DVD I always liked this one. This is the JP I so fondly remember, JP on top of their game. Rob's vocals are simply incredible. I was begining to worry that it would forever be lost when my Betamax died but I stumbled upon this DVD quite by accident and bought it without hesitation. I don't need extras, this concert is fine enough on its own. I think the sound is fantastic, they did an excellent job with the 5.1, what an improvement. And I dont know why some are complaining about the picture quality. Comon people, this WAS filmed in 1982. I dont have new high def tv so on my old fashioned set the picture looks fine:good color and sharp details.

What's up with that?If anyone knows of the quality of this DVD, please do share. I remember seeing it on MTV (yes, they used to show rock videos) back in the early 1980s. Good gig. Let's hope the DVD picture and sound are great. Oh, and the early online reviews on other Web sites stating that Scott is the drummer on this video are wrong. Dave Holland was still in the band during this 1982 gig.Peace!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must buy for any Priest fan","review":"The sound and picture are excellent on this dvd considering when it was shot \\"1982\\". This dvd shows a young Judas Priest. You will notice all the guitarists running around stage alot more then they did on Rising In The East. You will also notice that Rob Halford hits his notes higher and longer. The introduction starts with Electric Eye just like they did on Rising In The East, on this dvd though the song sounds more like the studio version. Some of my favorites are on this one too such as Devil's Child, Screaming For Vengence, The Green Manalishi (with the two pronged crown), and Sinner was amazing. Like I titled this, it is a MUST buy for any Priest fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD video NOT DVD quality","review":"Terrible video quality.

(Although losing ground slightly after the \\"Defenders\\" tour as the records became more watered down each time out; a trend that was finally arrested with \\"Painkiller\\"). In 1982, however, they came to America with high octane goods. Six cuts from \\"Screaming\\" appear on this set list; no other Priest tour featured that many cuts from one album to my knowledge. More importantly however, they deliver the goods with the skilled fury of a band that realizes their time has come. You can see it on their faces, they come into Memphis having kicked the door to the U.S. market off its hinges. This tour became more like a victory lap for Priest as they savored the sight of that door crashing down. This video is mandatory and will remind you how a generation of metal heads could be born in the space of one album and tour."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Priests Were Rising !","review":"Priest's SCREAMING FOR VENGEANCE was a follow-up success to the best-selling BRITISH STEEL album in the US.This being the first live concert available to fans in the vhs era is a classic performance.The dvd itself has a good track list,an impressive Dolby Digital 5.1 sound and a clear full screen picture.Extras include a discography and a Dolby Stereo surround mode.Recommended for those who want to watch a true heavy metal concert by a heavy metal legend on the rise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book - Fast Shipping","review":"Great book and fast shipping.

This book was mentioned so I bought it. On the Larry King Show Bakker came across as very sincere and a man who has begun to put his life back together. Bakker came across as being very rational. Larry King must not have read this book because this book basically says that the end of the world is very near and that believers should stockpile food and water in much the same manner as contemporary survivalists. One of the scenarios calls for a meteor or asteroid to hit the earth which would make the earth uninhabitable. This book was very interesting because basically all religions say that the world is going to end at some point in time. Bakker misjudged the Y2K problem (he said it could lead to chaos and nothing happened) and the supermarkets are overflowing with massive amounts of food, but who can what the future will hold for humanity?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jim Bakker is WRONG again in bible prophecy","review":"This is a thought provoking book. The problem comes in when Jim Bakker tries to take us through scripture to prove that Christians will go through part or all of the tribulation. He quotes from Matt. 24 and the book of Revelation. Both of these books were wriiten to the Jews, not the Gentiles. 1Thess. written by Paul along with Romans tells us that we as Christians will not have the wrath of God poured out on us. The wrath of God was poured out on Chist on the cross! Jim has spent 18 pages rambling on about the certainity of asteriod and meteor hits on the earth. Consciously or unconsciously, Jim seems to have a need to feel the wrath and punishment of God and believes all Christians do. Jesus Christ did it ALL! Sorry Jim, go through the Tribulation if you want, I'm not interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe in this crook.","review":"At first who was Jim Bakker?A faker, a hipocrital, a liar, a bigot, a womanizer.And then this same crook comes, claiming that he is the God's prophet!In the last about 2,000 years ; many people have claimed that Jesus is near, and he will return in a few years/months.All of then were wrong.Jesus isn't returning.I tried to read this book about 10 years ago, here in Brazil.A pentecostal brazilian send this book to I read.After about one week reading this bad book, I return the book, to the owner.I never finished it.If after reading everything, I wrote up, if you want to buy this book, then a last question for me.Jim Bakker wrote this book claiming Jesus is near.Since this, more than 20 years have passed.Since than, China is more than 3 times more rich.Never in human history, so many people had car, clean water, eletricity,CD, DVD, computers,etc.And there's people believing in a crook called Jim Bakker."},{"rating":"1","title":"From one side of the ditch to the other!","review":"This is just another book among many lately that are attacking the pre-tribulation view of the rapture of the church. The bible clearly teaches that the church is not appointed to wrath. Matthew 24 is not talking to the church, but to the Jews. Many get this wrong, and Jim Baker did too. Readers beware, maintain a literal interpretation of the Bible, and watch out for the Kingdom Now, Covenant Theology type of teachings which are continually spreading. They teach no rapture, no millinium, and no tribulation.

Add just a touch of 1980s New Wave, and Broadcast occupy quite a sphere.This album has some of the best in that range, including some more modern electronics, but plenty of 1960s soundtrack-y work to go around. These guys must listen to a hell of a lot of old records, because I have heard extensively and never do Broadcast fall into parody. They quite literally make you think you are in 1966 Paris.Great addition or starting point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Broadcast","review":"I recently heard this band on a compilation or a website or something along those lines and at first I was not too impressed. They seemed to be copying a 60s kinnda sound with their psychadelic sounding guitar and loungy drums, along with a pretty strong singer who has dressed herself up to look just like that. However, after I had seen the band on several top 10, 20, 30 etc. lists I decided to look into it more. I was very happy with what I heard the second time around. I've always liked this sound...if any of you have ever seen Barbarella with Jane Fonda, then I'm sure you'd agree with me here when I say that Broadcast would be the perfect band to make the soundtrack for that movie or any other mellow tone loungy-type film.

The sound of these songs is as important as the melodic material they project (many bands try to do this, but \\"HAHA Sound\\" is the most successful balancing of the two I've ever heard).

They don't sound like Morbid Angel, Cannibal Corpse, or Suffocation. On here, they haven't yet developed their innovative style completely, especially the dissonant riffs and bizarre melodies, but the riffing is still innovative. Its kind of like Morbid Angel's Altars of Madness, an album where they hadn't yet reached their full potential, but still had enough integrity to make them rise above the rest of the bands in the genre.There is a real emphasis on the low end, especially the vocals which are probably some of the lowest I've ever heard.

I'm glad I chose to order my books this way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Vygotsky?","review":"\\"Lev Vygotsky: Revolutionary Scientist\\" by Fred Newman and Lois Holzman purports to be a clear introduction to Vygotsky and his ideas but it's actually a muddled, mish-mosh in which Vygotsky's discoveries get lost in a sea of philosophical, political, and psychological jargon. For example, the authors devote pages to discussing the \\"Zone of Proximal Development,\\" a concept central to understanding Vygotsky's contributions to learning theory, but never bother to explain or define it for the reader. Moreover, the authors have an alarming axe to grind. Fired up by revolutionary zeal, they want to show that Vygotsky's ideas are thoroughly Marxian and are valueless in any other context. Reading the book has something of the feeling of being invited to a seminar on financial planning and then discovering that the seminar is a poorly disguised infomercial for an expensive and unremunerative annuity. Readers searching for a lucid introduction to Vygotsky should look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harper Collins Robert French Unabridged Dictionary","review":"Not a French Unabridge Dictionary, this is, in fact, a very good French-English English-French dictionary. While it is quite good, you should realize the title is misleading and it is written and compiled in England. You will find unfortunate translations which skew the real meaning. Example: 'tetes brulees' is translated as \\"desperado\\", when it really means 'hot-head', 'daredevil'. Another: \\"foutu\\" is translated as 'damn', 'bloody', when it really means the four-letter word \\"f---\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book","review":"In my opinion, you should save your money.

The Koi like it. Good in cooler temperatures as well. Easily digestible and doesn't cloud the water."},{"rating":"1","title":"HIGHLY lacking...","review":"As Dara Joy's number one fan, I must say I was keenly disappointed in High Intensity. The story line was vague and the same descriptions of people are repeated over and over and over...All the characters in the book are majorly eccentric in their own ways, to the point of unbelievability. The mystery was a mystery to all but Tyber with no real clues being tossed out for readers to guess. Besides, didn't we ALREADY read about Tyber's and Zanita's romance? Did we REALLY need to read about it again?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"This book was not good. In fact, I would say this was the worst. Her characters were flat. The story line was very boring. I kept reading it thinking it would get better. Ms. Joy is a very good futurist romance writer. Probably one of the best I have ever read, so this really disappointed me. If you never read any of her books, don't read this one as your first for you will never read another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I was extremely disappointed - the plot never got together, I found it boring, I never got into the characters.and their was no build to the climax. I have loved all her other books though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This story was no where near as good as the first story High Energy. The story had absolutely no energy and it seemed as though she had to force herslef to make the book. And the romance between Mills and Gregor never really gets a resolution. Hopefuly she'll make a book for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"She Gets Better and Better","review":"When I realized this book was a sequel, I thought' how can she possibly make a sequel that would be just as good as the book before it?' Well ladies, she did! This book is just as hot, sexy and fun as High Energy. And after reading this book as well as all of her others, I have to say that I am waiting in breathless anticipation for her next story. I have indeed found my favorite author and her name is Dara Joy. Her imaginative storytelling will hold you in its grip until you have reached the last page. And make you beg for more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and sexy","review":"This was the funniest romance I've read this year--it had me weak with laughter several times. Zanita and Tyber are very very funny and very very sexy together. While more enjoyable if you've read the first book, HIGH ENERGY, I think most readers will be able to get into the story without reading the first. However, there were some petty annoyances, such as prose that was at times too purple and the overuse of some words (after the third use of the word \\"nether\\" I wanted to find my blue pencil, and I cringed each and every time Ty called Zanita \\"baby\\") but on the whole this is a keeper for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"I feel strongly compelled to tell people to save their money and pass on this book. I have enjoyed other Dara Joy books on various levels, but I can't bring myself to turn another page. The banal dialogue and adolescence between the main characters is just insulting. Takes me on an unenjoyable trip back to high school. Enough with the \\"Baby\\" and \\"Doc\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry about that...","review":"...But I couldn't make it past the first chapter and a bit. Have to agree about the level of the banter. It was truly unnatural-sounding and didn't digest well at all. The characters seem as if they should make a compelling mix, but their dialogue was just so desperately trying to be clever and failing that I don't really want to meet them. Perhaps the writing improves later on, but I've got too many unread books on my shelf to take the effort to wade through this to find out.I'm told that Joy's other books are very good, so I may try her again sometime. This book doesn't fire me up to doing so soon.Nice guy on the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Intensity","review":"This book was a major disappointment...I kept struggling and trying to make it past the first chapter, even skipping ahead and finally I gave up. I gave it the coup de grace and put it in my box of books to give to Goodwill, which, if you know how I love books, says it all. Knight of a Trillion Stars was my 1st Dara Joy book and it was so outstanding that I was in high hopes of future books by Dara. Alas, High Intensity just absolutely fizzled out....I couldn't get into the characters at all, and the dialogues just were exasperatingly annoying. I'm sorry Dara, Knight of a Trillion Stars, Rejar and Mine to Take were wonderful, with intelligently crafted characters and plots....please write a book on Traed! Please, no more of this type book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to to Ms. Joy's standards","review":"What a disappointment. Having loved all of her work,I was thrilled to see another Dara Joy novel on the shelf. But this one falls short of the mark. I thoroughly enjoyed Tyber and Zantia in High Energy, but this time out I found them trite and downright annoying. Zantia comes off as a total flake, and if I had to read one more pirate reference, I was going to scream. I continued to read this one hoping it would get better, and boy was I disappointed. This was just plain awful from start to finish - a definite pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zany and fun","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The characters we kept consistent with the previous book and flowed quickly. The humour kept a smile on my face."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Baby........","review":"I have read many of Dara Joy's other books and have enjoyed them. High Energy was good, I especially liked the character of Tyber and his kooky life. The mystery in High Intensity was fun but about halfway through the book I got VERY annoyed with the excessive use of the word \\"baby\\" (used by Tyber 'ad-nauseum' when addressing Zanita). It got worse as the book progressed, often once per page and sometimes twice. It definitely became a distraction and took away from the flow."},{"rating":"1","title":"well, at least the cover was worth the wait.........","review":"The book is lying face down on my coffee table. I made it to page 85 before it hit the wall. It's a shame because High Energy really was good. But, not to belabor the point about how mindless Zanita has gotten or what a befuddling pirate Tyber is, I suggest anyone who wants to buy the book should.....just to enjoy the cover. Tyber in a steamy bathtub. Yummy! Just don't bother reading the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!!!","review":"OK I love everything else I have ever read by Dara Joy, so when I picked this one up I thought I would be in for a good read. Now normally I'm the type that starts a book once the kids are in bed and before I know it the sun is coming up and I'm wishing 'why can't anything like that ever happen to me'...well it took three days to force myself through this one and once I was done, instead of wishing I was the herione caught up in some adventure, I was pretty happy just to be me. I could not get close to the characters, or into the story surrounding them. And what kills me is that the story line had sooo much potential...haunted manors, kitchen ghosts...I guess I'm even more disappointed because I really do enjoy Dara's other works. If you are going to check this one out I would suggest buying it used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"No offense to Dara Joy, as I loved Knight of a Trillion Stars and Rejar, but High Intensity was dull and difficult to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"more like highly vague","review":"I found this book to be very difficult to follow in comparison with Dara Joy's previous publications. A total waste of my time and money. I thought the repoire between the two principal characters more on a high school level than an adult perspective. The 'banter' between the two was absolutely trite or should I say tripe. I would not recommend this tome to anyone should they ask. Maybe the difficulty lies in the comparison of this book as opposed to Mine to Take. I expected more for the level of experience. We could speculate that this book was written earlier in the author's career and was now being released? That makes more sense to me rather than an author's ability to pen the prose deteriorating to this level. Full of cliches I might be but I, as well as other buyers, deserve better. I will surely think long and look long at the next release before its eventual purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"I made it through the book--but.....","review":"I have loved Dara Joy's books in the past, and High Energy was one of my all-time favorites. High Intensity, however, does not live up to its name! Although it was amusing to read about these characters again, the tension and fun of the first book just did not carry over. I got to the point where if Tyber called Zanita \\"Baby\\" one more time, I would reach into the page and hit him. Ms. Joy should have written a book about Gregor and Mills rather than rehashing the relationship between Tyber and Zanita again. Not her best effort!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tyber and Zanita heat it up again","review":"I was thrilled to find out that Dara Joy had written a sequel to her wonderfully entertaining book High Energy. If there was ever a romantic couple that I would want to read another book about it would have to be Tyber and Zanita. They are the funniest characters I have ever encountered, and their chemistry is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"MISS!","review":"Dara Joy has had a number of hits - but sadly this wasn't one of them! The storyline will leave readers who haven't read \\"High Energy\\" confused and wondering who these people are, why we should care about them, and what the inside joke is. I found I didn't care much for Zanita and Tyber and nearly gave up on this novel several times because I just couldn't follow the storyline.If you want to read Dara Joy at her best, I suggest reading \\"Rejar\\". There, you'll see Ms. Joy sparkle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"High Intensity Falls Flat!","review":"I'm probably going to get bashed by Dara Joy's fans, but this book is pretty bad. I loved High Energy, the first book in this series. The lead characters Tyberius Augustus Evans and Zanita Masterson sizzled in the first book and sizzle out in the second book. Ms. Joy spent around half of High Intensity recapping what had happened in High Energy. As wacky as the lead characters are, even they couldn't support such a lame plot in High Intensity. The only redeeming quality about this book is some new scenes between Tyber and Zanita and the reappearance of some wonderful secondary characters from High Energy.Will I buy the third book in this series if there is one? Probably in hopes it recaptures the spirit of the first book. Dara Joy has created a captivating couple in Tyber and Zanita--but please--give them a better plot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Physics made Easy","review":"Tyber is back with his holistic method of teaching Physics. Zanita's nonlinear thinking and Dara Joy's sense of humor bring back a fun sexual romance couple. This is the long awaited sequel to High Energy. Look for a reference to Rejar and Yaniff. Wendy"},{"rating":"1","title":"High Intensity= Intense Dissapointment","review":"As one of Ms. Joy's biggest fans, it greatly saddens me to write a negative review about her novel. The character's in this book have no chemistry, there is no plot, absolutely nothing to hold this book together. I believe this book was to finish up her contract with the publishing company, and this book is hastily written, most likely as a snub to the company. Hopefully William Morris will hang on to her (the new publishers) and keep her set on the Matrix of Destiny series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome return of the Nick & Nora Charles of romance","review":"Bravo to Dara Joy for daring to revisit two wonderful characters first introduced in HIGH ENERGY. Tyber Evans, the sexiest intelligent hero ever, and his zany Zanita, are the Nick and Nora Charles of romantic fiction. Combining his logic with her quirky intuition, the pair take off for Martha's Vineyard with Blooey the chef and Hambone the cat in tow, to investigate a B&B's culinary-based haunting. Joy treats us to sparkling dialogue and as amusing a supporting cast of characters as you'll find anywhere. As if investigating a ghost wasn't enough fun, we also get to witness Tyber's hilarious challenge to Zanita to prove that marriage would kill the passion in their relationship. The only reason I didn't give HIGH INTENSITY 5 stars is because Dara slammed the door on the bedroom just as thing were getting interesting a bit too often."},{"rating":"1","title":"more matrix please!","review":"Okay, Dara Joy is my favorite author, so I want to give her her proper credit as a talented writer, however, High Intensity just didn't start my engine, like her other novels (i.e. Matrix of Destiny series). Tyber's sexy enough, and Zanita's zany enough, but the heat just ain't enough. As a former Nancy Drew fan, I can relate to a crazy ghost chase, but that's not what I was looking for. So please more matrix please..."},{"rating":"1","title":"So So Book","review":"High Intensity--Well the title was misleading for one, I did not find anything through out the book that even came close to \\"High Intensity\\". Zanita and Tyber were good characters, and even if the story line was out there and some-what enjoyable I found myself skiping pages just to read more about Gregor and Mills. Because of them I gave this book two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avid Dara Joy reader","review":"It was a boring experience. Nothing like the previous Dara Joy books I've read.

WHY WAS THIS NOT RECALLED???"},{"rating":"1","title":"toxic plastic?","review":"I called the fisher-price customer service line to ask if this product contained bisphenol-a (deemed toxic recently by Canada) and they refused to answer stating the content was a trade secret and spouting off a rehearsed line stating that the FDA had not found reason for concern about this type of plastic (in the two major studies conducted by them that were, surprise, funded by the plastics industry). I thanked them and bought something else, the Melissa and Doug stacker made of wood and lead-free paint. Fisher-price, shame on you for not being upfront about this. Get used to the question because American consumers are getting educated about this possible very dangerous plastic in our children's toys, baby bottles, Nalgene bottles and lining 95% of the canned food and soda we drink.

He is able to sit up on his own, however, like any other baby, he does fall over in all directions. So, when I gave him this toy to play with he was very amused by it and was thoroughly enjoying it, especially being able to CHEW the rings. Then I noticed that he could fit the yellow cylinder (attached to the base that you stack the rings onto) all the way into his mouth. So I was concerned for his safety that if he fell forward he could lodge it into his throat and obstruct his airway.

Small children who are just learning about their environment are not up to choosing progressively larger rings in order. They try to put them on the pole in the wrong order which is just plain frustrating. Maybe the rings could get larger but the holes in the center of the rings should be the same size, as should the diameter of the pole, so small children can put them on in whatever order they want -- that would increase their enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"My baby loves this toy, she likes to chew on them, through them around, and well, she just has a lot of fun playing it. I really think your baby will enjoy this toy as well as learn a few things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic has been updated.","review":"Everyone had one of these growing up. This one has just had two details changed. The top ring has become a \\"rattle\\" of sorts with a bunch of colorful little balls inside that your child can shake around at a prettye early age, and the base is curved so it can rock back and forth. It's just one of those simple toys that lasts forever, and I'm glad we got it for my son. Our boy is 9 months right now, but has been playing with the rings for just chewing on, or to shake that top one since he was 4 months old. I'm sure we will eventually upgrade to getting them on in the right order, and saying our colors with it, but for now, he finds playing hand soccer pretty entertaining, or just throwing the rings as hard as he can pretty fulfilling. You can't go wrong with this toy. : ]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Contains bpa","review":"Yes, this is a great toy. But, FP has confirmed that it contains bpa. For children who chew on toys, particularly young children who sometimes do this continuously, this is an unnecessary and inappropriate danger. FP knows better but prefers to sell a cheaper product instead of one that is safe for consumers. I wish I knew before we got this.I ended up buying a wooden one from Holgate. Yes, more expensive. But i can't in good conscience expose my child to chemicals we know are dangerous.

I'm a firm believer on reading reviews before making a purchase, but I failed to this time. I saw this toy and remembered it from days-gone-by when my babies were little. I wanted to get it for our granddaughter to keep at our house for upcoming visits. Who would have thought it would have been made of anything toxic??? How can Fisher-Price or Mattel or whoever get away with poisoning our little ones? It's unbelievable. I've already unwrapped this or I would have returned it.

In regards to the BPA, it doesnt make me happy that it's there, but since we're not heating up the rings and she's not chewing on them constantly, I'm going to make a mental note of it but not worry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Dye Turned Baby BLUE","review":"My daughter was playing with the blue ring from this toy this morning, and I was horrified when I saw that her entire mouth was BLUE. I took the toy away from her, and immediately called Fisher Price. It is Saturday, and they are closed, but I did look at their website and saw there was no mention of the blue dye coming off these rings. I looked at other websites, however, and saw lots of pictures of babies whose skin has turned blue from these blue rings. These people stated they had called Fisher Price on the matter, but that Fisher Price has refused to recall the product. Please do not buy this product for your kids.

As she got older, she would practice putting the rings over the pole; she didn't care if they went on in the right order or not, she just enjoyed stacking them!

I really enjoyed the section on near death experiences, and Freud's ideas of dreams were a bit strange but I am not well read on Freud's psychoanalysis work however sometimes I wonder if he was drinking a bit too much Absinthe. I am also far from anything of an expert on Judaism, Islamic Sufism or basically any other beliefs outside of Catholic or Christian, so the chance to learn a bit on all of them was a wonderful opportunity. The last section there was some part that he brought up the fact that some religions predict the end of the world, like Millerites and Jehovah's witnesses by the way how many times did they predict the world was going to end? I have to ask them the next time they come to my door. Over all I have to say what a wonderful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Omens Of The Millenium.","review":"Harold Bloom made a million dollars of this book. Yet, he did not cite appropriately. In fact he took advantage ofsociety approaching the year 2000 to spread much anti-intellectual propaganda; such as that there is a common agreementamong the major religions of the world that such a thing will happen. In fact, there is not. Sufism is not considered apart of Islam since it condones too many things. The Day Of Judgement is a part of orthodox Islam, however it does notstate that Bloom will date it accurately as the year 2000. Kabbalah and Orthodox and Reform Judaism never state an endtime and are quite recalcitrant as to what happens after death. Christianity proposes an end time; however, it does notsay, \\"Ask a Muslim.\\" Professor Bloom's Gnostic vision does not seem to be very clear, however, the man has legal billsto pay.

The packaging indicates it is PVD brass finish, which means it is durable and resistant to corrosion. In addition to the shower arm and the flange, a hex wrench was included to tighten the flange, and Teflon tape to make water tight seals. I ended up using my own Teflon tape since the roll they included was poor quality, but I am sure it would have sufficed. I had no problem fitting the arm into the existing plumbing and attaching my showerhead.

It's made even more beautiful and unique paired with the 6-string guitar. That's one thing that I have to hand to these guys.

The author is very transparent trying to convince the reader the sex-industry is a victimless crime at best. He fails miserably by then going through the dreary list of women who were abused, ruined, commited suicide or were murdered in the industry.

I don't buy the no questions policy or the relationship between her and Maurice. And I really think the idea of reincarnating her was stupid, she was bad enough the first time she was alive, never mind the second. The book was too long, too drawn out, and too sappy for my tastes.

One minute he wants the girl the next he tries to get rid of her then whines about not having her then gets her back...its a neverending cycle right up to the end. About half way through the book I was wishing Gabriel (the vampire) would just suck it up and walk out into the daylight.Not one of the better vampire romances, but if you like your main character to be a 400 year old whiney baby then this book is for you.

I loved going there on my days off and sifting through all the bins looking at obscure titles, just like this one. The reason I bought this cd is because I recognize Bunny's name from the thousands of artist's she sang back up for, so I trusted the material contained within. \\"Talking With The Angels\\" is my favorite track, the album as a whole is thoroughly enjoyable and contrary to the jazz label, the music is not jazz, but straight up pop. The production is flawless for pop music and listening to Bunny's clear voice, it's easy to understand why she is in such demand for backing sessions for other artists. I wish her solo catalog was a bit more accessable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Everything, but close enough.","review":"I Had not yet puchased any of the movies/specials and when this set came out I was delighted! Lets first start by saying this set includes: Slayers The Motion Picture, Slayers Return, Slayers Great, Slayers Gorgeous, and Slayers Premium. All Movies are in Widescreen Presentation Except for Slayers Great. Slayers The Motion Picture, is the Essential Anime Disc release so it comes with commentary. Slayers Premium Also has a behind the scenes interview and Commentary. The other DVDs only come with it's trailer and ADV previews.My only regret in this set is that while this box includes most of the Movies, it still did not come with Slayers Excellent, and The book of Spells DVD. I don't understand why it didnt come with Excellent, but The Movies it did include are great to watch! I reccomend this if you have bought the series, but havent gotten around to purchasing any of the Movies yet, just remember to purchase Excellent and Book of Spells to complete your Collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, good, but not great","review":"I'm a long-time fan of Slayers and would recommend the three main series \\"Slayers\\" \\"Slayers Next\\" and \\"Slayers Try\\" because they are phenomonal in creation, story, and design. These OVAs, with the exception of The Motion Picture, are not as great, and do not use the original voice of Lina for younger Lina.These, for the most part (except for Premium) take place prior to the main series, although Lina's exact age isn't revealed (15 in the trilogy). They are fun, zany, and Lina and Naga get into all sorts of scrapes.Premium and The Motion Picture are the best of the set...and anything with Ghourry is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Sontarans","review":"Sarah Jane's neon yellow jacket, the Doctor's broken collarbone and some great scenery make this memorable.

Good episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"A short but entertaining episode.","review":"This was another great Doctor Who DVD.

Seriously, all they do the whole serial is run around the quarry, get captured, get away, run around some more, get captured again, etc. It all feels like perhaps the Sontaran's are playing pretend with a bunch of captured \\"friends\\" rather than actually trying to learn about human biology. There is an amusing ending, but I feel it would have been cleverer if the Doctor had simply been trying to get the Sontaran to turn around so he could smack him in the probic vent. That was the way to beat them in The Time Warrior, so why not in The Sontaran Experiment?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nim's Island","review":"I received my dvd in very good time, it was in good condition when it came.

I usually enjoy Jody Foster and the other talents in this movie, but they should have stopped filming while they were ahead and that was in the process of reading the script.

It's definitely not worth anything more than that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trailer Say What?","review":"Anyone who has seen this Movie needs to go back and watch the trailer. The trailer describes it as an action pack adventure as an Action Writer (Jodie Foster) and a little girl (Abigail Breslin) go in search of her missing father (Gerard Butler). There is no action, no adventure and no SEARCHING. Everyone just ends up together in the last 8 minutes of the movie. Yes, the trailer is good. It's very good.

The previews were so good. I think that at every opportunity to excel this film fails. It is very predictable and lame. It is also a difficult blend of deep and extremely juvenile. The kids that sat behind me at the theater were very confused by the agoraphobia scenes and when Jodie got to the island, it was as big of a disappointment as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Movie","review":"This was a very nice family movie, although we watched it as a girls night movie. Jodie Foster was unexpected in this movie, but as always she was great and made the movie better. Abigail Breslin was great in her role and made the movie. As for Gerard Butler, this is the type of movie I first noticed him in and would like to see him do more family, nice guy roles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nims Island","review":"I watched this without the company of children and still found pleasure in the story line. It definitely requires the ability to stretch your mind into the realms of fantasy so it's important to watch from a child-like point of view. Abigail Breslin is a delight and, surprisingly, there is a moral to the story that I found heartwarming. Jody Foster is very funny, and Gerard Butler is always a pleasure to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jodie, you let us down. . .","review":"This is a bland, shallow, and implausible story. It's what you'd expect of a cynical Hollywood production committee: \\"Hey, let's do Home Alone meets As Good As It Gets with some computer-enhanced Astonishing Animals (with fart jokes of course). Wait, wait, wait, throw in a Strong Girl. Yeah. Everybody approves of a Strong Girl movie!\\"I just don't understand why Jodie Foster let herself get mixed up in this piece of junk. Usually you can trust her to be very careful about the jobs she'll accept.On the bright side, there's nothing really gratingly offensive in the movie, and it makes a sort of token effort at a preserve-the-wilderness theme."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nim's Island","review":"I really enjoyed this heartwarming story and I especially enjoyed the different roles played by Gerard Butler and Jodi Foster.

Foster,Butler, and Breslin are all wonderful, and they more than make up for a old, but tried and true plot (combination of Home Alone, Jewel of the Nile, and Swiss Family Robinson). Excellent special effects and action sequences. Not to be taken seriously, this movie is just fun to watch. Blue ray copy is wonderful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Awful","review":"I enjoy kids movies and I like both Foster and Butler a lot. What the directors had these talented actors doing is nothing short of embarrassing. I simply cannot call what anyone did in this film acting, as it was so deplorable. Since I know Foster and Butler have done brilliant work in the past, I have to lay the blame at the feet of the directors. They had Foster mugging with unrealistic facial contortions better left to a circus. Butler fared a little better, but he, too, had some difficult moments.The child playing Nim was simply forgettable.The story had potential and could have been done well under other directors. The scenery was beautiful. However, even that couldn't save this uninspired mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Favorite in our house","review":"My 7 year old daughter has fallen in love with Nims Island. My four year old son and I enjoy watching it also. I have wondered if the message in the movie is correct in conveying that it is okay to maroon yourself on an island and not go to school. However, I really don't think this is the message my daughter is getting. I think she just enjoys Nims brave attitude, and watching all the funny antics of the animals."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected much more.","review":"After seeing the trailers, I must admit that I was expecting far far more to this movie. The premise is that Jodie Foster is persuaded to go to Nims island to help Nim find her lost father, and of course she is a fish-out-of-water type on this island. However, she arrives on the island in the evening, and the next morning father comes back, and the movie is over ! A whole 10 minutes worth of the movie. My thought was \\"is that it ???, is that all there is to it ???\\" . The grand adventure she is supposed to have on this island does not happen. Have movie making standards really dropped so much ?

The WT-966B has a stainless steel band, and the plastic watch body is finished with a substance that matches the band exactly. It all appears to be made of stainless steel.

The disc includes the Alan Jackson duet It's 5 O'Clock Somewhere, Cheeseburger, Meet Me in Margaritaville, Tiki Bar, Knees of My Heart, and Fins.

In this case, the hour hand gets stuck on the temperature gauge, and the clock stops telling time. I have to take the clock down and give it a tap to get it running again, and then it takes about a day to reset the time.Were it not for the 60degrees at 3:00-3:30 flaw, I'd give this a 10/10.

It is under the overhang at the peak of my roof, which provides enough water protection that I have never had a problem, even in heavy rains. It has never fallen in the wind, though the one drawback I would give is that it is lightweight and I know if it ever did fall, it would probably break into several pieces.True, it must be brought inside in the fall, for the Northern Minnesota winters fall well below 40 degrees, but I also am not sitting on my deck in the winter, wondering what time it is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Atomic feature did not work","review":"Needed large clock for my classroom, but it never picked up the signal indoors where every other atomic clock I have bought does work so I returned it to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"out clock 318ip","review":"very unsatisfied - it does not apparently work in the southern hemisphere.

The clock and the thermometer are extremely accurate, the hygrometer just so, so. It is functional under low temperatures as I've had it outside during the winter season and it has maintained it's accuracy with temperatures as low as 5 degrees above zero Fahrenheit. I don't know if I'd buy the product and use it outdoors if I lived in an arctic or subarctic environment but it seems suitable to give good results all year round where I live in the lower Great Lakes region of North America.

If I were to package the tracks, I would probably exclude some of her less memorable songs. In my opinion, \\"Bedtime Story\\" wasn't that great, and neither was \\"Drowned World/Substitute for Love\\". She should have included \\"better\\" songs.

She acts and looks the same to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, But NOT Great","review":"Madonna has been the most influential female artist in recent years, but this Greatest Hits Collection falls short of the Immaculate Collection, its predicessor. The reason is probably the fact that she left out such Mega-Hits as \\"You'll See\\" and \\"I'll Remember,\\" which I believe would have made the CD worthy of the same caliber and revere given to the Immaculate Collection.

Taken with her previous two hits sets, it is hard to fathom that Madonna was able to achieve so much success so many times. Her trick was to keep things real--real spirituality (\\"Frozen,\\" \\"Secret,\\" \\"Bedtime Story\\"), real attitude (\\"Human Nature,\\" \\"Erotica,\\" \\"What It Feels Like For A Girl\\"), real heartbreak (\\"The Power Of Good-bye,\\" \\"Take A Bow\\"), and real fun (\\"Deeper and Deeper,\\" \\"Ray Of Light,\\" \\"Music\\").

This is the album recommended for those who did not buy her CDs and want to have the greatest songs at home.I believe Warner should have released a greatest hits colection like \\"something to remember\\".

First of all, I know that a chronological order of the tracks might have been boring, but it would have made more sense to me in this case. Second, she shortchanged us on the good songs. Why isn't the Don't Cry For Me Argentina remix on here, instead of the regular track? What happened to Nothing Really Matters, Fever, American Pie, and You'll See? The Power of Good-Bye is a nice song, but it wasn't a very successful single, and could have been taken off to make room for a better track.Final analysis: Madonna must want us fans to make our own compilations from MP3 files, or she would have treated us to a better compilation, with a new single or two!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can Madonna do anything wrong?","review":"I wish there were more stars to give away!!

I could go on, but I'll spare you!The songs here are Madonna's best from 1992-2001. This album does not disappoint, in any way. I do however have one small problem, I wish she would have added some new jams to the collection, perhaps the funny cowboy song from her HBO special would have been a nice addition...but alas...this album ROCKS and if you are a fan, and you must be because you're reading this review, BUY IT!!! What are you waiting for!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SO FAR AWAY FROM IMMACULATE!","review":"This Greatest Hits doesn't stand close to the \\"Classic\\" title that \\"Immaculate Collection\\" stands for, many essential tracks where left out, mainly ballads, if the point of not including them was because they were available in \\"Something To Remember\\", well just not included \\"Take A Bow\\" as well, but they did?, so how come?, why this collection didn't click?, well maybe because all Madonna's 90's albums were \\"Concept Album\\" one album very different from the other, with different styles and dynamics. So the songs feel kind of out of their original place. The only good thing about this, is that the marketing people from Warner, placed all the radio edit of the songs, thx, because \\"Frozen\\" was way too long. If You don't own any of the 90's albums of Madonna, this maybe will help you, but if you do skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of Madonna","review":"This is an awesome CD. Although I liked her Immaculate Collection album, I feel that this cd brings about a more mature Madonna. Her music is softer and her voice better modulated than her high shrilly voice from the 80's. I definitely do recommend this album to all Madonna fans. All of the songs on this cd I like with the exception of Erotica but 1 out 16 isn't all bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"No new songs","review":"A good collection of songs but why no new songs or maybe a bonus disc with extra remixes. The price is too high for song you already have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Buying","review":"Altnough there are many tracks missing from this album its still worth buying. Favourites like Deeper and Deeper, Ray Of Light and Msuic are all here, along with tracks like Beautiful Stranger and Take A Bow. This album shows how #Maonna has changed over the years to appeal to a wider audience and shows that she has managed to do it without compromising herself or her musical ability"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but no Immaculate Collection!","review":"The second collection of Madonna's greatest hits has one big flaw: her old songs were better.Here, however, there are some excellent songs starting from the \\"Erotica\\" era and continuing all the way to \\"Don't Tell Me.\\" If you like the newer stuff, go for it. But if you ask me, the real hits on her first greatest hits volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's the new stuff?","review":"I've been in love with Madonna since 1980, so I'm certainly a huge fan and have seen her in concert (before it cost $5,000 a ticket)... but I was hoping for some new material. This is a decent collection but one would be better off buying the Immaculate Collection. At least you'd get 2 more songs, a video, poster, and some postcards... all in a nice box."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little disapointed","review":"I was a little disapointed of the somngs on the CD but besides that I'm no complainer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Madonna, Edited?!?!","review":"I have been the biggest of Madonna fans for over seven years now and I was disappointed to say the least, to find out that all of the tracks are EDITED!!! Come on people!!! Has Madonna ever let herself been edited? I think not!! Let me know when the old Madonna comes back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get into the Groove with this Ray of Light!","review":"Ok, so there were a few songs that were left out and a few songs that did not deserve to be on a CD titled Greatest Hits, but the CD is still a great buy for the casual Madonna fan. And for those of us who are Madonna Fanatics, it's ok to buy to add to the collection but not to get excited over new material, which this CD lacks. For those of you who enjoy the singles released, buy this CD. For those of you interested in seeing alot of pictures of Madonna, buy this CD. I suggest you just buy this CD. It does not go in chronological order as The Immaculate Collection did, so don't expect to go through the years in order. I give it 5 stars because the songs on the CD are great, inspirational songs and plus, it's Madonna. How can you not give it 5 stars?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Madonna, I HATE u.

She mainly appeals to unhip people over the age of 47 now. She looked about 57 when this album was made.You can pick this one up and her others at the local used CD stores for $1.00. They have dozens of copies."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Can I Say? It's Madonna, She Just Simply Rocks!","review":"GHV2 is a great album that you should defenetly have in your collection, especially if you are a Madonna fan. The album is filled with hits that will groove you on from track to track nonstop. However perfect it may see, the album is not a 5star album because it failed to add some great singles such as \\"Rain\\" and \\"Bad Girl\\". Thankfully \\"American Pie\\" was left out of the album which leads me to say that was a smart move. With such great tracks like \\"Erotica\\", \\"Bedtime Story\\", \\"Beautiful Stranger\\", \\"Ray Of Light\\", \\"Frozen\\", \\"Don't Tell Me\\" and \\"Music\\" this album is doomed to be ANOTHER success for the world's favorite Material Girl, Madonna. All I can say is \\"Way To Go!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I ordered, and in great condition.","review":"This is a nice Madonna CD for any of her fans. The seller was also wonderful. They provided unbeatable prices, and super fast shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE but not new","review":"I love this music and it is a great set of tunes.I second the motion of :you to only get this Limited Edition CD if your a true die hard fan\\". It is a great collecters item but other than tha I would stick with the original as it is much cheaper and missing very little besides the fancy packaging.This is just a re-release of the last stuff. But still worth listening to ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Hits 92-00","review":"This is Madonna's greatest hits from the year 1992 through 2000.All the songs are koooo,especially Erotica,Deeper and Deeper and Bedtime Story!Although it's missing a lot of songs that were hits!But overall it gets 100/100 for being a true singer.Here are the songs that were missiing that should have been added to this:Fever,Rain,Bad Girl,I'll Remember,You Must Love Me,This Used To Be My Playground,You'll See,Nothing Really Matters and American Pie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Choice for the Maddy fan","review":"As other reviewers have noted, it doesn't differ in musical content from the regular version, but does offer snazzier packaging: a hard cover encloses the booklet and disc, the booklet offers slightly different artwork (mostly more photographs)and the disc itself has different artwork. This is a good version for the dyed in the wool Madonna fan, and the collection of songs is really a must have in any form."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an immaculate collection","review":"As a Madonna fan, I was and still am so disappointed with this album. It is my understanding (as stated on the fan club site) that she picked the songs rather than letting fans do so (like Bjork.) I like most of the original versions of these songs but every song on this CD is edited. I don't understand the running order either, i.e. why these song are in this order. I made a CD prior to this coming out and all of her singles from this time period and they fit onto an 80 minute CD. Why did they leave some out? Immaculate Collection was over 70 minutes long where this barely runs 60 minutes. Also Immaculate Collect was in order of release and fit so well. I think that is why Immaculate Collection is still selling records and this one has died off. The only good thing about this CD is the Booklet with a great collection of photos and a hillarious story. Sorry Maddy, you have let me down."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ingredients are bad","review":"Sodium lauryl sulfate (one of the top five ingredients in this soap) is a known skin irritant and shouldn't be present in any high-end product.

I give to this CD five stars, and recommend it to anyone wanting to be initiated to the thrash metal genre.

I know that LaHaye and Jenkins are using their own interpretations of Revelation, but their books are based on a lot of study and prayer.

Uhh no they didn't, they had 11 kids that we know of for a fact, and any reputable source will tell you she was a very active caring mother, strict yes, but only by today's standards.

The songs are drowned in syrup and soft drum-machine beats. This could be such a stark, powerful album, but it's not, and it's such a shame -- the songs themselves are gorgeous.

It isn't. Don't be fooled by price -- pay the extra money and get what you pay for.I returned this model and bought the Sony TRV11. The video quality on the JVC is noticeably worse. This could be because of the lack of the Carl Zeiss lens or the lack of low lux recording (both found on the Sony).The battery that came with the JVC only lasted about 30 minutes (compared to about 1 hour with Sony) and the image stabilization was shoddy at best. Also, the LCD screen quality on the JVC is just so-so.While the JVC does have a built in light, it is really useless for night shooting.Overall, the JVC has average quality and features.

It doesn't even have a twain driver cuz it has its own propriotory software for communicating with the camera. There are no twain drivers for this camera. JVC must have been thinking of conquering the universe. either that or they were sure in a hurry to bring it out in the market. its really more of a toy. This I believe is the \\"pinhole camera\\" of the Digital Video Camera market.Sorry, i really am way out dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"Buyer beware regarding Star Packer with Lucky Texan, both starring a young John Wayne on one DVD from Westlake Entertainment. Even at $0.25 plus $2.98 shipping, this is only for those who are going to watch on a nine-inch or smaller television screen. Both source prints are soft dupes with much surface noise and drop-outs.Both films are worth watching if you buy better versions. These are early John Wayne, five-day wonders cranked out for Lone Star Pictures during the mid-1930s. John is supported by George \\"Gabby Hayes\\" and Yakima Canutt. The story lines are fairly simple but entertaining.If you can find this at a Dollar Store and don't care about quality, then these will suffice. But don't watch on a big screen and certainly not on an HD screen. So, thumbs up for the films but thumbs down for this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a good relay, but.....","review":"What they don't state about this particular relay is the fact that two terminals are much larger than the other two. They won't fit any standard relay socket, and if you use this you will have to purchase larger terminal connectors for your purpose! Found out the hard way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Terd....","review":"Wanted a temporary fix for my electric fan to get me home from vacation and this was WAY to temporary.... Running a 30 amp max in-rush electric fan (through a 30 amp fuse powering it BEFORE the relay) so IF this was a 70 amp unit as advertised it should have lasted longer than the three days it took to melt down.... Got a Bosch relay and it worked perfect for the three months I needed it to in Florida, and its still fine as a spare in my tool box....

I was just afraid because in the description they don't say the Model of this stroller. The delivery was just in time and I was so excited put everything together and jogging with my little one. Then I notice that the model that Amazon is selling is an old model not the new one. I used to buy many products here but this time I'm so mad and disappointed...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I love our new stroller. It is very easy to push and control. We have a very tall daughter and her feet do not drag like they did in our other stroller. She easily falls asleep in the reclining seat and the stoller fits in the back of my Plymoth Breeze better than any other standard stroller we have owned. Very compact and easy to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good versatile jogger","review":"This is a good jogger if you will be using it for more than just jogging. I really like the fact that it has a front swivel wheel that you can lock for jogging and unlock if you need more manuverability. It comes with cup holders, which is nice because a lot of joggers you need to puchase them as an accessory. Overall it is a good stroller, the only thing that I would change in the design would be the wheel locking feature. It has 2 individual locks, one for each wheel. The jogger I had previously had a bar across the back that would lock both wheels at the same time when pressed. I am extremely satified with the stroller for the price at which I purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!","review":"I believe this product is unsafe to use. After using regularly for one week, the front nut that holds the front wheel becomes loose, giving the stroller a speed wobble that will turn the stroller onto its side. I have called InStep, which informed me that you should tighten the bolt before using (DOES NOT STATE IN THE DIRECTIONS). I did tighten the bolt only for it to become loose during a run again and create speed wobbles. I have returned the product to Sports Authority on three separate occasions with the same outcome. This is HIGHLY dangerous. I currently have a call to their customer service manager for hopefully a better response. I believe this product should be taken off the market ASAP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing two important features","review":"We received this stroller for our shower and have only used it a few times so far. I wish that it had a hand brake and a lanyard as we live on a very steep hill. If I had to buy another stroller, I'd definitely look for one with these two features."},{"rating":"2","title":"great walking stroller","review":"I recently recieved this stroller as a gift for Christmas. I just started using it for walking and the wheels move very smoothly. My daughter seems very comfortable in it and usually falls asleep on our walks. The handlebars are very tall which is great because I am 5-10 and my husband is 6-3 and we both are very comfortable pushing the stoller. I did buy the Kiddopotamus sunshade because the sunshade on the stroller does not block the sun from my daughter's eyes, especially when she is lying down. I am very pleased with this stroller for walking and the price was also great as compared to other joggers. I gave it 4 1/2 stars only because of the sunshade, besides that I would give it 5 stars. I definitely recommend this stroller!"},{"rating":"2","title":"InStep Safari Jogging Stroller","review":"I highly recommend this Jogging stroller. Very well made. Stable during a full run.

The padded shoulder straps keep baby very secure and comfortable. 2 thumbs up!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Stroller Yet!","review":"The InStep Safari Stroller is the best of the 4 strollers I own. I wish I had purchased it first and I could have saved some money. Blue and chocolate are great colors. It is obviously bulkier than most but it is a smooth ride for my son.

I have gotten my money's worth and the stroller still looks new. We go down our limerock grade road, through the woods and on trails. This stroller goes everywhere you can imagine.It collapses for carrying in the trunk of a car(I just put in my truck bed), is completely washable, and the color has not faded.There is still a lot of growing room for up to 3-4 years.There is storage underneath for baby care items,a cup holder tray for your sports bottle,and a foot rest for baby to keep his/her legs from getting caught in the front wheel.The added options came as part of a package and would have costly if purchased separately.And it is so lightweight,even a Grandma can have fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stroller for the money!","review":"This stroller was shipped very quickly and was easy to put together. I have enjoyed using the stroller it works much better for walking and jogging than my Graco stroller. I don't like the way the child tray has to be removed to get your child in and out but right now I just leave it off. The stroller doesn't feel as sturdy as I would have liked but I've been using it about 2 months and I haven't had any problems yet. I would recommend this stroller for anyone who doesn't have the money for a more expensive brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"wobbly front wheel and unstable","review":"I got this stroller about a month ago. It worked fine for 2 days and that is it. After that I was walking around the track and the front wheel kept wobbling so crazy that other joggers and walkers stopped to help me see what was wrong with it. The wheel nearly fell off! I took sent it back asap and bought a baby trend expedition LX at target for even cheaper than this one and it is much sturdier and I don't fear that my baby will be harmed from the front wheel falling off!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great - but cup holders too small","review":"I bought the InStep safari Swivel Jogging Stroller in chocolate/blue - looks great! I bought it on the recommendation of a friend with 3 little ones and based on other reviews. The stroller is great - smooth ride, lots of room. My 2-year-old daughter seems very comfortable in it. The only problem is the size of the cup holders. They are not big enough to accomodate most water bottles. I can fit a small, 16 oz. narrow bottle and that is about it. I cannot understand why a company would overlook such a thing, especially since they were thoughtful about everything else. This is the reason I give it only 4 stars - if the cup holders were bigger it would definitely be worthy of 5 stars. Not really a big deal because I store my larger water bottle in the pouch located under the tray.I would most definitely recommend this product! And of course Amazon is awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book to share with elementary age children.","review":"I am a guidance counselor who uses this book with fourth grade students. It provides an easy format for helping this age student understand that they have control of their feelings and reactions. It has helped some of my most difficult students to gain skill in social situations by controlling their own feelings. The more they understand themselves the more they can accept responsibility for their actions. This book helps them step by step to learn how to take that responsibility for their emotions and their lives. I recommend it heartily. (My students can check this book out from me to read at home. I was surprised at the number of parents who read it and commented that, not only did they enjoy it, but they also found themselves using the ideas in the book.) Nancy Lessig (rlessig@bellsouth.net"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awakening of the Ancients.","review":"The concept behind \\"Testimony of the Ancients\\" reveals a great deal of interest towards the legacy of past entities, the album arrangement with a short interlude before or after (depending on perspectives) a song create an atmosphere enhanced by the subtle use of keyboards on the main songs. Such complex songs such as \\"Twisted Truth\\", \\"Testimony\\" and \\"Presence of the Dead\\" have interesting use of tempo and variation underlined by defined bass lines that play at their own pace. Guitars and Drums shows higher technicality than those of previous efforts and the vocals sound brutal and right at place.A technical Death Metal Landmark with enough creativity and punishment that make the Ancients proud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Growing up","review":"In my opinion this album is a middle point between the straight-foward trash of their previous albums and their upcoming Prog-metal masterpiece \\"Spheres\\". There's some experimentation with guitar-synts; the songs here are not so mature as in \\"Spheres\\" but they are heavy and fast. Along with Atheist this band is the precursor of Progressive Death Metal; a \\"must have\\" for every Cynic fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"A contender for the title of 'most overrated death metal classic'. The production is flat and dry, the vocals lack power, the frequent experimental interludes are annoying, and the actual songs are patchy. I bought this record as a spotty, undiscerning teenager and it bored me to tears even then. I unwittingly bought a second copy when it was bundled two-for-one with the masterful 'Consuming Impulse' re-release. If you really must hear 'Testimony of the Ancients', buy that same package, and then you can use it as a Frisbee or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambles through the land of narcotics like a lost tourist...","review":"The author leads us to believe that prohibition of drugs in any form is a terrible idea and is the reason why so many people are getting rich off of the drug trade. His theory has many holes and though I understand what he is trying to say, I didn't like his Marxist-style commentary. He rambles through the first 5 chapters like a lost tourist and has some very foolish ideas on how to treat the drug epidemic. Not one of the better books on the subject of drug use and abuse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great John Jakes novel.","review":"CALIFORNIA GOLD is the story of Macklin Chance, who like many others of his day, journeys to the land of California with the hopes of finding a new life and fortune.

I thoroughly enjoyed this book, although I do not feel it's Jake's best.

Interestingly, it is a very sad music, which is not correlated to the ambiance of the series, which is quiet comic and entertaining.Persuaders is fun. IMHO it is about Tony Curtis. They could put somebody else in place of Roger Moore and it could turn out okey, but changing Tony Curtis would make a huge difference.Another thing that has caught my attention is the state of the world at the beginning of the 70's. The world looks so innocent, nave, clean, and unpopulated. SO different from the world we are living in today.

This was ordered from Amazon and fulfilled by Sweetearth Foundation, who put this item in the mail in May of 2011 and as of October 2012 it hasn't been delivered. Not sure if it was sent book rate (last priority) or what happened but somewhere between NJ and MI the item disappeared and it had been so long (oh, it'll show up eventually won't it?)that I apparently forgot about the order. A recent prompt by Amazon reminded me of this situation. And it seems that Sweetearth has gone the way of my package because they aren't a presence on Amazon any longer either. Oh well, MY BAD (memory) but others should be reminded that USPS and mailing books can be an imperfect solution."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece in the truest sense of the word","review":"Without a doubt, this volume is the best word on jazz ever written. A sophisticated wit, coupled with a dry sense of humor permeates many of the entries, unlike many volumes about the music which talk down to the neophyte. Many of the passages read like literature--particularly when reading about Miles and Trane. There are very few omissions in this the latest edition. Only a few quibbles--Why so rough on John Coltrane's Live in Japan? Where is the entry for Mark Whitfield's work? Other than that this volume approaches perfection, and if this review helps sell more copies of this outstanding tome, my pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"The same old excellent work","review":"Eccellent and essential reference for all jazz appraisers. Accurate and clear the descriptions. I would like to recommend to the authors to list separately the few entries awarded with the crown; it could be a good guide for \\"desert island\\" jazz records."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvellous Book","review":"Delightfully encyclopedic - its commentary is at the same time historical, musical, and addictively readable. So far, their reccomendations have not steered me wrong, however, I would say that their broad tastes are not for everyone. They will equally rate questionably listenable free jazz with the most divinely inspired bebop, and they aren't consistent in describing the sound and styles of lesser known artists, which makes investing in any of these a little nerve-wracking.Some have said this before, and I agree, that the book could strongly use a few appendices - an index (listing by albums, styles of jazz) and a short list of their favorite albums would save one time (instead of having to flip through 1500 pages).It is the best book of its kind out there, though, and its entirely worth its cost in the money it will save you."},{"rating":"2","title":"masterpiece of British literature? you be the judge.","review":"I bought the Penguin guide 3rd edition in 1997. I have bought each successive edition and do not intend to stop. Never mind the occasional internal inconsistencies and prejudices, to which the authors confess freely and for which the readers of a 1500-page book should offer some forgiveness. I love the book because it is complete, its reviews are nearly always dead on, its biographies (5th edition) are a tremendous and welcome improvement, and its literary style is so cool. For my money, the Penguin guide is one of the treasures of the English language; the fact that it's about jazz elevates it completely out of the building. Read the excerpts; they sell themselves. On so many levels, this book can't miss. I'm looking forward to the 6th edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful as a guide for two people only: The Authors!","review":"Don't waste your bucks or quid on this weighty tome, use allmusic.com or iTunes instead. Due to the two author concept, this rather opinionated effort (and the authors must be commended for a very big effort) is nothing more than the jazz opinion of two guys. They show little empathy for musicians they don't care for, and omit many who they do not classify as \\"true jazz\\" (whatever that might be.) At least allmusic has a team of reviewers who are sympathetic to the musicians they happen to be writing about. What's more, allmusic doesn't take the slightly smarmy approach that these two do. Forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recommended","review":"This is a book that can't decide whether it wants to be a recording catalog or a dictionary of jazz. It is of little use as either. It gratuitously and gracelessly interpolates into its text unsupported and arbitrary opinion. Its prose is sloppy, glib, puerile, and humorless.Recommended: PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."},{"rating":"1","title":"beneath contempt","review":"If this is \\"dry\\", \\"sophisticated\\" \\"wit\\" then the Three Stooges are E.B.

Simply it is a great reference for Jazz lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Value for Money","review":"The great thing about reviews is that no one ever really agrees on what is great and what is just ordinary. This book makes fun reading although I certainly do not use it as a strict buying guide. The fact that it references so many CDs is its key value because you can look up artists and CDs and get an opinion and some context on them. Therefore this is a great guide if you plan to collect jazz music. In my experience collecting jazz music is a bit of a journey and there are many paths to go down. This book is not perfect, it misses plenty of albums, but lists many more. It certainly lacks a decent overview of jazz history or a listing of seminal recordings. An intro of this type, as in the Gramophone classic CD guide, would be quite worthwhile. But overall, I'd recommend it for anyone who is a collector of jazz music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paperback and CD-Rom","review":"A huge book about jazz is good. A book and a cd-rom would be better. Both and the permit to use the content for a homepage would be the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"No index, one less star","review":"As always the Penguin (7th edition) is wonderful, especially if you are looking for European jazz. On occasion, I notice that some cds that were put out in 2002 or 2003 that had a relatively high profile aren't included but that isn't what I buy the guide for anyway. However, the lack of an index for a reference guide is both baffling and inexcusable. In the past editions, I have used the index countless times to see what other cds a certain musician may have played on. I suggest that the authors do a reference, which doesn't cost much, as I know from my own experience editing books. Then they should put it on the web so that interested readers can download it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't upgrade","review":"The previous reviewers have been 100% correct. While a first time buyer can't go wrong with the Penguin Guide, there is just not enough new content to justify upgrading from the 5th edition.I am actually quite disappointed in how releases from 2000 and 2001 are noticeably absent from this edition. Quite honestly, I feel ripped off for upgrading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pompous Cynicism Not Even Expected From A Penguin!","review":"Aside from not being very comprehensive, \\"The Penguin Guide to Jazz\\" is marred by an ever-present pompous cynicism that one wouldn't even expect from a penguin!

After finding my favourites and reading these \\"opinions\\" on which records to buy, it became clear that these folks have a fairly narrow view of what jazz is (ala Winton Marsalis). While the artist information is interesting and useful, IMHO the opinions on what is significant is way off.For me, this book has become a tool for determining what artists I will probably like. If they pan something (0 - 2 stars), it's probably worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Replacement Power Supply for Dell Inspiron 518","review":"I have never replaced anything on a computer in my life!

This is a completely over priced item though since it it not necessary just slice the back of case and a normal power supply can be used instead. It is not necessary to have this part or one like it just use a cheap $15 power supply. I only ordered this one because it was insisted that no case modifications were to be made, this is the lowest cost option that is available.

His music has a great beat, and the excellent choice of instruments make listening to his music while cruising Connecticut's Merritt Parkway a favorite pasttime. HOWEVER, I am disappointed with this album. I really enjoy the instrumental music. The persistant vocals in this album distract from otherwise good music (\\"All About You\\" and \\"Beautiful\\"). A couple tracks are stagnant - not typical of Boney James' work (\\"Somethg Inside\\"). I will applaud his efforts in \\"Grand Central\\" and the last track \\"Untitled\\" which I enjoyed. I am unable to replace my favorite album - Sweet Thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Smooth, Easy Ride!","review":"Boney James is Boney James is Boney James!! What's not to like? With each CD, he just keeps getting better and better. \\"Heaven,\\" \\"RPM\\" an \\"See What I'm Sayin'?\\" are among my favorites. This is rollin' down to the shore with the roof down music. It's sitting by the fire and chillin' with a novel music. It is let me slow it down and relax music. I had only heard one track, \\"See What I'm Saying'?\\" but the fact that it was Boney James was enough to make me get the CD.

This effort had me excited only to be let down. I do not understand with that Boney coming off one of his best CDs Sweet Thing and Body Language why he has to pander further to the smooth jazz/R&B vocals which go absolutely nowhere. Especially on this disc, the vocals are meaningless and are throw aways. Even the instrumental tracks seem over produced and superficial. I do hope over time this grows to be liked and look for Boney to get back with his original smooth sound, which is missing on this disc. In the meantime, I will stick to my OLD Boney and look to break out the Holiday CD soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"#NAME?","review":"I REALLY LOVE THE SONG WITJAHEIM.

Which is why I'm really disappointed in his latest effort. The main problem is the overabundance of vocals. One or two tracks would have been enough, but over half the album features vocals. I totally agree with the reviewer who said the singing gets in the way of the music. And in general Boney's playing just seems uninspired, like he was on a deadline to finish this album. I listened to this CD several times to give it a chance, but the magic just ain't there.I'm still a fan, but I'll stick to Boney's prior CDs. Boney, do your fans a favor and let your music speak for itself next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will the real \\"Boney J\\" please step up to the plate....","review":"What happened to Boney James on this CD?

From a musical and compositional point of view, I much preferred the earlier incarnation of King Crimson ie the \\"Wetton\\" years. However from a purely technical point of view, I believe this latest incarnation is the best. Each musician is a master of his instrument and you get a great opportunity to see them execute their talents.They are just brilliant, each blending together to produce some of the most exceptional musicic you will ever hear.My only complaint is that Fripp tends to overdo his \\"Frippertronics\\". His guitar sounds more like a mellotron than a guitar. Luckily, Adrian Belew makes up for it with his astounding skill on guitar.I haven't played the DVD too many times but already I am favouring the \\"Bootleg\\" dvd from 2000 over than the \\"Live in Japan\\" DVD in 2003."},{"rating":"2","title":"dark matter","review":"Marvelous performing, filmed in low light conditions.

This DVD demonstrates that this version of Crimson was the most interesting since the Wetton years. And, it is quite sad that several have dismissed this version of Crimson. I especially like the rythm section of Mastelotto and Gunn. These guys really create a unique sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Let Down","review":"First let me say that King Crimson are my favorite band and Robert Fripp is my favorite guitar player with Bill Frisell a close second. The first DVD is enjoyable and fun but nothing more and the second disc, sadly, is uninspired. That is a mortal sin for King Crimson. Even their performances are lead-like and somber. I don't know what the problem was, whether it was the particular the nights that they recorded or if it was getting stale for them, maybe it was time for Crimson to go into its hibernation period but I was shocked to watch people who seemed like they couldn't wait for the set list to reach its conclusion. There are so many Crimson performances that take your breath away and so many of their vinyl, CD, and DVD discs that are stunning that this set has left me bewildered: where is Crimson? I would recommend not giving a performance at all if you're just going to phone it in. Look elsewhere, this is not the real King Crimson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought","review":"I thought this book was too good to be true for the price - and it was!

I was just outraged.Then Taste of Chaos DVD release. Ever band on there was recorded live. What did Senses Fail do? Dub over their performance except for the screams. How un rock! It was like a britney spears performance. I was just so shocked that they would have the guts to even think of dubbing over their performance when the rest of the bands put their vocals and hearts on the line and sang.

All i can say is at least we can thank senses fail for contributing to over rating the scene just that much more. do ur self a favor and if anything from these guys go pick up theyre ep instead, then try listening to some good music for once and go pick up some albums from bands such as glassjaw, the bled, saosin and circa survive, even if u cant stand these bands then at least say u like them so u can look cool sense thats so important these days,good day"},{"rating":"1","title":"Effeminate Music for Effeminate people","review":"Title says all.

Under no circumstances will a generic EP that made no influence on any other bands deserve a 5. There is no arguement about it. In fact they were influenced greatly by others. Even if you love this band, you can't justify it being as good as Pearl Jam's Ten, which is a sure fire 5.

Really well produced, and sounds great. The guitar work is a little stronger then their first album, wich makes up for the Bass guitar that got put into more of the background on this album then with FTDOD.The lyrics are basically poetry, and if you already know anything about the band you know it's centered around a fascination of religion and poetry, by singer and writer Buddy Neilson.The album is great if you like senses fail's previous effort, but if you didn't like it you wont like this one much either, their only downfall is that their sound hasn't changed enough to say they' \\"evolved\\" from album to album."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!","review":"This album rocks. its certantly one of the best cds ive heard in a long time.

We found out later when we tried to view the tapes. At first, we thought it was just a bad tape, but it happened to every single tape. In one of the tapes, we found more than half blank/skipped sections. It's so sad and frustrating because we're trying to record our baby's 'first everything'.We're planning to get a new one.

This DVD would suit adults and teens who already have a very solid training in Sanskrit recitations. Even adults who are novices to reciting slokas will have difficulty following these recitations.

The final section of the book is the actual dictionary, which has numerous entries on various biblical themes. This one book serves as an introduction to biblical interpretation, an Old Testament and New Testament introduction, and a Bible Dictionary.

The first time he did it, he was going slightly downhill, so I gave the toy the benefit of the doubt. Also, my son wasn't hurt too much. The second time he was moving along on a flat surface outside and went straight over the handle bars, hitting his face on the ground.

She's 3 now and has really out-grown it, but still loves it. The only time I don't feel comfortable with her on it is when she's going down hill and picking up speed!I like this because it's encouraged her to use her imagination. Since it's not too big and has hard plastic wheels, we let her bring it indoors. She'll pretend that she's going to the store, to grandma's, to school, anywhere she can think of!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring for competent walkers/climbers","review":"My son got this last Christmas when he was 18 mos old, and he has never gotten very interested in it. It is very stable and safe, and therefore very easy to mount and dismount--no challenge or learning opportunity. My son is really tall for his age, so the toy seemed kind of small for him right off the bat. I think he would have gotten more enjoyment from it when he was just starting to take steps and climb up onto things. It seems much better suited for younger, smaller kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great, Practical Guide","review":"This book offers a great step-by-step approach. The working VoiceXML sites created in the book provide great, practical knowledge that you can put right to work. And the code-check database was very helpful in detecting where a program might have gone wrong. I would recommend this book for anyone getting started with VoiceXML."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book on VoiceXML","review":"I highly recommend this book. Very well written and the projects actually work once you work out your own knowledge of CGI and Perl, but that was not a big deal.

I hope Mark Miller plans to write a sequel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"VXML","review":"I was happy at first when reading this book with the anticipation of performing the final project. That project involved Java Script and JSP. Well, I was totally disappointed when I tried download the code I needed to run the project in my NetBeans environment. There was no code to download for the final project and the code in the book is incomplete. This book had some good examples for a junior VXML programmer but it did not offer anything that could not be found on the web like(Voxeo, or TellMe Studio). This book is a waste of your money. I wished I could get a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"No longevity","review":"I have been using these for over 2 years now. We have 19 water spigots across our property. They range in use from my wife's vegetable garden, occasional hookup for a power washer, and horse troughs. You could say we test these cross the whole gamut.If you let them freeze they crack.Frequent use wears out rubber seals (I get maybe a year of disconnecting and reconnecting an item once a week).The crack easily, usually leaving a male piece in the female piece, which is impossible to get out and requires changing both pieces.I've yet to find anything that works better, and at this price I can afford to replace them all every year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Bought these at a big box store. Initially, they worked great and bought some more. After about 12 months of infrequent use, they began to leak, not just at the gasket as others have found. These were generally kept in the garage or heated basement and not allowed to freeze. About 18 months after the initial purchase, I am junking them and going with a metal quick-connect from a different manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gilmour quick connects fail","review":"Initially I bought one set each of a few brands to compare. Gilmour seemed to be made the best, it has a built in valve (very handy), and the male connector has a wide flange which makes it easy to tighten with fingers (others need a wrench if you don't have tough hands). So I bought four sets of Gilmour, I was very happy for the first two months, but now they have all failed. Can't push the male connector all the way into the female. Seems to be a problem inside the female. I'm starting over, looking at other brands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't spend your money on this garbage.","review":"This book contains so many grammatical mistakes that it's disgusting. I actually had to reread some of the sentences so that I could understand what the author was saying. I found it very annoying when I came across multiple run-on sentences and had to take the time to mentally separate them so that I could logically connect the events in each paragraph. This book is only good for people who don't care about bad grammar, which, unfortunately, is the majorty of today's society."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Emotional Read","review":"This author made me care deeply for her protagonist Mel. The characters come to life on the page and subsequently make you feel their pain and sorrow, as well as their deep friendships and intense lust. The storyline is impactive and only makes you want for more. The best thing this author could do would be to write a second novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocked at other reviews","review":"I purchased this book because of all of the positive reviews. The poor sentence structure and grammatical errors reminds me of a 5th grader's first attempt at telling a story. The characters were poorly developed and the different situations unbelievable. There are so many other excellent others available (e.g. Melissa Good, Radclyffe, McNab, Carr, Maiman, Cooper, Forest, Rulle, Schmidt to name a few) that one should not waste ones money on such an immature, poorly written book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A legitimate romance","review":"I was really impressed with this book. I purchased it because I kept seeing it every where. Have to say, it was worth it. It was rough, but I could really see the potential of this author. The story was great and she had me really caring for her main character Mel. I absolutely love romances and this is one of the better ones that I've read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A ROMANCE OF A LIFETIME!","review":"This is a truly enjoyable romance novel that really kept my interest throughout the whole book. I did not want to put it down because my curiosity was peaked as to what would happen next to the main character Mel. Mel is a wonderful, loving woman who grieves over the loss of her partner Sarah and tries to go on with her life. She yearns for another partner to spend her life with and has several relationships. Some good, and some bad. Many problems arise through the book that makes you wonder what will happen next to wonderful, loving and caring Mel. You can't help but love her and feel for her. Some areas of the story are tragic and some are laughable. The author did an excellant job of writing this novel, and will keep your emotions going up and down and your feelings both happy and sad. This was a very enjoyable novel and I can't wait to read more books by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what we expected","review":"this item is obviously part of a very old edition or collectors edition. we could not find the doll or anything close to use this item. the description did not indicate this and we were under impression it was usable with regular Barbie dolls."},{"rating":"2","title":"good value","review":"Much better deal than buying helmet and gear separately.

I must have looked at every home store, hardware store, drugstore, and big-box store out there, with no luck. Then I decided to look at Amazon, and found these. They are just what I needed, something to hide and dry my kitchen towels. I ended up ordering three so I could use one in the laundry room and my son's bathroom, but one out of the three had some wire that was exposed and was defective, otherwise I would have given 5 stars. The company said they would reimburse me for all three because I cut my finger on the defective one. I need to check my credit card statement still, but I thought that was more than fair. ** Bonus: they are super easy to install and are quite sturdy! **Not a bonus: the shipping charge if I had ordered just one, cost more than the towel bar! I was not charged more when I ordered 3, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cheap re-issue of Mello'Day....","review":"From the track listing provided here, this album seems to be a bootleg of Mello'Day, which Anita O'Day recorded in 1979 on the GNP Crescendo Label. That album is readily available and is well worth picking up. It provided the listener with a glimpse of Anita's powers later in her career. As with these re-issues/bootlegs...it's very sad to see this happening more and more in the digital age, as the original artists are not receiving any compensation for their work. Ms.O'Day is still very much alive and performing in NYC at the age of 85 years old; a true survivor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four fifths of the book is good","review":"I don't like the Athenian parts, and that's not to say that I'm against the Athenians in the Peloponnesian War. The difference in the writing Nicastro uses is vast when writing about Demosthenes (Athenian general) and Antalcidas or his brother Epitadas (protagonists). Overall, as in my title, four/fifths of the book meets and exceeds my expectations. If the Athenians weren't portrayed so diplomatic/politically obsessed, I would have found them more interesting. Yes, I know that was a major part of the Athenian culture, there are just more interesting aspects to Athens that could have been used. Very good read though. I do recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Novel of Ancient Sparta","review":"This is the first book that I have read by the author and I enjoyed it very much. I love books on ancient history, both fact and fiction so I suppose I am a little biased in that respect. The book is a story of two cities on the Greek mainland. The city of Athens, home to some of the finest minds and the finest writers of the period and the fierce and unbeaten Sparta.The book tells the story of four hundred Spartan soldiers who are cut off by Athenian ships on a narrow strip of land. Although they are almost starving and have no hope of receiving any supplies, they vow to uphold their tradition as warriors and never give in. Meanwhile the Athenian navy make ready for the inevitable assault . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Overall, this book is a disappointment. The story drags, the characters are flat, and the writing is average. I didn't feel that any of the characters were well-developed. There seemed to be gaps, as if the original manuscript was much longer but his editor made him cut out large sections.The comparisons of Nicastro to Pressfield are misleading; TIoS falls very far short of Pressfield's work. Personally, I found the story boring and quit after about 2/3 of the way through.On the plus-side (arguably): I will acknowledge that TIoS does not romanticize the Spartans; it is less \\"glorious\\" and more \\"nitty-gritty.\\" (Personally, I'm not sure this is necessarily a good thing. The result is a pretty dry novel).Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"It's very very very rare that I don't finish a book. I did not finish this book. The story drags on and on and on. This is truly a bore and one to pass up. There's other books out there that deal with ancient Sparta that are much better reads."},{"rating":"2","title":"An independent voice","review":"I think it's high time that somebody wrote the truth about Sparta. Thanks mostly to writers like Stephen Pressfield, we somehow get the idea that these guys were basically ancient versions of ideal American combat buddies. Actually, the Spartans were possibly the least understandable of all the Greeks. Their society was a tyranny. They enslaved other Greeks. They mercilessly crushed democracies wherever they developed. What exactly do modern, freedom-loving Americans have to like about these guys?Nicastro's book is not anti-Spartan--it's just truthful. Contrary to what some of these other folks are saying, he's just as straight in dealing with the Athenians, who had their own problems. I give this author credit for tackling a hard subject, and doing it with skill and honesty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stands on its own","review":"Overall I enjoyed Nicastro's handling of the mundane Spartan life back home. While I agree that Pressfield's Gates of Fire depicted the battle scenes with better detail and gripping vision, Nicastro impressed me with his depictions of the Rearing, the period of brutal training for boys beginning at the age of seven, and with the other scenes of Spartan life.At the end of the novel, when the Spartans had surrendered and been led away in captivity, this book broke my heart at the depiction of how some of the soldiers' family members were treated back home. While there is much to be admired in the Spartan's culture, there is much to be loathed as well. And Nicastro's passage of the ultimate fate of an infant who was not found worthy to be accepted in Spartan society moved me deeply. I read those two pages over and over. For me, that passage alone was worth the price of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Read Gates of Fire","review":"I'm not sure how this book got 4 stars and has been compared to \\"Gates of Fire.\\" I bought this book because I enjoy reading historical fiction, and \\"Gates of Fire\\" is one my all time favorites.I found this book to be a huge disappointment. Characters aren't developed to their full potential, battles are barely described, and those that are, are just plain boring. There's no passion in this book, barely a plot, and what could have been a great way to end the story, a battle to redeem one's name, is described in about 2 paragraphs.There are much better and exciting books then this. If I could return a kindle book, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"isle of something i cant describe","review":"uh...Im still having trouble deciding if i liked this book, but lets make it clear this book doesnt even come close to \\"gates of fire\\". Sure in life not everyone is happy but in this book, NO ONE is happy!!! it was difficult to really get to know the characters they are all like stone they dont come to life at all.

It was very short, cinematography was poor, and the guides who claim to have years of experience failed to pass along any useful tips for the would-be hunter. The segment when the dall sheep was shot was horrible in that it showed a \\"prize\\" sheep falling off the mountain because the hunter used a rifle that lacked adequate gunpower to reach across the 400+ yards to kill the animal with one shot.

Don't believe the description which calls this a girl's anime, this is squarely aimed at the 18-30 year old male demographic, even if (Or maybe because) the entire cast is made up of cute female high-school students. I should point out that I watched this all subtitled, so I can't comment on the english dubbing. However, I really enjoyed the japanese voice acting, the quality of the translation, and the completeness of the translation notes included with the series.The humor is very Seinfeldian at times. Most of it is universal, pertaining to life in general or relies on the great characters. Still, there are many references to both Japanese and Western Culture, so some familiarity with Japan may be required to get some of the jokes.Cuteness is rampant. Come prepared."},{"rating":"2","title":"Azumanga!","review":"This DVD set is the complete series of Azumanga Daioh, a hilarious anime series. There are 5 discs in a thinpak box set.

I recommend you watch a few episodes on youtube.com first, just so you can see if you like it. If you do like it then this is a great thing to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Genius of Simplicity","review":"So many people have said that this anime, like Seinfeld, is a show about nothing. I think that viewpoint misses something. Azumanga Daioh may not have a sustained story arc, or a grand destination in mind, but watching it reminded me of my own days as a high-school student.Be it Chiyo wishing that people would stop treating her like a kid, or Tomo acting every bit a fool and enjoying every minute of it, or Sakaki being uncomfortable with her towering stature, or Yomi's constant concerns about her weight, or even Osaka's frequent non-sequiters, this is a series about growing up with your friends.And the characters are all truely likeable, as well. Even those who can be seen as annoying at times can't really be faulted for their personality quirks.The series is fun and heartfelt."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those of you who haven't collected the series!","review":"This is a boxset that contains all the episodes of the Azumanga Daioh series. Those who weren't able or didn't get the discs seperate now can get them in this boxset. I think this is a very good deal for someone who hasn't got the discs. Too bad that I did.

In this coming-of-age story set in a small Italian village, the 9yo protagonist comes across a secret so powerful that it threatens to destroy his world. It's a tale of betrayal, morality, divinity, mystery, and redemption, set against the sere and harsh but beautiful background of Italy, circa 1980. And oh! the language!

The boy, he later learns, isn't dead, but is being held captive, but by whom? As he slowly learns the truth, we learn a great deal about his world and the desperate choices those around him have made.I enjoyed the style of writing in this book--it was very spare, yet evocative.

I was left with the impression that it was melodramatic, overwrought, and not particularly believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close to perfection","review":"The publication of Niccolo Ammaniti's work in English is long overdue. \\"I'm Not Scared\\" lacks the black comedy and outrageous situations of his earlier work but, in this novel, one of Italy's most important young writers attains something close to perfection. Like \\"The Great Gatsby\\", this is a novel with zero padding. Every word has its place and contributes to the whole. The style, the sensitive descriptions of the hero's world and attitudes and the construction of the story are first class. The whole book unfolds like a movie (the first few pages brought back vivid images of Terrence Malick's \\"Days of Heaven\\" with the undulating fields of grain) in vibrant, striking images.

I speak native Italian and the translation is stilted; mistranslating Italian words (i.e. He says the child is afraid of \\"vipers' ... it should say \\"the child is afraid of \\"snakes.\\") The translator has no sense of idiomatic use of language, and therefore we wind up with a book that is neither Italian enough, nor English enough.

Have had it 3 months. It's fairly well built and folds easily for transport and storage. I like the three doors that gives you options on where to place it in your home. Dual sliding locks stay secure. The pan is plastic and easy to clean but I don't how durable it will be. Overall it's a solid purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serviceable","review":"Bought this crate for our 2 60-lb German short-hairs to share, since they don't like to be apart. We have a competing brand in the house, and this was for corralling them in the shop. Not as large as I'd hoped, but the 3 doors do make positioning the crate a great choice for people with limited space or furniture configurations. I recommend putting a blanket down inside because the plastic tray in the bottom doesn't fit well and is a very low quality plastic. Teething pups will have a go at it otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Crate!!","review":"This crate worked out perfectly for my 10 month old, 50# pit bull mix.

I would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a well-sized, durable crate."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 door crate","review":"The create works great specially with 3 doors makes it easy to place the crate in a room and the divider is also a good thing with a growing pup.

What resulted is a classical vocalists' album at its highly polished best. Cahn and Van Heusen closely tailored the material to Bing and Rosie's rapport, and they wisely got the great Billy May (who had arranged the Sinatra album) to provide swinging charts filled with May's trademark humor.

In particular, the author examined each cover, providing interesting cases with comments on every one of them. Issues like membership contract, entries, Club management, premiums, additional calls, are well documented, which are hard to find with such details in other P & I books.

The other 2 cases, a 1300 and a 1400 were just too small. I didn't get my case from Amazon and I paid more for it. But the place I got it from also sold the camera padded dividers. This is the way to go IMHO for holding DSLRs and Lens. I purchased this case as a camera bag for my motorcycle, so it had to be well padded, watertight, and lockable. A earlier spill in water killed my D200 which was in a Wolfman Expedition tank bag. That bag is water resistant to rain, but not in a submersion situation. I believe this case will protect the D7000 if it suffers a similar fate.

People have no clue that he was still around creating some of the best music you are going to hear. He explores more eastern avenues which he had begun in II and he continues his orchestration on masterpieces like Dancing With the Wind. Dirty Road and Die born are beautiful to say the least.

It is another excellent album for Travis Meeks and whoever is in his company at the present time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical Genius Strikes Again","review":"Travis Meeks is a true musical genius and shows it as much as ever in this latest album.

You might remember DOTN from previous hits such as \\"Touch Peel and Stand\\", \\"Shelf in the Room\\" and \\"Enemy\\".Now, after more than a year in the crafting, \\"RED\\" marks the third CD to be released by this prolific band and is well worth the wait as once again we have a CD full of great songs... including some that have been stage favorites during their tours and are finally available here, polished to typical DOTN perfection, on this recording. DAYS OF THE NEW is a band full of energy, heart and great songs... No doubt with a lot more music yet to come as they stake their claim in music history. Check out RED. N-O-W!!!

He has a voice that can best be described as sandpaper grinding against a blackboard. Just to be fair, I borrow DOTN 3 from a friend and gave it a listen...that's something I won't do again. At least Travis is surrounded by \\"musicians\\" with talent to match his own now. Zachary Hanson would have been a better choice for a drummer. All in all...this is crap. Go buy Tantric's CD.

I've noticed much more of a diversity and maturity in their music. I've always liked the lyrics but the music seems to have progressed, (i.e. the east indian influence in \\"Giving In\\" and the stop/start feel of \\"Words\\"). I love it! I've waited a couple years for this latest release but so far I believe every month has been worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starfax is an idiot","review":"\\"it's clear that he ripped off Tantric's fresh, new sound without Meeks\\"? lol. Little kid, you are tone deaf and know nothing about music. First of all, while Tantric's CD was okay, it wasn't incredibly fresh. The Tantric debut CD follows along the same lines as DOTN's first CD. Second, this album combines orchestral arrangements and ethnic sounds. Such elements were in place in Travis's vision since the GREEN album, which came out before Tantric's CD. While Tantric are okay, learn something about music and take a music appreciation class before you come out here sounding like some MTV rent-a-teenybopper."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best CD this year","review":"Travis Meeks is the man. A simple but true statement. After Unloading the access bagage which has become known as Tantric he made a ground breaking CD know as the Green album. Two years later he's back with a new band, however the music is just as ground breaking and amazing as the second album was... but better. This is one of those CD's that you can listen strait through with out having to skip any tracks. I did't think he could top what he has already done, but agan travis has come out of no where and droped my jaw agan. He has seemed to combine the great elements of the first two CD's and throw them in a blender. There is the strait up rock stuff from the yellow mixed with the weirder elements from the Green album and has make somthing truly special.Stand out tracks: Die Born, Best Of life, and Dancing with the wind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Original Rock Music?? No WAY!!","review":"When I bought my first DOTN album (green) it collected dust for about 5 months. After giving it a second chance I found out that Travis Meeks is the brightest chance for rock in the future. This album blows you away right from the start. Its original fast paced acoustic/electric rock with influence from The Doors and unplugged Pearl Jam. Meeks has almost all the control of the project. (ex-members formed Tantric) The result of this is an artistic album full of emotion and great songs! I am not joking this is one of (if not the only) albums that I've liked this year. You can listen to the entire thing on the official site too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catchy, But Puzzling","review":"When is DOTN leader Travis Meeks going to ditch the orchestral ideas? Hopefully soon, because such adventures bog down what is an otherwise fine rock record. Sounding a lot like their 1st record on songs like \\"Days In Our Life\\" and \\"Never Drown,\\" Meeks doesn't need such chicanery. Sure, AIC and Soundgarden references abound, but in this mostly acoustic form, they still sound fresh. Meeks baritone is the focal point of the wistful \\"Die Born,\\" and the reflective \\"Dirty Road.\\" \\"Fighting With Clay\\" sounds unapologetically like acoustic Soundgarden. Next to this, his classical overtures sound ridiculous. Stick to rock Travis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame Ghost Story","review":"This movie is basically a woman jumping up and down on a bed, pretending to be raped by a ghost.

I mean its not a bad album, but the guys can do much better than this. There are a few good songs. \\"Disease\\" is hilarious, particulary the spoken word act from Handsome Dick at the begining. \\"Science Gone Too Far\\" is one of the band's catchiest tunes, proving they were as good as any of the big names from the 60s. Their closing cover of the Stooges' \\"Search & Destroy\\" is an okay interperatation of the classic. However, that's about it. The rest are mostly humorless FM-style rockers, and while the Dictators weren't selling out, they were certainly trying to become more accesible.

I returned the watch without a problem although I had to pay the return shipping on a watch that was defective and i was not offered a replacement - only a refund.

I turned the water off, disconnected everything and then tried again only to find myself being sprayed again. By this point I was wetter than the dog and she wasn't very happy either. I had high hopes that this would make bathing my dog easier but it is obviously not well made so instead of easier it was a mess.

My brother-in-law says it happens to him when all he is doing is working at his desk, not even walking. My husband has only gotten a chance to wear them while using our exercise equipment, and his toes go numb while he's doing that. I've worn them exercising in our home and going on walks around our neighborhood, and it happens every time. I am extremely frustrated because we're all stuck with these stupid shoes, which were expensive, because they've been worn a few times, and the store won't take them back now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich and moving!","review":"Morris Robinson's voice is extraordinary!! If you love Bass Opera voices then this will give you a thrill. Morris sings the Gospel as if it's coming out of the marrow of his bones, He feels every note. He's fairly new to Opera and had a football background believe it or not! I'm sure that Mr.Robinson will be VERY well known in Opera circles in the coming years and I can't wait to hear what he will be singing next! He's a big man with a big voice, but, oh, the subtlety and range this man has will knock your socks off!

He was singing at the Crystal Cathedral and his performance of this song was very nice. His voice was rich and full, his timing in delivering the song was well executed. We were so excited to find his CD featuring the very song we loved. But, we were so disappointed. That one song is the only one we enjoyed hearing of those on the CD. The others feature accompaniment that nearly drowns out his voice. No one buys a CD like this to hear a full orchestra and loud choir; you buy it to hear the man's voice. The songs are not \\"easy listening.\\" They are an intrusion. We put the DC away and rely on our Paul Robeson CD for the sounds we desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much hype","review":"I heared a editorial about this guy on npr and it was pretty cool so i bought the cd. but in reality it is pretty cheesy and not very well organized. opera, gospel, and smooth jazz just dont go together that well. too bad cause morris has an amazing voice and it could have been a spectacular album, but i don't think they put that much energy into it. elevator music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pull the Triggers","review":"The Pull the triggers song is on the Radio Dinner album, and is not from Lemmings."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Thanks","review":"It was probably a hoot sitting in the audience that was most likely high.

At his BP clinic, his medical assistants told me the systolic BP's measured by my OSZ5 were inaccurate. I called WA's service and was told this model couldn't be calibrated. They offered an exchange at no charge which I accepted. A few months later, the instrument fell 18 inches from my bed and landed on the floor. The battery compartment popped open and two small plastic pins broke off so the compartment would no longer stay closed. I sent it back to WA for repairs. They told me the instrument needed recalibration (I had been previously told that was impossible.) along with the repair. They quoted a charge of $75 plus shipping. Since I had paid around $110 for the unit, this seemed rather expensive.This took place while the instrument was under warranty. They said this repair was not covered.

Now, I own \\"Call Me Princess\\" and \\"Princess Prince\\", I have read \\"Aquarium\\", and I want \\"Let's Stay Together Forever\\", all of which are by Tomoko Taniguchi.

You kind of have to know your anime before you watch this one, otherwise you might not get all the jokes. But there are plenty of hilarious moments whether you do or not.

The plot carried me downriver towards a mad rushing waterfall. I got a sense of inevitability in Sonny's crisis despite Mattie's longing to stop her son from making mistake after mistake. She seems to be his sole supporter in his self-imposed crisis. Pelletier examines their relationship in depth. Mattie reflects on what she did wrong in raising him while the daughters do all they can to deflate her belief and hope in Sonny. This book captured my attention from beginning to end. The conclusion was different from Pelletier's other books because it had an unexpected twist of which I could not foresee. Read \\"Beaming Sonny Home\\" as an example of the wide scope of Pelletier's talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big-hearted and funny","review":"I have been an ardent fan of Cathie Pelletier's work since the first novel. She is a joy to read. Laugh out loud humor and heart-wrenching stories intertwined with marvelous characters and purely wondrous prose. Beaming Sonny Home grabbed me from the first paragraph, which is typical of Cathie's writing. Sadly, it appears that her earlier work is not in print. Try by whatever means to collect all her books--especially the Mattagash series-- and add this one to the stack. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not one to tune out.","review":"This book is in the usual Pelletier vein - strong on women characters and connects with nature.

It combines the best elements of Christmas music and John Denver kind of like hotccocoa and marshmellows. And ironically it is probably one of the last live performances in North America Mr. Denver did. He is charming and humourous and there's nothing offensive about this concert cd. My only regret is that there's no video on it. Like the Wildlife Concert Denver was at his zenith with this cd.

However, the author gives only the most superficial treatment to the 'stories' from the hotel -- as if a small clip from ONE gossip column would suffice. NONE of the pictures have captions or idenitfiers. I KNOW that many of these hotels have more extensive and interesting stories to tell, even in the limited space for each entry. Space is wasted on travel stuff best sourced from a Fodor's or Frommer's, e.g. the fact that a certain hotel is close to the shopping on Fifth Avenue. Overall, a slapdash work with little real research effort. This is a lost opportunity that is an embarassment to the publisher, and some other author should take up the project.

While the tree does fill out nicely when you spread the branches, it falls far from the 70' diameter it states it is. On a GOOD reach it is maybe 60'. It is a pretty tree, but thin.

I was disappointed in this book, because there were not enough pictures indicating basic positions.

She grapples with fulfilling her maternal instincts and succeeds, almost, at the book's end.

Other people -- Gordon, Tyler, and Quindlen to name three -- have done it better, and truly flawlessly when it comes to writing. Maybe it's me, not wanting to wallow in the nasty lives in a large cast of unlikable people. It's like watching ugly soap stars: I have to look at enough ugly people in real life, I don't want to see them on TV, too.

One has the sense that the author has just learned the technique of foreshadowing, and uses it every other page to display her mastery.

He becomes an excellent soldier for the cause of hate and is then flown to France to fulfill a mission to assassinate the President of France. A true story.Filmed as a thriller - documentary style - the master terrorists have everything planned to the last detail but this...they failed to consider the impact of a friendship this young boy develops for a Parisian boy his own age. The most touching scene is the gentleness in which the French boy comforts the young soldier who is deeply troubled by nightmares in losing his parents and his innocence. And the most haunting line of the film, spoken by the child soldier - \\"what's it like being a boy.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"well done movie","review":"Boy from Lebanon gives a great in-site into what is happening in Iraq,Iran, Lebanon, Israel, and other countries.

The public milling about in the background during shootouts and big fight scenes was hysterical. There were actors who's skills ran the gambit from seasoned to what appeared to be first semester acting students. It was like films they would have used for the Mystery Science Theatre.

Using the current VSTi instrument wave (from Steinberg) standard, you can play the same sounds used by the Beatles, Moody Blues, Genesis, Yes (tales of topographical oceans anyone?) and more. The first set comes with 27 or so sound banks, the additiional banks (Vol 1-3) have sounds that were never available publicly (Frank Zappa and Moody Blues amongst them).By far, the M-Tron is a great addition to anyone's DAW."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good But Not What I Expected","review":"I've read several wonderful reviews on this book and couldn't wait to purchase it.

Peter Marshall makes the character of Albert Peterson sound like a Jerry Lewis creation and Sylvia Tysick as Kim DOES sound like a teenager- one who can't sing. The kids on this album generally are awful. They screech instead of sing and many of them have pronounced accents. A lot of the singing is out of tune and the orchestra hits clams frequently. This album was recorded in an era where British versions of American musicals were frequently inferior vocally to their U.S. counterparts. Thankfully, that has changed. London has proven to be a haven for many discarded American musicals that deserve revivals here, but for financial reasons will probably never see the light of day. Perhaps someone in England will revive \\"Birdie\\" and produce a recording that does this underrated show true justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Can't the English?","review":"This disc has the same content as was heard on the original Broadway cast album. The score is still enjoyable. the performances here are disappointing. Chita Rivera sounds tired and seems to be forcing her voice. Peter Marshall wrestles with his musical segments and lacks the charisma that Dyke Van Dick brought to the role. The kids are all terrible here, and several wrong notes slip through in the orchestra.

I could have made a better bag than this. DO NOT BUY THIS BAG. It's not even great for protective purposes as it puts constant stress on the cable if you have a wired 6x8 tablet. There's no room for the mouse or the pen holder and the simple divider in the center does nothing for organization. A simple elastic loop is all that holds the tablet pen in place. This loop only holds the pen if you work it in a bit too which causes the rubber grip on the pen to slide a bit and obstruct the buttons on the pen the next time you use it. This is NOT a travel bag, it's a \\"good thing I bought this bag so I can store my tablet\\" bag. But we all know, we never store our tablets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good item, Mis-Named","review":"This is NOT a travel bag, it is a SLIP COVER. Do not be fooled by the image, there are no hooks for a strap, it has two zipper pulls, which functions rather well for my own purposes and speedy packing. I have a laptop tote bag with a padded space for the computer, but the only place for the tablet was in the main section with all my books etc, since all I needed was a little more padding it suits me fine.I like the elastic loop for keeping the stylus organized and the mesh compartment divider is handy for keeping the cord and any thumb drives I have from getting lost, tangled, or scratching the surface of the tablet.

I'm disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely fits the 6x8 tablet","review":"I was really disappointed in this product; was expecting a lot better for the price.

It is written in a sophomoric style that reminded me of the old Hardy Boys adventures. We have to believe everything he says as he says--with the Bible as the only sourse of reference.

Do you remember \\"Day-O\\"? Belafonte's choice of carols was a refreshing choice for the time. Spirituals and folk music had grown in popularity; his rendition of these numbers is timeless.

The VCD I bought was from [...] which ships direct from Bangkok. My product was intended for home viewing in Thailand, not for mainly export/international audience. I really enjoyed the film, Thai culture is complex and Royal culture much more so. The Prince of Thailand made this film,it is a film not so much a movie, so yes, it can be slow at times and painfully detailed but it should be. This is a film to learn some of Thai history and culture, not just to be entertained. I really loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Epic Movie About the Early History of Thailand","review":"This has become one of my favorite movies. It's in Engish subtitles, but that's never been a problem. The story and the cinetography is great. It's historically accurate in the customs and dipiction of life in Thailand 200 years ago. The story is full of intrigue, betrayal, love, loyalty, honor, self-sacrifice, and has plenty of drama and action. This movie was made at the request of the queen because of her concern that the school systems were no longer adequately teaching about Thailand's great history. She wanted this story told to bring that history alive and inspire interest and pride in the youth of Thailand for their country's heroes and culture. It was one of the most antcipated movies of several years in Thailand and one of the most popular. There was a sequel made (I'd love to see it) but it hasn't been marketed with English subtitles nor in the US market. A real shame. Definitely recommend this movie to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"The almost scariest book ever","review":"I think this book is very scary, but, it may be scarier.It was scary. But, a little more scary would be better. It's set in a house, with a evil granny, and a grandson happy as can be. Here's the ONLY part that was terrifying: When Corey [the boy], saw Amy [his sister] and Amy rescued him from the cluches of evil Granny Marsha. Why? Because she was getting back at them.This book was good, but it could of been better with a longer ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"The spirit of the Backveld","review":"An extremely rainy summer in Pretoria gave ground to more reading then had been expectet beforehand, and my usual stock of books were not in my posession. This turned out to be a stroke of luck, as it were, because rather than turning to my own, I had to turn to the bookshelves of my landlady. Mafeking road and other storys caugth my eyes; an hour later it had also caught my heart. Bosman spinns storys out of the everyday life in the Groot Maroco district as easely as he use the history of the Transvaal republic as the setting for his tales. His storys are funny, sad, warm and exiting, often all at once. His talent as a storyteller is indesputeble, and his love for the ways and traditions of the people of the Marico is impossible to hide. Not for nothing is his storys said to be the best to ever come out of South Africa. This book has my warmest recomodation. If you read it , you will never regret.

A few problems though: my railing is up a bit higher so I had to install it 3 inches off the floor but that isn't my main issue. My main issue is that I used drywall anchors and from the pressure of the gate and also from my child pushing on it, the drywall anchors are pulled out of the wall now so it's not safe anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisey & Hard to Work","review":"I liked the size and the retractable gate feature appealed to me greatly; however, after about a year the spring mechanism gave way - so now it is of no use.

His dead pan delivery of sinister lines & action makes him a very believeable charachter.Corky Siegel does a fine job on the harmonica giving the soundtrack \\"two thumbs up\\" for how it fits in this film.Overall, it's more than a renter. If you need a good no-brainer man movie with good action & cheer for the hero moments...this is the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a nice action flick","review":"It's been 20 years since I have seen this movie which I recall enjoying very much back then. I placed the order after forgetting about it and was pleased with the re-viewing. Yes it's not quite the front to back action packed style film you might have grown used to but it still has a good story and plenty of hero filled action. Rutger plays the part of a bounty hunter most of us middle age men would like to experience for just a week or two. Although it was a bit slower than I recall I still would recommend it to any 40 something year old man who enjoyed action movies from the 80's."},{"rating":"2","title":"The terrorist of KISS","review":"This is a very exciting movie, with an unexpected twist at the end.Gene Simmons is disturbingly accurate in his portrayal of an international terrorist, and Rutger Hauer plays the lone wolf bounty hunter to perfection,taking his final revenge in the end.

The entire album again, outside of the first song (jingle bells which my kids and I find super fun to dance to) sounds like a dirge.

You've probably done more on a first date than most of what you'll find in this book. Not to mention, I object to the entire concept to begin with. It offends me as a male.

Not really suited for a quickie. This book may be a good start for an 18 year old virgin... but if you've been sexually active for more than a couple of years, and watch TV/movies occasionally I doubt it will bring any new ideas.

Laura also seems to assume women don't work outside the home (\\"meet your man when he gets home from work...\\"), and most have a closet full of \\"full, billowy skirts\\" with which to perform her quickies. My husband and I bought this book hoping it would have some fun, innovative ideas but what we got was a lot of silly stuff, most of which we've already done - and I agree with some of the other reviewers - most of these \\"quickies\\" are anything but quick.

If I wanted to read about sex with random women, I would read a romance novel, not fantasy.Throughout the book its easy to see that Aldiss is a sci-fi writer through the way he writes, and his descriptions.

The performers do their best with the material, often far outshining this slapdash tale, but ultimately, it's quite a disappointment - and at barely 70 minutes, I still found myself amazed at how it seemed to drag.The fixation on sex and fantasies comes across as pretty juvenile, and if you're wondering where the R rating comes from, it's from frequent drops of the F bomb and not from any gratuitous tittilation.The mini movies included as an afterthought are nice but again, show that the performers can do quite a lot with feeble and overworked material.I would really have liked to see this entire cast in a much better film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Best","review":"When you want the best in oyster sauces, this is the premium!

It features oysters as the main ingredient, first on the list, and a full 30% of the total contents! Its English brand name is Maekrua and the label features a healthy looking woman against a blue background pouring the sauce into a giant wok. A more subtle sauce than most, but also more meaty (as opposed to sweet or salty).

There's virtually no loose ends to speak of, the show has a complete plot and resolution to every conflict. Development of the main theme is immediate, in the first episode you are introduced to Angelic Layer and Misaki obtains her angel Hikaru right away.Full of good humor too. Well rounded show.This product comes with fully English voice acting which, in my opinion, was done pretty well (and I think the original Japanese can be switched on too with or w/o subtitles, I only watch it in English). 5 disc set.

I believe that the fighting sequences could have been done a little better, and it can become a little repitious in this aspect. Do not be discouraged by this, however.

It was a special package deal and since cassette players are pretty much extinct I have no need for the cassette! Thank you to the sellers on Amazon that this now compact disc is available. I tried tirelessly to download the individual tracks, however, the first and last tracks of this album feature audio from the movie and really make the album unforgettable. Such classic songs from Bing Crosby, Nat King Cole and Perry Como make this a great compilation. I know have my favorite Christmas songs and a great album here added to my collection. This simply is a great cd!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Expectations","review":"We just returned from a 3 week trip to Belize.

I expected a silly, offbeat, lighthearted story and this is far more complex. The narrative flashback is a device that works well for this protagonist.

However, there seems to be some light at the end of the tunnel thanks to this movie, along with the recent \\"Wake of Death.\\"\\"In Hell\\" is a raw and darker film than his normal material. Don't expect his stamped karate moves, because it doesn't take place during this flick. Instead, we are treated with gritty, no-holds barred rumbles.To top it off, Van Damme begins to show signs of some acting depth. I'm not talking Oscar winner, but for Damme, this is probably the best work he has done that provides a sense of substance to his character.A moment or two of akward cheesy-ness appears, but doesn't hamper the overall experience of the movie at all. Even if you are not a Van Damme fan, like I \\"once\\" was, you should give this flick a shot. Don't expect a masterpiece and I believe you will be surprisingly surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"always a fan of 'in hell'","review":"I don't know what it is about \\"In Hell\\" that I've continued to like all these years.

I lost my respect i had for this actor for good. I really loved his films and raised him above all suspicions, but now it is all ended.

I used to be a big fan of this guy back in the early 90's cause of movies like Blood Sport, Kickboxer, Lion Heart, and Double Impact. Those were some good flicks by him at the time. I was a little kid and I used to watch Kickboxer, and Bloodsport all the time, and I thought he was the coolest. Now he's just all washed up. His fighting scenes are boring, and he doesn't have the intensity anymore like he used to. His career seems like it's about to be over or something. His movies are just played out to me, cause I've been more of a Hong Kong action fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every time when I think it can't get any worse, it does.","review":"I used to be a big Van Damme's fan, and still love Blood Sport, Cyborg, and other \\"old\\" movies. His new movies are getting worse and worse with each new release though. First he dropped down to the level of Jackie Chan's movies, the Chinese-produced ones. Now he went even one lower, to a B-/C+, third-rate production. The plot is completely cliche, the acting is very amature, and on top of that - once again - Van Damme does No martial arts type fighting whatsoever. I never thought Van Damme was a good actor, but I admire his form, speed, and style in martial arts. Now he is trying to be a \\"real actor\\" I guess, which he is not and will never be. All in all, my recommendation is - don't waste your time. Even being a hardcore Van Damme fan I just can't recommend this to anyone at all.

VERY VIOLENT AND VERY BORING. VAN DAMME JUST ISN'T WHAT HE USED TO BE. THE MOVIE STARTS OUT OK, BUT IT QUICKLY RUNS OUT OF STEAM. ALMOST ALL OF THE ACTION SEQUENCES ARE DOWNRIGHT BORING. THIS MOVIE IS DEFINITELY PROOF THAT VAN DAMME'S BEST DAYS ARE WAY BEHIND HIM. BELIEVE IT OR NOT, FORMER NFL STAR LAWRENCE TAYLOR HAS A ROLE IN THIS MOVIE. ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES OF VAN DAMME'S CAREER. WHEN YOU REALLY THINK ABOUT IT, IT'S JUST AN ACTION VERSION OF ''THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION''. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR YOUR MONEY ON THIS TIME-WASTER.

After barely knowing her, Ashe decides to up and marry her. So when the expected calamities begin to happen, I have no sympathy for Ashe. He was the adult in this situation, he should have known what to expect. It's Kitty who has my sympathy. She goes on and goes on making bad choices because she's never made to deal with the results of her actions. She didn't have much of a mother and Ashe is not much of a husband, so she doesn't have a guiding hand into adulthood.

Oh, yes, it is well-made, in that my son has thrown it at the tub wall a kablillion times and it hasn't shown the slightest sign of falling to pieces, but it honestly needs to be sent back to the drawing board for a little redesign.

The biggest challenge is that the original DVD video was reformatted to 1080i (without being upconverted). This means that upconversion DVD and Blu-Ray players ignore the upconversion process because they think the video is already 1080i. That means you'll be looking at a 480 picture the entire time and it is pretty ugly. I contacted First Look Studios, Inc. (The manufacturer and distributor of the disc) and they said that they did not author the disc, but they are aware of the challenge and are receiving quite a few complaints by telephone.

The fact that it is advertised in HD and that it was even put on a blu-ray disc, is a joke. Anyone who bought this, including myself, was definitely ripped off by the company who produced and marketed it. At least I have a nice coaster for my cold drinks now.

The holes in the deflector line up with the existing holes under the hood so no drilling is needed, but the two middle \\"tabs\\" of the deflector are a bit wide, so you need to remove two snaps that hold the weather-strip in order to accommodate the deflector. That being said, I haven't noticed any trouble with the weather-strip being loose.

Having lived in California since 1948, I thought I knew a lot about our history. How wrong I was. This was an extremely difficult book to put down. I learned more about how the West was settled than I learned in all my history classes in High School and College put together. Besides being very factual, this book is extremely easy reading. I've passed this book on the many friends (all native Californians) and they all loved it. Extremely informative on the settlement of Utah (and other parts of the West) by the Mormons. It was also very interesting to learn about the mining in Colorado after California's Gold Rush. If you live and love the West Coast, you must read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obvious Errors","review":"I agree that Irving Stone's Men to Match My Mountains is an entertaining series of intertwined stories about the settling of the west, but it is tainted by a couple of obvious and major factual errors in the early going. Before page 60, he's got 1840s explorers walking the banks of Shasta Lake, which didn't exist until Shasta Dam was completed in 1944. He's also got guys climbing UP the Eastern Sierra to Owens Lake, which is impossible since Owens Lake is at the base of the Eastern Sierra (or was, until the City of L.A. diverted its water).

The Michener approach to historical fiction worked well enough in the first installment, The Princes of Ireland. The misty past, lacking historic record, is fertile ground for mythic fiction.This weighty tome (862 pages) exposes the flaws in attempting to personalize complex cultural, economic, religious, and political conflicts into a broad, sweeping panorama that lacks depth. The shallow plot attempts to mitigate centuries of sadistic oppression and trivialize pain, suffering, and death. It fails.The Georgian Dublin of the Anglo-Irish is pictured as a magical place with grand buildings and peopled by Ascendancy scholars, artists, and aristocrats. Other than the dangers of being mugged, little mention is made of the sorry lot of the majority of the city's inhabitants. Dublin was a disease infested hell-hole for most of the city dwellers at the dawn of the 20th century.Historical fiction can educate and enlighten. This book does neither."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"I loved Thomas Flannagan's novels, and read some of them more than once. The Rutherford books do not come close. With all of the historical drama from which to draw, it seems that it would be difficult to write a boring book about Irish history, however both of Rutherford's Irish saga books seem to fit that description. I have not been able to finish either. The characters seem to me to lack dimension, and their lives could have been set in Kansas or New Zealand as easily as in Ireland. I liked Sarum and London, so there seems to be a mis-match between the writer and his subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rebels of Ireland","review":"The client has never received the book.

I agree 100% with Derek Mok's review below. There really is nothing like a melody or interesting chord progression here. I realize that sometimes you can get by without those elements to a certain extent if there is a good groove going on. Witness such great albums as SUZUKI by Tosca and Way Out West's brilliant INTENSIFY. But on this record, there simply is no groove. Everything is just plain dull. It reminded me of some of the less successful 80's techno-pop, or like bad Human League and Thompson Twins outtakes. Skip it. And hope that Dot gets back on track with the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little bit of...","review":"After reading the reviews posted by others I was enthusiastic to purchase and listen to this cd. I was,however, surprised to discover that it wasn't what I expected. As one of the other reviews, which was printed AFTER I bought this, said if you aren't a Soundheim fan, this may not be for you (although I do enjoy most of his shows). I found the lyrics to be somewhat clever, but after listening to the entire cd I did not really feel moved, or even invested in the characters. I love musicals, but this is not one to sink your teeth into or be moved by, it is quaint and somewhat cute, but not one you're likely to see a national tour.

It not only gives us a handle on what spirituality is, but is written in terms that the layman can understand, while providing clear ways of practicing proven forms of centering and meditation. I especially like the use of case histories to illustrate how we all link to the need for spiritual grounding in our lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"strong chai smell","review":"the sliding-top tin is pretty sleek, credit card sized, it'll probably look good with your Razor(tm).the mints are a little smaller than an Altoid, but much milder. the smell is strong and spicy chai/cinnamon, but the flavor is pretty mild."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough Film","review":"This is an excellent film. I think it is also a tough film for people to judge the real merits of, because the subject matter is difficult, and the word of mouth has been that it is a gory film, that also gives the gay community a black eye. I think all this prevents people from properly appreciating the film.Its drama folks, its about murder.In truth it is not as gory as many slasher or recent war films are. And it certainly is not an attack on the gay community in any way.So get some courage, get the film, don't prejudge it. I think if you do you will see it is a much better film than the(very incorrect!) buzz would have you believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting","review":"I found this movie to be pretty interesting and welcomed change from the typical gay movie themes. It was dark, gritty and somewhat disturbing at times. The sound and acting were not always the best. I think that the flaws made it much more interesting. It was great to see someone who was brave enough to step outside of the box. I'm glad that there are movies like this one. How many movies can we watch with drag queens, circuit boys, gay men with HIV and hustlers? Great movie. You may have to watch it a few times to really understand everything in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slasher film for the community. Such a fuss!","review":"First, I'm a fan of Alexis Arquette. His spot in the film just sends me. Now the movie is a bit..er a lot gross. It's good looking gay men acting out some very sadistic fantasies. Things I have fantasized doing to a couple of my ex's. Notwithstanding, I,of course would never do such, but it's there lurking in the back of my mind. Don't laugh at me, and don't touch my makeup! There is a theory that societies that supress artistic expressions of sexuality and brutality wind up acting them out for real, ie...the Nazis. Those where freedom of speech allows for such expression are far more healthy. We must be in good shape then. Really this film is a shocker, but that's good. It's just a movie afterall. Mind you, the operative word here is FANTASY!

Frisk was a rough alienating novel where the main characters used S&M; sex as a balm for their feelings of alienation. The woefully miscast actors were not up to the task of the complex emotions that should have guided this piece. Parker Posey always wonderful was reduced to playing a stand-in for some of the more nefarious characters in the novel the sadistic germans who assisted the lead in their dangerous sex games that ended in murder.There's little skin on display for the voyeur crowd - was anyone really dying to see Alexis naked?All-in-all infuriating and dissatifying."},{"rating":"1","title":"It gave me nightmares","review":"It was umm...interesting.

I had seen the concert before on tv and Michael performs well. Despite his lip-syncs in several songs, he can still show off all his crazy but hot moves. My friend Melissa viewed the DVD with me and she likes his talent but the shooting and editing of it seemed to bother her. She thinks it's ridiculous for any MJ fan to cry, scream or faint, even on camera. She also thinks that Jackson had gone a bit too far with his constant crouch-grabbing. And most of all the footage in Bucharest is mixed with footage in London, Monza, Toulouse, Paris, Lausanne and others to name a few. But still I like it and Michael is an incredible performer."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Epic Collection From The Greatest Entertainer Alive!","review":"If you want pretty much every masterpiece from MJ, then look no further than this set. Covering the era's from the Jackson 5 through today, this is sure to have something for everyone.The main reason for buying this set is the new songs and the included DVD of Michael's 1992 concert that he recorded for HBO during the Dangerous Tour. It epitomizes what a great entertainer he is and showcases his superb dancing and singing. He also looks extremely sexy and is a delight to watch for that reason alone.Hopefully, Sony will release the DVD as a stand-alone package, as alot of people won't shell out the bucks for this set. And maybe they will include 5.1 Surround Sound and some additional features. ~:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"a special treat for the fans!!!","review":"Every MJ fan should totally get this.

Even at the time it was pleasant though unsensational entertainment. The recording has long been out-of-print and has never generated the same demand as other forgotten flops. Without the comic sketches which were the show's high points, the album is curiously flat, and contains a great deal of filler. \\"Everlasting\\" has to be one of the most boring love songs ever written for the Broadway stage.

The author gives excellent background on the early days of the group including the demise of Syd Barrett. Perhaps what is the most interesting are the paralells drawn between Pink Floyd and the Beatles. The demise and the reasons for the demise of both bands are similar. The author takes a very pro-Gilmour stance in the post-Waters era of the band. Although I may not agree with his view, he does an adequate job of supporting his argument. The only reason the I gave the book 4 stars is becuase it is dated material. The information on goes up to the Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour. No mention is made of the Division Bell or other exploits. This may be due to the death of the author several years back."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book that covers everything!","review":"I haven't yet run across a book as good as this one that goes so far in with the band. A lot of research went in and it is a great source for all articles written on Pink Floyd. It spends a lot of time on the band's beginings, but is touches everything that did, has done, or will do with Pink Floyd. It's a little out of date now and only goes up through the Delicate Sound of Thunder concert and does not touch on the Division Bell or the '94 Pulse tour. Other than that it's a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saucerful of Secrets","review":"Buy Nick Mason's \\"Inside Out\\" biographical book instead. Much better - great photos & the real story.

The first 130 pages goes deep into the history of Pink Floyd when Syd Barret still played a huge part in the band. It talks about Syd's ultimate downfall and David gilmours dramatic entrance into the band. It goes in depth into the \\"The Wall\\" and \\"Dark Side\\" albums and talks about how the control freak Roger Waters ultimaley destorys the relationships in the band and results in Waters departure. The book also slightly touches base on some of the projects the band did after Waters departure. This is a must buy for all Pink Floyd lovers.

Although he gave it everything he had, the script was lousy, the movie depressing, and unrealistic, especially the end, and the other three players were absolutely boring. It has a love scene, yes, but he's making it with his best friend's wife. He's definitely not Sully in this movie. I'll never watch it again. And I'm a HUGE Joe Lando fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"This sucks!Don't buy this!","review":"OMG this movie was really short, had no plot and had a stupid ending!Not worth the $6.69 I paid for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this","review":"This is the worse iron and very frustrating to use. The cord location is bad, causes iron to easily tip; the electronic on/off goes off in the middle of a garment pressing with immediate low temp, than it drips. Worse piece of .....! Shark needs to get out of business, don't like any of their products I've tried!"},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAKS WATER","review":"I bought this thinking it was going to be a \\"Professional\\" iron and it's far from it. I've had the same experience with the 2 I've received. Both of them right out of the box, filled with water, turned on and water leakes out the sides and bottom all over shirt. By the time I couldn't deal with it any longer, the 30 day return policy was up and now I'm stuck with it. Very disappointed!!! And from reading other reviews. It seems this product is constantly getting bad reviews. Lesson Learned (at least at a low price)."},{"rating":"1","title":"lasted 3 uses.

I don't know what happened. Probably had the iron for going on a year + but I hardly ever used it. So in iron years, its basically brand new. I should've checked these reviews before I bought it. Too bad too because like everybody else, it was a great iron before it malfunctioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"just stopped working in less than 2 years","review":"Haven't had it for 2 years yet. One day I ironed quite a few things, came back the next day to iron some more and it wouldn't even turn on. Plugged it in other outlets just in case and nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Choice!","review":"I had this iron for a little over a year (it has a 1 year warranty) and it just stopped working. There was no sign of anything wrong before that. While it worked, I was pleased with it, but I've never had an iron that fritzed out after only a year. I should have checked the reviews here first and I would have seen the many 1 star reviews. That was my mistake. Stay away from this manufacturer and make sure you check all the reviews of the iron you're considering."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 years and going strong - Love it!","review":"I'm constantly moving and very few things have stayed with me for 5 years; this iron is one of them. I was very surprised to see bad reviews about this iron, maybe they haven't emptied out the water after every use? If you don't empty out the water on the iron after each use it won't last, no matter the quality.I used to complain about my irons never getting out the wrinkles properly (i'm type A about my clothes) and steamers wouldn't leave my button-downs crisp enough. I almost cried for joy when i used the shark. Which is why i'm embarking on another move with just my clothes, a few books, my skis, and this iron. This is true love. I'll love it until the day it stops working and then i'll go right back and buy one exactly like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"More design flaws than you can possibly imagine","review":"I did not think it was possible to cram so many design flaws into an appliance as fundamentally simple as an iron. I would not take this iron now if you gave it to me for free. I would try to protect my friends and relations from ever, ever buying one. It is heavy, poorly balanced, does not steam reliably, will only steam when near full, and is extremely difficult to fill without spilling water. The setting information is obscured by the handle, and the \\"see through\\" panel is colored dark blue so you can't see the water level unless you hold it up against a strong light. I really can't think of anything I could praise about it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"This iron doesn't heat hot enough, and it leaks. I'm not an iron fanatic or anything, just thought I'd spend a little more on a decent iron. I could've spent $5 and got a better iron than this. Walk dont run away from this thing. Even though some people love it, there are more people saying it's horrible. I wish I would've come here before I purchased it.Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You're better off wearing wrinkled clothes","review":"This iron is worse than worthless. At least if you know something is worthless, you'll avoid it. Take my word for it, you do not want to buy this iron. One of the very few moving parts, the power cord, came loose and now the thing doesn't even light up. Put your clothes between your mattress and box spring and hope they flatten out before buyin this iron. It may work for a while (a very short while) but I guarantee it won't work for long. If you still want to buy one, take my advise, keep the packing and sales receipt handy - you'll need them before long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melty-gooey stuff from the iron","review":"I've had this iron for less than 3 months and it oozes this reddish, gooey stuff when I iron. I have tried cleaning it and it keeps coming back. It's not starch or my water. I am very disappointed at this iron."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steam Iron Won't Steam","review":"I have read and re-read the instructions for this iron and I can't get it to steam continuously which is what I have always been accustomed to with a STEAM iron.They know it has problems because the instructions tell you &quot;if the temperature setting and steam control setting are correct and there is no steam, gently tap the soleplate on the ironing board a few times. Move the variable steam control from '0' to 'Max' a few times.&quot;After this the iron will steam for a few seconds and then it stops again. Not a good steam iron."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"At the beginning it worked well. I appreciated very much it's long electric cord which allowed me to use the iron without getting an extension cord. However, after few months of light using it started leaking. Now, after 16 months since I purchased the fancy looking iron, it stopped heating up. Reading all the comments posted here, I must admit that I was lucky enough that this iron worked for that long. Therefore, I am giving it 2 stars insted of one."},{"rating":"1","title":"SMOKE and FIRE not CONTINUOUS STEAM!!!","review":"I PURCHASED THE SHARK EURO-PRO CONT. STEAM IRON FROM A LOCAL TARGET RIGHT AFTER I MOVED INTO MY NEWLY BUILT HOME. IT SEEMED TO WORK JUST FINE FOR THE FIRST WEEK. THEN ONE DAY I TURNED THE IRON ON AND WALKED AWAY FOR A COUPLE MINUTES. WHEN I RETURNED I SMELLED SOMETHING BURNING AND NOTICED THAT THE IRON HAD A LOT OF STEAM COMING OUT OF IT. WELL, I INITIALLY THOUGHT IT WAS STEAM. BUT IT WASN'T. IT WAS SMOKE AND THE IRON WAS ON FIRE INSIDE. THE STEEL PLATE BEGAN TO MELT AT THE TIP. I QUICKLY UNPLUGGED THE IRON PUT IT OUT SIDE IN MY YARD UNTIL IT COOLED OFF. OF COURSE I RETURNED IT. I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED. IF I DIDN'T GO BACK IN THE ROOM WHERE IT WAS PLUGGED IN AS QUICKLY AS I DID, IT COULD HAVE CAUGHT MY NEW HOUSE ON FIRE. THE PRICE WAS VERY GOOD FOR SUCH A POWERFUL IRON. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY, IF IT SOUNDS TO GOOD TO BE TRUE - IT IS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"fyretodd","review":"This was my third and last Shark Iron. The first two stopped working after minor drops on the carpet; our fault I guess, but other irons took much more abuse. The last Iron completely stopped working 2 days after warranty and thus, the company wont repair it. In addition, all three irons leaked water very shortly after purchase. Oh well, I'm done with this iron and purchased a Hamilton Beach at a fraction of the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst iron I've ever owned","review":"If I could give this product no stars, I would. I like a good iron and this is not it. From the beginning it has spit water on garments every time I used it. I gave up and used it only dry. It is not effective at getting out wrinkles. It heats up, but without the steam, it's useless and with the steam, it ruined my clothes. I would not recommend this iron to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it worked.","review":"Purchased Iron and it worked great while it worked which was about a month. Now it won't heat at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after 12 months","review":"It was good when it worked, all of a sudden it stopped working. When powered on, it turns on but doesn't let me choose the ironing mode and doesn't heat-up. This is an expensive one I got from Wal-Mart, what a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunk of junk","review":"We purchased this iron as a replacement for one that broke and forgot to look at the reviews - big mistake.This iron worked really well the first couple of months but it is now spewing water at every use. It is a challenge just to get through a shirt. In order to iron without getting water spots all over it, and then having to run the iron over to evaporate the water, you would need to give up the steam, which is the main selling point of the product.A shoddy product and I wish we could get out money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit working after only 15 months","review":"Do not buy this iron. It was fine for the first 15 months but today, it just quit working. No lights, no heat, no nothing! Of course, the warranty expired three months ago. Seems that this is a problem with this iron that others have also had. Irons I've had in the past worked at least five years before dying."},{"rating":"1","title":"The box worked better than the iron","review":"After reading other reviews I am not sure what I can add. My iron lasted a full 8 months of mild use (used once a week). One day was I ironing. The auto-shut off kicked on as I went up stairs and the iron never again turned on. It was never dropped, barely used and for the most part is overpriced junk. I don't know what to recommend but AVOID THIS PRODUCT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"Quite simply, the iron is terrible. Although mine heats, the steam function consists of a dribble of water that pools on the clothes. Having the on/off switch right where your hand rests is also silly since it becomes quite easy to accidentally turn the iron off. This is as bad of an iron as I have encountered, so save yourself some grief and get a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!","review":"Just like other people who reviewed this item, I thought I had found a winner until it JUST STOPPED WORKING!! Forget about the annoyance of having to reset it every five minutes because it automatically shuts off. After only having this iron for about 3 months it just stopped working. The lights will flash but it will not heat. I will never buy another iron this expensive and I will surely never buy another SHARK iron! I will be heading to the store to get a 10$ iron that I dont have to feel bad about throwing in the trash if it suddenly stops working!"},{"rating":"1","title":"inconsistant in temperature and steam","review":"This iron is heavy, which is probably the only thing I like about it. The temperature keeps dropping when I am using it. Drives me crazy. I am constantly pushing temperature buttons. The steam varies as well. Sometimes it works like a champ and other times I find myself wondering-where is the steam? Also it takes forever for it to heat up. No quick touch ups with this iron. Craziest iron I have ever used. Automatic shut off is a royal pain. Honestly wish I had never bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, really really bad","review":"I purchased this iron 2 months ago and I thought it was going to be a winner, with the metal plate, and great steam features. Well, I just spent 2 hours and 40 minutes ironing. The iron automatically shuts off every 6.5 minutes and there is no reset button on it, which means that in the last 160 minutes, I had to unplug and restart the iron 24 TIMES....24 TIMES. While this may be a handy feature for some super speedy gonzales iron person, it is frustrating in the extreme. I will NEVER buy another Shark product and recommend that if you need a dependable iron for more than a 5 minute touchup, you'd best look at another product."},{"rating":"1","title":"circuit board fried after 1 1/2 years","review":"This iron never got hot enough. It spurt brown steam, then the next day burnt a hole in my ironing board cover, and quit working. I'd only had it a little over a year, paid $50 for it, and after much research found out it was made in China. I CANNOT find an iron made in the U.S.A. VERY< VERY disappointed and upset. An appliance should last longer than a year!!@!!! It was only used about once a week for a couple of hours. This is ridiculous!! DO NOT BUY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy design","review":"I had owned a Rowenta previously and loved it. So when it quit on me, I vowed to replace it with another Rowenta. But the Shark looked comparable and was $10 cheaper. I bought it and have regretted it ever since. Here are the things I hate. #1 The temp change button is located at the top of the grip and your hand is constantly touching it and changing the temperature. I have had to restart the heat setting 6 times already and I've only ironed two items.#2 To fill the iron, there is a little door which you have to hold open, but the iron also has to be tipped to get the water in...you really need three hands.#3 The iron is very heavy.#4 The steam and spray button are stiff to depress.I'm going back to Rowenta."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Rip Off","review":"I have tried 3 of these irons and non of those currently sold by Target work. The first quit heating after a few uses. The local Target was very cooperative and exchanged it. The second unit didn't work out of the box. The unit's auto shutoff feature would shut the iron off after a couple minutes usage - even while it was being used. At the risk of being pretty naive, I again exchanged the iron. The third did the same as the second. So, this time I called the manufacturer, Euro-Pro. They wanted me pay to have the iron repaired and indicated that it would take 8-10 WEEKS to get the unit returned. It is too bad that their quality control is so bad because, when the iron works, it does a quite good job. This is a bad company making a very inferior product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have had for 2yrs and love it..","review":"I've have had mine for 2yrs now and I just love it. I before had spent lots of money on Rowenta's and they both went into the trash in a very short time. They leaked all over the place and just didn't perform well. I got this one and gave a lot time and use before writing this review. I'm so sorry to hear others have not been as happy. It heats up within a couple of minutes, it give off lots of steam, and I've never had a leaking problem. It has a bit of weight, not too much but it helps when doing cottons.The only reason a 4 star is I don't care for the cover to pour the water in. They could have designed it better, or just leave it with no cover at all..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rush to Market","review":"Here's another example of a great company getting greedy, rushing into the consumer market without, ahem, ironing out major design flaws. This iron could have been a blue-ribbon winner, were it not for a steam feature that kicked over and died within one month of using the iron. When the steam feature did work, this was one honey of an iron. But one month out and the steam feature is dead. Which makes this one clunker of an iron. Shame on you Euro-Pro. Here I was hoping you were going to build on your reputation for designing fantastic industrial irons, but your move from the industrial to the consumer market is not doing your brand any favor. I'll certainly think more than twice before considering anything by Euro-Pro in the future. Oh, and another thing: some warranty service: you have to PAY the company to have them ship the iron back to you once (presumably) repaired. Their flaw, my cost... By anyone's math, that adds up to a BIG ZERO!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does What It Says It Will!!!!","review":"Having used just about an iron from every manufacturer over the past 60 + years I have finally found the best. This iron does exactly what it says it will - from the continuous steam to the once over does it. It takes a while to prepare the iron for use but this time is worth the finished results. Linen and silk are two of my favorite fabrics and both turn out beautifully. I just bought this iron this morning after comparsison shopping on the net and came home to do a trial run. I had to write a review when I was so pleased with my purchase. It was also one sale at Target when I went in today which was icing on the cake!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fire Hazard Faulty Automatic Shut off Mode","review":"I really loved this iron. I bought it at Target only 5 months ago and I loved all of it's features. Until yesterday.My ironing was interrupted and a few minutes later, I smelled a hot odor. I thought there was a fire somewhere in the house. When I got to the kitchen, the iron was making a loud clicking sound and smoke was coming out! The automatic shut off light was on, but the iron had burnt itself up! if I had not unplugget it my house could have burnt to the ground.I tried to use it today, but it does not heat up and it is still making the loud sound in auto shut-off mode. I will have to get another iron then go through the hassles of contacting the company the other reviewers have unsuccessfully attempted. I will contact Consumers Reports and other safety agencies. This iron is not safe and should be recalled in my opinion!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Waste Your Money!","review":"I bought this iron 10 months ago; initially it worked like a dream. However, a couple of months ago it started to leak and would not heat properly. Now, it is a nightmare, it no longer heats, and the faceplate is scorched and sticky.

I turned the iron off, but left it plugged in while I went to put what I was ironing into the wash. Within a few moments, I noticed a very heavy burning smell coming through the room. My iron was smoking profusely and was on fire internally. Later that evening, I sat down to look at purchasing another iron through Amazon and was SHOCKED to find how many other consumers had the same thing happen to them! Based on what I read, this should have been recalled a long time ago. It would one thing if the iron simply died, but this thing is leathal! It's not worth the risk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Does Not Work","review":"Like most of the reviews here, I have the same problem.

At the time, I spoke to a Male Butler that was buying the same Iron. He raved about it.While looking for a new Iron that will last, I came upon these reviews. I will not buy another Shark. I loved it till it quit. Now no steam, and only a low heat on any setting. So I will return to the store that replaces anything that you are not satisified with. Even beyond the warranty. I am willing to pay more to get a iron that will go the distance. I would hope for 4 years. I only Iron about every 10 to 14 days. That goal seems reasonable to me. To it's credit, the iron did not leak. I drained it after each use as recommended. I actually used bottled water since I iron so infrequently. So, on to the next.Mike"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hoped for better. . .","review":"I've had this iron for a little while and I haven't been happy with it all. There's several annoying things about it. I don't like the grey water tank. . . I can barely see through to find the water level.

Also, the worst thing is it started spitting water after just a few months and now it's ruining clothing.I wish I'd purchased something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a 1600 watt iron!","review":"The product description on Amazon describes this iron as a 1700 watt model. It is actually a 1600 watt model, significantly weaker, as irons go. We took the iron out of the box to confirm the wattage on its label, but otherwise didn't use it.

To be fair, it did fall off the ironing board and onto the carpet, but plenty of irons have met this fate before and kept going.

Just about everything about this iron is great--if you get a good working copy...Sadly, I didn't get a good one. After just 2 days, the steam mysteriously stopped emitting from the lower vents.

Save yourself the frustration and buy something else that works. The real irony sorry for the pun is that this was the most expensive iron at the store where I bought it. I can't believe that I have wasted this much time on an iron.Run like your hairs on fire from this company and product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Provides 1 year of good ironing, then dies","review":"I've bought two of these Shark euro-pro irons, each model year newer than the other and I had high hopes for this iron. It makes great steam, it's heavy and very well balanced and it lasts for 1 year only. I used this iron every day. I thought when it happened to the first iron I bought, that it was a fluke but when the 2nd iron I bought broke after 1 year I know it's this iron. The iron makes great steam but it breaks completely after one year. This latest iron burned a hole in my slacks and I didn't even know it was touching my pants. Who ever makes this Shark iron needs to work on Quality control. A good iron should last at least 3 years in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Iron I've Ever Had","review":"Ditto to the last review. This iron worked well for two months. After that, the auto shut-off decided to really shut the iron off, whether you were using it or not. The ONLY way to get the iron back on again was to unplug it for a while, then try again. Completely unworkable. Beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"all the steam anyone needs","review":"I really like this iron, the continuous steam feature is great.

I decided to buy an \\"expensive\\" iron since my little cheap Sunbeam ones were disappointing over time. Six months after I bought the Shark iron, I noticed a strong burning smell after about 30 minutes of use. The sole plate was turning black! I unplugged it and let it sit for a while. Later I tried plugging it in again to see if it worked and it was completely burned out - no lights at all. Thankfully, I kept my receipt and Sears cheerfully replaced it with another one. That was less than 3 months ago and the new Shark iron did the exact same thing last night. I smelled something burning and the sole plate was beginning to turn black. I'm taking this back to Sears and NOT buying another Shark iron again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Euro Pro Shark Iron","review":"I've had two of these irons and had the same problem with each. The first one worked great for a couple of months and then when I would plug it in, it wouldn't light up and heat right away. Seems like there was a problem with the automatic shut off. After about 15 min. the light would come on and then you could set the iron to the temp. you wanted. I returned it and got another, I really liked it when it worked; and the second iron developed the same problem.After reading the other reviews about having them repaired and having to pay for shipping/handling, I just decided to buy a different iron.Very disappointing especially since it was rated so highly by Consumer reports."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sore thumb!","review":"I bought this product at Target. I can't say that the iron is faulty; just the design of it is not friendly. It does not produce enough steam on its own and I have to keep my thumb on the \\"extra steam\\" button in order for it smooth the wrinkles, hence, a sore thumb with extended time with ironing. It also tips over easily resulting in 2 nasty burns from it falling on my hand while positioning an article of clothing. I've been advised to purchase a Rowneta next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks all over","review":"I just bought this iron and it leaks like crazy. We've only used it one time and ironing clothes makes a mess because it leaks so much. I can turn it to a 45-degree angle and water just pours out of it. I'm taking it back today.

I hope that it contintues to do everything that I need done. I have not had good luck with irons. They have only lasted two months tops and then they stop working. So far I am very happy with this iron and I would recommend it to my family and friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage, save your money, buy a less expensive, better Iron!","review":"I have spent the last 18 years in the military. I Have used many different irons. This one looks the best, but worked the least. After a dozen or so uses, the Iron got really hot, melted through an expensive shirt, then quit heating up. Not it just sits there and blinks, and smells bad. Good think I bought my wife a Rowenta clothes steamer so I have something to use on my things.For the $60 or so that I paid for this last year, this think is a piece of junk and I will probably never own another Euro-Pro Shark product again as I have not had good luck with a number of their things.

Season Five pretty much repeats the excellence of Seasons Three and Four.The continued excellence of the show was the good news. The bad news is that it breaks no new ground and does nothing new. It felt pretty much exactly the same as the previous two seasons. Nothing wrong with that, but my own preference is for shows that move forward and tell a story. So the show, for all its excellence, remains a somewhat limited show. But unlike Seasons One and Two and very much like Seasons Three and Four, I looked forward to each episode and every one provides significant entertainment.I did get a charge out of seeing Timothy Sprall in a small role.Now, on to Season Six!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the fundamental chages become obvious","review":"By series 5, Red Dwarf has begun to deviate from its roots, which is actually obvious before this. By series 4, it is much more based on visual and physical comedy than before (though they never forget to leave room for the hysterical lines) But series 5 is fundamentally different somehow, to me, it begins to get a little more sober (slightly) and thoughtful. It begins to deviate somewhat from th basic premise the show was founded on) But despite any chages, it follows still in the grand tradition of Red Dwarf, delivering dense, side-splitting humor, right until the last moment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too big, misleading description","review":"Just got these in the mail; they are way too big for my size 5.5 shoe.

But after purchasing the album and listening to it, I really wish I had never bought it. \\"Useless Inventions\\" is the only good track on this CD. Everything else is just bland and boring.If you're a die-hard fan of this band and have to have all of their albums, wait until you can find a used copy of this one for 4 or 5 bucks, because you probably won't listen to it a second time.Oh well, at least I've learned that this band had much better albums than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"another good GbV record","review":"though no one will ever confuse earthquake glue with bee thousand, there are moments here when you remember why you fell in love with this band in the first place. there are, however, problems. what's with that annoying sound all the way through i'll replace you with machines? does bob think my kind of soldier is a good enough lead-off track? why are kevin's drums almost inaudible? didn't he mine the whole \\"i want to sound like the who\\" thing pretty exhaustively with choreographed man of war? either way, i like this record and it's better than the following year's GbV swan song, half smiles of the decomposed. i just get a little sad listening to this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scintillating","review":"Another gem that I would have just about missed...ethereal; Amazon has quite a good Indian classical collection and I plan to get some similar titles in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"You gotta be really damn good to stand for so long","review":"When I first listened to it I must say that I didn't enjoy it all. But then I gave them a second try and I've finally got surprised with the great songs that lies in there. The best tracks so far are \\"Jetstream\\" (which is the most pop song they've ever done and it simply takes you to a jet flight), \\"Guilt is a useless emotion\\" (an upbeat dancefloor hit), \\"Morning night and day\\", \\"Dracula's Castle\\", \\"Krafty\\" and \\"I told you so\\" (the best track of the album).The album at all is not as good as \\"Get Ready\\" but they continue to make great and enjoyable music for the past 25 years. And you gotta be really damn good to stand for long."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"Who knew New Order were a great guitar-pop band too? Despite their long history of dance club hits, this time they've turned their genius into bouncy intelligent pop. Granted, a couple of songs aren't quite as strong as the rest, and Barney hit the rhyming dictionary a bit hard in spots. However, I'd challenge ANY young 80's ripoff band to create something half as good (you know who you are.)Overall: the good stuff is great and the couple of \\"bad\\" songs are merely OK. Which proves that, just as youth doesn't automatically make you cooler, age doesn't automatically make you irrelevant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just ENJOY","review":"this album has some killer tracks in it,as all NewOrder albums,but mostly WFTSC is,to my mind,to enjoy the band,who changed music twice before,and now after 25 years,are doing it just for fun.so just put it in your CD player and...ENJOY!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blown Away!","review":"I was suprised and delighted to see a New Order release and bought it instantly because all of their music is good. I had no idea how good this one would be; it is now my favorite CD out of about 700 CDs, most of which are Brit-Pop and female alternative (Lillith Fair types). I am 50 years old and enjoy music like this far more than the old 70's classic rock I grew up with! By the way, does anybody know how Bernard Sumner gets the awsome buzz in his guitar notes; is it by pressing the strings loosly to the fret?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Music To My Ears","review":"I am an avid New Order fan from way back and I know a good disc of theirs when I hear it, and WFTSC is very good indeed. The songs are relaxed, not forced, with all the classic New Order trademarks: melancholy vocals, unmistakeable guitars and the occasional swirling keyboard. You can hear elements of other classic New Order tunes in some of these songs, but each retains its individuality. The title track is classic New Order and \\"Jetstream\\" is reminiscent of Peter Hook's side project, Monaco. The songs flow together well and the melodies lift you up and carry you. This disc is lighter in tone than some of New Order's moodier discs, like the classic Power, Corruption and Lies or Low Life, but it's very good indeed. Listening to WFTSC gives you a good feeling, it's like spending time with old friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ownership","review":"I currently own all of the works ever issued by New Order not counting singles and imports. Does that mean anything?...Not really. I did find that this effort harkens back to their earlier works and brought a slight reflective feeling of what they were famous for.Some of what's found on here evokes a sound similar to what you would find in Substance. Which for those not holding the entire NO library in their possession is a pretty straight-forward, minimalist sound and steady beat. I remember NO for that and that seems to be what they have done best over the years....Straight-forward and minimalist with a beat...Not such a bad deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"four stars because... well, just because","review":"My review of this album will be biased- I'm sorry. It's kind of like, all the New Order, without any of the \\"New Order\\"- which, at first, makes no sense.It has all the things, that, at least superficially, qualify it as New Order: the catchyness of the music, the pop culture feel, the studio polish, etc. etc. However, I feel it lacks that certain \\"why don't you piss off\\"-wit that their 80s era songs were made famous for. I kind of miss that, even though I have this bad tendency to label almost everything New Order put out as shallow in comparison to their previous work under a certain, \\"dare-we-not-mention\\" other name.However, Yes, I did purchase this album, and, Yes, I do enjoy listening to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"Don't be fooled by these five star reviews apparently written by interns at the record company.

Now I'm a New Order fan from the beginning, and well, they have produced questionable material before (technique for example), but this one is the worst by far! It's like a caricature of a band that was once the driving force behind countless music genres,numerous scenes, and now the 80's revival scene(...what, the fashion wasn't bad enough, now we have to have bad 80's stylised music?). For a band that made good music, this surely is the end... and it hurts!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This album blows.....","review":"Puhleaze don't buy this album. it's just so bad. it's so boring , it's irritating. grab the last album, Get Ready. that was excellent. but New order should be ashamed of releasing this album.Their best album, is Power Corruption and Lies, of course, followed by their first one. or check out their early singles, Blue Monday and earlier.sorry to be so brutal.

But oh, was I disappointed. I like \\"Krafty\\" but after finishing the album, it seemned annoying. If this cd is supposed to be the redeeming album of their career. The next album will be hilarious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you guys deaf?","review":"I've been a huge New Order fan since forever and in my opinion their last great album was Technique (I bought this album because of all the reviews which stated Sirens sounded a lot like it). I admit there are a few songs, specifically Who's Joe, Hey Now What You Doing, and Dracula's Castle, that sound almost like they could have been B sides for songs on Technique. However, this album is a disappointment (and this is coming from someone who even liked Bernard Sumners side project Electronic). The album sounds like a cross between Ace of Base, the Scissor Sisters and the Republic album (which was the beginning of the end for NO in my eyes). I guess I'll just keep listening to my old NO albums and try to block the memory of these last three from my mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"No\\" is right - this is unremarkable disco dreck","review":"I'm not sure why I like New Order. They've never been the most melodic band and the singer's pretty terrible (if you can't handle this opinion, you must be tone-deaf). Still, they've often been rhythmically intriguing and much of their stuff just sounds really tripped-out and cool. they've written some good songs. Some of this new CD has some cool SOUNDING music, but I don't hear any great songs and it ends up just irritating me with its monotonous wimpiness."},{"rating":"2","title":"four only on account of their very high standard of output","review":"mon, dis an unmitigatedly brilliant record dat, once you spend de time wich it, grow on you like de moss grow round de tree-base. i be de biggest NO fan in de world (dey take vote last yr--i win, i win!) so i a trifle tendentious when it come to de band. you should know onetime another ting bout me musical tastes: i crazy for dees udder bands as well dat you must-must investigates: THE BLACK WATCH, THE LILYS, & de XTC. i presume you areddy knows de CURE). ok, mon: de title track is evocative of all de early best stuff off de power/corruption/lies & brodderhood & low life plus technique. the guitars shimmering & de melodies transcendental as de summer sunset.

Save your money, now I'm doing research on ultrasonic deer alert devices. I recently ordered the Hopkins (now Hoppy) Trailblazer 12 volt device - will test it and do another review.This is my personal experience - IT DOESN'T WORK. If you want to take your 30% chance of avoiding a collision with a deer (based on research) then go get these.

I can vacuum them up and throw out what I trap but suddenly 50 more appear. I purchased this item hoping it would drastically reduce the population by attracting the bugs into the bag. The attractant has a delightful floral scent (obvious to human noses) but sits a good 8 inches above the bag itself. The beetles are not attracted to this. When a beetle accidentally falls in the bag, it climbs right back out as there are four holes for it enter or exit through which are at least 1 square inch each in size. Even if the bugs were lured into the trap it is ineffective at keeping them in. And there is no 'stun' factor as the description mentions. I do not recommend this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money...stick with your local box stores for this","review":"The capacity of this bag is much greater than traditional bags you get locally, so you don't have to empty them as often. However, the 'ziploc' style opening at the bottom of this bag is not well made, or easy to empty. If you've ever used a similar product, Japanese beetles are stinky and the last thing you want is to get rotting beetles on your hands trying to empty it, if you don't mind then buy this bag. These bags are too expensive to just throw out after 1-use, and if they happen to collect water from the rain, its almost impossible to empty the bag without all the nastiness on your hands.I recommend using much more cheap & disposable bag you can get from a local box retail store for 1/2 the price.

Welcome to Into Your Heart, the soulful R&B/pop release by Irish band Hothouse Flowers who have germinated their talent over the past several years in a creative hiatus to emerge with tracks that are refreshing, sometimes spiritual and always unlike anything you hear on the radio these days. Riffs and vocals are reminiscent of Marvin Gaye crossbred with John Lennon, with Irish soul that is at once wistful and hopeful. U2's bono attended their opening gig and offered his full support to the band, pictured in subsequent reviews with lead singer Liam O'Manolai who is as sexy as the range of his vocal talent which is broad and wide. Don't miss this CD and listen carefully to the lyrics on Magic Bracelets, Santa Monica, Peace Tonight and more. It grows and grows, just like the Flowers themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soulful Flowers","review":"I'm a huge Flowers fan who feels the magic of \\"People\\" has never been surpassed but who nonetheless loves all their previous albums, including \\"Born.\\" Saw them in Boston last year when they played some of the songs on this album. When the media refers to this album as \\"raw\\" it doesn't mean powerful and unpolished. Instead, I found the album to be somewhat light, along the lines of Van Morrison. Beyond the first track, which would only be the third or fourth best song on any of their previous albums, there really isn't much that will hold your attention or make you sing along. Much of the album is wispy crooning coupled with unsophisticated lyrics. That being said, Liam's voice has never sounded better, and the band is still more heartfelt about their music than most out there. But here's hoping they return to the heights of \\"Hallelujah Jordan\\" and \\"At Last.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A gift.","review":"When a melody and lyrics speak to you, it's called a gift.

Needless to say, I'm a bit disappointed.However, I will not discourage all buyers from this product. If you own just a few brushes (12 or less), and they are small/short brushes without a lot of fullness, then this case would be perfect for you.

It's a little weird though. It came with a usb cord, but the devise does not have a usb plugin. (oh well, an xtra usb cord) The wireless usb plugin is a strange shape and size, but it works. It is large and if you only have two side-by-side ports on your laptop, you probably won't be able to use the other one. The keypad hints at quality with four little non slip rubber feet on the bottom, but it's not level, it wobbles ever so slightly when in use. I actually shopped a little more after I received it to price one with a large plus key, like a desktop keyboard, but they were generally <$25.

Whatever ends up working or not working, I guess it's a learning process either way. :)I find this product to be quite good based on its own merits though (not based on any purported super/magical health-giving properties.)

It was easy to set up (although the directions were not the greatest). The sling seat is not the best and if your little one is still pretty little, you may have to wait to use this. I wish it had more area to sit on. It's like a hammock in there, but I think that is how a lot of them are (bike trailers). I really reviewed all the trailers and I liked this one because it came with everything: coupler device for one bike, shade and weather seal, and stroller attachment. For the price, you can't go wrong; however, I wish that the seat was better made to accommodate comfort and safety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as expected","review":"I don't have anything to compare ours to, but I'm not that thrilled with our trailer. It's very small for two children, the seat is like one giant sling so it's not comfortable, and the harness is a huge pain. I expected the harness to be a pain because of other reviews, but I expected the seat to be more comfortable and for two kids to fit pretty well. Because it's like one giant sling, keeping two children in place comfortably is very hard. I would not buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value for the $$$$","review":"I love this trailer.

After much research and hmmming and haaaaing, we decided on this trailer. It has proven to be a fantastic purchase. We have taken it out only 5 times but we've only had it for a few weeks. I must say that I agree with all of the complaints about the seatbelts. They are quite a pain but my smart little one can't get out of it when she's in it...that's for sure. It was very easy to assemble. We have yet to use it as a stroller but for now, we truly like this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall good product","review":"Overall, I love the trailer. It rides well, is very sturdy, and my children (11 months and 3 years) have plenty of room to enjoy the ride. However, I am very displeased with the clips. I was hoping they would be similar to the 5 point harness system used by Graco, but they are not. They are hard to undo and I don't feel my children are as safe as they would be with the 5 point system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the occassional ride","review":"This is a nice trailer. My son fits comfortably in it & it has flaps in case it rains. It easily can be removed, but is a little harder to mount back on. It's also hard to stand the bike up with the kick stand. My bike always falls over with the trailer attached."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product - for the most part","review":"My son enjoys his bike trips and I am happy with my purchase of this light bike trailer. I would like to point out some nuances.I have a Columbia bike and it did not fit on the rear wheel the way it was supposed to. I had to move the rear fender. The seat belts are not so much belts but clips which I find time consuming to unlatch. You have to make sure you have al the straps tight or your kid will slump. This cart is wider than a door frame and would not fit for taking indoors. My son likes storing items in the side section. It has a small drainage hole in the bottom of the trailer which worked great when my son dropped his water. It drained out the water and aids in cleaning the inside out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lite weight, sturdy & price is right!","review":"We are very pleased with the design and would recommend the Quick-N-Lite. The product meets all my expectations... Well made, Easy to assemble, folds up easy for storage, a sinch to attach to my bike, User Friendly for my toddler daughter to climb in and out, Safe from roll-over.I went with the Quick-N-Lite over the Quick-N-Easy because the frame is aluminum (strength & lite weight,less chance of rust). The trailer is nicely engineered for rigidity and fit. There is storage behind the seat for packages, blankets toys, bread to feed the ducks, etc. Fact is, I am not sure what more higher costing model would offer without adding size, weight or un-needed frame around the wheels. Along with being well made, it is good looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I bought this product for my 1 year old and 3 year old. There is plenty of room for both children and toys. There is a lot of room behind them for storage. You can not see them when you are using this as a stroller. The straps are hard to unbuckle and the instructions that come with it a very vague. There are parts that I didn't know what to do with. Other than the previous comments it is a great product. It rides very smooth and takes bumps really well. It doesn't tip over when your bike does.

It gives me back the hair I had when I was in my 20's. I am now 43, and my hair feels extremely soft & it looks healthy and shiny. I don't think you necessarily have to use the Tsubaki shampoo. I was using Aveda Shampure shampoo w/ the 1st bottle, and I am now using the Tsubaki Shining Shampoo. Frankly, I cannot tell the difference.

The Half Not Told is about the Civil War in the West, particularly in Missouri. The frontier town of St. Joseph, Missouri, which became torn apart and saw its fortunes fall due to stagflation, is a reflection of how dramatically the war changed Western American life forever. The Half Not Told draws very heavily upon primary sources, as its highly extensive endnotes section and a bibliographical essay attest.

Some of the negatives are the army time display and finding a connection. When set to show army time it will only show 3 digits (eg.: 14:30 would be shown as 4:30).

Having listened to a number of audio books over the years, I was a little surprised that this one was only three hours long. I realized fairly quickly that it was an abridged audiobook (which, at the time, was not made clear in the product description when I bought it. It's now much clearer.) The book isn't bad, and it was decent to pass three hours of time, but I definitely do not recommend the audiobook. I imagine that the unabridged book is probably very good, but too much was omitted from the audiobook to fully appreciate this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A look at the Holocaust from an unfamiliar point of view","review":"One of the best looks at how the Nazi Holocaust destroyed the lives of 11 million people, almost half of whom were not Jewish. The choice(s) that Sophie makes will shock the uninitiated in Holocaust literature, though you would be well advised to keep in mind that such choices were made on a daily basis by those who survived the madness of World War II. A haunting, disturbing work that will stay with the reader for a lifetime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Partly brilliant, completely overrated","review":"There is so much useless verbeage in this book that it is almost unreadable. Stingo is really a boring narrator when it comes down to it and his struggles to get laid do hardly a fine piece of literature make. And using the f-word is not really all that outrageous, is it now. Parts are undeniably brilliant, but the whole is a waste of time.

It was so moving, and so incredibly well developed that time and again I find myself remembering pieces of it at odd moments.Other readers have rated this book as \\"flawless.\\" I would like to say that I did find some glaring flaws, although they did not subtract from its overall masterpiece. Nathan is described as a drug addict and a \\"paranoid schizophrenic,\\" and as someone who works in the field of mental health, I would like to say that descriptions of his diagnosis and illness do not support schizophrenia at all.

It amazed me. The writing style was beautiful - it was obvious that William Styron thought long and hard about every word that he wrote. The characters were so compelling. The stories that Styron weaves togeter...Sophie and Nathan's relationship, the concentration camp, Stingo's struggle...it all melds together to become a wonderful story. I recommend it to anyone who wants to be truly captivated by a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Brilliant Book After Look Homeward, Angel...","review":"In a brilliant novel that draws upon the post-WWII years, Styron captures the guilt and shame that spans across the continents. Inspired by the haunting Southern spirit of Wolfe and Faulkner, a young Southern writer travels North only to discover a horrifying story of a Polish woman who survived Aushwitz and her schizophrenia-stricken lover. A must-read to anyone looking for the new and unusual perspectives on history, as well as to those who hold as their life's meaning, the craft of writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent. The best book I have ever read .","review":"I have read Sophie's Choice twice and both times I couldn't put the book down. This is a heart-wrenching, stunning work of art written in the most memorable prose I have ever read. I was sickened by the butcherey of the Nazis, amused by Stingo's sexual frustations, and deeply touched by the life disappointments of Farrel,the failed author,the madness of Nathan, and the torture, physical and mental, of Sophie. I will read it again. I am sure of that."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the great masterpieces.","review":"Sophie's Choice is a novel unlike any I have ever encountered. The poetic prose flows fom the pages as easily as Sophie's tears. William Styron has created a charachter so amazing in Sophie that she is quite simply the most fascinating I have ever encountered. Stingo and Nathan hold their own against Sophie as well. Sophies love for Nathan is stronger than any in modern literature, and the choice she is forced to make is unbearably heartbreaking. AS I finished this brilliant work of art I couldn't bear to leave the trio, and like Stingo I will forever ponder the unexplainable depths of Sophie and Nathan. This is a treasure to read again and again. Also, Meryl Streep's performance in the film is the best acting in screen history, because she makes Sophie come alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sophie's Choice","review":"Triumph of the human spirit is for naught without the peace of Christ. we cope without Christ. we triumph with Christ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too much Stingo...","review":"It's difficult to find characters in fiction more tormented than the main trio in Sophie's choice. At first I was excited by the story, even the humourous beginning intrigued me. Unfortunately the title of the book is misleading, since about two thirds of the novel is dedicated to Stingo's trials and tribulations, and he is the least interesting of the three characters. The book's power lies on Sophie's story, wonderfully spilled in nonlinear fashion, with the true facts slowly emerging from the initial lies and decorations. Sophie is the antiheroine we seldom find in current novels: perpetually feeling guilty and unable to rebuild her life. Great story, it's a shame it focuses so much on Stingo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Echos of the Past Resound in the Present","review":"It is amazing how much a story of the holocaust can seem so fresh in light of the current tragedy taking place in Europe. The author did a brilliant job making you feel the emotions that Sophie felt. At first I was annoyed by the flashback sequences used to tell the story. As I got further into the story, I realized that if Sophies story was told all at once, It would be too horrible to bare. This is the first novel on the top 100 list that I felt actually earned its spot. I enjoyed the fact that the novel had not only had a plot, but a counter-plot to put the horror into perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Backorders","review":"I received one out of my order and havn't received the rest yet.

I mean look at UML Distilled. But, I had certain expectations for the content and that is where the focus should be. If you remove the screen shots and code sample you are left with a book of maybe 25 pages.I purchased Katonka's book thinking I would use it as a guide, but there too many gaps of knowledge and disconnected ideas.

You still get the same high good-looking jumps and loop-de-loops,but the actual fighting is one of the best parts.You get excellent combo moves and on Team Dark and Sonic a nicely well-done finisher attack.All four teams have a finisher attack,but half of them are stupid. What really caught my eye is the two player battle mode.There is something about knocking a team off a cliff is entertaining to me. I also agreed with some of the other people.Team Rose is corny,and falling off a cliff is way too easy,but over all,this is one of the best and most original games I have ever played."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice play but lots cons","review":"This was a great game to play its just... you'd think they'd get the same vioce actors for tails and kunckles. Tails always sounds more childish, and kunckles always sounds.... wierd. the best vioceovers for any of these characters has to be the First Sonic Adventure. Which is, sadly, only for gamecube and dreamcast. This Game doesn't have the same quality of story line as the previous sonic adventures did. while the team thing was great, it was not great that Knuckles ability to climb walls was taken away. All we can do is hope seag realizes its mistakes. i hope the next sonic game is more like the first sonic adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"only if you're in to it","review":"overall the game is ok.the only thing that brings it down is the difficulty.when you get to level 4, it gets so hard that it gets boring"},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying game","review":"This game is VERY annoying, and can get tiring easily. The thing I don't like about it is that it only lets you play game stages, and you get bored easily.

The plot is that Dr. Eggman has built the ultimate weapon and Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles have to stop him. The Game play is excellent, it can be a pain sometimes.

We own a few sets and have given them as gifts in the past. They are great for imaginative play and travel well. Usually the sets come in a heavy plastic and fabric case that zips and has the Pockets of Learning logo on it. However, this item was not delivered in the packaging. The castle was just in a plastic bag that was stapled shut. It looks like I picked it up second hand. This may not be as big deal if I was purchasing it for my own use, but I ordered it as a gift. Based on the lack of original packaging, I am not comfortable gifting the item as I had planned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great soft, safe, imaginative toy!","review":"My grandson really enjoys this item we recently purchased. Unlike other castle type toys, this is soft, safe, and well constructed. Excellent for travel and the manufacturer replace missing parts free at any time."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor man's Elmore Leonard","review":"Pelecanos wants to be Elmore Leonard really bad but he ends being a Leonard lite at best. The book is really detailed screen play and not very good one either. Here is a sample of some of the annoying clich��s:1. The good guys coach football to rescued or troubled kids, and their team of poor kids, in spite of their ragged uniforms etc., beats the obnoxious rich kids team.2. Of course, Pellecanos can't have the hero PI Strange be all good because that wouldn't be too old fashioned, so he has him visiting massage parlors.3. He loves his secretory (she knows about the massage parlor secret and still loves him!) and in the end proposed to her because 'he loves her and needs her' and also because 'her son needs a father figure'.This was first Pellecanos novel and it is going to be also the last.Do yourself a favor read or reread any Elmore Leonard. You will be much more satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gritty, moving read","review":"This is my first Pelecanos book, and I have to say he made an impression. Gritty is a word I don't like too much, but it sure fits here. Derek Strange works in a sad, dark world, but there are moments of light, love, and hope. Worth the time it takes to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great writing turns ordinary story into terrific book","review":"If you share my belief that a really good author puts the reader in the scene with the characters, you'll probably appreciate the writing in this book. Pelecanos knows how to paint the word picture so the reader can see it and feel it. In this book, he takes what I'd rate as a fairly ordinary story and weaves it into a terrific book with great writing.This was my first Pelecanos book, but it won't be my last. I'm eager to see what he can do with other story lines. His character development is strong and his way of working current references to sports and music appealed to me in this book and I want to see how they play in some of his older work. In summary I'd say that if you like urban crime books, you ought to do yourself a favor and read this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hell to pay is correct.","review":"This book is mostly about a bunch of gangsters doing gangster stuff. Many filthy words and deeds. I read about half of it and could not read any more. I kept hoping there would be a point to it,but could find none in the first half of the book. When I purchased the book, I never dreamed it would not even have a real plot or maybe I could not recognize it. I have read hundreds of books, but none like this!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying Too Hard","review":"I made it exactly eight pages in to this novel. The writer seemed to be unfamiliar with the subjects he was attempting to portray. The dialogue was forced and uneven. It seemed to be cobbled together from bits and pieces of misrepresentations heard on \\"MTV\\" or \\"Comic View.\\" For me that ruined the entire book before the story had a chance to begin.The author was trying too hard to convey subject matter he knew nothing about or completely misunderstood. It was too nerve grating for me too continue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Retire this title","review":"I am profoundly saddened that the title, \\"Hell to Pay\\" has not been retired out of respect for Barbara Olsen whose life was extinguished on September 11, 2001. She was a passenger on American Airlines 77. She calmly made two calls to her husband, Ted Olson, before flight 77 hit the Pentagon.That the title of her book, \\"Hell to Pay\\" has been . . . uh . . . recicled is pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hell to Read","review":"I'm not a big fan of crime fiction, but I had read some good reviews on this story in some Men's magazine and figured I'd pick it up. Thankfully I had the sense to borrow it form the library instead of purchasing it.\\"Hell to Pay\\" was insanely boring. This would be the perfect novel to turn into a Steven Segall movie because it is already lacking a plot. Pelecanos jumps around way too much, and at too many times when he should be fleshing out the story more or adding some more action, which \\"Hell\\" is seriously devoid of. It seems like he used this book as a chance to describe the seedier side of Washington and to mention all of the urban hip-hop artists he knows rather than trying to tell an entertaining story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gritty and depressing","review":"You can certainly smell and feel life on the inner-city streets of Washington D.C in this story.But maybe that is the problem, the violence and lives of the people described is just too depressing to make compelling reading.The plot lost direction at times and wandered off on tangents, without contibuting anything to the story.If you like urban, gritty, realistic to a fault, novels about life on the mean streeets - then this is for you. But if don't, then give it a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hell to listen to","review":"This audio book, like many of those by \\"Brilliance Audio\\" is difficult to listen to...especially while driving. I listen to a book a week, and the only ones I've encountered with bad quality are by this company. The sound quality is bad, and the dialect impossible to understand. Buy the book, skip the audio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe later","review":"Snapped this up from bargain books, after reading all the good reviews. I found it boring and trite from the start and then it got worse. After 70 pages I gave up on it. Maybe later."},{"rating":"1","title":"One thing Pelecanos is not, is a 'brother'.","review":"The tortured language, the dialogue, is simply awful. His attempt to make the detective's conversations seem like Spencer is more like Shaft in drag and it fails miserably.The sexual tension is gratuitous, seems forced as if added to make the book sell rather than spending the pages in deeper character building. It's rare that I won't finish even a bad look, but this one I finally threw at the wall at page 160. Enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Price, Great pressings","review":"This Jasmine Music collection of Dick Haymes on 4 cds with over 100 tracks is a great price!For collectors of Haymes some of the tracks are duplicated on other recordings but this is definitely worth the price.Duets with Helen Forrest, Bing Crosby, the Andrew Sisters (I guess that counts as a quartet !) are all represented.The pressings are clean and the sound is wonderful.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Golden Voice","review":"This guy was far FAR better than Sinatra!! What an incredibly intimate voice when necessary that, on the next note, could just soar to full voice with no problem. Wonderful musician. Of all the uncertainties of his life, the one true thing was his ability to sing and sing like no other man in his field. A true original."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"What a wonderful voice Richard Haymes had. It's a shame so few of the arrangements here do that voice justice. Nothing swings, heck they barely creep forward. No jazz, just endless arrays of violins, harps, pianos and I thought I heard an accordion on one track. It's like expecting Sinatra and Riddle and getting Lawrence Welk. Great voice though, and some of the numbers with the Andrew Sisters are swell, but that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent book","review":"I am climbing Rainier for the first time later this year, so my wife bought this for me as a Christmas gift.I was a little disappointed. The practical information is very outdated. If you are looking for a great history of Rainier and former climbing expeditions, this is the book for you. Keep in mind that this book was originally written in 1973 so there is not much modern information. The are very few photos in this book. Most are black and white pencil illustrations. Unfortunately, there a very few books on Rainier and this is probably among the best. If you are looking for general mountain adventure books, look elsewhere. This reads more like a textbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!","review":"Very good, even in advanced age, Rubinstein is always wonderful!I do not know explain, but I think that just missed something to achieve the same perfection of the record of Pollini with Abbado.Perhaps a little more of virtuosity, which is necessary in Beethoven.The orchestra also is not as impressive as the recording conducted by Abbado.But, still Great!!I recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great reference but probably not the place to start!","review":"This book is a great tool for studying Russian. All the essential rules are here in an easy to find format. However, if don't know any Russian this is not the best place to begin. It is quite a dense book that is diffucult to read straight through but great if you have specific questions. I also recommend picking up 501 Russian verbs if you are serious about improving your Russian."},{"rating":"2","title":"A work of history!","review":"This is a great book. A classic of history republished in English.The way Ussher weaves secular and biblical history together is fantastic. From an historical point of view the book is valuable. From a current perspective, it is a 'poke-in-the-eye' for long age indoctrinators. Whatever one thinks about the biblical timeline, this book is a worthy addition to one's library.

Puts history in a new light","review":"While I had heard of Ussher, I had never read The Annals of the World. What an eye-opener to early history! While I knew the history of the world, as found in the Bible; I really didn't have a clear understanding of what was going on with the rest of the world at that time.If you are a believer of G-d's Word, then the estimate of the first day of creation makes a lot of sense. As one who believes that G-d created everything that exists in six literal 24-hour days (morning and evening were a day), I also believe that the Earth is about 6,000 years old. That is what Ussher found when working back through history.This would have been a great aid back in high school. It makes history come alive, and answers a lot of questions that were never explained in school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Work...A Classic","review":"This is an excellent book that thoroughly proves that the Holy Bible is an historically accurate book! It makes reference to the uninspired apocryphal books (it was written by a Catholic archbishop), so use it with discretion. Since the Bible is this historically accurate, it would only seem to reason that it is equally reliable for doctrine, reproof, correction, and instruction in righteousness (2 Tim. 3:16-17)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still can't bring myself to like this book...","review":"I'll be the lone dissent...my son (who is now 9) received this as a (Catholic) Baptism gift. The illustrations are beautiful but the story/poem is extremely long and convoluted (and not really appropriate to a Catholic baptism). It's difficult to follow, starting by talking about the child and his naming day then going on to an agricultural lesson (the rain coming down and making seeds grow, the wind, a \\"flaming raining-bow\\")then to the church for the baptism. There are numerous mentions of washing things clean and bringing the dead to life. It is just not a children's book - none of my three have ever had much of an interest in it - we only still have it because it was a gift! I prefer to give as baptism gifts books such as Max Lucado's \\"Just In Case You Ever Wonder\\" or a child's board book with prayers (the ones with the little handles are fabulous for occupying a small child during Mass!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book too!","review":"Absolutley love this book.

There are better books on this topic for a few bucks more."},{"rating":"2","title":"How could you not love Oscar?","review":"Oscar de la Renta is a brilliant designer and throughout this large book his talent radiates off the page.

Hey, if you can't buy one of his dresses, mine as well own some pictures of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Problems","review":"I can't understand why other reviewers gave \\"The Siege\\" by Helen Dunmore such good ratings. I was very disappointed in this book. The first thing that really bug me was I don't think that Ms. Dunmore has ever been to Leningrad (now St. Petersburg). When I read a book I like to be able to picture myself right the middle of the action and with this book I just couldn't. The second that I didn't like was the fact that I couldn't connect with any of the characters. I believe that this is very important as a reader.Overall, \\"The Siege\\" is a bad book. If you are looking for a book set in the period read \\"The Bronze Horseman\\" it is 100 precent better than the \\"The Siege.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I read/taught in a long time. Waste of time.","review":"This book has got to be one of the worst books that I have read in my entire life and I am ashamed to have to teach it for the IGCSE. The problem of the organic intellectual in this book seems to have been completely ignored by most reviewers. The author has absolutely nothing to do with Leningrad, and thus, the entire account is based on speculation. Consequently, the novel sounds more like British propaganda than anything remotely authentic.Furthermore, the novel reads terribly, with adjectives inserted gratuitously for no apparent reason other that to mystify the reader and create awkward sentences. As a result, reading this novel is a painful experience, which my students will unfortunately have to share with me.I would like to add, that my girlfriend and my brother, all three of us Literature B.A.s from different universities, also found this novel to be a terrible read. Not only is it a waste of money but a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunning novel","review":"This is a fine work of historical fiction. The characterizations are alive; these could be living people, and their story is a heartbreaking one. The only complaint I have with the novel is the fact that it jumps from late December 1941, directly to May 1942 -- Uh, how did Anna, Andrei and Kolya survive during the other three & one-half months of winter? It was too abrupt a break in the flow of the work. Also, I personally thought the weakest part of the book was all that concerned Anna's romance with Andrei. I didn't feel the chemistry of the romance; I actually wanted more and more about how the family survived during the siege.Still, everything else about the book is SO powerful, (the characters of Anna's dead mother; her father and Maria Petrovna his mistress, in particular) I gladly give it four stars and recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good find","review":"Good jazz played by top of the line musicians.

Last week as the iron was heating there was a loud pop as sparks and smoke started flying from the back of the iron (on the cord where it meets the iron). It blew the fuse in the house and left black soot everywhere. Luckily I was there to unplug it. I called Rowenta customer service and was told that he fault was mine, but as a one time thing they would replace the cord on the iron. Why would I want that iron back?

However, after only two years of relatively light service, the thermostat failed and it would no longer heat up. As it was out of warranty, I paid $32 for a repair (about 1/3 the cost of the iron) and it was in the shop for about two weeks. Less than a year later, the same problem occurred. The warranty on the repair was only six months.I contacted Rowenta over what I considered to be a defective product. Customer service offered me a very piddling rebate toward purchase of a new Rowenta.Instead, I bought a Black and Decker D2030 at less than half the price and it performs at least as well.

Here we have a plot which is breathtakingly incomprehensible (and believe me, it still doesn't make any sense even after repeated viewings!), atrocious acting, and characters which are pure cardboard. Don't even get me started about the over-the-top music and the terrible special effects. Perhaps worse of all is this episode's focus on Ace's continuing \\"personal discovery\\", which is given great dramatic emphasis, but which has absolutely no payoff!

If you enjoy this album (or TotFM) I highly recommend trying out Radio Citizen's Berlin Serengeti."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you really like 'Tales of the Forgotten Melodies' chances are this disc will be a disappointment","review":"Listen to sound samples before buying! Compared to 'Tales of the Forgotten Melodies' this CD was a big let down. Gone are the collages of movie audio samples placed over dark soundscapes (although a few short 'filler' tracks reflect this style). 'Hope & Sorrow' focuses more on guest vocalist and rappers and most of the tracks fail to impress. This seems to be an attempt at more of a commercial 'dance' release than the well crafted Turntablism record that I was expecting. I 'hoped' this disc would be an excellent follow up to 'Tales of the Forgotten Melodies' but all I felt was 'sorrow' upon my first listen. A disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blues Stories From the Delta","review":"Super Chikan - Blues Come Home To RoostThe review by Bryan Newbury is dead on and I can't add too much. Though Super Chikan is a nephew of Big Jack Johnson, the guitar pickin is not really the focus of this music. What this CD is about is stories. Stories about life, people and circumstances. Stories you can understand and maybe even relate to (particularly if you have spent time in or lived in the southern US). That is what makes this so special - the songs take the front position over the instruments and they are excellent. Few contemporary blues musicians can paint pictures so simply and vividly with their music as Super Chikan and that makes this a stellar CD worthy of the 5 star rating. Very engaging blues with a delta spirit. Unusual and recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Here come the Waves","review":"This is such a cute movie. I love Bing Crosby. Betty Hutton did a great job.

But this book is a tedious, self-absorbed, page after page rehash of the same events, over and over and over again. I thought I would scream if I had to read another sentence about them there girls gettin' chopped up (I think there is one form or another of chopped on almost every page). This book properly edited would likely have contained under 200 pages, instead of over 500. As my English teacher from 7th grade used to say to the class, \\"Say it in one word instead of five.\\" Many of the sentences are absolutely painful to read, and unlike a Clifford Gertz sentence/paragraph/page, some really don't make much sense deconstructed.

She needed to get out of the way, stop telling us all about the \\"juniper scented air\\" (mentioned at least 20 times), and let the story tell itself...it is simply that compelling. So compelling, in fact, that it survived its poor telling to be a spectacular story, not a spectacular book. Perhaps it is so personal a tale that it would have been better off ghost written. Perhaps that is what the one negative reviewer was really trying to convey."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read ! Strange Piece of Paradise - A return to the American west to Investigate my attempted murder","review":"The book is a compelling memoir /true crime detective story. Some reviews said it was too long but the excellent writing and character descriptions make it interesting all the way through.

It is too long by half -- it's a bad sign when readers (such as this one) are eager for a book to end, instead of hoping it never does. It is filled with cliche, bathos, and endless repetition.What happened to Jentz is horrible, and she's to be commended for surviving and, now, thriving, in whatever way worked for her. She's to be commended for recognizing and naming her attack as, essentially, a (misogynist) hate crime.Sadly, that doesn't make the book worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I couldn't believe how poorly edited this should-have-been-gripping book was. It SHOULD have been like Truman Capote...except all the more powerful, as it wasn't written by an outside observer, as Capote was. Who was Jentz's editor? This book went on an on and repeated itself endlessly....draining the immediacy of what had clearly had the potential of being a riveting story. As Jentz interviews countless people who all draw similar conclusions, not to mention the hundreds of mentions of the ponderosas...ZZZZzzzz.Sadly, a real disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange Piece of Paradise","review":"A shocking true story that puts an auxillary flash on the western american psyche and the institutions it created. This book is not merely a \\"true crime crama\\". It is an investigation that brings to light the real effects that violent crimes have on the victims lives when they survive. While it may seem repititious and seemingly full of minutae that is what a victim is stuck with, like it or not, and that is exactly what police reports and the criminal justice system are stuck with as well.This book raises important questions and gives the reader an uncomfortable center seat in the victims ride. Thankfully Jentz is a woman of character and courage and helps us raise above lament into a keener perception of the raw western United States and it's institutions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleuthing out the real names","review":"I enjoyed the book immensely.

I may be the only one who wanted to know but you can find it by searching forTerri's last name and the detective's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long and Winding Road","review":"I thought the strength of the book was the writing. Jentz really knows how to grab her reader and take him/her on the wild ride that is her life. I was immersed in the land of Oregon and all its strange/wonderful/crazy characters. In her youth, Jentz went on a quest to see America and sadly she saw the worst of it. When she revisits the crime scene years later she's able to comprehend more fully the narrative of the west and how she fits into this narrative. The only thing missing was a little more of Jentz' present life - how did this affect her relationship with her parents? I noticed she dedicated the book to her partner, Donna and wondered how the crime affected Jentz' relationship with men, women, etc. Overall, a compelling, terrifying and important read."},{"rating":"1","title":"to the bitter end","review":"This narrative annoyed me so much that I read it to the bitter (and far too long-delayed) end out of pure spite. Pure spite seems to be the emotion fueling the writing, too. Hmmm. This author is so grotesquely self-absorbed that she takes it as a personal affront that the people who live in the small town in Oregon near where she was assaulted have been thinking of other things over the past quarter-century. Her dogged persecution of the companion who was hurt much more gravely but seems to have moved beyond that trauma much more successfuly... sheesh.

I am really disturbed that other parents find this suitable to read to their children. Be prepared to be woken up at night when your child has nightmares. I actually took the liberty to rephrase and omit large chunks of the stories before I made the book \\"scarce.\\" These stories should have really been toned down for this age group or come with a large red sticker emblazened on the cover that says \\"NOT for young children.\\" This book should be marketed to a much older reader, if that.

That doesn't sound like a lot of time but I was 13 when that came out. At age 20, I'm a different person and so are Linkin Park, for the better.

Being different or maturing does not mean mindlessly throwing everything out the window. There is not one song on this album that resembles the LP style. No rock-rap mix, no Mr Hahn and no vigor.To have listeners wait years for this album and then to come out with this is just inexcusable. Does LP even care about its fans? Or do they care about enjoying themselves more by playing around and being 'different' to entertain themselves?Or is it that band just got complacent? Too much touring, too many side projects like Mike Shinoda's Fort Minor, and not enough put into this album. They say that they wrote over a hundred songs - is that an attempt out of guilt to cover up the lack of time spent on this album? It is as if Mike Shinoda had entered the studio in the last minute from his side projects and that Joe Hahn had nothing to do with this album.Well done LP, you have just lost most of your fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wuss rock to a new level!","review":"I'm a BIG fan of hybrid theory, one of my all time favorite cds the songs never get old. When I first heard What I've Done on Myspace I thought okay this new album sounds great. So I marked my calendar for today and went and picked it up. After listening to the whole cd the only real LP song is What Ive done, I felt robbed. They released that song to give you a flavor for that album but the after-taste wont wash out now. After listening to that CD I had to pop in some heavy metal to get it out of my head. This CD is boring, uninspired and lame. I'm sure all the girlies will love it but not us metal-heads. Maybe I'll listen to it if I can't get to sleep otherwise it'll be collecting dust. STAY AWAY FROM THIS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it a chance","review":"I don't know why this album is getting bashed so much. Yes, the sound is different, but that's good because the guys aren't repeating themselves with every album. The band even warned listeners that this was very different and might surprise some. There are still a few traditional heavy songs and a little rapping. (Watch out for the F word.) The lyrics are deeper, and there's a good variety of song styles. Like some others have said -- let it grow on you. I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible album... what happened?","review":"I heard Bleed It Out on the radio, thought it sounded like Linkin Park did in earlier albums. That was the only good song on the album. The rest was junk, far too much politics. Linkin Park - stay with what you're good at, politics isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst LP cd","review":"I am a huge fan of Linkin Park, and i was vastly dissapointed in the album as the sound was not LP worthy. I recognized maybe 2 songs that sounded like them, the rest seemed like political crap that I personally don't care about. I wouldn't recommend it and hope they get back to their sound on the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minutes to Midnight - yeah its a disastor alright!","review":"I am a huge Linkin Park fan, I nearly cried when I first heard this release. It was terrible! Worse than terrible. After I hand listened it I turned to my boyfriend and said \\"The alternative music market must be too easy for them because this is soft rock - they sound like fricken U2!\\". I got the making of with the CD and thats pretty much what they said, they were branching out to reach a wider audience. Well I hope they realize they are alienating their existing fans.If you are into pop and soft (soft, soft, soft) rock... this is for you, if you are a fan of the Linkin Park sound... this is a waste of money because its simply not there."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"This cd is so lame compared to their older music. I'm probably going to delete it from the computer. Not recommended at all, unless you like hardcore people singing boring music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expanding Your Horizons","review":"Throughout the life of a band, record companies often discourage bands from changing formulas (for abject failures see Coke and New Coke circa 1985). Thankfully, with the addition of Rick Rubin, Linkin Park has expanded into new territory with great success. The country ho-down-esque \\"Bleed it Out\\", the first single \\"What I've Done\\", \\"Shadow of the Day\\", and \\"Little Pieces\\" are the album's highlights.If you were not a fan of Linkin Park's past efforts, \\"Minutes to Midnight\\" will change your mind regarding the band's depth, range, and musical abilities. It's a must have for any rock music fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke","review":"I love Linkin Park's other albums, but this one sucked. Linkin Park has been known to have pretty clean lyrics, but on this album they say the F-word several times. I was very disappointed, and now I can't listen to this album around my wife or any children. As far as the music is concerned, there is probably only 1 good song on the whole album."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Stars for 2 good stars","review":"Extreme disappointment in this one. Huge fan of Linkin Park's previous work. More than 50% of this CD are ballads. The only two good songs are Given Up and Bleed it Out. They even dive into the political cliche with another anti-War song (Hands Held High) bashing who else, but our president. If you are going to go there you better come with Green Day quality, otherwise you are the Dixie Chicks. Do not waste your time on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album since U2","review":"OK, I'm a European mother, but finally here's a CD I can listen to with my kids! I think this is the best CD I have heard so far from LP, finally some message is back into rock and roll. WHAT'S WRONG ABOUT THAT, by the way? That's at the root of rock and roll. And each song has its own distinctive sound. I appreciate the diversity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD","review":"I bought this CD for my 15 year-old son and this is what he had to say about it: \\"I like most of the songs, but there were a few that were different from what I was expecting. They were a different writing style than normal.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah its different but still good.","review":"Ok first off, if your a Nu-metal junky than you will not like this album period. They experimented alot in this album and most of the songs are pretty soft. Theres about 3 heavy-ish songs. This album is very different from LP's first album. Theres very little rock-rap if any. Its mostly Chester singing and Mike only does 2 songs. If your expecting the old LP than you'll be disappointed but if you come in with an open mind and welcome the change than you'll enjoy it. I think Meteora showed that LP was progressively getting softer so this isn't really a surprise to me. Every song on this album is unique which is nice because a lot of their older work sounded similar to eachother. I was disappointed with a couple of the songs on this ablum but I enjoyed almost every song. Like I said, If you come in with an open-mind than you will enjoy this album. If your expecting the old LP than you will disappointed. Simple as that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed afters years of waiting.......","review":"Until now, I would have always given LP the benefit of the doubt....WOW, I had to struggle to find a couple of decent tunes. Sad to think this took three times as long to write/produce as their previous. Perhaps if they wrote with their gut and natural instinct, possibly they \\"overthink\\" on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waited for this? Ugh..","review":"Start out by saying I'm a big Linkin Park fan. Hybrid Theory was amazing. Reanimation was cool. Meteora good. Hell even the mash-up with Jay-Z was good. Then this. What happened? The whole idea is the combination of rap & rock, and on this CD there isn't a single song that includes both... It's like they trade off songs... Also, as if slowing and quieting all the songs down wasn't enough of a deviation from prior albums they decide they need to venture into politics and rip the President in consecutive songs... Is there really any value in a song that refers to Bush as stuttering and mumbling... he'll be out of office soon, who will want to listen back on this and think, yeah, he's right....Best song on the CD is the single, What I've Done. No surprise there. The live version of What I've Done sounds the exact same as the studio one... All in all the CD did not meet my expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"A NEW GROWN UP LINKIN PARK","review":"For those of you who are out there whining because this disk is too mellow........ MELLOW OUT. These guys did.After all they're not teenagers anymore. Superb music and in an oddity two of the best tracks actually hit the air. What I've Done and Shadow of the Day are fine, fine music. Mellower [is that a word?], yes. Fine? YES.Take time to enjoy a band seeking and finding maturity in their writing and playing. Linkin Park has done just that"},{"rating":"1","title":"The singles tell what Linkin Park doesn't want you to know.","review":"Linkin Park has said this is their new sound. Nobody denies this album sounds waaay different than their previous genre defining efforts. Apologists for the album claim that the new sound is better, more mature, that we should embrace it. If that's true, then explain to me why the two singles chosen to be released, What I've Done and Bleed It Out, are the only two songs on the album that sound anything remotely like Linkin Park's \\"old\\" sound, right down to Chester screaming and Mike rapping.If the new sound isn't a bust, why are they trying to hide it behind these two songs?This album is to Linkin Park what Slang was to Def Leppard. Want to bet that just like Def Leppard, after all the public talk about how happy they are with their new sound, the band runs back to the \\"less mature\\" \\"old\\" sound on the next album? Def Leppard never recovered from claiming to have outgrown the fans of the sound that made them, will Linkin Park?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love LP, but this ISN'T LP!!!","review":"What are these guys doing? What is Chester thinking? I want to hear Chester screaming and not singing emo like the black Spiderman. Only ~3-4 songs on this CD rock, but they're still more like B-sides for what this band is capable of. VERY disappointing CD from these guys as everyone else is saying as well. I just hope they get back on the sound that everybody likes about them. Definitely don't buy the CD... You've been warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Minutes to Bargain Basement","review":"I think the problem is THIS IS NOT WHAT WE EXPECTED. LP has been unique and hasn't really sounded like anyone else in the past. Now, at least in this venture--they sound LIKE OTHER BANDS (i.e. Green Day, Fall Out Boy).I guess they wanted to prove they can play instuments; and not relying on synchronized beats and hip-hop rhythms as much which predominantly commanded past tunes. I tried to listen to this CD 3 times; and I get the same feeling......not good at all; WHAT I'VE DONE, and nothing else will be remembered on this one.Bleed IT out---sounds like some 80's High School Cheer. Will the real LP please stand up, because you have Fans who are STILL WAITING FOR THE NEW LP ALBUM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Continuity Album : maturing album","review":"i would say looking at my previous collection of Linkin, i am somewhat a fan. However i lost touch with them till this album came around. I must say these guys have matured up as artist over the years. This era of an album reminds me so much of U2's Joshua tree from the 80's. It has heart and you feel there is good continuity between all tracks! Not to mention several of their tracks got picked up by movie scores. I think they will continue to grow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"There would be some respect had they gone and done something unique instead of ripping other artists off. I'll stick with HT and Meteora."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Linkin Park, but....","review":"No one is a bigger Linkin Park fan then me and Chester's mom, but why did they have to start cussing on here?? Some good tunes are ruined by the use of nuaghty cuzz words, I hate that!! Korn, Fall Out Boy and My Chemical Romance never have to cuzz to get their points across. Oh well, next time guys, keep the lyrics clean to go with your wonderful music you give us. I do love the cover, they get 1 star for the album cover, but 4 taken away for the cussing!! Go Bengals!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well Atleast They Had 2 Good Albums","review":"What the F**K is this CR*P!? I have yet to make it through the whole album and I doubt I ever will!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"Instead of giving this CD 1 star I think I would like to change my review to 4 letters.... C R A P"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS CD SUCKS! LINKIN PARK TRIES TO BE ANOTHER ROCK BAND NOT LINKIN PARK","review":"This is a good cd...had it been a new band coming out that wasnt Linkin Park. Linkin Park has built its name on the fusion of synthesizing great beats and rhythms along with hard rock & rap. As a former die hard fan their music was classic even before it was classic...if you know what I mean.However because they chose to become beyond commercial with their latest \\"regular\\" rock music I give this CD TEN THUMBS DOWN because the general consesus agrees with me: THIS CD SUCKS! (read more reviews) If your a linkin park member reading reviews on AMAZON know that you dissappointed your fans. Stick to what your good at and dont be another rock band, they are a dime a dozen...which is about what I should have paid for this lame cd.Here is some advice: dont think that you cant lose your fan base because your linkin park. Your name means nothing if your music isnt what we expect and want. Supply and Demand!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Here we go again................","review":"Anybody remember when bands just played music and were happy with that? What happen to the days of picking up an album and listening to great timeless songs about nothing? Now, all we get from bands that think way to much of themselves is whine whine whine. I wish all of these whiny bands would make 2 versions of their albums; One with whine and one without. By the way, when I say \\"nothing\\" I mean no political agenda, no \\"cause\\" to rant about just great music. LP is an awesome and talented band but I don't buy albums to hear someone else's opinion of something. And, LP is way to talented to have to drop the \\"F\\" bomb to try and please a group that called them \\"emo\\" anyway. I know I know, if you don't like the album don't buy it........... Hmmmm, I'll remember that..........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely Worth It","review":"Die hard linkin park fans (most anyway) are going to ignore how terrible this album really is. I've always like linkin park music, hybrid theory was good and meteorea to. It is good to experiment with your musical style, look at nine inch nails with the hit Year Zero. Yet, a lot of the mixing and sounds on the album are just plain stupid. There are some reasons to like this album. Given Up is a good track, and honestly What I've Done is a nice alternative rock song. The \\"classic rock, hip-hop\\" feel is not here at all though. The songs Bleed It Out and Hands Held High are two of the most ridiculous songs the band as even thought up. They had a good thing going with Qwerty if they had built an album around that."},{"rating":"1","title":"I miss Linkin Park sound!!!!","review":"Hi I'am a super huge fan of linkin park I have all their cd's. And was expecting like all of you to get a listen of linkin park new cd. I heard What I've done and I thought: hey is not bad. But once I got a hold on the cd I was in total shock!!It completely lack of the formula that made Linkin park to grow in to be the most sucessful band in the world!I don't know what they were thinking, I keep on looking in the near future so they can realize the big mistake they have made and fix it.Overall, there are just like one or two songs with the sound of the first cd's of the band!Not recommend buying unless you want to have all the cd's."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a mess!","review":"Linkin Park went from good to great with their release of their second album Meteora. This album has traces of Meteora - yet it is seeded with this totally downbeat slow tempo songs and Nickleback type of rock sound.I say there are about 4 songs that are good Linkin Park. The album feels totally incomplete, as if they did not have enough time or desire to make a couple of more good songs. I say; 4 more good songs along with an intro/outro would make this album a 10 song hit. Oh-well... $12 in my pocket.BTW: 'In between' - I don't consider that a song. The dude just talks you through the song. It is not singing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Linkin Park is the best","review":"Although this CD is different from the usual sound, this is still a great CD. I've listened to it almost everyday since I got it. The first three songs are the best but the rest of the CD is great also. Anyone who likes LP should definitely buy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different","review":"Very different from past Linkin Parks...I dont like there swearing on this cd. It was nice on there past ones not to worry about playing in front of the kids. The song Hands Held High really stands out. I dont agree or like there knocking the Presidnet but it is a good song."},{"rating":"1","title":"LP is gone and this album sucks.","review":"Ok, so they wanted to change... Too bad because their talent is in what they were doing.This album is horrible. There is NOTHING to catch you and make you want to come back. The melodies suck, there is no more rap or hard core anything. Its like the Back Street Boys with occassional screaming and a few gratuitous F-bombs to disguise the fact that it sucks.Too bad fellas. I was looking forward to more of your skill. Wish it would have stuck around. Not only that, but my boys are big fans and can't listen to the album. Why? Because you need to express yourselves with the F-word for some reason. Lame. That isn't growing up guys, its copping out.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE. YOU CAN HAVE MINE."},{"rating":"1","title":"This new direction makes no sense...","review":"Hybrid Theory, although short, was simply brilliant. Meteora try to recapture that magic and was quite good overall. This new release, Minutes to Midnight, just doesn't make any sense.When legendary producer, Rick Rubin, came on board I figured that he would take them to new heights. Longer, more complex tunes, and maybe a bridge or a solo here and there. But this was not to be. Balllads, ballads, and for something different.... we get MORE BALLADS.Each song on its own is listenable, I guess. Overall this highly-polished mellow fest is NOT what we want to hear from LP. I'm sure that over the next five years well have to endure a few remix, mash-up versions of this CD, and maybe they'll get their act together when their new one hits in 2019."},{"rating":"1","title":"They're Gonna Lose Lots of Fans With This One","review":"I was ecstatic that they were having a new album, but I'm not only disappointed in it, I'm annoyed. Not only is the album worse than their previous ones, but the CD sucks in itself.It's not something I can listen to again, except for about 4 tracks. Most of the songs are much slower (but not in that good 'My December' way) and do not have that rhytmical rock quality that I so loved. They need faster guitar melodys and way more drums. Better luck next time, I hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative","review":"I do like Linkin Park, but this album is something completely different from their original stuff. It has more of a softer side to it that just doesn't seem to flow together. Where they were going with this I have no idea. Im sure there are a few people that will like it, but the majority will be very disappointed. I believe what happened here was they rushed to put an album together b/c Mike Shinoda broke off from Linkin Park to go with Fort Minor. Plus I think they tried to do something a little different here, other then their NU Metal sound the had originally. Don't get me wrong there are a couple of tracks I do enjoy, but those tracks were quite a bit like there old stuff. I suggest you listen to the cd before you buy it, cuz it just might be a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed LP Fan","review":"I can't believe I have been waiting 4 years for this garbage. Linkin Park sounds like a completely different band on Minutes to Midnight. There are only 2-3 good songs and even those can't hold a candle to the worst songs on their previous albums. If you want to hear some songs that sound like the old LP, sign up for the LP Underground. The LPU membership comes with a CD that contains a few tracks that didn't make it onto the album. QWERTY, a great song that was supposed to be part of the album, made it onto the LPU v6 CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rage Against the Machine v2.0?","review":"I've loved Linkin park for 6 years now, and still have the first 2 cd's on my playlists after all this time... but this cd is completely different.First of all, like others have said, those tracks like \\"in the End\\" and \\"Faint\\" don't really exist in this cd, sadly.Second, the lyrics are crap. It's a lot of political, anti-war, anti-bush nonsense. I hate wars and Bush as much as the next guy my age, but I don't want to hear it in music. I much preferred the angst ridden, depressing, and self realization lyrics of the prior cd's.Third, wtf?So yeah, I like about 4 songs on it, so far. However, like The Open Door, I'll probably adjust after listening to it more and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Cd Just Diffrent","review":"First Off I keep hearing people saying that the cussing in this album makes it suck and I gotta say thats stupid as hell to belive since they only say f*** and barely at all the most is in Given Up. You live the exact same place as everyone else so get over the few cusswords, other than that this album shows a diffrent side of linkin park couple songs still got that original lp sound but then its also added new items which unlike most people keep saying dosent make it suck just goes to show you they can pull off more than the every day kinda of music your used to. To sum up this album for someone looking to buy it if you are a little kid you might wanna stay away but for anyone who has any sense of maturity its a good album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad new sound","review":"How do you say someones latest effort really stinks politely? Like most of you I was an avid fan of Linkin Park. Played thier CD\`s so much I had to buy them over and over again because I\`d wear out the CD. This latest Cd from linkin park is as good as trash to me. Why change the sound of the music when everyone LOVED the sound they already had? I understand the band wanted to change the way they expressed themselves through thier music. Ok. Instead of just changing a little bit of thier sound and lyrics, they changed the ENTIRE sound, lyrics, mood, vibe, passion, all that we all came to adore and enjoy about Linkin Park. With this \\" Minutes to Midnight \\" CD, I have to say I\`m strongly disappointed and if they dont go back to being the band we all could jam and have a good time listening to, then Linkin Park is in for a rude awakening."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's pretty good.","review":"This cd isn't as bad as I initially thought it was. When I first popped it in my car cd player, I was like what the heck is this? This isn't normal linkin park!!! The problem with everyone is though, this isn't normal linkin park. It's been said that they were experimenting with a new kind of beat....and this is it! I will have to say though, I'm a die-hard linkin park fan...ever since the first cd came out when I was 14/15 years old (I'm 23 now). So I'll definitely end with this...give this cd a chance and it should definitely grow on you, because it grew on me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely listenable....","review":"A few decent tracks, but a vast departure from the Linkin Park of old. Instead of taking the well mastered synthesized overtones from their prior albums which were everpresent throughout each song, they seem to utilize more naturally occuring sounds as the base of their music.Which makes it just sound horrible. For the most part, the album is soft.....too soft. The lack of their mastered sound makes the music all but mainstream rock. Then to mix in the politics.....Like I said, a few decent tracks. The album for some reason feels more like a \\"prequel\\" CD....something that should have come before Hybrid Theory. Sadly, as with most third albums, groups tend to try new avenues which either do extremely well as the band has matured along with it's audience....or it flops. I feel in this case, it is the latter."},{"rating":"1","title":"REALLY NOT A GOOD ONE....","review":"After 2 really good albuns, HYBRID THEORY and METEORA, Linkin Park really turns me off of their sound with minutes to midnight...besides WHAT I'VE DONE and GIVEN UP, i don't really like any other song...they COMPLETELLY changed their metal rap sound for some emo without attitude or inspiration....Really not a good one...stick with the first 2 LP albuns..."},{"rating":"1","title":"LP What happened?","review":"Alright so I heard Bleed it out on the radio and was enticed to want to get this album in some way shape or form. After I got it I was so bummed out. I am seeing a whole Limp Bizkit fiasco again. They gave us hard rock to start out with and some rap... now its all poppy and makes me wanna vomit. If you like their slow songs then this cd is for you, but if your a hard rocker then stay away... horrible"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Hands Held High? Dear God, what has Linkin Park been doing since Meteora? My wife's a huge fan of LP, and even she said WTF when she heard this song. Where is Mr. Hahn? He's sorely missed on this effort; though he participated, it's in a very minor way.Lyrically, this effort pales in comparison to other LP efforts. The lyrics here are so, well, lame:\\"You will pay for what you've done.\\"Hell, I've penned better than that.And the bar chords on \\"No More Sorrow\\" are just embarrassing.In a nutshell, I'm exceptionally disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I ran out and bought this one when it came out and because I loved the old Linkin Park I gave this cd a try ... a few actually. There is nothing at all thats stands out, nothing that catches you like they used to. If you are a fan of the their older albums don't disappoint yourself by buying this one. They sold out and lost that originality that made them so awesome.Also the political statments run rampant on this cd (seems like a trend lately).

What happened to LP? Every song on this album is worse than the worst song on either of their first albums. I am very disappointed and if I could return the CD I would. What happened to the heavy instrumentals? What happened to the lyricism? What happened to the electronic influences? Minutes to Midnight is worse than bad, it's BORING."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least it made me laugh","review":"This CD is lowest-common denominator turd, and definitely not up to par with Meteora or Hybrid Theory. Linkin Park is trying to be \\"cool\\" by cussing in a couple of songs, but it just makes them seem more pathetic. The rapping, which was one of Linkin Park's best attributes, is almost absent on this CD, and it seems they have just become another emo band. It does get one star for making me laugh once (the lyrics to Valentine's Day made me howl so hard I almost fell off my chair: I never knew what it was like / to be alone on a Valentine's Day,). Seriously, quit whining Chester, nobody cares; quit writing emo music and grow up.The worst album of 2007 thus far."},{"rating":"1","title":"I respect them for trying something new...But this album isn't LP","review":"I respect them for moving on and trying something new. When I had first heard they were going to do that I was excited. I loved LP for thier heavy guitar rifts and they way they conveyed thier lyrics in a extreme manor.However this album is just not what I expected at all. It just didn't do it for me. It's way to slow. It's not that I don't like it, It's just not the same LP \\"AT ALL\\". They went from one end of the spectrum to the other in too drastic of a time period. They needed to cut a record that had both thier styles on it beforee this one so you kind of new where they were headed before this one came out. It's like they were hard one day and emo the next. Also, what's with the swearing? I swear tons so it's not that It burns my ears. It's my kids! I didn't mind them listening to LP at all. I didn't have to sensor thier music. I pretty disapointed as far as that goes. Anyway to sum it all up...\\"To much change, To drastically\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Linkin Park That I'm Used To","review":"If you liked their latest music video, then this album should apply to you.

Definitely not the hard hitting rythm and lyrics that earlier albums offered."},{"rating":"1","title":"I LOVED LP'S OTHER CD'S, BUT THIS ONE FLAT OUT SUCKS!!!!","review":"I never buy cds, I always download them, but Linkin Park is an exception.

I wouldn't have even known this was Linkin Park if I heard it on the radio (besides What I've Done). Trust me! Download a few of their songs and I'm sure you will change your mind about buying their cd.

An album not to be missed","review":"This album is a definite change in the sound that made Linkin Park one of my favorite bans. But don't take the change as a negative! Yes, as a whole, their are more soft and ballad like titles, but thats cool though. Leave Out All the Rest demonstrates how much a band can change. Rick Rubin did a good job of helping Linkin Park to develope such an awesome sound. Although tracks like Bleed it Out and No More Sorrow are what most fans were expecting, the other tracks have strong messages that are uplifting, which is what i like about bands Linkin Park. I pop this album in, turn to Shadow of the Day, and i feel like things will be cool no matter what. I like the change and i hope that Linkin Park continues to develop new sounds. If you can't except the new sound, you aren't a real fan. PERIOD!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!","review":"This album blows! It totally failed any expecatations I had about this much anticipated album. It's full of touchy feely ballads. not one song got my adreneline going.

I hope this is a wake up call for Linkin Park to produce a better album next time if there is a next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the amazing band you were?","review":"Linkin Park. Hybrid Theory changed my life, it absolutely CHANGED my life, it made me want to listen to rock, metal, death metal, and everything I listen to today, your earlier albums HT and Meteora helped me discover everything I love about music and I became a musician myself as a result.I waited YEARS for you to put out a new album, I waited and waited for every drop of news I could possibly find. Then that day finally came when Minutes To Midnight was finally released.. it turned out to be the worst day of my life. I destroyed your cd within an hour of purchasing it and I'll never look back on it. This album is emo/pop mainstream garbage and I'll have none of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Un cambio de actitud","review":"Linkin park para no dejarse ver como una banda de Nu Metal o como quieran decirle, cambiaron un poco las l��ricas dram��ticas y se pusieron un poco mas serios, para los que tenemos tiempo escuchandolos nos parecio que no daban la talla pero en si no es un mal alb��m sino que no esperabamos eso de ellos."},{"rating":"2","title":"for real","review":"i have always loved Lincoln Park just the way they were so when i heard that they were comming out with a CD and it had a \\"new sound\\" i was not very happy but i was very surprised how much i liked the music. i really love the sond Bleed it Out but i guess i have a very wide music range so i still love them."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the Hell Linkin Park","review":"I am a huge Linkin Park fan. I practically memorized their old cds i like them that much, which is why Minutes to Midnight is such a disappointment. Gone is the hard rocking-rock/rap that I loved and what made them famous and in its place is a cd of poorly done balads. Chester & Mike DONT SHARE ANY TRACKS. No tracks with an awesome rap beat mixed with a hardcore rock song, its not there at all, its really terrible. This cd is so terrible that after listening to it once I may never listen to it again and just hope that they come out with something better in a couple years. Then again they could put out an album of dogs barking to a rock/rap beat and it would be better then this piece of garbage. I never write reviews for music but I felt obligated for this one. If you are a Linkin Park fan, DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM. Just pretend that they never put out a new album and wait patiently for them to come to their senses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jeez","review":"I want to say first that I love Linkin Park and every CD they have put out to this point. This CD however is the worst. To be perfectly honest after listening to the CD it sounded as if Avril Lavigne wrote their lyrics and Good Charlotte wrote their beats.I mean honestly, how do you go from collaborating with Jay-Z to this? Also I'm sorry, but the song Hands Held High is trite. I'm all for speaking out but this smacks of bandwagon jumping.Just my 3 cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"End of Linkin Park","review":"When I first saw that Linkin Park had a new album, I was psyched to get the copy. I bought it at a Target (which only sold it coupled with one of their books) for over $20!! I played it about 3 times and can honestly say if you like the traditional Linkin Park, then you may find 1-2 songs worth while. Other than that, it was like listening to a band that once ruled the metal world for 25 years and now they wanted to do a \\"personal\\" album. However, these guys have not been around long enough to claim this type of work. If I could return used CDs, I would have. Not a good buy, save your money for a 1995 Led Zeppelin album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way off Par","review":"I purchased this album months ago and waited a while to give it a chance. I do agree that it is important for a band to branch out try new things and open up new doors, what LP does here is branch out too far. In doing so they lost what originally attracted so many"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow. This is really not what I expected.","review":"It's like they took everything about what made Linkin Park cool and fresh and new and made it old and annoying. Sappy, boring ballads, overcooked Shinoda raps, I could go on for a while on this one. What a disappointment. Last song is kinda cool, so 2 stars. I could've heard Sting sing it with better results. Go back to the formula that works (Hybrid Theory, Meteora). How many years did I wait for this? Humbug. Want a true masterpiece? NIN-Year Zero FTW."},{"rating":"1","title":"Casual fan - this doesn't do it for me","review":"Having listened to LP for their first two CDs as well as the Reanimation disc, I can say for a fact that this album is a letdown for anyone expecting the same Linkin Park. Every band's sound evolves and changes over time, but this is lacking to the Nth degree.The same song structure is used all too often, as was the case throughtout the first two CDs. The problem here is that the music just isn't as hard as it used to be. This would be fine if the lyrics could move it forward, but the lyrics are mostly weak, uninspired, and can't do the job of driving the music at all. Chester takes most of the vocals, which is fine, but Mike is underused as a result. It really sounds like they're trying to throw stuff at a wall to see what sticks...If you're a die-hard, you might like it more. But for someone like me who listens to the band only every now and then, its farewell Linkin Park."},{"rating":"2","title":"LangGaDang","review":"i thought this cd sounded pretty cool, i like it when bands try something different, when you listen to this cd it sounds like a whole new band"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes Change Isn't Good!","review":"I'm not going to labor you with details of the \\"reformed LP\\" more like the \\"deformed LP\\" since others seemed have done that here. LOL. LP is still good. Maturity does result in change... Yeah, some songs sorta of the flav of the classic LP, thank God for memories. 2 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Like others have said before me, I loved Meteora and Hybrid Theory. Those Albums were good times and this album is just... meh.It doesn't compare to their great albums before it.It's even a little, dare i say, boring?I just hope that Linkin Park learns from this and makes the awesome CD that we can all feel coming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not \\"traditional\\" Linkin Park, but good...","review":"This is a very different sounding Linkin Park than the first two albums. It took me a few spins listening to the disc, but now I actually like it...a lot. There isn't too much Mike S found on this disc, and where he does appear I'm not so sure it sounds very good. This whole disc is very very slow. Missing is the hard rock....still a good disc in my opinion though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has anyone seen LP?","review":"Some of the rough edges of the first 2 albums were covered by an emotion that represented real expression. This album lacks both. Essentially, they have released a compilation of emotionless, \\"power\\" ballads. The angst has been replaced by the awkard insertion of cursing and prolonged single scream in each song. If I wanted to hear Sublime, I'd buy their album."},{"rating":"1","title":"They released the B-Sides album first","review":"I'm not a Nu-metal junkie. LP is the only Nu-metal band I own CD's of. I love HT and Meteora, they're great to workout to and have strong driving music. This album sounds like a CW television series soundtrack. Don't buy this POS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"change is good but this just sucks","review":"seriously.i say to all bands out thereif you want to write music about how you feel and want it heardwrite a ********* solo albumdont ruin the band youre withi have few words to say for this albumyes change is goodbut this is just horriblei couldnt get though 3 songswithout wanting to throw it out the windowdo new but mix oldit worksand i hope to god they dont tour this album"},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"Horrible is about the only word for this album. I heard they had over 100 songs to choose for this cd, and these are what they chose? It felt like I was back in the 80's for a few songs, clapping in the background and everything...rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"INCREIBLEMENTE malo!!!!!!","review":"Es un incre��ble que una banda que vendi�� millones de copias de sus dos primeros albumes, saque al mercado un cd tan malo. Si eres un fan��tico de Linkin Park, no lo compres porque ten la seguridad que te defraudar��s!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sorry for growing!!!","review":"I just want to say that this album is great. I agree that it's not Meteorea, but who wants to hear the same thing over & over again. Naysayers, you have to remember, Linkin Park are no longer a teenager Nu-Metal band. Linkin Park have grown into one of the most unique, multi-influenced bands of the last ten years. If you really listen to Meteorea, it's direction leads to this album, in my opinion, perfectly. Fans of Nu-Metal, grow up. Fans of great music, do yourself a favor & buy this album!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ballad Park???","review":"When the single(What I've Done) was released I was hoping it was one of the softer songs on the album... Wrong! There is only one or two songs on the album that are harder/heavier. Most of the other songs are ballad-like.The album has a U2 feel to it, which is not a bad thing. However, as everyone else is saying, it is not the Linkin Park sound that...well...makes Linkin Park who they are. Perhaps they are trying to redefine themselves.It is just not the sound that Linkin Park fans have come to expect from Linkin Park. Very little of the heavy screaming, heavy guitar munging, and angry rap."},{"rating":"1","title":"EMO","review":"If you were wondering how their new music would sound, what genre they were going to get placed into now that they decided to go another way, then the best I can come up with is that they have joined the emo mainstream. Listening to their new music wants me to slit my wrists, its so panzyish that all i visualise during the songs is a blooming field of pink tulips with all band members groping eachother. Very soft songs, very sappy lyrics, a mix between new kids on the block and jimmy eat world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummm...","review":"When did Linkin Park add 2 members and become EMO? There is only one word to describe this album which has 2 good songs: AWFUL"},{"rating":"1","title":"sell out","review":"this album is sad. it is far from the rockin' Hybrid Theory. i am very disappointed that i have wasted my money on this one! they really need to pick up the pace. i don't want ballads from these guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Album Of 2007 So Far","review":"When I First Heard That Rick Ruben Was Behind This CD I Got Really Excited, With All His Work With Slipknot, Jay-Z, And Countless Other Bands I Though This Would Have Been Old School Rockin LP But No. They Change There Style For The Worst, When Some Bands Change Style It Can Be Refreshing And A Good Thing But Not With These Guys. This Is One Of The Biggest Flops I Have Ever Heard, The Days Of Headbanging And Mosh Pits Are Over Traded In For Slow Garbage. It Is Not Even Worth Time To Sample It, Find Some Sucker That Has It And Laugh At Him For Making Such A Bad Mistake Like I Did. When They Go On Tour This Summer You Will Not Hear One Song Off This CD, Maybe The Single Because That Is The Hardest Song On Here. I Feel Your Pain Die Hard LP Fans, Let Hope They Never Repeat This Sound, EVER."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is being generous.","review":"They never made a CD that was good from start to finish, but, they do have 7 songs that totally rock the house. This new CD makes a person want to vomit. The only person this could appeal to is someone who knows nothing about talent and/or music and was given this thing as a gift.If someone gave this to me, I would throw it away. Not even one song is worth puting on the MP3 player. What Happened?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do artist's change what they do best?","review":"Linkin Park should've stayed with their original sound. This album is background music at best. Very disappointing. As fans, we should figure out what we have to do to make them really mad and return to what they do best...be angry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Down","review":"At first listen i didnt like the album and then as i listened more i liked it even less.I expected much more from a band that has been nothing less of excellence and creativity.This album lacks both.I can see why some 14-18 year olds might like this album but as a 28 year old ive learn to expect more.the songs are simple and nothing to pull you into thembasically i cant beleive its linkin park"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was a proud Linkin Park fan","review":"What a sad day for linkin park. I have to admit that these guys were over played badly on the radio and i had to take a break but never did I stop saying that they were great at what they did and did it like no other. I have to say after listening to this cd I nearly cried because it's so disappointing. I thought to myself... and this is Linkin Park sounding washed up."},{"rating":"2","title":"You have to differenciate different from bad","review":"In few words: if you expect to hear the same LP sound from Hybrid or Meteora, you will be highly dissappointed. Doesn't mean that it's a bad record but it's like a totally different band, most of the songs are ballads, and some passages you swear you are listening U2.Buy it only if you will dare to erase all the previous paradigms and preconceptions on LP's sound to start from scratch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different then their last albums! BUT NICE!","review":"I was a bit shocked to see some things different in the way Linkin Park had done based on their past albums, but it was a nice surprise for me. I kept an open mind despite some negative reviews and found myself listening to the whole album, loving most of it. I definately give them props for triyng something new despite how older fans might feel about it. I thought they still kept their edge, not on the whole album, but a good bit of the songs. I loved Shadow of the Day, and Hands held, one of their most different songs they have done but I personaly loved them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different Hybrid Theory","review":"Linkin Park is an amazing band. I am not a big metal fan. I can't stand rap. But for some reason Linkin Park really gets my toes tapping and even my head banging!They warned their fan base that this would be a different album this time around and they were absolutely correct. Linkin Park has been up until this point a rap-metal-electronica hybrid. This album is more of a metal-arena rock hybrid and I have to say its not bad!I am not the type of Linkin Park fan that knows each band member's name nor do I get onto the \\"LP is selling out man!\\" trip. All I know is there is some good music on here.Reading the reviews I can't help but remember the hub bub that surrounded Metallica's Black album. Although, Minutes to Midnight does not compare to the brilliance of the Black Album, it looks like Linkin Park is having to grow up a little and I think they will be better off for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would the real Linkin Park please stand up?","review":"I have one question for Linkin Park, did your ****s fall off or something? I mean, I like slow dinky piano numbers as much as the next guy/girl, but not from LP! I recommend you dust off Hybrid, Meteora, and even Reanimation and listen to Faint and both versions of With You. When I listen to those numbers, it feels like my head is ripped off, thrown around, and reattached feeling better than ever. I'm happy to pay the speeding tickets your music causes. This album, however, was hugely disappointing. I have to check the cover to make sure it isn't Duran Duran reborn or something. I give the album 2 stars because there are some brief glimpses of the old you. Please rediscover that magic. Otherwise, you'll just become another rock band. We don't need another Nickleback, as successful as they are. Bring back the old LP and you'll sell gazillions of albums. Don't try to be something you're not, lame, at least until now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappoints","review":"Say what you want about Linkin Park, but don't say they are consistent. While this is definitely within the realm of the sound of Linkin Park, it does nothing to move them forward in the direction that MADE them as popular as they are. They have moved away from the angst, the energy seems to have left them. I am not against bands experimenting with their sound, and trying new things, however, if they want to remain 'successful' they need to not entirely leave what got them there.There are far too many ballads, and not enough of that raw emotion that forced them to the top of the charts.If you don't mind the lighter side of Linkin Park, then you'll have no problems with the album, and by all means buy it, however, if your looking for more of the hard, emo rock, and raw emotion of the earlier albums, you WILL be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Used too Love them, now I'm not so sure!","review":"Wow, Linkin Park used to be one of our favorite bands....until this album came out! What a disappointment! It sounds nothing like LP and to be honest I'm not sure it sounds like anybody...and thats not a good thing!I will give them another shot on their next album, but if it doesnt change then...See Ya LP!P.S. this is kind of like what happened to Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, Deftones, Sevendust...etc, bands get too comfortable and want to attempt to \\"CHANGE\\"...well I am afraid I know how this story is going to END!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Minutes to boredom","review":"Many bands are cursed with being under a certain genre. They're known for a certain style and if anything changes in that style, there's a big risk. Some work out well, others don't. This one is the latter.LP was known for having no cuss words in their lyrics. They were able to communicate anger, fear and other negative attitudes through passionate words and screaming vocals. Now they've replaced it with cuss words and sappy boy band clean vocals. \\"What I've done\\" is the best song on the album only because of the lyrics. That's the only reason this reviewer gave it two stars.The nu-metal music is gone as well. It's mostly replaced with easy-going guitar riffs and lazy beat box sounds. Not impressive.If you're an LP fan and wanted a new Meteora or Hybrid theory; it won't be on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Linkin Park? Not anymore...","review":"Linkin Park was one of my favourite bands because they had their own sound - I've never heard another band who could duplicate the easy mix of rap and rock; who could have thoroughly entertaining songs, perfect no matter what mood you're in - and could give you energy if you cranked it!Minutes to Midnight is a sad excuse for a Linkin Park CD. They have lost their sound, and now sound like a million other bands out there... Think Tom Petty with some 50-Cent mixed in random places. The rap doesn't sync with the music, and most of it made me want to scream - not with energetic joy as before, but in agony.I remain a Linkin Park fan; but a fan of the glory days when they were \\"angry\\" and entertaining. I purchased the CD without hearing anything from it because I expected it to be new songs, same band; if you haven't bought it already, don't - wait to hear the songs on the radio, if they get there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating to listen to","review":"Listening to this CD is nothing but an exercise in frustration. You'll spend every song waiting for a climax that never comes. It's so obvious even to someone who's not a musician where every one of these songs should have gone but didn't. You'll hear it in your mind and wonder why the hell LP didn't hear the same and produce it. Sounds like they were just [...] around the entire time. I've listened to this three times in the span of a year b/c each time I was hoping it wasn't as bad as I'd remembered and it was equally disappointing each time to the point I skipped past nearly every song on the third go. I have wide musical tastes so I can appreciate different things, but what they tried to do here just didn't work and they knew it and apparently didn't care. I won't be buying anything from LP again without doing my research and listening to it first. I'll only be fooled once, never again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the Linkin' Park you know and love","review":"They said it was more rock than Rap Rock, so what the heck, I'm a rock and roll person so let's pre-order it, if from LP so how can I go wrong? Wrong! Be warned this is not the Linkin' Park you know and love. This is totally different and not in a good way. I love rock and roll but this ain't it! I had high hopes for rock and roll from LP but I am so disappointed. LP, get back to what you did in your first two CDs.Save your money, don't buy this CD. I played this CD a dozen times or more but it just doesn't cut it. it's now collecting dust at the bottom of my CD pile."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I am reminded of the south park episode of faith+1, and also of listening to nickleback or some other pop-rock band all at the same time. Gone is the angry, angst-filled music of the old linkin park. Instead we have songs about how he was alone on valentines day and that made him sad. This change was not a welcome one, and anyone who loved the first two albums should NOT buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen before you buy!!","review":"I have never written an online review before, but I feel pretty strongly about this. I love Linkin Park's first two CD's. I bought this one based on what the other CD's were like and off of their hit single \\"what ive done\\". The rest of the CD \\"minutes to midnight\\" sound nothing like their first two CD's. It is largly hip-hop style with very little musical complexity. I was extremely discapointed with this release. So, please, Listen before you buy.I give this CD a 1 star because I did like one song."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!","review":"I love Linkin Park, I have been to quite a few shows and thoroughly enjoy their music but this is not Linkin Park. If your into the more eclectic/ soft style with no beats or drums its all yours. The rock has died out of them. Don't waste your money, the only good song on the album is on the radio and that I am sure will get played out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will always remember the old Linkin, before they vanished.","review":"I've been a fan of them for a long time, however when the changed their sound, I hoped that they might get their sound back. Unfortunately, they are stuck with ballads. If they ever did a reanimation-Esq album, it would be great if they added a dubstep nu-rock twist. But only time will tell if the will keep on sounding like U2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good LP CD, not a good CD in general.","review":"Be weary of people who rate this album 5 stars. 5 means perfection, music that will stand the test of time. This, citizens of rock; is not even close. I will be honest, I like me some Linkin Park. I have seen them twice in concert and in general, I enjoy their music. I don't worship them or write 8 page diatribes in their defense if someone decides to flame them. This album has to be heard to be believed. I was moved by it, moved to come on here and warn people that this not what you expect. Whatever idea you have of this album it wont be that. There are no punch to the songs. They removed every musical aspect which made them, them. I mean, honestly the songs simply put, the songs aren't any good.In a interview they said they made hundreds of songs and these made pick. Linkin Park, did you even listen to this album before you presented it to us, your fans? This is awful you should be ashamed of yourself, go to your room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste the money","review":"They should have waited another 2 years. This cd is bad at best. I can't even explain how disappointed I am."},{"rating":"1","title":"This can't be Linkin Park","review":"If I wanted to listen to a Lilth Fair album, I would've just bought a Lilth Fair album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not throw-away awful, but still bad none-the-less","review":"I can't describe how eagerly I awaited this CD. I'm a big Linkin Park fan, but after listening to this CD, I may be more hesitant to buy any more of their CDs. It starts off okay with 'Wake', but then goes down hill. Most of the songs are soft, and not the 'soft' kind of way that made In The End a great song. The music itself seems different, and Chester makes up so much of this album that you wonder if Mike Shinoda was off doing another solo album. I miss the two of them singing/rapping in the same song, but you won't find a lot of that here. You also won't find any of those good-ole Linkin Park songs from the past. It really felt more like a Chester solo-album, and it wasn't that good. I give it two stars only because of the two or three songs I can pick out of this mess that I can listen to. Hopefully their next album, which following their time line won't come out until around 2010, will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The same band...?","review":"If you are used to the old Linkin Park style and are familiar with any of their older CD's, this one will definitely shock you. When I first heard it, I couldn't believe how much they had changed. Change isn't always bad, but in their situation it is. Before, they were a unique band with very defined vocals and now they just sound like any other band. Very disappointing..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Linkin Park?","review":"I've been listening to Linkin Park for as long as I can remember. First, I loved Hybrid Theory, then I realized that I like Meteora even more. I felt like I couldn't survive a second with them, but Minutes To Midnight just seems so.... fake. It feels like Linkin Park has turned into something else. They might as well change their name.To all fans, get a box of tissues before you start listening to this album.Maybe their next album (if they make one) will be closer to what they were, to what they still are.... They just wanted to tap into a different part of their minds I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"LP,s WORST","review":"I waited for so many years for a Linkin park studio album after Meteora and was left totally disappointed.I have been a great fan of LP since their Hybrid theory days, but what I heard from Minutes to midnight sounded like most of the Boybands and left me utterly confused.It sounded like a mixture of all the bands like Backstreet boys, N sync, a little dose of Red hot chilli peppers, Bon Jovi...etc.I hope they go back to where they started from otherwise they,ll end up loosing a lot of FANS....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as bad as \\"they\\" think.","review":"This isn't Linkin Park's finest, but it's a start after being gone for so long. For those who can't deal with the explicit lyrics, move on. They're not as bad as everyone makes them out to be - they're not excessive at all. People say \\"bad words\\" in the real world, and life goes on.There are more than a couple good songs on this album, but plenty of \\"filler.\\" Listen to it at least 3 times completely through, and you should come to like it like I have. The first time can feel pretty rough, but give it some time.Looking forward to more from this great group, and hopefully an improvement that can be felt by all of their fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Craptastic!","review":"I fell in love with LP from their Meteroa so when I say they had a new something out I was very happy but that ended quick. From the first song where you here nothing but the f-bomb dropped way to many times and then it came, the clapping. I was thinking, ok this is new and if its only one song then hey I can get past it, but it wasn't. It continued on through the sappy, boring songs till I felt like I was at a LP revival meeting. I was looking for the collection plate to be passed. After that I stopped it and after my ears stopped bleeding (and not in a good way) I threw it away.I just don't get what the heck happen or what the crap they were thinking when they made this. I am a bit dumbfounded."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 stars... Good, but Different!?!","review":"I am a real fan of heavy metal music. LP is usually not heavy metal, but as for this album... i think they get a little closer. i can't beleive reading all of these other reveiws that all they are doing is trashing LP. Yeah... it is different, but it is not bad at all, in fact, in my opinion, i think is just as good as the previous 2 releases. it is way more chester, by that i mean... way more screaming. but all in all i like it... i usually don't write reveiws, but come on LP fans, don't be so hard 'em for trying something different... especially when it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech.","review":"I read all the reviews. I tried not to listen. I thought to myself, being \\"old\\" now (30) that the kids never give some different a fair shake. And like Metallica, I was wrong. This does not belong in the same category as previous works. I can understand bands wanting to branch out and do something different. Its hard to believe they play the same songs in concerts tour after tour after tour. But if you want to release an album for the John Tesh radio show, then lets market it straight to adult contemporary, shall we? Quit pretending you rock!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!","review":"Since I'd been waiting for their new album for long time I am so dissapointed in their new album. It was kinda interesting because they tried new style but that's not Linkin Park and that's not Linkin Park I love! I don't know what happened to them. It didn't feel like Linkin Park at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"they lost it","review":"I used to be a big linkin park fan. This cd is not good, the first single to come out \\"What I've done\\" is total phoney garbage. No melody or rythm....avoid this"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment- mediocre at best","review":"With all the excitement and a single like What I've Done coming from this album you would think Linkin Park was going to deliver. You would be wrong if that's what you assumed. It seemed to me they decided to overhaul their style, with very poor results. The only song I enjoyed was What I've done which was released as a single quite a while ago. My call on this: save your money and buy what I've done on iTunes.I feel ridiculous with all my references being to that one song, but seriously, the rest is trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks Rick Rubin","review":"This cd is an abomination to the Linkin Park name and sound. I waited patiently for the next greatest cd to arrive, and here I sit still waiting. I want to personally thank Rick Rubin for yet again ruining another band I enjoy. Do not waste your money on this cd, instead, go buy another copy of Hybrid Theory and/or Meteora. Thanks and God Bless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long the wait... big the dissapointment","review":"I have been waiting the 3rd Linkin Park album as many other fans for so long. But after listening it for the first time, I got really dissapointed. I can say that is the first time I bought an album and only liked about 2 or 3 songs. The rest of the album sounds all the same boring stuff.They for sure have credit for trying something different, but for the next one, they should try to do an album with much more variety.Also, for some reason I don't like the sewaring in this album. Nothing against it, I listen bands like Nine Inch Nails, Garbage or Green Day that make it sound good in their respective albums, but for some reason I don't think it sound really good in a Linkin Park album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest Disappointment of the Year!!!","review":"I really don't know what disappointed me more, Metallica's St. Anger or Linkin Park's Minutes to Midnight. They really screwed up on this one. Now I am worried about what Rick is going to do to Metallica's new one due out later this year. I hope their new one is better than this. Too much change is just as bad as no change at all. They should have balanced out the songs better. The best LP new song can heard on YouTube. In search, type in Linkin Park and Qwerty. Believe it or not, this song did not make it to the new album. What the hell were they thinking!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Losing the heat","review":"I was actually in disbelief when I heard this album \\"Minutes to Midnight\\" I expected so much more out of LP since Hybrid Theory and Meteora. Alot of bands hurt themselves by changing the sound of their music in this case LP put themselves in the mode of self-destruction. No more hard hitting lyrics, powerful vocals, edgy chorus's, dj's and the days of rap rock are gone for LP. Rick Rubin is mostly to blame for the destruction of LP he ruined them like all the other bands he's produced. This album has no replay value what so ever you will get bored with every song on here. The only goods songs are Given Up, What I've Done and No More Sorrow, as for the other songs they are mostly slow songs and aren't very gripping. Alot of my friends bought this album and were disappointed with the outcome and refused to even listen to the album all the way through. LP may have lost the heat we can all hope that they find it again, until then I'll just listen to their old music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I can't believe it says they wrote over 150 songs for this album. I wonder how bad the other 135 were. When I first heard the album I thought they put the wrong cd in the case because it sounded like a high-school band.There is nothing \\"grown\\" up about this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I heard the \\"what I've Done\\" on the radio and went out and bought the album--I had been waiting like the others on this site for them to release one for what felt like forever....NOT the stuff I expected. Almost FELL ASLEEP driving listening to the other songs on the CD. Buy the single, not the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't listen","review":"To the supposed musically enlightened people that tell you to give this album a break. They could have come up with this garbage in year 1 of their hiatus. I'm not sure how they can spin that this piece of junk took 4 years to make. I call a major BS, and I love LP. Why change? Why fool millions and millions of fans into buying this bust? How do you tour and play these songs?It's almost like an action/thriller author deciding to write a romance novel. I suggest borrowing someones copy or ripping it. $10 is too much to pay for this one. Sorry LP fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm angry and Chester's not","review":"Like many of the posters, I've been waiting on pins and needles to get my hands on LP's new release. And like most of the reviews I've read, I'm disappointed. Listening to LP was a state of mind. It got you pumped up. The mix of Chester's screaming with the hip-hop created a one of kind sound you didn't get from any other band. This album erases all that. I want screaming Chester, not the mild, thoughtful and melodious Chester. An earlier poster said this was LP's version of U2's Joshua Tree, a defining album for their future. I agree with part of that assessment, except I think the LP album is more comparable to U2's Pop disaster. I'm all for growing musically, but remember your roots. LP pulled up the tree with this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Not LP This is Rick Rubin Puppets","review":"Hi Guys!This is coming from the heart, I am true LP fan, but this album is the last nail in coffin for my respect for them. I mean first it was \\"Minutes to Midnight\\" then \\"Thousand Suns\\" and now this piece of crap, I mean where as the Hybrid Theory, Metero , Linkin Park are gone?? Damn you Rick Rubin you destroyed a great band! Damn you!If you have any Brains guys(talking to LP) Please get rid of this Piece of crap!

I had expectations like anyone else, but this is so below what LP is capable of."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, not as good as Meteora","review":"First, about all of the people who posted to the discussion before the release date saying, \\"I work for a radio station and I listened to this album,\\" I would like to assert that they are all a bunch of liars, because I am not listening to the same album that they described, whether they wrote positive or negative comments. Chester does in fact scream, although more of the material tends toward Place Where I Belong kind of style. And Mike Shinoda has two songs where he raps and one where he actually sings for a change (although that is one of the songs that doesn't grab me). I pre-ordered this album but procrastinated listening to it because I was afraid that I was going to be disappointed. No, it's not as good as Meteora or Hybrid Theory, and there are a couple songs that I don't care for at all, but as a whole piece it is pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Vivid Chapter for LP","review":"Honestly, I've got to say that, for the most part, Linkin Park has taken a very risky path by changing and exploring the depths of, what can possibly be, one of the greatest albums of 2007. \\"Minutes to Midnight\\" is a new chapter in LP's odyssey, and I truly respect that. There has been quite a bit of debate on LP's change of sound and style, but one has to remember that they're growing up, and I'm glad for them. Chester and everyone in the band has a vision-one that will leave us singing their melodies forever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why linking Park! Why?","review":"Im going to make this quick. I've been a huge linkin park fan since I first saw the video for crawling. After that I had to have all their tracks and I enjoyed every bit of their last albums. But I dont know what happined here! This cd sounded like a pop album with sad songs for chicks. Omg I couldnt believe what I was hearing. So I gave it another listen while on my way to work. And their were only about 2-3 songs that were ok. What I liked most about the Linkin Park sound was the rap/rock mix and chesters vocals when he screams. It used to send chills thru my back. Well thats all gone now. I wish I could ask these guys wtf happined dudes!? You guys were on a role! Well anyways So if you enjoyed the other linkin park albums you might want to skip this one. Because im telling you you wont like it! I just hope they go back to the old sound on their next album. I just hate having to wait again. -_-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible / Garbage","review":"As a very enthusiastic and loyal linkin park fan this cd is horrible. This is what we have been waiting 4 years for? If they release another wierd cd like this that doesn't have the linkin park feel that we have all been waiting for since meteora came out and for some since hybrid theory they will start losing a lot of fans. For the amount of time they put in between alblums they should release with a better product. The only reason this gets two stars instead of one is because it's by linkin park."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will the real linkin park stand up?","review":"In case you havent picked up on it from the other reviews - this album is a serious departure from what you might expect from Linkin Park. I'm totally open to change with bands, but , I guess this is a perfect example that its not always for the better. TO me, LP means Intensity... songs that make you want to break something, get up, run as fast as you can until your lungs feel like they are going to explode. None of this music will give you that emotion. As said I can understand, that bands change - I think this is SO much of a departure its hard to adjust. Rest in peace LP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey at least it's good for frisbee fodder","review":"Honestly now. They had such a great system going, and yet they say that U2 is a big influence. A band that won a grammy saying \\"yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah\\" please. Linkin Park needs to take a look in the mirror and rethink who it looks up to and go back to their old ways. And yeah the cd is good for frisbee fodder after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rare Rick Rubin miss...","review":"Rick Rubin usually has the golden touch - from the Beastie Boys to the Dixie Chicks, to Johnny Cash and Neil Diamond. But this CD has so many sugar coated power ballads you'd think you just bought a Nickelback CD.There are a few rockers but not enough to offset the bad.Bad Rick Rubin. Bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"One listenable song","review":"Like most fans, Linkin Park won me over with Hybrid Theory. There was a good balance between metal, rap, and other styles. This album tries to become more mainstream. They really lean away from the metal sound that made the band. The only song that I could listen to all the way through was 'What I've Done\\". There was either too much rap in every song, and I was waiting for Chester to come in with a heavy chorus, or the song was a ballad. It was disappointing to say the least. As a fan of Hybrid Theory, this isn't the Linkin Park that I became a fan of."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh no a break down","review":"um what happend this album sucks only 4 songs on this album was good and thats track 2 4 6 and 8 the rest sucked. They were doing so great with their 1 2 and 3 album but this one was garbage and they sound alot better with no curses in their songs this album had curses this was a total waste if i new this album was'nt going to be good i should'nt had downloaded track 2 4 6 and 8 into my mp3 player but thats alright in the future with their new album i hope it dos'nt end up like this album i hope its going to great like hybird theory reanimation and metroa this was a dissapointment i hope this never happan again."},{"rating":"1","title":"LP's Latest falls short of (my) expectations","review":"Linkin Park's latest album is too much of a departure from previous albums. They've gotten soft and moved to far away from what brought them to the dance. Very disapointed as this is one of my three favorite bands that up until this time have always delivered. Maybe next time.-Mark"},{"rating":"1","title":"Passable rock, but crummy Linkin Park","review":"Take a generous helping of Nickelback, mix in some Korn, and a hint of Limp Bizkit and you'll have Linkin Park's new sound for this album. Bleah. Ironic that a band that shaped the sound of a genre is now impotently emulating others.Thank God for the net and mp3's or I would have bought this upon release just like the bad old pre-napster days. The record companies got me with Def Leppard's Slang, they won't be getting me with Minutes to Midnight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything Rick Rubin Touches Turns to Gold . . . Well . . . Not Quite","review":"After Rick Rubin produced a Rock Album of the year by taking some of the Funk out of RHCP's Califunk for Stadium Arcadium, he helped Linkin Park take the rock and the rap out of their unique brand of Rap-Rock. It didn't work quite as well, in fact this is a complete dud. My favorite song is Bleed it Out, and this song really rocks. What I've Done has a haunting piano piece like In the End, but is really really repetitive lyrically. Some of the politics that come into the music are usually what I like to hear artists say to express themselves, but for Linkin Park I don't think it works as well. However, I gotta admit Hands Held High is pretty good. I honestly thought that I had put in The Fray CD when I heard the Shadow of the Day intro. Yea, pretty much too soft, too slow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Too Good","review":"I'm a huge Linkin Park fan. I have always loved their alternative sound. This cd was not Likin Park. It sounded like a different band all together. I was disappointed with it. I feel that when a band finds a good sound that works they should stick with it. Hopefully their next cd will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost me after the second track....","review":"What a disappointment... I blame the Fort Minor detour for this. They got soft. Tragic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Linkin Park are bunch of HAS BEEN SELLOUTS!!","review":"wow, linkin park has officially sold out. This pretty boys are nothing but nsync with some guitar playing that only apply to bubble gum teenie boppers. With a pathetic album who's trying to be political, Stinkin park is such a WANNABE RATM which not in a million years they will be even 10% as good as Rage. Linkin park has sold out now, bunch of mainstream no talent insecure band =Linkin park. You can compare Linkin park to groups like milli vanilli, nelson, vanilla ice, new kids on the block, nsync, ect... bunch of no talent crappy band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come on, guys, let's keep a little faith for these guys","review":"Alright, I'll readily admit this is not their best album. This is probably their worst album to date. But every band goes through a period of time when they 'discover themselves' and change their style somewhat. I still have high hopes for LP, I just hope they return to their roots. That's what they're best at. If they can redeem themselves before their next release (looking way into the future here), then all will be well, and M2M will best be forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"what the heck????","review":"just one comment for this album..... this sucks, from begining to end.

Long gone are the days of Hybrid Theory and the good mix of rap and rock. This was a waste of my money (which i ran out and bought the limited edition the day it came out). I mean...come on guys seriously who wants to listen to a bunch of whiney emo songs from yet another sellout band? I have lost all respect completely for this band and this album is to blame. Yes it does have evolution but its not a good one. I understand that they arent gonna put out another hybrid theory but could you atleast keep the awesome guitars and the hard rock beat to it? And wheres Mike on this one? It seems he is disapearing from the band which i dont like. All in all i recomend this album to no one who respects rock music its a waste of money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I wasn't a Linkin Park fan at all when One Step Closer was released as a single. My roommate played Hybrid Theory so much, though, I started to really dig them. When Meteora came out and I heard Faint on the radio, I went out and purchased the album the next day. I listened to it for 6 months straight in my car. I couldn't wait for Minutes to Midnight. Over 4 years went by before it came out, so I expected something amazing. Maybe that's why I hate it. It doesn't hit with me on any level like the other two (especially Meteora) did. It's just way too soft to be called Linkin Park."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak, very weak.","review":"I give the album one star for the single \\"What I've Done.

How could these guys actually think about releasing this stuff. It is awful! Every song is dull, slow and boring, with the exception of the tracks, \\"What I've Done,\\" and \\"Given Up.\\" If they would've stuck to the formula of those 2 songs and of there last two albums, which are full of hard driving rockers and crunching guitar, then they would have a winner on there hands. But no, this album is a BIG FAT LOSER!!!! If you want to listen to some music that will put you to sleep, this is the album for you! But if you want to hear some good rocking tunes, look to there previous albums Hybrid Theory and Meteora. You won't find it here. This is probably the worst rock album of 2007."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not original, NOT the LP that we knew....","review":"The cutting edge heavy hybrid rock sound that uniquely defined Linkin Park only exists in a few songs such as \\"What I've Done\\" and \\"No More Sorrow\\". Most of the other songs are a re-hash of a more familiar rock style that is neither original nor cutting edge. The pace of the songs is slower, monotonous and disconnected compared to their previous albums.No matter what your political slant is the political preaching in this album's songs is disappointing, boring and unoriginal. Those types of songs should be left to Green Day, The Dixie Chicks and aging hippie folk music groups.I agree with many of the disappointed fans who felt that LP has essentially tried to re-invent itself with \\"Minutes to Midnight\\" by embracing more common musical themes, styles and lyrics. I found that the more I listened to this album the less I liked it which is contrary to what I felt about their previous albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"It is sad to say but Linkin Park had taken a huge step backward with this one. So much so, that it was a stretch for me to give it 2 stars.

C'mon, this sounds like the love child of AFI and Staind on glorious amounts of anti-depressants.So they say they \\"grew up\\" so they don't want to make angry music.

May they rest in peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Selling out is hard to do...","review":"I've waited since March 2003 for Linkin Park's next cd with ferverent anticipation. After hearing that cd today, I wonder how it was possible for them to take 4 years and have over 100 drafts for songs and produce a 43 minute piece of garbage. The thing that kept repeating over and over again in my mind was, \\"Wow, I can't believe they're pulling a Stain'd\\". This cd is absolutely horrible, overly melodramatic, way too up-beat in a anti-depressant drug-induced kind of way. Linkin Park, here's some advice: stop taking all the Prozac, Zoloft, or whatever else you're doing and put some passion back into the music. I, and everyone I know, feels cheated out of the last 4 years of waiting for this over-produced, over-hyped coporate buy-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I've listened to Linkin Park for years, I absolutely loved Meteora, Hybrid Theory and all their other albums and was eagerly waiting for this one to come out, so I bought it but I already regret buying it. I completely waisted my money on this. It had songs which had absolutely no rock or good lyrics. Why'd they go all soft all of a sudden? Even their lyric have become softer. Singing about valentines day, apologizing to someone are what they sing about now. If this CD is not compared to LPs last CDs it would've been better. P/S I only rated this 2/5 because of around, say, 2 songs I liked and 2 songs that were ok. But on ALL the other LP CDs I loved ALL the songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone jumped the shark!","review":"And they did it with Rick Rubin. For some reason the guys in the band thought they were NU METAL and actually said they \\"created that genre\\" and wanted to stay far away from it.. Obviously their delusional and aren't even close to NU METAL because KORN created that genre.. Anyways track by track shows immaturity and obvious theft of other artists writings.. Specificly U2 \\"With Or Without You\\" and \\"Shadow Of The Day\\". These guys need to regroup and stop jumping the gun and write some good songs and feel good doing it.

I know this won't outsell Meteora, but it probably will put them well on their way to making what could in all probability only be another garbage album. In any case, progress usually is a good thing, but perhaps Meteora 2 would be the best bet for Linkin' Park.

Yeah, I thought so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Return to Sender","review":"If you liked Linkin Park for their fast paced tempo and hard lyrics then you will be very, very dissapointed. I would return this album had I not purchased it already from Itunes. The only songs that mildly relate in style to their previous two albums are What I've Done, Bleed It Out, and No More Sorrow.I would have given this album zero if I had the option. I'm not a fan or the new music at all. It's also not the type of music that will grow on you. If you like a lot of slower paced alternative music, then give this album a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are You Kidding Me?","review":"I was always a huge fan of Linkin Park. I loved Hybrid Theory and Meteora and even went to their concert in Texas, which was great. But dude, WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED IN THE NEW CD? They turned into some emo band like Fallout Boy or something. There are only 2 songs I like: \\"What I've Done\\" and \\"No More Sorrows\\". It's hard to listen to other songs and I'm really disappointed; therefore I believe it's a waste of money to buy this album and I regret. Next time just download or buy those 2 or 3 good songs because the rest just SUCKS.I ask myself; why would Linkin Park totally change the style that made them so famous and loved by the public? Just don't buy it because you'll be disapointed. Students from the college I go to can make a better CD than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sellouts","review":"LP has sold-out. This CD is completely different from Hybrid Theory and Meteora, and not in a good way. The cover of the CD shows an Emo-like LP and gives more of a melancholy feel, something they have never represented. The tracks range from decent to terrible. I had Hybrid Theory the day of its release and the same with Meteora. After sitting and listening to MtM I am just sad to see how a label can destroy a band. They need to stick to what made them special in the future if they hope to maintain a solid fan base."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bull S***","review":"I was once a HUGE fan of Linkin Park and even was part of their fan club. My mom was the first to notice and listen to them and buy their album[yes my mother has pretty good taste in music]i borrowed Hybrid Theory when she bought it i loved it and i still haven't given it back. My parents got me the second album for my birthday and i loved it too. But I couldn't be any more dissapointd in their \\"new\\" sound. I respect artists for wanting to reinvent themselves and find something different to experiment with so that they don't seem predictable. But when you put out something that is THIS BAD you might as well have just gone with being predictable.I'm gonna go listen to the new Ashlee Simpson CD and cry in the corner and hope they've learned their lesson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disapointment!","review":"I have been a big fan of Linkin Park and absolutely loved their first two albums. Minutes to Midnight has a completely new style to it that does not sound like band. Overall it is much more mellow than the rest of their material and I only really enjoyed 3 of the 12 songs. Even then, nothing really blew me away with this album unlike with Hybrid Theory and Meteora."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say 'selling out'?","review":"What the heck happened to their music? I was a big fan but this new album is stupidly political and is just plain horrible. Their single on the album is the only mildly LP style song on the album. LP obviously went soft and pop.

This was a major let down as I was looking forward to this album for so long. The songs are just such a bland and boring departure. I am all for a band trying new things, but be sensible about it. Maybe only do this kind of departure or 2 or 3 songs and then do your standard stuff. I should have known this album would have been pretty bad just by the simple fact Rick Rubin produced it. He has a thing for taking well established bands and making them do sub-par albums. I've tried listening to this album several times through to give it a fair shot, and there are some songs that hand great potential, but didn't quite make the grade. I have a feeling this album is going to alienate a lot of standard LP fans. At least I will still have their tour to look forward to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minutes to Midnight...","review":"Minutes to Midnight...Should be more like Minutes Till I Slash my wrists, or maybe Minutes Till I Jump Off a Bridge. Very big disappointment on Linkin Parks part. With the exception of 3 to 4 songs you might as well take the CD and use it as a coaster when you swallow 40 pills and take a swig of JD. I have been a huge fan of Linkin Park since day 1 and all I have to say is congratulations Linkin Park you have now joined the Emo race. Put on your girl pants and run to the nearest store to pick up this amazing album.

Slow melodies were all over the track with a sound that showed no signs of speeding up. The vocals have changed alot too. This CD is like they took a whole new direction and I don't know if it's a good direction yet. I have to listen to it a little more and hope it grows on me.

However, there was something good about the rap/heavy guitar/voices combination found in previous albums. Count me out if the whole album is like \\"What I've done\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Look whos grown up","review":"Some people are down on this album, but those are probably the same kinds of people who have no real musical appreciation; ie the song has to be \\"radio worthy\\" before it passes their muster. I didnt even like their earlier work, everything sounded the same. This album is much more diverse. Of the 12 songs, only Given Up, Bleed it out (kinda), What Ive done, and No more sorrowcould be considered rockers. So its much different. But in my opinion, this is what makes an album, and not a singles collection. If you are a real LP fan, you'll pick this up, and i think youll really be happy with it. Im not a big LP fan, but i was interested because i heard it would be different, and it is, and i applaud them for sticking themselves out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Word:Change","review":"I can be more bias since I just picked up their Meteora CD last week and this one on Tuesday.I can understand why so many fans would not be happy with this cd since it sounds nothing at all like the last.But groups change and LP might trying to get hold of another audience,like myself.I listen too Bon Jovi and Nickelback mostly,not to big with rap since I think it's overexposed and rap/rappers all start sounding alike from Eminem,LimpBizquick,etc,etc,Linkin Park are not the greatest singers but if you're an open-minded music lover,you will enjoy this cd.Little more singing and less rap lyrics never broke a group."},{"rating":"1","title":"change is good... well... maybe...","review":"I remember a comment from the Meteora DVD, about how they wanted each song to be enjoyed even by the 100th time... it seems that concern was not present on this album.

I am a hardcore LP fan but they just let me down. What a piece of junk. Except for what I have done and Bleed it Out, none of the songs are even worth a hear. The two songs I mentioned are also okay. I am only let down by this album. I hope this is some kind of joke cause I expected a zillion times better then this. I hope they get the old Mike and Chester Rap-Rock back in the same album.

Just awful...","review":"I was very excited when I found out that Linkin Park was releasing a new album and ordered it immediately. I was not happy with this album at all. The music was far from what you would expect from Linkin Park and, as with so many other wealthy entertainers, they feel that it is their responsibility to talk about politics in their music. I listen to music for entertainment, not their political wisdom. This was somewhat more palatable in Green Day's American Idiot because the music was still very good. This is not the case in Minutes to Midnight."},{"rating":"2","title":"new and different and impressive","review":"read some good reviews and some not so good...but I really love linkin park so had to hear for myself...I can see what some diehards might be missing, but I still think this is an impressive group of songs...that grow on me more and more with ever listen. great vocals, interesting songs, miss some of the rapping but whats there is real good....think these guys are trying to evolve...but hold on to their sound...just explore new places...and while i love their loud stuff...and i love when they take you on a roller coaster ride from rough to smooth on the same track...but i must say, they can deliver a strong, stirring ballad...with just enough edge and reality to keep it from being a sappy result"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Music, but not Linkin Park","review":"Tracks 2, 4, 6, and 8 stay true to what made Linkin Park famous in the first place. The rest of it just sounds like any other emo song out there. Hands Held High has its moments, but I was thoroughly disappointed in the lack of Mike Shinoda's rapping in the majority of the CD. After Fort Minor, I expected something more from him. Given Up can only be defined as intense, especially with the 30 second + yell. Totally kickass. Like I said, if I heard a lot of the songs on the radio, I would think they sounded pretty good, but not Linkin Park."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally different","review":"I am a huge linkin park fan. I loved Meteora and Hybrid Theory. Those past two alboms had it all the rock, rap and trurn tables. Minutes to Midnight is different, but good. I wasn't so excited when I heard LP was changing the style for this new album. But when I got it on May 15th and listen to it I believed it to be a risk but is was a good one. I would most likely say Given Up, Bleed it Out, and What I've Done are probably the most similar to the albums that LP has made in the past. If you are a hardcore LP fan and love there music this is diffently the ablum to get.YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING IS THE WORTH TO GET OR IS IT JUST A WASTE OF MONEY.

Of course Hybrid Theory is their best disc but this particular album isn't a total wash-out. The reason I gave Minutes to Midnight four stars is because the band tried something new, which I always appreciate, the songs are softer but still have a rock edge to it, and Chester Bennington's vocals have never sounded more clearer and animated (in a good way). Standout tracks include: Bleed it Out, Shadow of the Day, Hands Held High, In Between, and Leave Out All the Rest. Expect to hear a different sound but ultimately it will leave you wanting more (if you like change that is). Happy listening!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's growing on me.","review":"I admit that upon first listen, I was a bit shocked and disappointed. Because I'm a big fan of LP and especially Mike Shinoda's Fort Minor, I so looked forward to hearing their kickass signature sound, only louder and better. Guess what, LP changed gear on us. I'm sure some fans are completely thrown off by this. But I'm glad I've given this album more listen and really started enjoying its more carefully crafted songs. I think in this album, LP is more thoughtful, more provactive, more dimensional. Chester's usual strong, angry voice still good as ever, and now he adds more color to his sound. I do wish it could have more Shinoda.Overall, I think this is a solid album, differend, yes, but a worthy one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The same stuff gets boring, the change is welcome!","review":"While this album is very different from the first two, I think the different style if a nice change of pace for the band. If they had released another album of the same stuff over and over again, then it just gets boring. This shows that LP has a great range, and I think the lyrics and vocals on this album are great.Every group changes their style and sound over the years, so true fans should stop ripping on them for this album. Would you want to go up and perform the same 6 songs over and over again? The group needs to feel good about what they are performing, and they obviously felt good about this album...as do I!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"LAAAME!!","review":"Man, after listening to \\"What I've Done\\", I was SOOO excited to hear this CD. BAH! It's sooo bad!! What happened?!?This is just like My Chemical Romance's \\"Black Parade\\" CD. The ONLY song I liked off that album was, well, Black Parade. Same with this CD, I only like WID.With Hybrid Theory and Meteoria, both had a slew of kickin' LP trademark music that was super catchy and you could learn the words to in minutes. This CD however is SLOW, SAPPY AND EMO! What happened to Mike's rapping?! It's practically non-existent in this CD. And what happened to the music? It's so quiet. I mean, I love Chesters voice n' all, but, um, music please?I'm VERY disappointed with the CD. Just PLEASE! People! Listen to the CD in a store first before purchasing!!

I loved Linkin Park's earlier brilliant and highly influential work, but this CD is a HUGE disappointment!!! These have to be the reject songs that didn't make it onto the first two CDs.

Any band could have put this slop together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your 15 Minutes Have Long Ended.","review":"First off, I don't like Linkin Park, but I've listened to the band's previous two albums enough years ago to get an idea of how the band used to be. \\"Hybrid Theory\\" was a CD that was my favorite years ago, but I've grown tired of it quickly. \\"Meteora\\" is cut-and-paste material. After a four year wait, LP fans experience the dramatic change that they have latched themselves to. They thought that \\"nu-metal isn't cool anymore, let's go for the cookie cutter indie sound that the kids adore nowadays\\", and that is a representation of Minutes to Midnight. I remembering listening to \\"What I've Done\\", and I think to myself, \\"Is THAT Linkin Park?\\" Sad but true, Linkin Park have sunken down into a deeper hole. They keep making music, yet they fail to realize that they have not been cared for since 2003. And now they release a forgettable load of trash.Avoid this at all cost and buy real music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Linkin Park continues to surprise me.","review":"I give this CD five stars because it deserves it. It's not as good as the first two becuase of a couple reasons. Mike Shinoda's rap is minimal at best, and the songs are politic heavy, and there's swearing, but there's something brewing here that makes me give this CD a five.It's brilliant. It's different and it's interesting. Although the songs are less satisfying than their other releases, it's the nature of these songs that makes this a 5 star release for me.WakeGiven Up 4/5Leave Out All the Rest 3.5/5Bleed It Out 4.5/5Shadow of the Day 4/5What I've Done 5/5Hands Held High 5/5No More Sorrow 5/5Valentine's Day 4/5In Between 5/5In Pieces 3.5/5The Little Things That Give You Away 5/5 *Personal favoriteIt's not for everybody and may even alienate most Linkin Park fans, but it still gets a definite recommendation from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"What I've Done\\" is not the only great track","review":"Has LP strayed too much from its famous trademark sound? Yes, in the sense that the transition has been too much for the hardcore LP fans. It really takes a lot of time to listen to this CD to fully appreciate it and many people just don't have the time. In this case, I decided to spend the time and see if I would warm up or not.I have come to really enjoy the CD. \\"What I've Done\\" is not the only great track. I especially like the hard hitting \\"Given Up\\" and the softer tracks including \\"Leave Out All The Rest,\\" \\"Valentines Day,\\" \\"In Pieces,\\" and \\"The Little Things Give You Away.\\"In the meantime, one thing remains true. Chester Bennington is the best Male Rock Vocalist in the business today. He keeps proving it over & over and his work on \\"Minutes to Midnight\\" is further evidence. Linkin Park will always be a cut above the rest because of Chester's outstanding vocal skills, regardless how much they continue to mix in the rap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speechless...that's how I feel","review":"Not much to say.

Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Backstreet Boys, U2, or Linkin Park?","review":"I cannot believe what has happened to Linkin Park. I'm not sure if...well I have no words to describe how I feel about this alblum. It started out good. Nice little intro, first song pretty decent. Then they turn into U2. My wife even said one song reminded her of backstreet boys. I read that somebody said that if you don't like this album you are a sell out. Well I'm sorry to say that LP has sold out. How can you completely change your style from nu-metal to emo? I HATE emo and that is exactly what this cd reminds me of. Tracks 2,4 and 8 are quality LP songs but the rest are good but not what you would want from linkin park. If I wanted to listen to those type of songs I would buy a U2 cd. LP became popular because of their unique style of music and they have totally abandoned that. I guess they want new fans because they lost this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As other reviewers have mentioned, this CD was not the typical Linkin Park style. When I read an interview that stated more effort went into this album than any other before, I wondered where all of that energy went. Over 100 demo songs were produced before coming up with the final tract list. Much of the CD is filled with anti-Bush and anti-war rhetoric. While I have no problem with adding political discourse to music, many of the songs come across as a repeat of what Green Day accomplished several years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Step Backwards for Linkin Park","review":"Being a strong supporter of Linkin Park from when they were called Hybrid Theory, I believe they have taken a step backwards with their music. What made them stand out in their past albums were their rhythmic beats and flashy intros. However, after completing my first listen through of Minutes to Midnight, it seemed like all 12 tracks lacked strong intros and melody. The chorus is very Thirty Seconds to Mars like, in that it lacked that usual Linkin Park intensity and fire. A couple months ago, I heard one of their other songs going around on the internet called Qwerty. After listening to that song and knowing that they were looking towards changing their style, I was anticipating more metallic rather then a soft alternative rock. Overall, for those who haven't purchased this album ----> save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"No suprise","review":"Rick Rubin producing you say? Quite a few months in the writing process eh? Maybe this album will be worth listening to, haha, wrong! Since I was a freshmen in high school when \\"Hybrid Theory\\" came out I was ofcourse listening to this band. The over-produced, pro-tool using nu metal pop band did grab your attention if you had the mindset of a 15 year old such as I. Fast foward to nearly seven years later and this band is huge, I remember seeing these guy's play with Kottonmouth Kings and Hed PE at the nearest dump of a club this city could offer. The band seems lazy, rich and bored and not worth giving actual musical writing a chance. I'm alone on Valentine's Day? I'm sorry Chester, hopefully next time around a woman will except your chocolate and flowers. Give me a break, I hate insulting bands and what not but this album is so bland and boring, Rick Rubin's touch seems nowhere to be found."},{"rating":"1","title":"I miss Linkin Park","review":"I don't know who made this cd and is calling them self Linkin Park, but it isn't the real LP. I have listened to them since Hybrid Theory and loved every song from both that cd and Meteora. This has only a select few songs that are only even ok.

LP is my only hope..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm yaaaa NO!","review":"If you like whining chick rock, like the new Staind and Daughtry, you'll love this album. If you like Linkin Park, don't pick up this Linkin Park CD (odd sounding eh?). WTF LP! My only hope for your 4th CD is that the song \\"New Divide\\" is the LP I've grown to love.

Now the radio stations have so overplayed it that it has lost it's appeal. The reason it's overplayed?...It's because EVERY other track on this album is crap. As some have suggested, I listened through the album three times, the first was painful, the second was irritating, the third made me mad that I had actually paid money for this \\"music\\". Response to several tracks such as \\"Valentines Day\\" and \\"Hands\\" is 'who cares?!?!?!'To sum it up, I tried to give this album to two co-workers and both my teenagers and no one wants it for free...LP, take a moment and reexamine. This album is a bitter disappointment. Growth is good, but if I want this kind of sound I'll listen to Diana Krall. ."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT Linkin Park! what in the world happened?","review":"If you loved Hybrid Theory, Reanimation and Meteora, this Album will leave you wondering why in the world did they change their awesome ways!

Im very let down by this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long wait for a let down","review":"I won't go into a rant, but four years is a long time to wait for a third album. LP is definatley one of my favorite bands but this isn't what I was expecting. I thought with their maturity as a band, the time given between albums and with Rick Ruben producing that this would be there masterpiece. It isn't, not even close.Mr. Hahn is no where to be found on this whole album, there is no electronica-rock-rap that make LP distinct. Mike barely raps, it seems that he took all of his ryhmes and used them for Fort Minor, and what we have left it a sappy ballad album. I won't be holding my breath for four more years for the next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh my god this is terrible","review":"what a terrible thing to do to all the lp fans...we've waited so long for a new album and this is what we get..This album is soooo slow and very tough to listen to...i would not reccomend getting this one i seriously wanted to throw this cd out the window as i was driving"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do bands \\"grow\\" and inevitably get worse?","review":"All of LP's previous stuff has been exemplary, including even the Jay Z mix and the 4 fan-special volumes.This album from another group might get 2-3 stars but from LP gets one because it's an atrocity to their name. I would have called LP my favorite group, but this is just really bland and boring and to have waited so many years...what a shame.Too bad, their reign was for a long time, but it seems every group has to fall from grace at some point. Let us just say a solemn prayer for the late LP and remember them when they were good and not destined for the closing credits on a teenage drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regretably Boring Release","review":"This album is a definite divergence from previous Linkin Park releases, and though it is similar in composition and general approach it nevertheless falls short in almost all respects. What really ruins this album is that nothing seems to fit - slow repetitive music is combined with uninteresting lyrics; fast and uniquely Linkin Park beats are combined with overly repetitive lyrics which are unimaginative and not engaging.The overall CD comes across as a poorly planned and eclectic collection - it's important to branch out and try new things, and Linkin Park should be commended for not trying to hole up in a mode established in Meteora and Hybrid Theory. At the same time, it is important not to disregard the things which worked well for this group of musicians and the fans which enjoyed such releases. Minutes to Midnight will probably disappoint any but the staunchest adherents of Linkin Park's new album of teenage-angst, punk, hip-hop, synth mix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Great Of A CD!!!","review":"I Thought This CD Was Pretty Bad!

Hybrid theory - awesome. It was innovative, it rocked, had sick hip hop riffs behind it, and led modern music in a new direction. Meteora - awesome as well, and it soidified their legacy as one of the great modern rock bands of this generation.Unfortunately, as a true linkin park fan, I urge people to NOT buy it. Listen to it at a buddies house first, then buy it if you want. Apart from \\"What I've Done,\\" this cd sounds nothing like the old LP, and more like the postal service than anything else. Which would be fine [e.g. 'My December' - a great song], but the songs on this album don't even sound good. They tried to go soft, edgy, and deep but that isn't what there good at. Common guys, where's the distortion, where's the sick piano openings, where's the DJ???And for all you cooks who gave this album above a 3 star rating...seriously...are you kidding?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Let Down","review":"Steer clear of this album if your an LP fan.

I, for one, don't buy it. Even though a few tunes rise to their former level of energy, the remainder of these songs run out of gas before the tracks end. Let's not allow today's corporate music juggernaut to say what's quality,... this LP outing is only fair at best.

I haven't bought the album yet, but I don't intend to based on the Amazon clips. I want my hard and heavy rockers back, not these EMO imposters.There are only 2 songs worth having on this album, in my opinion. What I've Done is such a teaser as the only identifiably Linkin Park song on the disk. It makes me want to go dig out Hybrid Theory and Meteora and reminisce. The other song worth having is Shadow Of The Day. I heard this song on the radio and loved it, even though at the time I had no clue it was LP. Needless to say, I was shocked when I realized that's who it was because it's completely EMO and not at all what I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"What did you guys do?!","review":"LP is one of my favorite bands! It is difficult to find a band that rocks and does not cater to bubble gum school kids. LP has shown that they can be very innovative with their music and I think Meteora epitomized that notion. The first and second albums were some of the best modern rock that I have heard! I guess every good thing must come to an end... I understand that bands want to evolve and grow as musicians, but LP does not need to do it this way! Do not ever, ever, ever, ever, ever go soft LP. I listened to a friends CD and will not be buying this. I think this band needs to step back and evaluate what made them great. Buyer beware, LP has gone soft and has decided to sell out.

After listening to it a couple of minutes I deleted from my hard drive and wished that I could get my 10 minutes back of precious time wasted listening to this!Dont get me wrong.

To hear the first combined, work of Dre, Eazy, Yella, and Ice-Cube is truly a joy, but it is not the start. Most people would abtribute the start of Gangsta-Rap to Ice-T, but even he says that he got the idea from Schooly-D. Schooly-D's \\"P.S.K.\\", is the official begining of the era. So for all you \\"New-School\\" youngins who think you know about Hip-Hop, go back and do some more research."},{"rating":"1","title":"NWA And The Posse","review":"Anyone who isn't familiar with this particular record might be surprised with what they hear. Much of the record has a disco-dance feel to it and it rarely uses the hard gangsta beats that would later make the group famous. There are really only 4 tracks worth your time and three of them are featured in remixes on better NWA albums (Boyz N The Hood on \\"Eazy-Duz It\\", 8-Ball and Dopeman on \\"Straight Outta Compton.\\") Unless you are a collector and need all of NWA's material, avoid this particular album."},{"rating":"2","title":"memories of the 70s","review":"The 20th Anniversary tape was great.You got a taste of Archie Bunker from beginning to end.Archie shocked us out of the gate, but then he filled us with laughter by the home stretch.We began to understand that Archie himself was innocently ignorant of people.My favorite line in Archie meets Sammy was \\"I know you had no choice in being colored but whatever made you turn Jew?When you watch this and hear him say this you will see that he actually does not mean any disrespect and it actually comes off very funny.Watch this tape with a light heart and be ready for lots of laughs."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY","review":"Why on earth would anyone spend 4k on this when you could spend the SAME 4k and get D3.....which is superior in EVERY way?????? Please tell me? If you have 4k and are in the market for DSL, get the D3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Megapixels don't matter.","review":"As an enthusiast, i was really impressed with the image & build quality of the D7000. I still own this camera & still love to use it for indoor work, low light performance is still impressive.The D2XS was a choice for it's speed of handling, although the megapixel count is now ancient, the image quality is truly a beautiful thing & only shooting with it can relay it's images on a personal choice level.The build quality, function structure, performance, focus speed, battery life, viewfinder are all reason enough to pick up this machine & enjoy photography.For the used price of around $1000 (with 5K shutter count) i feel lucky to have encountered such a deal.Between the D2XS & D7000, my investment was minimal to continue taking pictures with some decent gear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty but chain doesnt last","review":"my son bought this for his girlfriend for Christmas. It's very pretty but the chain is very frail and didnt last. Ended up having to buy a new chain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super explanations","review":"Borrowed this book from the library but have to buy it. It's a good reference and does great explanations. Real helpful for a novice like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Gangster","review":"Wow what a movie.Its based on a true story but I'm sure that theres alot of hollywood in it.Anyway wow is about all i can really say.The movie speaks for its self."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brutal yes; and well directed","review":"I agree with the brutal expression chosen for describing this movie. It is very hard to wacht. But if you were familiar with 70's cinema(a new form of classics) this is the movie to pay attention to.Full of what is called intertexts and references, it is produced as many of what I call the \\"new movies\\": composed in the form of related spots which are unified but have an unity by themselves. Even very well known actors (as Cuba Gooding, Jr.) protagonizes one of the spots.I disagree with the view that Russel Crowe do not play his part well. At the contrary, he, a Ridley Scott favorite, shines in some of these spots. It is amazing how this guy, who came from Australia, fitted so well in American movies.And Denzel, what can be said? he is a bombshell, born to be an actor since the first Spike Lee's movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Denzel Goes Gangsta'!!!","review":"I thought it started off really slow and thought it would never pick up. Finally, later it did. There are some parts that reminded me of 'The Godfather' The parts I liked were when there was gun-fights and some hot nude black girls help with the heroine. I probably wouldn't recommend AMERICAN GANGSTER!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Electronic Liquidators","review":"Would not buy from this seller again, I ordered items over 1 month ago and the estimated arrival time has come and gone a long time ago. I emaild this seller 3 times with no reply from the seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"American Gangster","review":"The blu ray disc was not able to play. I had to use the non blu ray disc. I had a certified technician test it and it was un playable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Danzel+Crowe=A HIT!","review":"As I looked at the total reviews, I was really surprised at the ratio of 5 stars. I guess I'm just a sucker for gangster movies and an avid fan of Denzel Washington.Yes, the plot is very similar to Serpico, HOWEVER, both are based on actual true life stories (two DIFFERENT stories). I've owned the DVD since the day it was released and I've already watched it several times with friends and family. It'll be viewed by me, many times in the future.If you are a fan of gangster films (not gang bangers), Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe...you will be entertained and suffer no buyer's remorse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Old School Cop Movie","review":"I would say this movie is a good companion piece for The French Connection, Serpico and also Prince of the City. I like the movie pretty much from top to bottom and found it to be an old school cop movie like the great ones from the 70's.I recommend it to everybody. I didn't however like that they gave it the 'feel good' ending that they did. I have also read that some of the stuff they commented on at the end about Lucas helping put so many people behind bars was b.s. so that soured me too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Denzel","review":"Denzel, Denzel, Denzel he ought to know better. I seen him in too many good movies. For some strange odd reason it's just not what I expected of him. This movie could have had more blood and guts, for him to be a gangster. I guess it was all right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dynamic true story","review":"At first, because it was rated R, I wasn't going to see it, but because it was based on a true story, I thought I'd try it. The opening scene almost made me shut it off, but I hung in there since I enjoy Denzel Washington and Russell Crow (very convincing performances). I was not dissappointed. What struck me was the contrast in the two main characters - Frank Lucas (Denzel), the suave drug dealer/businssman and Det. Richie Roberts (Russell), the humble, extremely honest cop. I grew up in NY during this time and vaguely remember hearing about that. It's a good drama, the era of the late 60s - early 70s was recreated perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Denzel does it again!","review":"Once again, Denzel Washington gives an amazing performance! This time he pairs up with Russell Crowe and the outcome is phenomenal. Make sure you watch the special features on the second disc so that you see the documentary that shows the real people behind the characters that the movie is based on...truly mind blowing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A rough & tough movie...but with \\"ganster\\" in the title, what can you expect.","review":"We had seen at the theatre but we really like Denzel Washington so we bought the movie to watch in our home.There's more bad language in it than we like, but we deal with it to watch this movie.Recommend to anyone who likes Denzel W. The only thing: he's a bad guy and we didn't like that part of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth watching!","review":"Excellent cast and excellent acting. Definitely worth renting over many other titles currently available. One of Denzel Wasington's better performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong Acting Propels Familiar Crime Saga","review":"There's little new in director Ridley Scott's \\"American Gangster.\\" However, the emphasis on characterization over violent action is refreshing. Denzel Washington gives a compelling performance as real-life Harlem drug lord Frank Lucas, with Russell Crowe equally impressive as New Jersey detective Richie Roberts - the man determined to bring down Lucas' heroin empire. An excellent supporting cast features standout portrayals by Josh Brolin and Oscar-nominated Ruby Dee. Regardless of the predictable outcome, Scott manages to keep the pot boiling for 157 minutes. \\"American Gangster\\" does not rank with the classic crime epics, but remains a solid achievement."},{"rating":"1","title":"A realistic life of Lucas would have been more interesting.","review":"Great acting, OK directing and terrible writing. Washington, Ejiofor and Crowe and great as usual, Scott seems to be bored and the writing might just be mediocre if it wasn't claimed to be \\"based on a true story.\\" Among the bizarre claims is that Frank Lucas' collaboration \\"lead to the conviction of three-quarters of the NY DEA.\\" Reality: zero convictions. He only testified against fellow dealers. Also his relationship with Bumpy Johnson has been falsified. Johnson's widow calls Lucas a liar and the movie false. These are just two of about a half dozen major distortions. Gangster movies are apparently going back to Godfather style fantasy rather than to realism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost true modern gangster film","review":"This is a very well made movie. Denzel Washington is great. The violence is as expected. The story is almost true. All-in-all, well worth the purchase price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining DVD","review":"A ton of action and thrills in this one, a great performance by Denzel, well worth the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good movie, great acting","review":"This movie was pretty good, I am not a huge fan of gangster themed movies but I got it because Denzel Washington and Russel Crowe were in it and they always are great to watch. It's a good plot, it is based on a true-story which I really liked. What I enjoyed most were the special features which show the viewer the real story that inspired the movie. If you like crime dramas, or dramas in general than you will most likely enjoy this movie. It is a little on the long side but it's worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Headed for the trash....","review":"I have been to movies for 67 years and once worked as a sound man for a R&R band. One absolute is...you never never allow the band to overwhelm the vocals. This movie does exactly that. The backround noise overwhelms the actors dialog to the point that it is impossible to understand. For the first 20 minutes it is almost impossible to figure out who the bad guys are. I have a rule..if a movie doesn't hook me in the first 20 minutes.. it goes into the trash can...this movie is in my trash can..good riddance!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped","review":"I was told American Gangster was an epic gangster movie in the tradition of the Godfather. Nothing of the kind. Instead it is another cliched and mediocre urban gangsta flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"The movie is so dark, I was unable to tell who the actors were. 10 minutes into the movie and I gave up."},{"rating":"1","title":"I fell asleep 3 times from bordom.","review":"It's true! The movie fails on all levels; Slow-paced and devoid of any meaningful continuity, it fails to encourage any concern on the part of the viewer for any of the characters. I hoped they would all die! Russel Crowe, in his inimitable style, mumbles throughout the entire movie with the exception of two lines. The hacked-up plot proves that Ridley Scott enjoys toying with the viewers mind instead of trying to create a comprehensible storyline. Maybe he hopes the viewer will think him to have a superior intellect."},{"rating":"1","title":"movie still not here nor has it been shipped","review":"I ordered the movie maybe 3 weeks ago and still havent even received an email stating its been shipped will never due business with this company again"},{"rating":"1","title":"profanity and blood","review":"I did not like Denzel Washington in this type of movie. The movie was full of violence and vulgar language. If I had known this, I would not have purchased it from Amazon. I like Denzel Washington in family type movies or movies of other types, but not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"HD Review","review":"I guess the guy above me didn't read my review. HD DVD is all done. It's Dead. Case Closed!!!!I was going to buy this on HD DVD but the extended cut is not in HD. What a joke for a DVD Format that may soon be dead. I own both HD and Blu-Ray players and I will only buy movies that have extras on them. After all, they are supposed to be able to hold much more than regular DVD.News Update!!!!!!!!!2/19/2008 The battle is over. After a few unconvincing denials of reports about the failure of the HD DVD format, Japanese electronics firm Toshiba announced on Tuesday at 5 p.m. local time (9 a.m. CET) that the HD DVD format it supported had failed to establish itself on the market.Feb. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Toshiba Corp. abandoned its HD DVD technology, surrendering the high-definition video market to Sony Corp.'s Blu-ray in the entertainment industry's largest format war since VHS beat Betamax in the 1980s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Russell Crowe gives an OSCAR PERFORMANCE","review":"Rusell Crow gives an OSCAR PERFORMANCE. Crowe is spectacular; he salvages the movie. Unfortunately for Crow that particular year the Oscars were not given based on good acting. It was one of those political based years. The movie is worth renting, perhaps on a rainy when you arrive late at the video store."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD BUT, MISSING SOMETHING? 3 1/2 STARS!","review":"I love a great gangster movie! White Heat, Scarface, The Godfather(part 1 & 2), Goodfellas, Casino.....the list goes on and on. 'American Gangster' has a great cast, excellent production, interesting story, but for all it has going for it, the film didn't completely draw me in. It's certainly worth seeing, but I don't see myself watching this movie more than one or two more times......once to see the extended addition. I rate it 3 1/2 stars. Rent it before you buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long but good","review":"I must say I really liked this movie, it is long but a very absorbing film not to violent, it may have been based on a true story but there is some stretching in the tale to be sure but it still makes a very good movie, both leads are excellent in their roles, In my book a must see movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth seeing...","review":"I saw it in my home but can honestly say if I had seen it at the theater I would've felt it was money well spent. While not normally my choice in movie; it was gritty, disturbing, and definately violent, overall, well acted and directed. We started watching this after the children went to bed and I was so tired I thought I might fall asleep; no worries, I was glued to the screen till the very end."},{"rating":"2","title":"denzel is the man","review":"This was a great movie and all the actors actreses deserve around of applause. They all should be very proud of the work that did on screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie, kinda long","review":"I liked this movie, it was a little on the long side and there were some things that just didnt make sense...I'm not sure I'll ever watch it again but its def worth having in your library."},{"rating":"1","title":"American Gangster - Bang - Boring","review":"Wish I had seen the American Gangster on the big screen. I would have asked for my money back - it was boring. My review: slow and predictable - Bang-Boring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"American Gangster","review":"Not up to expectations.
