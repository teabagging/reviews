I thought that the characters were fun (although, not as developed as I would have liked or expected), the story/plot was cute, and the ending wasn't stereotypical. My only problem with this book is just that it wasn't written with as much depth as Meg Cabots other books. In all her other books, the characters seem to be really defined and we know a lot about them and how they think and feel, but with the main character in this book, we only see how she feels about things happening in her high school. It's entertaining, and if you like Meg Cabot's other books you'll like this one too, but I still think that \\"The Mediator Series\\" is her best work yet.So, should you buy this book? Yeah, why not?

I've done my best to ensure that this is not operator error: the internal tray, lamp module, and spring are undamaged and all parts are clean; the batteries are good, the spring seats well. It looks like a design (or quality control) flaw, in that the tabs from the battery tray do not go up far enough to contact the lamp module until the lid is tightly seated, causing inconsistent operation and leaving no additional leeway for metal component wear. Sometimes a small whack at that point will get it on, and reassembling it may help - hit or miss. Coming on every time is pretty much job one for a flashlight. My other complaint is that a replacement xenon lamp module is half the cost of the flashlight at ~$11, hydrogen-absorbing catalyst pellets or not.

This book, about a teenage girl growing up in a dysfunctional family in Germany, depicts in painful detail her experimentation with drugs that soon turn to addiction and self-destruction.

The book starts out with a total of maybe 4 or 5 positions to learn....for the entire first month!Of course, you can skip ahead if you'd like, but I just like the idea of learning these somewhat simple positions and doing them over and over again (probably not the overall theme of the book, but that's kind of what I got out of it).Those more familiar with Yoga - and especially those more advanced - will probably not get much out of this book.

If you are looking for humor, there is likewise better things out there, and the same goes if you are looking for a travel account.Possibly this book could interest you if you are looking for an extremely biased rant against the current administration's policies, lacking for self-criticism.

The section on traffic analysis at least talks about a professional tool (WebTrends) but then goes down a long and unnecessarily technical talk about web logs that is sure to bore the heck out of non-technical readers.

Quite aside from the cost, I'm not sure this is so useful for some sites.There is some elementary analysis of your web access log. So you can get a measure of how successful your efforts are. But this chapter is very inadequate. There are free analysis tools available; instead of thumbing manually through the log.If you are tempted by this book, then there is a far better and more sophisticated treatment given in \\"Search Engine Marketing\\" by Moran (IBM 2005).

They throw off a tad more light as a candle - it has a flat wick of about 1/2\\" wide - certainly will not create enough light to read (not even close). If you're looking for more than mood lighting, look for a lamp with a round wick. Over the years, my lamps have developed a dull, brass patina and look wonderful - much more durable than other lamps I purchased around the same time that must be brass plated, not solid brass. These little guys have gotten awfully expensive - I think I paid about $75 for mine with gimbals back in the early 1990's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I wanted to love this product. It's so hefty and shippy. But it sheds very little light. The bars running vertically along the cage block more light than it seems they should.

The search for mellow, gimbaled, oil-based illumination continues . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dim!","review":"I have a friend who has an oil lamp for his boat, about the same size as this. It is not Weems and Plath but probably a lot cheaper. I bought this lamp hoping to get the same warm glow in the cabin of my boat as he has in his (both 30' boats). I got the premium oil, high quality, put it in the lamp and lit it. I was very disapointed!!! I let it burn for over an hour thinking the wick might need some conditioning. I could not read a book 2ft away from this lamp. It also oscillated, went from dim to dimmer every 2 seconds or so. This was in still air.

I spent over $150 in books, but they'll come in handy once I'm in grad school anyway. I haven't received my score yet but I know I could have done better only if I'd given myself more time and had a better memory -- through no fault of the book. Also helpful was the book of tests published by ETS -- they really prepare you. As another reviewer mentioned, the test contains more 20th c., African-American and new theory questions (phenomenological criticism?) than the guide warns but that's the only criticism. Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Robin White knows Russia","review":"I won't dwell on plot since the professional reviews have done that. Rather, I'd like to focus on White's ability as a writer to construct an intricate plot built around his experiences and knowledge of Russia, especially Siberia. In each of his books, we learn quite a bit about the Russian political landscape, and about Siberia in particular. While his plots are top notch, his characters are well fleshed-out and \\"typically Russian\\". In every successful novel set in Russia, there is an ambience which distinguishes it from any other type of novel. It's that feeling of hope without hope, that bleakness of landscape paralleling the Russian soul, which nevertheless survives all the stronger for the strife it has been subjected to. Robin White is the master of that landscape and I await his next effort with much anticipation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I wanted to like it, but I gave it five chapters and nothing really happened.

Is that the name of the band or the album, or both? But after putting this CD through it's paces in my CD changer, it has come out on top time and time again. It is a pretty chillin' CD throughout with a solid baja vibe. It is smooth listening all the way through, although there is one song that is a little creepy at points (but still good). It is interesting to note that on their new album, Rebel Radio, they take that same song, turn it inside out and produce one of the best jazz tracks I have heard in a long time. This band is very talented and is a great find. Senor Ronnie knows what the hell he is doing. I have been listening to their new one quite a bit now, and love it just the same (if not a bit more).

It has the feel of a mario world but expands beyond that to include difficult puzzle solving. You have to herd various creatures into their pens.

I enjoyed the book but found myself not doing the exercises regularly, or understanding them fully, until I got the video. If I'd had the patience, the book would probably have been sufficient. The video is extremely well organized and direct. Nancy Zi is a charismatic teacher. The video production, including new-age type music, is excellent. It's a pleasure to put on this video and be guided through tension-reducing/ energy-creating exercises - especially at the end of the work day. I get recharged and can restart my day, so to speak. The book is an excellent reference for the video, since the book goes into much more detail. Also, the book offers approximately 15 additional routines for specific applications. That said, the video, in my opinion, is still worth buying by itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"From the people in Coldcut comes a sonic extravaganza...","review":"DJ Food is a collaboration between the founders of the down-tempo groovers Coldcut and this definately marks a change in their musical evolution. Whilst Coldcut's music is Jazzy and uptempo, 'Kaleidoscope' represents a distinctly more dramatic and experimental turn. The main style of the album is that of an aural landscape which succeeds in letting the imagination soar amongst the synths and whispered beats of the album. The only tracks which differ from this style are 'aging young rebel' which sounds like something a stoned Morricone would write, and is no less good for that, and Nocturne which is a fantastic tune, rising xylophone beats and breaks. If you want challenging original and provocative music then buy this, it's definately worth your while."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Performance","review":"if there were a different medium for this release to be sold as, i'd have it be a play. the album wasn't composed with this in mind, but the final product plays like some sort of strange musical. you'd think that all the songs were composed by different people, because of all the musical ground that it covers. while remaining generally jazz, it bounces all over the place. kind of like this review. the first few songs are standalone masterpieces of sonic genius. the rest of the album is a chilled out dub jazz soundscape, that you don't want to be released from when it finally ends. pick this one up, and have some fun listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful experimental effort","review":"This album creates a beautiful soundscape, especially starting with Ageing Young Rebel (track 5). This track has a mysterious film-noir feel, coupled with a 1950's beat sensibility. It's sly and clever, and talks about how as we live our lives out, we lose touch with ourselves and just get 'normalized' by the society we live in. After track 5, the album delves more deeply into a kind of classical feel. It's very moody, velvety, and puts you into a kind of trance. Overall, this is just an excellent album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"potential","review":"this is the first album ive picked up from food and i was impressed. i felt the whole album from beginning to end but i couldnt help also feel that he was holdin back quite a bit. however, it is a good buy worthy of your dollars in my opinion. its still original and unique and thats the reason i listen to and love music. thank you. enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth a read...","review":"A well illustrated and very interesting book which gives the full historical background to the development of this iconic motocycle.

He has the likes of Ruben Blades and Bela Fleck helping out. His brother plays cello on it too. He wrote most of the songs and they are beautiful. I especially liked the cover of Dust in the Wind. I kept waiting for Steve Walsh to start the vocals! It's very easy to listen to. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"excellent, easy to listen to. The man has talent.

Far from it. I'm a rather intense Red Sox fan and music buff. When I heard that Bernie had a CD out I just had to give it a listen. From the \\"get your feet moving\\" sounds of \\"Las Salsa en Mi\\" to the contemplative sounds of \\"Just Because\\" the CD covers a great range of moods. \\"Samba Novo\\" makes me think of Bola Sete and I love the cover of \\"Dust in the Wind\\" ...this album gets regular playtime on my MP3 player.Kinda funny, but I bought this at the same time I picked up Red Sox pitcher Bronson Arroyo's \\"Covering the Bases\\" and I don't know if I've even listened to it all the way through.Maybe Bernie and Russ Freeman (Rippingtons) should do some collaborative work."},{"rating":"2","title":"relaxing","review":"\\"The Journey Within\\" is a relaxing cd.

I was impressed with Bernie's guitar playing on this song. I thought I might be wrong about what I thought his CD would sound like. Unfortunately I bought the CD and its not very good. It is pretty whimpy even for smooth jazz! Many of the songs sound alike and Bernie's guitar playing is nothing to write home about. If it weren't for the above mentioned song the CD would be a complete dud! Maybe when Bernie retires and can spend more time developing his style and his sound will improve but for now pass on this CD unless your a big Yankee fan. It's just not very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but...","review":"Except for the last cut (\\"Williams Kids\\") the CD is great. Everything it's advertised to be. The last cut on the CD killed it entirely. Having the Williams kids, however cute they may be, on a jazz CD was totally inappropriate. The mood created by the other cuts was completely destroyed by the last cut. But for the fact that I received the CD as a Christmas gift, I would have tossed it in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Am Shocked At How Bad This Cd Is.","review":"I can since that there are alot of Yankee fans reviewing this cd not on the basis of the music, but on the performance of a ball player on a field. Let's get serious, this cd stinks. If this is the best that he can do. He is in serious trouble. All of the songs sound the same. There is no one song that stands out, they all sort of mesh together. He does have the ablity to play, but he is one dimensional. He should have waited to put this out when his music developed a little more. He has no style, there is nothing that says \\"hey that's bearnie\\". When you hear Boney, you know it's him. When you hear Pat Matheny you know it's him, they have a unique style. When you hear this you just say. I wasted money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth on the Field and in the Studio!","review":"I purchased this CD for no other reason than because I am a Yankees fan. I thought it would be great to have the limited addition cover and perhaps even get it signed someday. But what I ended up with was a true treasure. Being the avid Yankee follower that I am I was well aware that he played the guitar and even that he had gone to a music high school in Puerto Rico, but I really had no idea the extent of his talent. I knew that he was a great ball player, but assumed that he was probably decent at best muscially. Boy was I wrong. I listen to this cd over and over again. It has a soothing quality about it and when the work day is getting rough.... I just slip on my headset and Bernie takes all the pressure away. I bought the cd out of intrigue and now cant wait to see what he comes out with next. Bernie's music is just as smooth as his multiple gold glove fielding performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Home Run!","review":"This CD has two good things going for it. Number one, it's by one of my favorite New York Yankee players and number two, it's a smooth jazz album. There is one question though, \\"Is it a great CD?\\" Well, I must say that though its not the best CD I've heard, it is a very good debut by the 4-time World Series Champion centerfielder.The CD has a lot of good tunes, including \\"Just Because\\" and \\"The Way\\". Bernie is also accompanied by a great supporting cast that includes David Benoit, Bela Fleck and Ruben Blades. Bernie has a nice, flamenco flavor to his playing. It's definitely a compliment to years of work. Bernie reportedly said that if he didn't become a baseball player, he would have been a musician. I do believe he has the makings of a second career long after his baseball playng days are over. Maybe he and former NBA all-star and bass player, Wayman Tisdale can make a collaboration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like the Hardy Boys, but better","review":"When I was younger I used to read the Hardy Boys books, which were great.

Although all the controls, and most of the characters are the same, this game has changed a lot from the original. objectives such as \\"Get Chuck Unstuck\\" are hilarious new additions that were never on any of the other games. I especially like the fact that Chuck runs around complaining about his tounge no matter how many times you play the level, and no matter how many times you run poor chuck over because he got in your way... Don't you think Chuck should have learned to get out of the way? Oh well... poor Chuck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Online","review":"I have read in a magazine that you cane go online with this game.

So if you already own THPS3, you've had the first adapter-ready title under your nose this whole time.\\" You can find about this information in a Electronic Gaming Monthly Magazine which is on page 102, issue 155 with the SOCOM US Navy Seals on the front cover of this magazine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't put it down...","review":"Warning: Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 is highly addicting. Ever since I bought this game I haven't been able to put it down. It was a little difficult to get used to at first, but now I'm pulling off 400,000-point combos with ease. The revert is a nice addition, and unlocking Darth Maul made the hours spent impressing those girls on the Cruise Ship worth it. The soundtrack is excellent (Xzibit's \\"Paparazzi\\" is one of my favorite rap songs ever), but it's too bad that almost none of them appear on the actual soundtrack.

This is no different than the first or second one, with the exception of new levels, which are basically the same as the last two game's levels. And there's online play. Well big deal. It's not like too many people go online with their Ps2 anyways. I don't see how they keep getting away with re-releasing the same game with a different number at the end of the title.

Despite all of the compliments on the game, I had my doubts. The game came out in 2001, so would it be dated? I went ahead and bought myself a copy anyway. I did not make a bad choice. The graphics are great, the gameplay is incredible. Sure, THPS3 might not have the enormous levels of THUG, but there are still tons of things to do in every level. Though the game is very easy to beat, the replayability is amazing. Each time you beat the game, a new secret is unlocked. From skating as Darth Maul to playing classic levels from THPS1, the secrets are always fun and surprising. Featuring many different pro skaters, the variety never gets old. A perfect score from me, and may you have many fun-filled hours playing this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Suprised - Very Disapointed","review":"I would have to say i was disapointed after playing Tony Hawks Pro Skater 3. I have the second one and i love it. The grafiucs are good, music is fine, bla bla bla. But the game is just flat out hard. It has stupid, nearly impossible missions and tasks. The tricks you could do in the second were totally different. Its a good game for people who have the patience and the devotion to constantly work on a game to beat the first few levels. I think people just gave it 4s and 5s because they don't want to sound like Pu**ies for not being able to do anything. My friends and I all gave it a 2 out of 5. We'll stick to Grand Theft Auto 3..

It's a really good price, because it's kind of old, but the graphics really aren't bad. There's tons of different ways to play the game (free skate, S-K-A-T-E, graffiti, etc.) which makes it an interesting game to play for a long time. Unlocking the levels proves a little difficult sometimes, but I wouldn't want it to be too easy.My only complaint would be that the game needs a vert ramp...nothing fancy, just something that is similar to the thing pictured on the front of the box!!! That kind of tricked me a little and I figured they would have a vert ramp in it. There are plenty of half pipes you can find in various locations, but they're too small. A true vert ramp seems like it would be really cool for trying to do bigger tricks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun stuff","review":"This is a great game that builds off of the ideas set forth in the first couple of Tony Hawk Pro Skaters.

The controls are unbeiliebaly simple to learn, but still take some time to master. Once you do however, skating around the game's huge levels will feel like second nature.The graphics are good.

Also, I have epilepsy.I went over to my friend's house (a gamer) and he said that with some luck and a fork, I could make a character that looks like me. Buddy, he was right. It was neat to see myself jamming and thrashing on the verve pipe.Some times I felt like Tony Hawk was gonna jump out of the screen and slap me because it was sooooo real. He was so real. It hurts when he slaps.It also hurts when I pee if some soap got down there.A guy in the Canada level had the same problem.This is a good game.

From a Trinitarian viewpoint, Buzzard and Hunting are helpful if only for gaining an understanding of where my Unitarian (e.g. Jehovah's Witness) friends are coming from, though I remain unconvinced. If you're looking for something which comprehensively sets out the arguments for believing that God is not a Trinity, then this book will be helpful.

For some reason I find her patter not as annoying as say Jillian who is nonstop (no wonder they offer a no talk option) also she does all the exercise without much effort (take a page from her book Jillian!). Suffice it to say it comes down to what you want in a video and I do want them to call the change without having to constantly looking at the screen. Though Cathe sometimes will forget to call a change this is not a long video and you can anticipate the next segment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Again???","review":"I find some of the songs danceable, but not really my favorite style.

These songs have already been published as part of \\"Belly Dance - An Erotic Blend of Music\\". It was also published as \\"Modern Belly Dance by Maroon Shaker\\" - once again a different picture. The songs are identical, not even worked over and republished with a different sound. Enough already!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Earthy New Age Style","review":"I really like this CD. Most of the songs are within 4 to 5 minutes long. There's a few slower songs and a variety of faster songs in several rhythms.

I recommend it for anyone who likes a softer \\"tribal style\\" or \\"new age/goddess\\" style belly dance, and/or for those American Cabaret-style dance lovers who enjoy the lush sounds of celebration in the desert."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful journey to the heart of showbusiness","review":"I loved this book and warmly recommend it to anyone interested in Shirley Maclaine's life. Maclaine proves an engaging and entertaining narrator, her writing spilling over with wit and charm in equal helpings. The book was written after her Oscar win in 1983 and she tells the story of her route from childhood ballet classes to musical theatre and eventually to screen stardom. Much of the book deals with her relationship with her parents and the part they played in her journey. They come across as complicated and somewhat vulnerable characters who seem frustrated that they didn't pursue their own artistic ambitions with the same single-mindedness as their daughter. Overall, it's a great feel-good book bursting with plenty of spark and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product great price","review":"It does exactly what it's supposed to.

It's by far too weak and possibly only works if standing completely straight up. My microphone is attached to a boom so I can use it easily while sitting, however the arm on the Nady MPF-6 makes it completely unusuable.

If I wanted it for a microphone stand, it would have been a steal. It will cover just about any sized microphone, is made from good solid metal, and does its job as advertised. My only problem is that the online page gives you the impression that it is perfect for a desk-top microphone like the ones popular for podcasting. Nothing is further from the truth. The clamp will only fit on classic microphone stand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Pop Filter that does it job","review":"This pop filter is very effective in removing the pop if you're using condenser mics.

I've been using this filter for the last couple and have had mixed success using it with two different mics (A Samson C01U and a Studio Projects C-1). Unfortunately, errant pops sneak into my recordings fairly often. I will grant that they're quiet pops, only loud enough to be heard with studio headphones. But still, a quiet pop is just enough to ruin the recording if you strive for professional quality. If you're a hobbyist looking for a cheap filter that'll work okay, go ahead and grab it; just be aware that some pops will show up in your recordings. If you're looking for something that will completely eliminate all plosives, I'd recommend paying a little extra money for something better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutly Worth It!!!","review":"I personally use this pop filter over my blue snowball microphone to record SC2 shoutcasts.

It's an invaluable asset.Also even though this is not the cheapest pop filter you can buy. It is definitely the best quality to price point I could find. And trust me, quality is huge in this sort of product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Neck Quality Compromises Product","review":"The flexible neck between the clamp and the ring isn't strong enough to carry the weight of the nylon filter. The result is a pop filter which cannot be used with boom mic stands. The filter refuses to stay in place, and will drop the moment you remove your hands.

It is priced reasonably and does what it is supposed to do. It effectively reduces the \\"pop\\" sounds created when a person close talks the microphone and speaks a word with a \\"P\\" sound. The flexible metal pipe allows the filter to be moved to the optimum position.Issues: The clamp doesn't hold as tightly as it should to the microphone stand. The metal pipe is somewhat difficult to maneuver.

THE REASON WHY 1 START IS BECAUSE IT CAME TO ME BROKEN! THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE GOOSE NECK AND THE CLAMP IS LOOSE!IT'S SUCH AN INCONVENIENCE JUST TO RETURN AN ITEM TO SELLER, PAY FOR MAILING IT AND WAIT FOR A VERY LONG TIME TILL YOU GET IT BACK! These companies should know that and should do strict quality control on their items. It's just a Microphone Pop Filter! MAKE IT RIGHT PEOPLE!!!! DON'T INCONVENIENCE YOUR CUSTOMERS!!!TO THE POSSIBLE BUYERS:CONSIDER WHAT I WROTE HERE. THE PRODUCT IS MADE IN CHINA AND I FIND IT TOO PRICEY FOR HOW IT WAS MADE.

I was not sure it would work as well as my other filter filter or wind screen, but it works very well. It's easy to get used to and the clamp fits all my mic stands in my home studio including a tripod extension without adding a lot of weight. It looks a little bit odd at first, but it does exactly what it is supposed to do. For a long time I have worked a mic close with a pop filter fitted over the pickup area.

I couldn't afford the Kodaly books, so I thought this would be a good start.What a disappointment! A lot of the games involve blindfolding the students, which isn't appropriate in classrooms anymore, especially because most elementary music classes will have 20-30 kids, no matter what size the school. On top of that, the games don't actually involve the kids singing much - there are rhythm games, but good ones are very few.Overall, this book seems very outdated in it's ideas and games.

I took the blanket out and voila- not only it didn't retain any of the scent, but all the dirt stayed exactly where it was. So I had to rewash the blanket in Era.

The game is absolutely awesome. I got Thunderstrike, GTA3, Smugglers Run2 and this game for Christmas and caught myself playing AC4 the most so far. The only drawback is there are only 18 missions. I think going back to the missions with different aircraft will be fun. As well as upping the level of difficulty. I played it on normal since the beginning. Landing on the carrier is fun as well as watching the awesome replay of the missions. Graphics are unreal. It looks like watching a movie. The only drawback is I wish they would have used a normal enemy. Iraq, Iran, whoever. I don't really like the Eurasions story plot. I like going up against a real enemy. Looking forward to the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"ACE COMBAT SHATTERD SKIES","review":"This game has amazing graphics. It was a challenge to beat the game.

The graphics rival most PC games and the gameplay is smooth and deep. Scenery is incredible - landscape doesn't lose much quality as you fly close as with many flight sims. Only real detraction is the story-line.

The good stuff with this simulator is it's realistic and has an engaging story line and has almost no bad stuff except for saying swears, but that is what you hear over the radio. My favorite part of Ace Combat '04 is it's exiting when I accomplish hard missions. But I'm furious when I get shot down. I recommend this for ages 7+ because kids under 7 might not get the story.

Its very limited with such things like landings being optional and the ability to just fly off the map to reload.Timed missions are annoying, sometimes you want to just fly around after the mission, and destroy more targets, but you can't because the times up and the mission is over.Cut scenes are ultra-cheesy illustrations and a dumb story.Different airplanes don't behave that differently.

First of all he jumps around from one musician to the next without sometimes giving even any small details about them, their songs or albums would be nice!He jumps around too much from one genre to the next, it is frustrating.My next problem was that for the price you pay for this skinny book you should at least get a CD with the songs he gives details about. All he does is recommend you go to ITunes!! Why not just tell people to go to Project Playlist, at least that's free.The most annoying thing is that I love music and this book made me hate the class, I kept wanting to rip it to pieces it is written so badly!!Don't buy this book if you can avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strontium 90 - 'Police Academy' (Ark 21)","review":"Anyone remember Mike Howlett?He was bassist for the band Gong until he left in 1977.Within that same timespan he just happen to bring together an unknown singer (we now) know as Sting together with drummer Stewart Copeland and guitarist Andy Summers to play on his demo.Strontium 90 was a short lived band but they did manage to perform at a large hippie festival in Paris in May,1977 where the three live tracks on this release was taped,\\"Three O'Clock Shot\\",\\"Electron Romance\\" and \\"Lady Of Delight\\".The ONLY Police cut on here you're likely to recognize is \\"Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic\\".The only other decent tunes here are \\"Visions Of The Night\\" and \\"Towers Tumbled\\" because they do feature Sting's trademark vocals.I was pretty dissapointed with 'Police Academy' mostly for the reason is that it just SEEMS that it could've been so much better.On the upside,however if you happen to be a MAJOR Police nut,you may very well enjoy it.Nice cover,though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recorded motor noise spoils otherwise superb camera","review":"After researching the digital camcorder field for three years, I decided this camera looked like the best in the less-than-$400 market. The camcorder performed magnificently for me for the three weeks I had it and it has an extraordinary feature set for the money. However, the motor emits an extremely annoying noise which is captured on the tape and sounds like you were recording everything in a machine shop. On going back to the Internet and researching other reviews, I found that this is a very common problem with this camera. So sad! I loved this camera, but the recorded motor whine killed what was otherwise a 5-star camcorder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"DO NOT buy this if camcorder your computer does not have a Firewire/IEEE 1394 DV Terminal. Our computer is only 7 months old and we do not have this Firewire connection, so we went to Best Buy to get a $50 converter cable so we could transfer the videos and burn DVD's. No luck, even with the extra cable, the videos require Firewire connection to transfer to the computer. I have returned the Elura after this discovery and ordered the Sony DCR-DVD108 DVD Handycam Camcorder with 40x Optical Zoom. This one records directly to the mini DVD's and plays perfectly on DVD players and the computer. Plus I can burn extra DVD's to send to family. Highly recommend the Sony, but not this Canon Elura."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good camera for the price","review":"I purchased this camera for work and have been satisfied with the results. I interview members of the community for our oral history project and video tape them to record it. The camera is not professional quality, but on our small museum's budget it does the trick. The images are clear, the camera is easy to use and small enough to haul around when doing interviews at people's homes. I purchased a firewire connection so I can upload the images onto the computer and make DVDs of the oral histories. They might not be movie quality, but they are good enough for displaying in exhibits and for researchers to access.If you want this camera for home use or other small events I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't escape motor noise in DV mode","review":"First off this is a pretty good DV camera for the most part but my pet peeve was the design is misleading...The mic jack is limited...After my first recoerding I heard the faint motor noise. So to counter act this I thought I could use a wireless mic and that would get rid of the noise...not! the mic jack can only be used in dubbing mode thats a great feature if you are editing film on the camera but for my uses (i use a video editing program) it's worthless.This is the only thing I hate about this camera. Evrything else is great!p.s. Recording on the SD card feature from the tape is awesome too! especially if you are using the night vision mode I sugest you don't use it directly on SD this will make it record slow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good video quality but horrible sound distortion","review":"The video quality on this camera was great but all that was ruined by a VERY VERY loud tape drive. The sound coming from the MiniDV tape drive was so loud that it was picked up by both the built-in microphone AND an external microphone placed a good 5-6 inches from the unit. The distortion was so bad I returned the camera. Canon needs to address this issue as I have been reading about this a lot lately. Let the buyer beware with this camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tape drive noise makes this camcorder unusable","review":"I got this because cnet recommended it as the best budget camcorder. Unfortunately, the microphone picks up the whirring of the tape drive while it records. During playback the whirring on the tape is so loud it makes the video unwatchable. If you've ever watched an old silent movie on a projector and can remember all of the noise that the projector makes, well that's the level of noise that gets recorded to your tape.I returned mine and would not recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Canon Elura 100~ wow, the whirring noise is overpowering!","review":"I just received the canon elura from Butterfly Photo and am promptly returning it for another. I hope not to have the same issue with the motor noise, but the one they sent was terrible. I recorded for about five minutes and the replay on both the camera and T.V. was very noticable and problematic. I went to Best Buy to hear their floor model and did not hear anything compared to what this camera's motor noise was emitting. Did Butterfly Photo send me a refurbished camera? It seems that there have been various reports of this issue. Obviously, some of the cameras do not have the motor noise problem, while others clearly do. Butterfly promptly sent another camera without the motor noise. Thanks!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor Noise Unbearable","review":"I second the review below. Overall the I liked the size and features of this camera. The only reason it went back was due to the motor noise being picked up by the camera microphones. Even my wife who is essentially tone deaf picked up on the noise in the background. Tried two different cameras with the same result. I have owned two Canon still cameras and been very happy. I am very disappointed that Canon would release a product with this type of design flaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying motor noise!","review":"I ordered the camera from Crutchfield on a Saturday and the camera came on Friday. I read reviews about motor noise but decided to buy it anyway. I should have listened to the reviews on Amazon.com, I noticed motor noise also. It was annoying to hear while recording, also while playing back on the computer or TV.I returned the Cannon to Crutchfield and ordered a Panasonic PV-GS300 camcorder from Amazon.com. Virtually silent operation, could not hear the motor noise at all during playback. The picture quality is excellent since it has three CCD's.I would not recommend buying this camera since the motor noise is annoying, and my fianc? heard the noise too."},{"rating":"2","title":"great buy","review":"This camera was a gift for my daughter, it has met or exceeded all of her needs.

It cost $329 with free shipping from Amazon. The camera does have some minor motor noise, but nothing the lay person would notice. The camera is feature pack (other reviews have gone into detail) and has a great picture. Most of all, I love the you can easily change the analog out to analog in from any source (old 8MM vids), connect firewire from the camera to my computer and either save on hard drive or burn a dvd of my old videos. Nothing else on the market comes close to this camera for under $500. I would also recommend buying the Cannon bag, as everything fits into it quite nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"This is an amazing camera for the money, still pictures are just above cell phones quality but with better optics, but when it comes to video... it outperforms many other more expensive camera..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much motor noise comes through on playback","review":"I just purchased this camcorder and I will make two observations supporting what many others have stated- both here and in other reviews. The motor noise is for real. The noise I am getting is a high pitched motor/ tape transport noise that is annoying while shooting and a major problem on playback. There is also a lower pitched constant rumble that combines with the high pitched noise to really ruin the playback experience. I tested this in different environments, and it is clearly the camcorder and not any surrounding noises.The only other negative thing that other reviews mention and that I will confirm is that it is, for me, an uncomfortable camcorder to hold. Try before you buy. If it were not for the motor noise I could live with the way it is held.Other than that, this is a great little camcorder. Too bad about the noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm very satisfied","review":"The experts had a lot of good things to say about this camera, so I bought one.I would recommend this camera to anyone who intends to transfer their footage to a computer for (even small amounts of) editing and eventual transfer to DVD.The still images, while of decent quality (especially with respect to the price of the camera) are not great. The still images appear to be highly sensitive to hand motion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice portable camcorder","review":"The camcorder is very portable and easy to use. We shot video at a conference swim meet and the Elura did very well in those light conditions. So far, my main problem has been the joystick on playback. The other controls are very well designed."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's good for the cost","review":"I just got this camara yesterday. Having never previously owned one I was quite naive in my selection even after having read pages of reviews.The directions were easy enough to follow and it was up and running in a short time.The playback noise is not really so bad. It exists, but is only evident if there is no other sound. The ability to attach a microphone that does not need to be held would be beneficial.Similarly, it would be nice to be able to attach a light. The mega light helps but is not very \\"mega\\".The strap seems hard to adjust. The camera is difficult to hold and I have been using both hands.On the positive side, the zoom is great, the steady shot feature is very helpful and the videos are good.It's not a $3,000 camera so why expect it to perform as one. It does a fine job for the price. You need to shop for the features you want most as they won't all be on one machine in this price range.Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this if you can","review":"I am sorely disappointed with this camcorder. Its lighting is not only poor -its erratic !! Sometimes at whatever angle I record, even in bright light, the resulting picture has unpredictable dark and bright lighting.

Don't be trapped","review":"I just returned one canon elura 100 camcorder today. The white balance of this products is so bad that it looks like there is a red filter in front of your camcorder. And this defect cannot be solved whether in auto mode, indoor mode or sun light mode. Really bad experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginners","review":"This camcorder delivers on everything promised: great picture, impressive widescreen mode, ease of operation with optional limited manual controls. Works well with iMovie. Transferring analog tape (VHS, VHS-C, 8mm) to either DV or computer is very easy with minimal quality loss. Still shots are easy to capture with decent quality.Shipped UPS from JR Computer/Music World. Packaging and all components in excellent condition. Shipping was fast.---There does exist an underlying motor noise. The noise is especially noticeable indoors. Battery life could be longer. I would definitely recomend a spare battery. You'll also need a firewire cable (not included) to transfer your DV tapes to a computer.---I would highly recomend this to anyone wanting a quality, user-friendly camcorder. However, the bells and whistles are found elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon Elura Digital Camcorder","review":"Overall the camera is fine. The only complaint, which I had already heard about going into purchasing, was the fact that the images can look dark when shooting inside, even with the light on. The camera would be perfect if the lighting was better or you could add a light. The functions are great and easy to use and undersatnd, especially if you have used other Canon digital cameras before. It is good buy for my first camcorder. I would recommend this camera to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT","review":"I am not a professional camera person. So I can only talk about personal home usage of this camera.

User manual is very well written and cross-referenced throughout. Really like it. Good value.Cons: The position of telephoto/wide-angle slide button and other top mounted controls uses index finger (this is a \\"for right-handed\\" camera) which for large hands and long fingers is difficult to use while holding cam still. Will not take an SD card greater than 2 Gb, which the manual says has not been tested for more than that. I tried a 4 Gb.

I guess it was okay for others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor noise not acceptable","review":"The Elura 100 had all the features I wanted, but the unit I ordered had unacceptable motor noise.

The important information on the various types of dyes and basic dyeing techniques is brief. Since the book was published in 1988, many of the brands of dyes and sources are no longer valid. If you are looking for a book that will tell you the best dyes and current brands to use on various natural and synthetic fabrics and blends, this book isn't it. It is fine if you can buy the book for $5 or just want some dyeing project ideas. However, for fabric dyeing fundamentals, there are better, newer books.

This dictionary is good in that all Japanese translations are given in both romanized text, hiragana and kanji readings. There are also numerous examples of sentences used for each word. However, the main drawback is the rather limited word count: There are only 6,000 entries. The dictionary is really aimed at the study room rather than as a useful reference to aid immediate communication.

Because of this, he can't put a sentence together to save his life. I had to re-read sentence upon sentence. This is a very, very tedious book. It is so predictable I feel like charging him for the hours I spent reading his silly book. Anderson must know the NY reviewers who gave this book rave reviews.

To compare this resoundingly dull thud of a book to the glorious work of Trollope shows remarkable ignorance.

It's impossible to keep track of all of these characters and formulate a good idea of what they're actually like.

I didn't feel for Lizzie or George and their gimme-gimme lives and by the end---yes I read the whole damn thing, brought it to the beach with me and had no other reading material---secretly hoped that George's plane was going to crash en route to Mexico! Wouldn't recommend reading it unless you have alot of time to waste...life's too short!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for the turn of the century","review":"Sure there are plenty of comparisons to Tom Wolfe. Yes, the book may be a bit long for some. But what a great story Kurt Anderson has put together. And it finishes just as strong as it starts. Remember all the television coverage ringing in the new year? How we all became glued to the hype and hoopla? Now imagine all those TV and marketing and software execs spinning their wheels right now trying to come up with the Next Big Thing. Basically, that's where Anderson takes you with Turn of the Century. I personally liked the character of George McTier a great deal (most of the time). Harold Mose offers reminders of those media titans we all read about in the magazines and see on TV. And the world Anderson creates really isn't that far off the mark. This novel moves at top speed. And speed kills... at least careers and brain cells for some characters. A great (and long) read that kept me entertained from start to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"a big messy satire","review":"I can understand why so many people gave up on this book, but I can't help but feel sorry that they did. For me, Kurt Andersen wrote a novel that perfectly reflects the CNN/Fox News sound bite journalism and MTV/YouTube short attention span entertainment that rules our culture today not just with his story, but with the structure of the book. He overloads the reader with information which he repeats again and again until it finally comes together like the sections of a pointillist painting to present Andersen's very cynical and very funny view of the Information Age. It's like a mirror reflecting a mirror, reflecting a mirror, ad infinitum. I admit it's not an easy read, but if you can dance through it, you'll find a story and point of view that's unusually original, entertaining, and most definitely worthwhile. As for me, I'm off to buy Heyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read","review":"This book was thoroughly enjoyable. Kurt Anderson has an entertaining and very interesting writing style. Great final 100 pages. I highly recommend Turn of the Century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comparisons to \\"Bonfire\\" are apt","review":"Reading these reviews, it seems to be quite a controversial book... people either love it or hate it, with little middle ground. I loved it in quite the same way I loved \\"Bonfire of the Vanities,\\" as a comedy very much of the time. There were so many good ideas on almost every page, several of which would seem to be the catalyst for novels of their own. As a snapshot of our times, the novel's windows on LA, NY, Seattle, software and media were so funny and appalling. And as a guy who works peripherally in the TV business, the TV parts seemed very accurate. I had a major difficulty with the ultimate fate of a major character (and I'd appreciate an e-mail from someone who can explain this unmotivated plot development late in the book---what did I miss?) but I really enjoyed this novel. I wonder what people who complain that this book was \\"boring\\" were reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharply satirical, excellent debut novel about our times","review":"This is to the 90's what Tom Wolfe's \\"The Bonfire of the Vanities\\" is to the 80's, although saying \\"Turn of the Century\\" pales in comparison is not an overstatement. Andersen's debut novel asks a lot from his readers: they must possess more than a passing interest in technology, business, finance and the entertainment industry--and have a deep appreciation of satire and all things ironic. That said, he cleverly skewers our society's mores, and creates many indelible characters in the process. Are any of the characters or events farfetched? Hardly. I also found myself imagining WHO will ultimately be caste in the film version. Note to Mr. Andersen: Don't let Hollywood do to yours what they did to Tom Wolfe's masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous, satirical take on media, technology, and wealth","review":"Kurt Anderson has pegged it. Since finishing Turn of the Century, I am reminded over and over again of how precise, how deliciously satirical it is. Everyday happenings and conversations, news stories about media and technology -- everything reminds me of something that could have happened to Anderson's characters. He is dead on in his interpretation of our taking ourselves and our nation's wealth too seriously. Plus, Chapter 48 wraps up a wonderful subplot that no one who uses Windows should go without reading. Bravo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A snooze by an editor who badly needs an editor","review":"This isnt a novel, it's a screed with a few potted jokes, most delivered with hamhanded timing, about the author's pals in the New York media, a world that I'm sure fascinates us all. A few passages come alive, the characters never do. (Dick Tracy was more three-dimensional.) As a piece of hype, it's the literary equivalent of the movie Titanic. As a piece of literature, it's the faux-literary equivalent of the boat Titanic. Save yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"George Will scewers this thing! Absolutely barbeques it!","review":"I'm writing this as a public service announcement: George Will, syndicated columnist, labels this book, \\"The Snobs Guide To The Millenium\\" in his latest column. Very funny commentary on sheer, unadulterated shallowness sold as reading material. Great commentary! A novel that aspires to be read by people caught up with their own self-indulgent self-importance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most boring book I've ever read","review":"This is a boring, pretentious book which, for me, did not in any way live up to its great reviews. I purchased the book based on what I had read about it, and if I say that I am disappointed, that is the understatement of the century, both the twentieth and the twenty-first. If one is not into computerese, the book does not make sense. The characters are one dimensional and cartoon-like. Wish I had my money back from amazon.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Celebration of Shallowness","review":"This is a shallow, nauseating book that suffers from the very qualities it ostensibly critiques -- shallowness, emptiness, lack of values. It does capture these money-obsessed, depth-free times, but inadvertantly -- by mirroring them."},{"rating":"1","title":"The View is not Worth the Climb","review":"After thrilling to the first 100 pages or so, I waited for some semblance of a plot to begin. I'd seen Charlie Rose interview the author, became intrigued, and bought this book in hardcover, breaking one of my cardinal rules. After 400 pages of snide media references and product placements,I gave up, realizing that the characters were too steeped in their cliches to become 3 dimensional, and if any plot were to develop this late in the game, it would not be worth it. All Style, no substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Terrible, Terrible Book","review":"It's really awful. Trust me. Worse -- it's BORING! Satire should be funny, cutting and inventive -- not read like a bad public access comedy skit. Mr. Kurt is not a very good writer, and should not be publishing fiction of this low quality. It has many of the hallmarks of workshop writing: the clumsy sentences, the characters cribbed from sit-coms, the overdone attempts at humor. The author is like a very young writer who needs more practice, reading time, and a good editor. It's quite surprising, really, that it got published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soulless","review":"Having just read today's NY Times, I can tell Martin Arnold why this book has not sold: you cannot fool the people. To even 'hip Type A' New Yorkers, Turn of the Century is banal, boring, and soulless. Where is the language of a novel? The poetry? This is so far from Bonfire it's ridiculous. There's nothing to care about it in here and the reading public senses it. Much ado about nothing. Random House should get the money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"The least interesting piece of fiction of the decade.....","review":"I gave up after 200 pages. No character registered, the \\"narrative\\" (I use heavy quotes here) was non-existent, the dialogue banal, and the point beyond elusive. Fiction, while it should be incisive, must also be entertaining. This is neither. Alternately dull, frustrating, pretentious, inconsequential, and infuriating. Some have compared it to Wolfe; DO NOT believe them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty","review":"Americans who attempt the comic novel rarely seem to realize that proper nouns are only a very small percentage of humor. Read the Brits like Waugh, Wodehouse, and Barnes, and realize that character, construction and ideas are important, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, boring and ultimately pointless.","review":"As social satire, I suppose that this book has some value. It effectively reveals the silliness of the television industry, for example. As a novel, however, this book is not very good at all. It is almost impossible to relate to or care about any of the characters (unless you're a television producer or Silicon valley executive, perhaps.) The plot is unengaging and somewhat implausible. In contrast, Bonfire of the Vanities had a good story to tell and interesting (if not sympathetic) characters. In Wolfe's novel, you actually cared to find out how the book turned out. It's a boring book that you will forget all about the day after you finish reading it. As Jerry Seinfeld once said, \\"If I want a long, boring story with no point to it, I've got my life.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"Enough already! Don't we hear enough about the pretentious preciousness and self-consciousness of Anderson's folk in Vanity Fair and Talk? I found this book to be very un-interesting and had to restrain myself from throwing it across the room. Should have been written (if at all) 10 years ago - or it already was once, and better, by Tom Wolfe. Sorry, Kurt, I love your stuff for the New Yorker. Maybe next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wordy, conceited and sarcastic","review":"I'm no Pollyanna when it comes to my choice of literature, but this novel left me with a really bad taste in my mouth. And I only read the first eighty pages!! That's when I decided to quit. The dialogue left me feeling that perhaps I wasn't \\"hip\\" enough to be reading it. I had nothing but disdain for the main characters and I couldn't stand their children. For me the author's conceit and sarcasm towards anything he did not consider acceptable (which basically is anything that anyone but the filthy rich experiences) oozes out from between the lines. I can usually plow through anything, especially when I buy it in hardcover, but the labor of interpreting the book's dialogue and the ensuing understanding of its banal content made me give it up. I couldn't convince myself that I would ever enjoy finishing it. Truly the worst book I've tried to read in a while.

This is not really a work of fiction, it is more of an agglomeration of puns, once au currant concerns, and careerist tribulation. No one with an ear for language will be able to read this ugly beast."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word: Tedious","review":"I'll be brief, unlike Anderson: I found this book to be a huge disappointment. It's fat, but it has no range, no heart, no soul, and not even much wit. If you're in the NY or LA or Silicon Valley media world, you might be amused to read about yourself here. Otherwise, who cares?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The perfect book for those . . .","review":"Lame. Revealing a knowledge of literature that begins and ends with Tom Wolfe, Kurt Anderson makes a self-conscious, overblown bid for upper-middle-brow media stardom. Smug, heavy handed, infested with trendy cliché-ridden observations and held together by shockingly feeble comic set pieces, 'Turn of the Century' is an exasperating read that continually reminds the reader of how much better Don Delillo handled similar material, a full ten years ago, in his vastly superior 'White Noise'. Two stars may seem like an excessively generous grade for Anderson's limpid debut novel, but an incontestable fact remains: Kurt Anderson has, indeed, succeeded in writing the perfect book for those who think Maureen Dowd is witty and Evelyn Waugh was a woman. (Something of an accomplishment in light of said target group's immense cultural influence in publishing circles and elsewhere.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Protracted Boredom","review":"Encouraged by glowing literary reviews, I persisted in plowing through this flat and oddly unfunny satire long after reason told me to stop. Unlike good social satire, in which characters are engaging despite their vanities and foibles, the characters here are bereft of life, and serve only as portals through which the writer cudgels us with his allegedly trenchant observances. Thus it was that I read the entire 600 and something pages without ever being genuinely amused or entertained. The observances seem dated -- haven't we all had our nouvelle cuisine experiences by now? -- and devoid of the imaginative twists one looks for as leavening. Turn back unless you have low expectations and lots of time to kill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"Boring, boring, boring! And disappointing. I began reading TURN OF THE CENTURY with high hopes. Reviews had compared this work to BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES, a novel I loved because it combined a clever and satirical look at our times with an actual story where things happened and characters/people dealt with those events. TURN OF THE CENTURY delivers what to me was 600 pages of description wrapped around maybe 50 pages of story. The look at our turn of the century life is at times clever and inventive, but portraying it seems far more important to the author than presenting a story where people live, reacting to events and each other, in that sophisticated and brittle world."},{"rating":"1","title":"A superficial critique of a superficial culture","review":"I wanted to like this book but it ultimately succumbs to the same pretentiousness and superficiality it purports to refute.I tried to finish it but finally gave up around page 500.

A fan of the old Spy, I was sold by the frequent comparisons to Tom Wolfe, one of my favorite authors/social commentators. This book was quite a let-down, however. I forced myself to pick it up several times despite my complete lack of interest in any of the characters. I thought I would surely begin to like it at some point given the author's pedigree and the marketing claims behind it. It never happened, though - I found the book to be a pointless encyclopedia of the modern entertainment industry and culture, lacking in deeper insight, narrative force, or emotional impact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy audiobook","review":"I can't speak for the actual text, but the audiobook was really crummy.

Much to my delight I have found CUALQUIER DIA very enjoyable. I couldn't help but notice how similiar Kany's music as well vocals were to fellow Latino artists Shakira and a smidgen of Paulina Rubio. Kany's music is a melodic blend of pop and rock. All of her songs are sung in spanish. Unlike Shakira, Kany's vocals aren't so shrill. I find myself preferring the uptempo tracks than the ballads. The ballads aren't bad but I just find the melodies in her uptempo songs a lot more melodic. The one ballad that I really did like is track 8 \\"Que Nos Paso\\". That is my personal favorite.

I am so glad that I read it first, because I really enjoyed the story and drawings. I HIGHLY recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 3-year old son loves this book","review":"I think it's the flying. It took us by surprise when, after checking it out from the library, it was suddenly his new favorite book. He was into the typical boy stuff: trucks, trains, front-loaders, rocket ships. Then all of a sudden, all he wants us to read is Abuela. It's a nice blending of fantasy and reality, with strong family relationships, and lots of fun, colorful pictures. He's moved on to other favorite stories now, but he always seems to enjoy this one. The sequel (Isla) is also good. A nice way to learn a few new Spanish words. There's even a glossary in the back with a guide to correct pronunciation. Just make sure you get the English with Spanish phrases, if that's what you're looking for. There is also a version that is completely in Spanish."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great book!","review":"Miss Jacobs' second grade class really liked the story Abuela. We loved learning Spanish words throughout the book. We liked the way the illustrator drew the s. We all agree that Rosalba's imagination was running wild. We wish we could take an adventure with her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophomoric and repetitive","review":"Too bad there isn't a zero stars rating.Being a fan of the various NYC historical fiction books (Alienist, Time and Again, etc.) I was looking forward to a good satire of the genre.The first chapter is somewhat amusing. But then Elliot repeats the same jokes. Over and over and over. Flatuence and excrement, in the place of wit, abounds.The illustrations are amateurish. Sorry Elliot, your sister is not a wonderful artist.Astonishing that this was compared to the delighful and funny work of Doug Adams. This book simply does not compare."},{"rating":"2","title":"crazy funny","review":"umm super funny so crazy and ridiculous. i would be reading on the bus and people would look at me crazy because i was cracking up"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst book I have ever read.","review":"I am an avid reader and a lover of books. I will generally read anything cover to cover, whether I am enthralled in the story or forcing my way through the end of an awful yarn. I couldn't even finish this book. It was HORRIBLE! I had prepared myself for a hilarious adventure (such as any of Douglas Adams' books) and instead got a disgusting, boring set of chapters that seem to have been forced onto the page by an immature, high school drama student. Don't even bother with this book. You'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thwack this one off your reading list","review":"Hated it.Read 45 pages.

I don't and did not finish the book, it was too unfunny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny....for a few pages","review":"Chris Elliott writes very much in the style of Dave Barry, which is a good or bad thing depending on your opinion of Dave Barry.Since both authors are basically making jokes and puns for the sake of making jokes and puns, the humor comes over as being very forced after more than a few pages where the aim is to get as many jokes into as many sentences as possible.The plot, such as it is, was an interesting framework to base the buffoonery on, and there were some definite funny ideas, such as the NCNYPD - Nineteenth Century NY Police Department - and the wooden oil-fired mobile phones.A certain, decent percentage of the time, Elliott can make you laugh. Not every joke is telegraphed, and he can be genuinely amusing. But this is a 350 page novel, and the relentless barrage means there will inevitably be misses, and the whole enterprise becomes tiresome way before the end.Recommended only for Elliott fans or those who love zany, virtually non-stop humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"My son insisted I read this book. I enjoyed \\"Get A Life\\" and even \\"Cabin Boy,\\" even though I appreciate the humor of Chris's father more than I do his. However, I tried to get into this book but could not get beyond the first 50 pages. I found it very self-indulgent, as if he was chortling himself over every \\"witty\\" sentence he wrote. Since the age of 10 or so I haven't found it funny for people in the 19th century to supposedly arrive somewhere in an airplane or for people to boast about accomplishments (the charge at San Juan Hill) that haven't happened yet. And what is funny about making Teddy Roosevelt the mayor of New York? I love Monty Python and off-color humor and am open to just about anything, but this just seemed a pointless sophomoric exercise. We got some \\"Get A Life\\" DVD's today for Christmas and I'm glad to get back to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too precious by half","review":"I was really hoping for more, I like Chris Elliot! But this book seriously disappointed me. It's too precious for it's own good, with self-conscious wordplay that tries too hard to be funny and characters constructed solely for the purpose of jokes that never pay off. Like Saturday Night Live skits of late, it probably sounded better when it was pitched.The reviews here comparing this to The Da Vinci Code aren't even in the ballpark - the \\"mystery\\" in this book is a bare skeleton that never takes life. It's more like Daniel Pinkwater on a very bad day. The only time the book is mildly amusing is when the story flashes forward to modern times with Elliot poking fun at his own low wattage celebrity-hood. Maybe there's a book there - but not here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coulda been better","review":"I was interested. I was disappointed. The book was very disjointed. The humor was mostly juvenile and the story was strange. Murder was the only way this guy could communicate with himself in the future? It just left me wondering why I wasted my time and money. I did like the Teddy character. That's about all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silliness Masking as Literature","review":"Yes, it was intended as a \\"fun\\" read (literature of the absurd?) and it did evoke several chuckles, especially at the first. But as literature (read into that word what you will) it's an abysmal failure. Crammed with so many jokes, puns, outrageous and over the top dialogue and downright stupid action, one's interest is eventually diverted from the story to the catchy devices. It's a case where you can't see the forest for all the intervening trees.I had expected a \\"straight\\" tale similar to the Alienist. Then when I discovered it was a humorous take on the police procedural I perked up. It was only after the 100th hyperbole and cutesy 20th century reference that I grew weary of the whole thing. Toward the end it descended into caricature. What's sad is that the idea was a good one - maybe the author should stick to SNL and the visual media. In fact, the book seemed very visual, almost as if the author were transcribing a SNL skit."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Couple Hundred Pages of One Liners","review":"I managed to get through about 10 pages before they all started to look the same.

I guess the seller does not care. I own a CW 80, and it works. However, if you should short out the unit for a few seconds the fuse will blow. Then you have to have a special tool to take it apart or send it out for repair. The fuse is not expensive, but it is hard to get to.I would recommend a MTH Z 1000, as it has a capacity of 100 watts and a circuit breaker. Should there be a short circuit you only have to wait a few seconds for the circuit breaker to cool off and press it to reset the unit. It's throttle is very smooth, and it activates the bell and whistle on all my locomotives. The MTH Z 1000 runs about $80 - 90, and being an electronics engineer I can say that is a great unit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For those of us who prefer visual learning...","review":"This is a great video workshop for anyone wanting to learn the basics of papermaking, and a little beyond. While the price might put some off, it would be wise to consider the cost of a live demonstration workshop, and the effort involved in locating one, before ruling out the convenience of this DVD. Nash is a wonderful teacher who gives clear and simple instructions that anyone should be able to follow with success. Both Western and modified Japanese methods are demonstrated, and Ms. Nash gives a good deal of time to discussing the process of making pulp from plant sources as well as recyclables.

This is one of the very few children's books that are, very necessarily, a staple of any good childhood. Pippi allows every child, whether it be in age, or in heart, to live out fantasies of going to the ends of the earth and of having fun adventures from which they'll always come out on top, with Pippi leading the way. Though there were few books in the series, especially compared to most other children's series, the powerful words contained within their covers more than compensate for this, raising your imagination to new heights.I have only one message for anyone reading this: BUY THIS BOOK.

I called Hasbro and was told that they do NOT make replacement arrows for this toy because it is a Toys R Us exclusive.The toy is great but it is fairly useless if you really can't get replacement arrows...so I give it 1 start overall.

You can cut off the end so it will shoot microdarts, too. Your choice. Search BBB mods and you'll find it.2. Instead of going through all the trouble to order replacement arrows from Hasbro, buy the Air Zone Foam Arrow refill pack. They work fine and actually seem to shoot further than Nerf's arrows!

What was the point of showing all this slime over and over again. No reason to like or have empathy for the main character.EVERY scene seemed to go on and on and on...The scene when he verbally rapes two young women is so offensive that I feel all the actors involved were humiliated-not only the actresses, but the 'bad lietenant' as well.All I can surmise is that the people who made this mess are sick.....Truly the entire story could have been told in about a half and hour if the movie makers had not enjoyed showing every sordid moment. Not in an enlightening way, in which you can feel some empathy and understanding of the main character, but in an exploitive way. Wallowing in the misery and almost ENJOYING the most awful parts......I felt like I needed to take a shower after watching it....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good performance, bad movie","review":"Harvey Keitel gives a terrific performance as a cop who's also a drug user and gambling addict. However, everything else in the movie is terrible. The movie is about a police lieutenant who is investigating the rape of a nun and goes through some kind of spiritual awakening at the end. However instead of showing him doing any actual police work, the movie focuses on scenes where the lead uses drugs and gets deeper in debt to a bookie. These scenes seem to be just thrown into the movie and Keitel is the only one you see in more than one of them. The idea that a cop could keep his job with this type of behavior and the ending are totally unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abomination of all that is holy!","review":"Although this is an older movie, I felt compelled to write a review after I recently saw it. Besides the fact that this movie has no redeeming moral values at all, it is also utterly depressing. After watching this I wondered what the actual point of this movie is. It seems like the director is trying to make some profound statement about the human condition, but I fail to fully understand his message. If you really want to see a classic movie dealing w/ corrupt cops then go rent Serpico. It made me sick to think that there probably are morally unjust cops like Harvey Keitel's character.Do yourself a favor and dodge this absolutely stagnant garbage. I would easily watch Shaq-Fu continuously, than suffer through this film again.

My advice is don't buy it, if you must see it rent it, but remember, you've been warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unable to review","review":"I wish I could review this Blu-ray since I love the movie and have seen good reviews of the disc's AV quality.

Only a drug addict with a serious case of self-loathing could enjoy this terrible movie. Apparently, the PRIME version is edited for content but, at over 2 hours of terrible dialogue, frustratingly slow pacing, cheap 'shock' plot points, and little or no intelligible character development, I would rather shoot myself in the foot than watch the unedited version. The only positive points I can find about this movie are its continued coverage of the Dodgers vs Mets world series and getting to see, briefly, full frontal nudity of Harvey Keitel."},{"rating":"1","title":"STREAMING VERSION IS EDITED!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is an excellent movie.

It's probably my least favourite Abel Ferrara film, but the sheer weight and pathos Keitel puts into the role is nothing short of monstrous.It's a disturbing film to watch, but it's tantamount to watching a car wreck--you can't help but be transfixed. The film itself is average (a la \\"Scent Of A Woman\\"), and deserves no more than 3 stars, but his performance is worthy of 5 or more stars. It also stars familiar New York (and Ferrara) character actors Victor Argo and Paul Calderon."},{"rating":"2","title":"God in first-person","review":"Well, I must say that this is one of my all-time favorite films. It's as pure as rock and roll. Too many films these days deal with things on the safe stage of irony and cleverness, but this movie manages to transcend sensationalism and exploitation by stripping away any ulterior motives that would taint the experience. It's a film you can't defend, but you don't need to. I don't think Ferrara ever said he was trying to please anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harvey Keitel Does It Again - And Again!","review":"Harvey Keitel finally \\"shoots his talented wad\\" here and goes for broke. This movie is so real and surreal at the same time, I was agape most of the time. I won't spoil the scenes, but he is one 'bad' lieutenant here and gets away with it (sort of). It's a great storyline filled with hilariously uncomfortable scenes that put a new spin on Harvey and \\"Weird\\".

What I got was a messy, rather unfocused film that thinks it is much more artistic that it actually is. First off, while I commend Harvey Keitel for his performance (the little of it that was actually shown) the movie fails to elicit any kind of interest in either the character or the \\"story.\\" Harvey really doesn't put on much of a performance at all. He doesn't have much dialogue nor does he have much in the way of physical expressions. All in all this movie isn't worth getting. Nic Cage's Bad Lieutenant is WAAAAY better. I'd highly recommend that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing redeeming about the character nor the movie","review":"The main character is a total low-life. The movie was a waste of time, even though I ended-up fast-forwarding through it.If you're watching it and expecting the character or movie to get better, well, neither do. They just get worse as the movie progresses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixed bag","review":"Harvey Kietel is worth 5 stars. The film is worth 3 stars. The directing is worth 4 stars.This is a very dark, intense, and interesting character piece. It all revolves one man's \\"struggles\\" of what he does and who he is. His weaknesses and his strengths. You have to be in the proper mood to be totally captivated by it but it remains a very good film on the whole. Definately a must see, but you wouldn't be any worse off if you just rented it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harvey Keitel is a Bad Lieutenant!","review":"A friend alerted me to this film. Since I once worked in the area where the movie was made, I was surprised I didn't catch the crew in action. Harvey Keitel does an extraordinary peformance in this film. This movie is not for children and some may find his character disgusting. I guess that's why he took this role. His character is a bad man, with many flaws but the movie also focuses on redemption. Despite the many bad things he does, there is always hope not only a bad lieutenant, but also, for all of us. Do watch this movie and try to keep an open mind. Harvey Keitel explores the dark side of his character very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Controversial yet impressive","review":"Harvey Keitel gives his best performance in this rough, intense melodrama following the final days of a crooked cop as he investigates the brutal rape of a nun and seeks redemption. This film is dark and depressing not to mention has some very explicit scenes, but it is still powerful. Not for the faint of heart or those easily offended, this film looks at a corrupt cop doing some very bad things and shows how even the most cruel and evil of men can still find a chance for forgiveness. Keitel is a brilliant actor. No other actor out there could've done this role quite like him. He and Abel Ferrara put together a film that may challenge your way of looking at things but it will remain unforgettable and intense long after viewing. This movie had an impact on me. One of the most depressing films ever made... it really stands out. a film like this is worthy of accolades and much attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONLINE VERSION IS EDITED!","review":"They should have (EDITED VERSION) next to the title.

Truly a powerhouse, I'm not even aware of a single dead pixel. And yes, it's been knocked over at least a few times, and subjected to pet dust/fur. The worst trouble it's giving is that it's beginning to dim just slightly, but considering near-constant daily use for more than half a decade, that's pretty reasonable!

She is a pioneer in many ways, but deliberately and repeatedly puts herself in harm's way for no discernible advantage. The writing is in general very good.

The effects of revivals on one urban area, in this case St. Louis, Missouri, would make a worthwhile study in the hands of a competent author. Beller, however, is not that author. For one reason, he seems to me to see his particular fundamentalist Protestant denomination as just about the only Christian church there is. Too much space is wasted in sectarian carping at other Christians, both Catholic and Protestant. Even Billy Graham is not immune.For another reason, Beller believes that Protestant Christianity died in St. Louis around 1900(one chapter is entitled \\"Why St. Louis Went to Hell\\")and he allows nothing to shake him from his idea. Any St. Louis revivals after Billy Sunday's in the early 1900's are completely ignored, including the 1973 Billy Graham revival at which I accepted Jesus as my Lord and Savior."},{"rating":"2","title":"ROCKS!!","review":"Oh Dude....the first Disc will knock your socks off!the second disc is somewhat disappointing compared to the first disc but this CD rocks!!!!!! the quality is not that great though.

Our heroine is allowed to sleep around without being punished, something that usually doesn't happen in dyke crime. She doesn't solve anything, but Scoppetone's been doing that for years. She's just the paid witness to a \\"bizarre\\" tale anyone who has seen Ricki Lake would yawn at.

Spooky, heart-hammering music in all the right places, fleeting glimpses of some *thing*, and for the most part the plot leaves you guessing 'til nearly the end. I'd figured out some of it, but not exactly the why, and I like that. Most movies these days you figure out in the first 15 minutes or so and what's the fun in that?The reason Shallow Ground gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the unnecessary goriness of it.

Granted, it was at a summer camp for youth so it wasn't exactly treated with kid gloves...But it was still a disappointment. Not the best quality craftsmanship. In no way is it worth the \\"list price\\" of $60. Luckily, they don't charge that.The tune it plays when you press the music switch is--get this--\\"jingle bells.\\" It's pretty awful. Sounds a lot like an holiday-themed car horn, strangely off-season ice-cream-truck or super annoying kids toy. Weird choice of tune.So, I'm not particularly happy with the product, but the seller was prompt and I'm hoping I can take it apart and fix it.

I kindof groaned because I felt like Hamlet 2 was stupid mainstream Scary Movie-type crap. Devoid of subtlety.But Saxondale is really clever and fun, and has one of the best title sequences ever. Too bad they edited that part down for the second season.I really like the concept of a hardcore roadie who toured with all of the rock greats, now in his 50s and having to deal with the realities of a 9-5 job and suburban malaise. The characters all have endearing quirks and interesting relationships. It's definitely a good change of pace from American sitcoms."},{"rating":"1","title":"my wife is manipulative","review":"The passive-aggressive subtext is an interesting study in unacknowledged sexism. They make such a big deal that \\"he\\" means \\"spouse\\", but - look here! - they use \\"one\\" where they actually mean \\"she\\". And who can trust any book that purports to study and describe problems in marriage without any discussion of domestic violence or abuse? hmm. maybe it's because those aren't common marital problems, from the perspective of MEN.In terms of actual useful advice, here, I'll summarize: communicate your actual needs, and be honest about where they're not being met, and listen to your spouse when she does the same. That one sentence is the most helpful thing this book has to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Andy Stack Rule's' terrifying true read!","review":"This was a book that I borrowed from a friend..come to think of it...I still have the book (oops) Anyhow....this was a good book written around the time Rule was making a name for herself as Andy Stack. I read this twice. A sadistic monster responsible for the disappearance of beautiful young women who had full lives ahead of them, and would no doubt have been successful had fate not thrown them in Jerry Brudos' path. Thier thin, beautiful fragile bodies were no match for this physically built stong LUST KILLER...this book made me rethink about going out alone, and thanks to one couragous girl in this story...I learned a thing or two...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated!","review":"I bought this book based on glowing reviews by a majority of readers; Ann Rule was touted as an outstanding writer. I found this book to be about as gripping as a newspaper article. Dull and boring.

After finishing it, I feel like telling all my female friends that no matter what, don't get into a stranger's car and when in doubt, fight and scream mightily. The 1960's OR seemed like an idealistic American town yet all the victims were cut short of their lives and dreams. They were your neighbors, friends, schoolmates, or co-workers. Yet they were unfortunate enough to chance-encounter the lust killer.Pacifc Northwest, with its abandon mountains and wilderness, had attracted influx of new residence yearly. Comparing with the density of New York City, it's way too easy to dispose bodies and evidences before they are discovered. Big city dwellers are usually more aware of their surroundings than those who live in more rural area. So in a way, NYC might be safer than Salem, OR."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as great as later books","review":"I enjoyed this book but didn't find it as interesting as Ms. Rule's later works (e.g. Small Sacrifices, Stranger Beside Me). Perhaps it is because the investigative/legal aspects of the case were relatively trivial. It could also be that Ann's writing has improved but who am I to judge?In any case, if you have read her later books first, you'll still like this one, but lower your expectations a bit.Joel"},{"rating":"2","title":"true story of fetishist turned killer...","review":"'Lust Killer' is one of Ann Rule's earlier true crime books. It doesn't quite reflect the extensive character study of some of her later (and brilliant) works but it does contain perhaps one of her most frightening characters, a man who has a [hang up on] women's garments ... and a true hatred of women. A deadly combination.The female killing spree happened in Oregon some 30+ years ago but the story feels fresh. This reader was amazed how such horrible atrocities could occur, commited by both a husband and a father. It is unfortunate Ann Rule doesn't delve much into the killer's background, and indeed it seems the author didn't do her usual interviews of family members and related individuals. So 'Lust Killer' has a somewhat abridged feel to it .. and it is indeed one of Ann Rule's shorter books.Bottom line: ghastly killer, horrible murders. Morbid yet fascinating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just my opinion","review":"What a waste of even the miniscule amount I paid.

But I'm not what you'd call a huge Santana fan anyway.

I don't think much of Clapton either-all style and no substance. That they are both great guitarists I will not deny, but they make me sleepy. The discovery of wilder white noise has spoiled me.

I personally enjoy the somewhat \\"pop\\" songs such as Open Invitation and Winning, which may not sound like classic Santana, put are melodic and entertaining nonetheless.

But did anyone care to mention that almost every song is cut off or shortened? This album is 33 minutes long! Black Magic Woman ends at the beginning of the solo, Evil Ways is drastically shortened, as well as everything else. I wish I had known this before I wasted 18 dollars on this album. If this album had been complete, I would have praised it for everything it's worth, but in this case, it's worth absolutely nothing. Go buy the albums instead. Buying this album is like downloading 3/4 of every song and burning it onto an album.

Sure, it does contain some of Santana's greatest hits-- and I do love Santana's music-- but it's not the group's best collection album. I urge you to buy \\"The Best of Santana\\" (1998) instead. It has all the classics this disc contains, plus additional great hits from the later 70s and early 80s, plus much better sound quality on all tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get \\"The Best of Santana\\" instead.","review":"If there's one thing I hate, it's when songs are cut short to be able to get played on the radio. Usually, the best part of the song gets cut. This album is no exception. An instrumental part of Black Magic Woman has been cut, and Gypsy Queen has been taken out completely. Jingo is about half as long, Evil Ways is cut short, and No One To Depend On isn't even here! Radio versions of songs suck, and should not be allowed on albums.It is highly recommended that you get The Best of Santana vol. 1 and 2 instead of this. You'll get the real songs, not some shortened radio edit versions. And you'll also get the actuall best of Santana, not just the commercial successes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reason Why","review":"Here's one of the reasons to avoid greatest hits/best of collections. These are some truly great tracks which have been savaged by some label-hired editor, who cuts large chunks off songs for no particular reason.Everbody should own a copy of \\"Samba Pa Ti,\\" by the way, one of the truly great guitar tracks, overflowing with delicacy and intensity. A truly erotic instrumental track.One of the best guitar solos in rock, on \\"Black Magic Woman,\\" can't be heard here though, because the studio hack whacked it off the version on this CD.Buy the original albums and hear the real deal. Columbia blew it on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a tease.","review":"To echo the sentiments of some of the other reviewers, this CD is a gyp.

It is a decent read, and it IS written well, however, the author really needs to develop her characters better. The girl in the book is an absolute moron. Not to mention it completely urked me that after every sentence from the Native American characters that ended with a question mark, ended with an \\"eh?\\" after it. Ok, they're Comanche....not Canadian. Had a hard time really getting into the book because of all the unrealistic annoyances with the characters. Def better reads out there.

I had to force myself to see this book through to the end. The heroine, Loretta, is what ruined this book for me. She was absolutely ridiculous and frustrating. By the first half of the book I had lost all sympathy for her. The hero is the typical alpha male but he really wasn't all that bad and truly had more honor than the heroine. By the end I didn't even care what happened to them. The most interesting part was reading the small parts that included the other tribal members in the village."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book","review":"A great book worth the read.

Domino UK and Domino USA have different versions.I didn't know that either until I bought this version.As for the music, I think it is not as good as I wanted it to be. The remixes are kind of trance music, not what I would expect from this band. I expected loud house style bass-driven anthems. As for the demos, unreleased tracks, and the edits.. the demos are horrible, the unreleased tracks don't sound like Test Icicles, and the edits seem very near the same as the originals.I think this should only be bought if you know that you can play the DVD and you are a big fan of test icicles and you want their stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Competent but unmoving sci-fi","review":"This book is way too long and as other reviewers have pointed out, runs out of steam about half-way through.The concept of the Eater is quite interesting but the book comes across as more of a creative writing exercise than as a satisfying novel.Competently written but unmoving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sci Fi has done better","review":"I would rather be sent directly into the eater itself, than get stuck reading this book again.It started off promising and I thought that it might turn out to be a good read. However, the only character that had any depth, was the cancer-stricken channing. The rest of the cast was nothing short of bad comic book characters and their use of scientific jargon made the book downright baffling. To top of the bad use of prose and horribly underdeveloped characters, the conclusion to the story was downright terrible.

However, the quality of this media shelf leaves much to be desired. The base is too light; very prone to tipping. The instructions have a stupid solution to the problem: Nail a strap into your wall that attaches to the back of the shelf. However they forget to mention that you need to nail into a wall stud to be even remotely useful. Otherwise putting a hole into sheetrock won't help hold the shelf upright. The shelf assembles as two pieces that attach together, one atop the other. For my unit, the alignment of these pieces was visibly off. While I like that I can configure the space between each shelf, some shelves don't sit tightly on the metal pegs used to keep them level.

A big relief for those following the band since a long time, after the previous two, all in all quite disappointing, albums.Maybe the lyrics on this one could be a little sharper, but as far as the music goes, this is really refreshing stuff.

Larger than I was expecting so I was excited expecting to see lots of nice pictures and details. In a way I did get that. However I found a lot of the pictures to be kind of dull and chalky. There were pictures of women that looked plain. Even with the make up. They didn't look pretty to me. The colors were bland and the skin very pale. Just a covering of paleness on the skin. Add lipgloss nicely done hair and that's basically this book picture for picture. Also it told you obvious things like using concealer and lipgloss and mascara erm...der. :/ I don't know I was looking for maybe a collection of colors that would go great for certain eyes and skin types and different looks with those colors. Also it doesn't name anything specific. Like what kind of concealer?? What color are you using on the woman's skin?? How much is it?? Honestly a girl's magazine is better and will tell you more than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book are just ok","review":"I had the 2 books of Kevyn Aucoin. After reading page by page, and reading many books of makeup. That one are very old styles techniques of makeup. No trends looks of makeup. There have a basic makeup looks. Not fashion makeup. Good for someone looking for sample style/looks.You can found others books betters then this!Only thing I like from this book is because they had the chart of contouring & highlight.But there was not the best explanation for contouring & highlight and not the best techniques.I am expecting more on this book before I have it. I am a little disappointed after reading page by page this book.This are not the best book you can have.I suggest this book:Makeup guide by Rae Morris.Thanks,"},{"rating":"2","title":"an incredibly artistic book","review":"Making Faces is an excellent book. However, it might not be what you expect. This book is wonderful provided you are looking for something a little more outlandish, extravagant, or theatrical. It focuses on color, mood, and the art of makeup. Making Faces also has sections devoted to: shadowing,(the use of light and dark to make features appear slimmer or bolder) as well as a method to change eyebrow shape,(with the use of wax and heavy makeup) and other professional techniques. If you expect to find more than a display of Kevin's work, some rather interesting aproaches to beauty, and quite a few beautifully artistic photographs, this book may not be what you want. Yet, if you'd like a change or a different perspective in the world of makeup, go for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Informative","review":"This book is well written and very comprehensive. What it is not, however, is a true How-To book. If you are looking for a book that will tell you step by step how to achieve a particular look, this may not be the book you're looking for. If you're looking for an excellent textbook-style makeup tutorial that will explain to you the differences and benefits of loose powder eyeshadow or cream eyeshadow, figuring out the perfect foundation for your skin type, and how to contour and highlight your features, then you've more hit the mark.In the middle of the book there are some \\"transformations\\" with picture guides, featuring women of all ages, skin types and looks. In the back you'll find a real treat: some absolutely fabulous how-tos for classic and dramatic looks, some of which are wearable and some of which you'll save for a special occasion. The photography for the book is really splendid, too.Really glad I added this to my reference collection. Thank you Kevin Aucoin!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Art of Make-up","review":"I bought this book since make-up has always been fascinating for me and wanted to learn some more before taking a professional course. I was complete surprised about the possibilities that make up can do with your face. I never thought that the correct application of colors and lighting could change in such a way a person. The way Mr. Aucoin makes it it's really incredible... you don't even need a plastic surgery to be as beautiful as many of the stars we see in the movies. It is really an art. And the instructions of how to do it are very practical to do at home.I would recommend it for any person who has interest in learning how to improve her appeareance and for make-up learning."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great Coffee Table book","review":"Kevyn Aucoyn is a wonderful, talented artist and an incredible human being-and this is a lovely collection of \\"made over\\" celebrities who (like so many of us)also adore Kevyn. Not a practical book for the \\"day to day\\" looks you can quickly use as you rush out of the house. Buy it for the celeb pics (and keep it on your coffee table or in the bathroom)-and get Bobbi Brown's book for real life make up tips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fabulous!","review":"Kevyn's voice in this book is so nice and not condescending, that half the fun was just reading his anecdotes. The transformations he effects on people are amazing, just look at the pages with his sister Carla!The looks presented toward the end are just amazing, the people are mostly unrecognizable, but the first part talks about make-up for you and me. Do you want to spotlight your eyes? Try the Julia Roberts smoky look, I did and amazed myself!I also like that Kevyn doesn't use brand names or specific shades, I can't afford $50 eyeshadow, so I have to work with what I can, or with a shade that I prefer, and he allows for that. It's all about your choices and what you want to do.And that teacher's note at the end is so sweet...."},{"rating":"2","title":"I NEVER knew makeup could be done like this!!","review":"I have seen this book in a few beauty salons across the country, but mostly used, I think, as a decorative item rather than a reference. Well let me tell you something, this book changed EVERYTHING for me as far as appreciating a true makeup \\"artist\\" as they pertain to my industry of photography!! The \\"transformations\\" this guy made on the subjects within this book is simply magical. It has taken my level of quality portrait production not only to another level, but to a whole other world!If you are a wannabe or up-and-coming makeup artist, this is a no-brainer. But if you are a portrait photographer, you owe it to yourself to get and view this book, and get to know who it's author is (was).I have given MANY of these as gifts (or \\"instruction manuals\\") to acquaintances I have met and thought had potential. Both MUA's and wannabe models as well. I have about 4 more on hand and am thinking about buying some more! :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"why are there so many 5 stars?","review":"I purchased this book due to the 230 of the \\"5 stars\\" reviews.

Together with contemporary Robert Jones's Makeup Makovers is a real affair."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have","review":"I love this book and not just because it's filled with pictures of georgous celebrities, but the author Kevyn is a genius! He makes the exotic and runway looks so accessible to everyone. Some good brushes, a perfectly matched foundation and your face becomes a palette. I've been into makeup so long and this is the first book I've been able to put my hands on that spells out the techniques. All my girlfriends have borrowed it already and we look more fabulous than ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Photographer's point","review":"This book is a great addition, since it offers insight on how they do it.

I love the amazing abilities make-up has to transform people. Kevyn is a master at this art. This book is definitely more advanced and more for your enjoyment and to be wowed!!!

It is full of wonderful photos of a variety of makeup styles from everyday makeup to glamorous looks.

It also has wonderful before and after makeover pictures. What a book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Really Beautiful Book","review":"Not really what you would call a resource or manual...but, very pretty and nicely put together. It's a show book, more than anything...not really a technique tool. His talent is clear, but this isn't on the same par as say Bobbi Brown's book. He's a wonderful artist and his book represents that.

The instructions leave you confused with gobs of makeup all in the wrong places. With \\"Making Faces\\" I was dead wrong. This is not another book with instructions that leave you wondering where your browbone is. Everything is illustrated and explained so well, that there is no room for mistakes, just clear instructions for specific looks that are nothing short of spectacular."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good beginners Tips","review":"This book is definitely from the 90's lots of older looks but some are definitely simple and timeless and can be worn now.

I miss him."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting but outdated - came out in '97","review":"This book includes styles for both supermodels and average-looking people. However it was published more than a decade ago (copyright '97) and styles have changed since then. This is most notable in the use of \\"outlined\\" lips or super-dark lipstick on about 90% of the photos in the book. The \\"edgy\\" pictures are even more dramatic and outdated. All in all, an interesting book, but not very usable for makeup tips in '08."},{"rating":"1","title":"The makeup in this book is totally unrealistic and unnatural","review":"Kevyn aucoin was definately an artist, but I didn't like this book. The makeup he presents is too obvious and fake. The pictures are excellent but he offers little step by step advice. The makeovers are great, in pictures. I would be scared to find someone with that much makeup in the street. This book is certainly missing the real-life/real-makeup element. If he was the master behind so many great looks on celebrities (i.e. Gwyneth Paltrow), why didn't he show us how to achieve their natural but polished style? Maybe he didn't want to give his secrets away!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best makeup book out there!!!","review":"Kevyn Aucoin, THE makeup genius, shows a wide array of beauty tricks, tips, and photos to help the everyday woman interested in makeup (i.e.; me!) showcase her best features.

Possibly stained. It was supposed to be a gift but I'll have to order another for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"FOR DETAILS READ HERE","review":"This book is well written and easy to understand. It offers lots of useful tips. This book is not geared toward the beginner who does not understand what concealer, foundation, and powder are used for or how they are different. Instead the focus of this book is for the person who already knows the everyday use of different products and would like to understand how they can better utilize them.Individuality is an emphasis that the author gives, which I felt is a good thing. Sometimes you come across a woman who is truly cool toned but looks wonderful with a warm eye shadow. The only way to find these things is to step outside the general \\"rules\\" of make up artistry. Kevyn will help guide you there.For the beginner I would recommend reading BEAUTY: THE NEW BASICS By Rona Berg. Then you can read this book and fully grasp what Kevyn's telling you."},{"rating":"1","title":"overwhelming, out of date","review":"I think this book must be for looks in the 80s and 90s.

Its worth more than what your paying for it on amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You can teach an old dog new tricks","review":"This book is very informative and fun to read as well. Kevyn has many faces in this book, some famous and some friends. Wonderful before and after pictures with nice stories about each person.Nice stories about how each person met Kevyn, or feels about him. Photos of everyday, evening and extreme makeup. Shots of famous faces Kevyn turned into other famous faces (Lisa Marie Presley as Marilyn Monroe). Very easy to follow the steps needed to create whatever you are looking for. I always wondered how showgirls/guys had those extreme eyebrows for stage..but what did they do the rest of the week at work with those eyebrows? Now I know how they do it! Different skin types are addressed and I loved the shading tricks with foundation. Most looks can be created using what you already own, the book doesnt make you feel like you have \\"the wrong stuff\\". Great book for everyone, beginners and experienced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing talent","review":"I bought this book for my wife who works in a salon. But I find myself entertained by it too! Kevin is a fantastic makeup artist (which is obvious when you first open the book). I think anyone in the fashion/beauty industry should see this book.

Being a make up artist myself I have gone to classes throughout the country to educated myself. The best class i've found is in his book. I still find myself learning new things every time I read Making Faces. I see something that I didn't see the first time, a new technique or look. I see the covers of magazines and can spot Kevyn's work because it is clean and beautiful like the looks in his book. Every detail is considered. He definately cleans up his looks to perfection. Which takes alot of talent, take it from someone who knows from experience. Make up is easy to apply, anyone can do it. Few can do it perfectly. I continuously educated myself and try to better my style not only because I love make up, but because I know perfection can be achieved with experience. Kevyn, call me I would love to work with you soon.With much love and respectTaylor Babaian"},{"rating":"2","title":"My inspiration!","review":"As an aspiring makeup artist, I have bought and collected most beauty books out there and I can honestly say that Kevyn Aucoin's books are the most detailed and efficient from all the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"No so helpful","review":"I thought this book would give me all the tips and tricks to become an expert at applying my makeup. Not so. It is pretty basic and I did not find it to be very helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely talented, not for everyone","review":"Kevyn Aucoin is definitely everything his reputation says he is. This book is excellent, informative, and extremely well put together.The only down side of it is he does not address Asian beauty. He address caucasian, black, and latin, but not asian... so Asians, this will be good if you want to learn about how to work on all the mentioned faces, but your own...not so much. For those asians whose eyes do not pleat (hooded eyes, or non-creased eyes) this book will not help you dress those and rare style of eyes.His technique is fantastic and I like his commentaries, very down to earth, though his work is outta-this-world amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the average schmoe","review":"I must say I am surprised at the reviews! It's a great book, if you're in the profession of makeup. None of the looks are fit for the average 30 woman who's going to the local mall or to work. This looks are for professional models on the runway. He tells you have to achieve the look, it's true, but he leaves out little things, like sometimes you can clearly see the model is wearing eyeliner, but he fails to put that in the steps to get the look. I had fun with the book when I first got it, but now it's gathering dust in my closet. I guess it depends on what looks you are going for and how seriouse with make-up you are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book on makeup","review":"I wanted to learn about makeup to be able to prepare people for video interview and also to understand makeup when using Photoshop on portraits.

If you prefer fresh and natural, that is covered too. Kevyn Aucoin really covers a lot of ground in this book. Kevyn approaches make-up as an art form and creates great looks from minimalist all the way through to showgirl. It's a step-by-step guide which will inspire you and move you to the mirror armed with your make-up kit. With this book, \\"Making faces\\", you can learn from a master, look your best and be creative. Guaranteed fun! The full page photos are award winning quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I was disappointed with this book. Simply put it does not contain nearly enough information pertaining to technique or application. It is mostly a tribute to Kevin's artistry and the man was a true artist. However it provides little in the way of instruction or guidance when attempting to replicate these looks yourself.The book is filled with pictures of celebrities and supermodels wearing over the top makeup, makeup that the average woman will never attempt or come close to achieving. In fact, most of the applications shown in this book are best left to true make up professionals unless you wish to look like a clown (or like you just left the MAC counter after the sales girl finishes applying every product they have to your face).Stunning pictures of already stunning women with little instruction."},{"rating":"2","title":"The MUST HAVE book for every Makeup Artist!","review":"I really like the illustrations presented in the book. I went through several other makeup books by others which I will not name and Kevin's book came out on top. He presented different techniques, and showed how to do them. The other makeup books did not show this. The photographs were useful and great at the same time. I really liked his style and his belief system which is similar to mine. \\"That our unique characteristics are what makes us beautiful.\\" GREAT JOB KEVIN!!

Why didn't anyone hand this to me sooner?!","review":"I'm 30 years old and the only make up I know how to do properly is one eyeliner technique. Sad isn't it? ;)This book is filled with vital information about the basics, and a bit more advanced, of how to apply make-up. Obviously getting the result he has pictured takes practice, but since acquiring this book, I've never looked better. I enjoy putting on makeup now, whereas before I hated it. I've always had the same look. (on dark features) Black eyeliner, maybe some eye shadow and lip balm. He's got me wearing lipstick!

Sweat is a great song, easy to remember, slightly more mainstream metal than you would expect. Hush is one of the most awesome songs Tool ever made, Maynard seems a little, I don't know, angry. In this cut. Part of Me is a good song, not as good as the first two, worst on the CD. Then Cold and Ugly, great, still not as good as the first two in my esteemed opinion. Then Jerk-Off. Man, this song makes this CD. Awesome intro, the rest of the song reminds me a little bit of \\"Hooker with a Penis\\" on Aenima. If you play guitar, learn Jerk-Off, it's awesome. Last is Opiate, completely different from the rest of the CD, great song, third best behind Jerk-Off and Hush. And of course Gaping Lotus Experiment, the weird half-unintelligable hidden track, It does sound like they're on acid.

There's just something missing about it. The songs are a lot shorter, and it doesn't have the artiness of the later albums. But it's fun to listen to, so it's good. My favorite song here is Opiate, which has some of the best lyrics I've ever heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a great short album","review":"Despite this album only being six \\"real\\" songs, it's still amazing, and showcases Tool as a more angry band than what we experienced during Lateralus. The two live tracks \\"Cold and Ugly\\" and \\"Jerk-off\\" are absolutely amazing, especially the conclusion of Jerk-Off where Adam Jones trills and Maynard screams \\"Die\\" for about 15 seconds. While the lyrics of this album seem rather judgemental, especially in Opiate, Tool is a band that encourages people to think for themselves, so you can take whatever you want from these songs. I recommend Undertow, Aenema, and Lateralus over this, but it's still a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard Rock at Its Best","review":"This EP is just amazing it captures all the elements of Rock and binds it into beautiful riffs and the drum work is just awesome the vocals by Maynard James Keenan is also really great great great Cd buy now BUY IT NOW for you will not be dis pleased"},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems like I've been here before.","review":"A little bit harder than their latter two C.D.'s but just as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"We journey back to the early days of Tool","review":"I admit- this is a kick ass debut metal album from Tool. They started off perfectly and matured mentally and musically over the years dramatically. Maynard menacingly drives out brutal forces of power with his divingly compelling vocal chords, as does the rest of the band backing him up with their eardrum-crushing guitar riffs at booming speed. Maynard is( of course, DUH!)the frontman, Adam Jones on lead guitar, Paul D' Amour on bass and Danny Carey on drums. I am naming the guys if you are new to this band, but I'm sure most or all of the reviewers on this Tool page own more than just ONE of their CD's. Take my word for it, this one's a MUST HAVE!

Not something that is way out there, or epic like most of their later stuff.

Both albums were essentially written and performed around the same time, so they're going to sound fairly close in sound. So if you've never heard Tool and your planning on getting this album, you should probably buy Undertow along with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back when tool was a rock band, not a concept.","review":"Opiate is awesome... It's what hard rock can, and should be. Opiate is power, it's emotion, it's freedom, and it's also just a lot of fun. This stuff just begs to be moved to, in fact it is not worth listening to without expending the same kind of energy and emotion, that it gives out. This CD gives us a *real* reason to head bang, to sing along, to let our eyes roll back into our heads and forget that there is a world outside. Opiate is true balls out rock and roll, and anyone that knows rock, knows how rare, and precious such a thing is. Sure, some of the songs are a little rough around the edges, but even then, they are played with such amazing energy, that one can't help but love them. I would recommend this EP to any fan of rock; it will reminds you of why you listen to this stuff in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"KICK ASS","review":"I have to thank an ex boyfriend for turning me onto tool. The only bad thing that happens when i listen to any tool is i think Of my ol' buddy scott. TOOL Is on the top of my list of favorite bands.

BUY any of it you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"This great album has live and studio tracks.","review":"The first album (EP) by the band gives clear indication what Tool would become - tight playing, dramatic, influencial and mesmeric. The best tracks on it are the live ones, I have never heard a more accomplished playing of heavy rock. You can hear all types of influences - Rollins Band, Iron Maiden, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath etc. Lead singer Maynard James Keenan performs in his trademark manner, sliding from insectile to jet blast power. Tool impress without having to shock, and shock without being predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anger put poetically plus great instruments and vocals...","review":"A raw and powerful album, the quartet outdid themselves early, releasing a marvelous EP before they even knew what to do with themselves.

You are in need of mental health.....Adam Jones is one of the most greatest guitarists or if not THE most greatest guitarist I have ever heard. You won't know a good guitarist if he shoved his guitar head up your A$$.....which Adam Jones oughta do for bashing his great talent. Sure he doesn't show his best work on this but it's still good.....Tool's later stuff shows his real talent. That and Adam Jones as what influenced some guitarists today.

Salival and Undertow are better than this, and anyone who likes this CD more than any of the others knows nothing of Tool.I mean this CD is so BAD that they have been trying to cover up that they voluntarily made it. I really refuse to belive that the band who made something as excellent as Lateralus, Salival, and AEnima made something like this. The lyrics on this CD are so terrible. I mean, could they be any more blunt in their songs? Hush, Sweat, Jerk Off, all of those songs are GOD AWEFUL. The only good song on this is Opiate, but that doesn't make up for how terrible this is.I am a christian, but still, musically, in no way lyricly, and message wise Opiate is the best song. The lyrics though are just terrible, just like in all of the songs. Anyone who likes this the most is what I like to call: A Limp Bizkit Fan, which I know is cold, but still, WE DON'T WANT YOU PEOPLE TO LIKE TOOL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"This cd sucks, the music all sounds the same, the vocals sound just as bad live as they do in studio, the riffs are generic, the lyrics are dumb and the sound over all sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"My advice -- avoid this product.

A value at this price.","review":"This is a great looking and sounding player. It's much more sleek than the pictures seem to represent.The sound quality is great. The headphones that are delivered do sound great, but, hey, maybe it's just me, but they really make my ears warm. It's almost like wearing earmuffs. If I were to make one suggestion on how to create more value/quality to this product offering, I would suggest Sony try different headphones, or better yet, offer a choice to those purchasing on the Web.In addition to the quality of the sound, you also have a plethora of options when using the player. It's easy to program your own playlist, set one song to repeat, or put the player in \\"hold\\" status so that you don't either accidentally turn it off or on.Enough said. This is a player I would recommend to any music lover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not something I would buy again","review":"Sony basically makes a pretty lousy portable cd player. I got one for Christmas a year and a half ago, and it might as well be dead. I treat it very well, but somehow :A.) It skips excessivelyB.) Right side of headphones don't workC.) Cannot read disc half of the timeD.) Even when I pop in a BRAND NEW cd, and the discman isn't bumping around, it STILL skips.E.) I'll be listening to a cd and sometimes the cd player will just stop for no reason (fresh batteries, mind you) and it happens A LOT!There are some good sides though, it has a GREAT battery life and the sound WAS good while it lasted.If I were you though I would stay away from this brand, another brand to avoid is RCA. Try Philips Magnavox, they work REALLY good."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD Player is not so good","review":"It isn't that great, and im not an electronics nerd, i've had the player for a year, and already when you even tap the lid, it skips, during play, it sometimes, just out of nowhere, shuts off. Which means you have to start the song all over again. I'm no electronics nerd, and have no interest in reviews, but I'm just stating my opinion. And the headphones it came with were horrible, and it constantly skips and cannot read disks well at all. It started doing this about 3 or 4 months or so after I had it. Don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON:T BUY THIS!!!!!!!","review":"This CD player is nothing but a pieace of junk. I've had mine for about a year and and the skip protection is not that great. And if you plan on using it in the winter outside (I like to listen to music walking to class, i am in college) then this one won;t help. If it is even RWEMOTELY cool outside it will shut off on it's own all the time making it impossible to listen to anything.

The script is ridiculous, Minelli's \\"innovative\\" sets and figures are overblown and irritating, and the music is astonishingly bad. Yes, there is \\"Coffee Time,\\" but how much of a song is that? Try playing it and you'll fall asleep the second time through. I've never understood the studio's abandonment of Lucille Bremer. She was a fine actress and a capable dancer. Moreover, she was a raven haired beauty. (Her singing in this film was dubbed by one Trudy Erwin, heaven knows why.) Astaire was fine, but the dancing was outside his range and often feels labored. Comedy relief? Depth? Memorable moments? Forget it. This film bombed at the box office and hasn't improved with age."},{"rating":"1","title":"yolanda and the thief","review":"Unable to review as product was defective and returned for exchange.

This story traces his past as a wide eyed honest rookie to becoming one of the dirtiest cops in the department.The movie makes him out to be a sort of a good guy who was forced under circumstances to turn bad but he actually has a good heart. While the real life Lee Rock was probably an all out bad guy, Lau plays him as a very sympathetic figure.As a standard Hong Kong movie, the movie has very good gun fight scenes. The story was not bad and the action sequences were just as good. Definitely a must buy if you are into Hong Kong movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the \\"very best\\"","review":"This CD is the best of the \\"very best\\" Welsh choirs series because of the variety of song types IMHO.

I'm so mad.One of the most important gears came broken. The internal struts and bearings are loose and the gears disengage under even the slightest load rendering it useless.The hexagonal connectors are so tight that you can't disconnect them without almost damaging the capsules.The blue wheel axle threads are poorly made - one came stripped - hard to make anything cool when you're one wheel short.One of the wire jacks fits so loosely in socket that any slight motion and it becomes intermittent.This is just a classic example of a great toy gone bad as the pig manufacturer cut every corner possible to make as much money as possible.

So, guess who has to get up in the middle of the night to find the phone somewhere in the house- the battery alert is so LOUD (not adjustable) that it wakes up the whole house. And it goes off every minute or 2 for the hour it takes for the darn thing to die. Also, one of the reasons I believe the battery life is so poor is because the image on the front of the phone lights up every 30 seconds- very distracting if you sleep with your phone near you in bed, and also a huge and pointless waste of energy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice hardware with crippling software","review":"The krazer works fine, the trouble is the low battery signal.

Then as if it couldn't get any better the the dang thing just shuts off when it wants to. It says that it has a low battery and shuts off as if the battery has give out, but only 5 mins. before, it had a full charge. It also continues to do this even after a software upgrade and new battery. And verizon isn't much help either.

It cracked in a weird tree-like pattern, and after that it was just sad to look at. Other people said the crack made it look more original. Afterwards every time I saw someone with that phone, they had cracks in theirs too, all in weird little tree designs.

I loved Slow, Deep and Hard but Bloody Kisses and October Rust made me cringe. The shoe is now on the other foot eh? Life is killing me drew me in, albeit kicking and screaming, because the songs are so catchy. To me this is Type O Negative goes pop but without selling out. There's some great melodies often surrounded by heavy sabbath/cathedral type guitar and a great production. There's a wide range of aggressiveness on display too, from the very mellow Nettie and Electrocute to Angry Inch which shows Pete can still sound mean and angry when he wants to tho possibly popping a roid in the process. Other stand out songs for me were Anesthesia, Dream is Dead, Don't wanna be Me, A dish.. The instrumentals Thirteen and Drunk in Paris are really the only songs I skip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back in black no. 1...","review":"Those dark Brooklyn boys make their return with their newest masterpiece. They come back to us in a time of need with their energy & music quality that is sadly lacking in today's music scene.

Not only do I consider it to be their own best of 'many' worlds (think of a fine mix of such albums as \\"World Coming Down\\" and \\"October Rust\\"), buy I really think that this is their most quintessential opus to date.Although I like their current style ALOT, I would certainly like them to spew out a little more hardcore à la Origin of the Feces or Slow, Deep and Hard in their next CD.Another thing that would really be great in future outings would be to emphasize both the bass and the hi-hat a little more.I also hope that they release a Live DVD ASAP that would capture their finest moments onstage.Finally, and upon taking into account the rumors surrounding thier possible demise, I just hope that they continue crafting their unique brand of music for many years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Different - Pleasantly Surprised","review":"I had only heard of Type O a few months prior to buying this album and had worried after purchasing it. I'm really into 80's metal mostly, but after hearing \\"My Girlfriend's Girlfriend\\" & \\"I Don't wanna Be Me\\" I thought I'd give 'em a try. Even though they are a goth-metal outfit I was drawn to, mainly, the tone/sustain effect of Kenny Hickey's guitar (the tone on I don't wanna be me is one of the greatest things I've ever heard).This album has some great songs on, some of which you can just chill to and others influenced by punk & industrial metal of the early 90's. \\"Life is killing Me\\" is just fantastic & a main stand-out. If you're looking for something different, try this, but it may be too much for some (inaccesable). If you're a type O fan then you should already have this (with bonus CD - so much better) and I don't think this band can be catergorised because they're so much bigger than introspective goth-rock"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Can't Stop!","review":"Since misplacing my copy of World Coming Down, I have longed for new material from Type O Negative. At first listen I was not blown away, yet, I could not stop listening to it. I have been playing it for weeks and I always find some part of the music I have never heard before. This album is heavy, melodic and apparently a bit theraputic for Peter Steele (i.e. I Like Goils and The Angry Inch). I think I have a grasp on their sense of humor, but, one can only wonder at a certain point. ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music for funeral or deeply depressed people...","review":"Type o Negative is probely the reason to why we see so many kids killing themselfes and cutting their arms and hating their parents. The music displayed by ton? Is depressing,makes you feel hopeless, depressed, and i hate them because one of my good friends, killed himself after listining to ton's \\"life is killing me\\" and the music is boring for a purpose...To make you hate yourself and end up commiting suicide or worse. How about listining to music that means something or not being about death all the time? Actullie try to enjoy life while you are alive ?Insted of killing yourself with the sounds of death,sorrow, and, depression. Type of negative's \\"life is killing me\\" was made for people to get more depress and give them false hope and it worked. Thanx to them? One of my biggest friends is dead.

Peter Steele has writen some of the deepest soul penetrating music that I've ever heard. October Rust is a perfect album to hear what Peter Steele is capable of.LIKM is the shallowest album ever by TON, even the earlier works had penetrating anger in them. Bloody Kisses, October Rust and World Coming Down had massive amounts of effective depression, sorrow and death.Possible because of burnout or the end of their record deal, every song on this CD sounds like a shallow copy off an earlier record. I never thought TON would become a parody of themselves but that is what LIKM is all about.The Dream is Dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life is Killing me...","review":"Pete Steele is back and this is probably Type O's best works since Bloody Kisses..it has songs that sound like they're from Type O's old days..Slow Deep and Hard..I'm proud to say Type O is up to alot of good unlike alot of other bands who tried to go heavy again and failed to repeat how strong they sounded in the past...eh hem METALLICA.....the 1st song starts off with a slow groove then picks up into and almost thrashy pace and captures your interests right away then it goes for the traditional Type O Goth sounds and picks back up and repeats that cycle much like Bloody Kisses did...Angry Inch was a pretty funny song if you caught what Pete was growling...alot of the other songs were very well done...all in all Type O is still rockign as strong as ever and I hope they keep it this way...BRAVO PETE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Type O need I say more?","review":"Finally the Drab Four have returned to us with a killer album.

Life is killing me makes no exception, it's just 75 minutes of sheer gothic/groovy/doom/punk goodness. TON makes a jaw-droppingly (does such term exist?) organic music that meanders through all the above mentioned styles (and then some) and still comes out as in-your-face, remarkably tight music. jee, i almost forgot about the lyrics!well just like the music, they also range from doomy lyrics about loss and despair, to happy-go-lucky downright hilarious (try the exquisitely 'macho' , \\"I like Goils\\"), more than a mere passing nod at punk (Angry inch) as well as tunes in the purest heavy metal vain such as \\"i dont wanna be me\\". this is greatness from start to finish and i'm even tempted to place it above \\"Bloody Kisses\\" because TON never sounded that good and catchy. well at least not for a whole straight 75 minutes!for all of you cynics out there, this album is for you!

Are they SURE this is Type O Negative's sixth CD? Sounds just as ground-breaking {sort to speak}, breath-taking and exciting as their first two {or three} efforts. About all fifteen tracks here showcase frontman / guitarist Pete Steele's trademark yawning-from-the-grave style of vocals. Cuts here that more than had me sit up and take notice were \\"I Don't Wanna Be Me\\", the Beatles-like \\"Less Than Zero\\" (a true modern-day Type O classic), the dramatic \\"How Could She?\\", the death-like sounding \\"Love Is Killing Me\\" and \\"The Dream Is Dead\\". A friend of mine that totally dug Type O Negative from the very beginning, had given up on them now - saying that the long-running goth-metal Brooklyn band has gone pop. WHAT the poop is he talking about? This CD is prime stuff, glad I got to catch the band on tour last year, co-headling with Hatebreed. Before that, I hadn't seen them since their 'World Coming Down' trek. Essential listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just didn't grab me at all","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love Type O Negative more than I can imagine possible. Oct. Rust was a work of sincere genius, Bloody Kisses was purely inspiring, and even the often slammed World Coming Down had siginificantly powerful moments. With this album, I feel that TON just is not taking themselves seriously enough. With \\"I Like Goils\\" Peter rants for 3 minutes about how he isn't gay. With the other songs, it seems like way too many inside jokes or self-indulged humor is being presented. Oct. Rust was a true reflection of a struggle within, World Coming Down was a continuation of that struggle and LIKM just takes too much of a comical twist. Maybe I just prefer to older, darker, and more gothic TON (Oct. Rust) if you liked WCD the best, then check this album out. It definately has its moments, there are just (in my opinion) too many skippable and overlookable tracks and moments on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life is lovely...","review":"This is one of those rare albums that you leave the repeat button on. Songs like I don't wanna be me & I like goils give the album that speed metal feel like the early ones, but this album has It's share dark slow ballades as well such as Iydkmigthtky (gimme that) or Anesthesia.

After hearing It's Never Enough and Black Sabbath (From the Satanic Perspective) both from Least Worst Of and wearing out the World Coming Down CD, I figured this CD was going to be something really kick ... Boy was I wrong. This CD is a lame attempt at mainstream gothic pop. That's right the band you never thought would sell out has. It's like they are just trying to get something on the radio. Anesthesia and Dish Better Served Coldly are the only two tracks even worth listening too. The rest of the tracks are horrible. If you like Summer Breeze, Cinnamon Girl, Day Tripper / If I Needed Someone / I Want You (She's So Heavy), you might like this cd. If you've never heard Type O before you might like this cd.

Don't waste your money on this CD like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was expecting much better..","review":"I am a fan of heavy music and after hearing many songs from Type O Negative I decided to get this CD. I had heard the song \\"I Don't Wanna Be Me\\" and \\"Angry Itch\\", and figured the rest of the album would be somewhat like that or good. However, once I listened to the CD, I found it all sounded the same, meshed to together, and in the end was a total waste of time and money. Almost ALL of the songs drag on with no meaning and sound boring. Good long songs and softer songs have a purpose, this is boring and long for NO purpose, it never amounts to anything. I can't name a particularly bad song because really I can't remember one from another nor do I want to. It is all just dragging and very boring. Peter Steele needs to write better lyrics, too, as I find all these cliche and old.

I received my Grandmother's when she passed away and have more that pleased with it. I can't add anything the other reviews other that mine is over 30 year old it is in perfect shape. I've been told that my Grandmother sent 1000's of cans through this in her day and I intend to do the same. The company's web site is very good if you need replacement parts but I doubt you'll ever need them. I had my local Ag extension agent test my gauge (the original) and it is still accurate enough for canning. This is the only part that should ever really need replacing since it does not have a seal. I am fortunate enough to have the old school Instruction and Recipes book (list price 60) that has canning recipes that I have not been able to find anywhere else.

The old water canner didn't fit my burner, and scorched my stove because it actually hung over the edge of the burner. This definitely fits much nicer.The only thing I am not clear about is WHEN the pot first reaches the appropriate pressure. The directions seem to indicate that it will actually reach the pressure prior to the gauge reaches that number, and you will know by the weight bouncing and sputtering. Mine sputtered, but never bounced. I didn't want to under-process, so I didn't start counting until the gauge reached the correct pressure...but I may have overprocessed (which won't HURT, but I was hoping not to over \\"cook\\" the tomatoes). I will continue to experiment!It seems like a sturdy pot, and I like not having to deal with a rubber gasket.

It is very difficult to get a good seal. You have to watch it constantly. We didn't and it leaked out all of the steam. The heat then caused the bottom to burn out. If you want to be very careful to make sure it does burn out all of the water, it should do a good job. For those of us not that careful, a pressure canner with a gasket is much easier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Canner","review":"I was a little skeptical of a \\"gasketless\\" pressure cooker.

I reviewed as many cookers as possible and this was by far the one that most people on this site and others raved about. It costs more, but I am happy I got it. There were a few reviews that scared me stating that the instructions were difficult to understand, or they couldn't get the top off. I can only say I had no dificulty with the instructions and I did as the instructions indicated and put alittle oil around the edge of the pressure cooker and the lid has come off just fine.

They all owned and used the All American and told me that the All American Pressure Cooker/Canner was the Best of the Best and that I should not even look at any other brands.As the other reviewers mention, the unit is of obvious quality. As soon as you take the unit out of the box, you will be impressed by its heavy duty presence and hardware. Other reviewers also mention that the instruction manual is of high quality as well, and I must agree.The price on Amazon was best I could find and I made my purchase with out remorse.

My sister's best friend was killed in the 50's by an exploding pressure canner and her mother who was standing nearby lost an eye and damaged her hearing. Therefore, my mother put the fear of God in us about pressure canners. She water bathed everything and by the grace of God none of us got sick. Now that we know that you can not WB all foods, you have to pressure can. This canner is built like a Sherman Tank and has both a weight and dial for safety. It holds it's pressure level great and I have no fear when I use it. My sister uses one of the cheap pressure canners that are so popular and she laughed and said that compared to my All American her's looks like a toy! This canner will last for generations!

You must rub a layer of olive oil on the sealing edges before use or it will not work right. This is an amazing item to have in your kitchen backed by a 50, yes, 50 year warranty! If you are on the fence between this and the Presto...you wont be sorry purchasing this one. Worth every penny ...the other cooker has many reviews of the gauge being blown out of the top. For me it was a chance I did not want to take...nor with my kitchen. I figured if it hit my cabinet door I would be out over $200, not to mention if it hit me or anyone else.

It was expensive and I was willing to pay the price for a really good canner. The problem I had was that it was VERY heavy, which is good, unless you also cannot get the lid off, which is not good. I tried this canner several times and every time the lid was a struggle to remove. The biggest selling point to me was that it didn't need a rubber gasket. The biggest disappointment for me was that the lid didn't come off (because it didn't need a gasket).The upshot. Get a Presto canner with the gasket for lots less money.

I left beans in it for 3 or 4 hours to let them cool off. They were softest ever.Otherwise the device is very solidly built. It should manage many loads of beans and generate lasting pressure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best and Easiest to use Pressure Canner","review":"Pros: For many yrs I have used the dial gauge canners but had to stay near the stove to babysit the pressure. With this one as long as you are within earshot and can tell how many times the weight jiggles you don't have to camp out at the stove. I will never go back to the dial gauge type again. You do not need to replace gaskets as it is metal to metal (beveled edges to fit due to expansion and contraction and it works). This is a top of the line canner, milled from a solid piece of aluminum and will last a lifetime if not longer. Although it is twice as expensive or more than the big box store pressure canners, if you are a serious home canner budget the extra expense in somehow and get this brand. Cons: because it is well built it is heavier than the thin walled other brands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful piece of kitchen gear.","review":"For people that enjoy preserving food, and plan on doing any amount beyond the novelty quantity, it is worth the money to purchase one of the All American pressure cookers.

It's been scary, since I could die from mistakes. But I've done it. And what I've quickly come to learn is that this thing is tiny. Absolutely positively just far too small.It's a good canner. Easy to clean, a real regulator (a weight that wobbles), and a non-screw type lid.

I wanted to only buy one, and this one is a serious canner! It is hefty, so not for those who can't lift but I love it and am sure I made the right choice with this brand - I was so happy to find one made in the USA, and it is well worth the money!

In all honesty, I am disgusted by this author and by the people who gave her great reviews. It made me more sad than happy. Shame on you, Zippy, for making small town folks sound like animals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I can't believe all the good reviews for this book. It is a boring book. There is no substance to the book and it is poorly written. The author just rambles on about nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disorganized memoirs","review":"I found this book very disjointed and unconnected. It is hard to determine how old Zippy is in any given chapter. Chapters do not flow. There are no transitions. I also thought the author told tales that are probably embarrassing to the families involved. These are real people and some she considered her best friends. I am glad I was not a friend of Haven (Betsy) Kimmel in Mooreland, In."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I've read in years!","review":"Terrible book! I love a good memoir more than anything (The Glass Castle, for an example of an excellent memoir), but usually have one of two complaints. For the most part, memoirs today are either well-written books about nothing, or poorly-written books about something unusual and fascinating. Kimmel achieves what I thought was impossible and writes without style or order about nothing!The subtitle doesn't make any sense either: \\"growing up small\\"?? That's different from \\"growing up in a small town\\".Just a few pages in, I was sure that the book I was holding was completely different from the book that received all of the positive reviews, but I was wrong. For some reason, Kimmel has found a way to trick readers, and I just don't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Me\\" Generation - Zippy","review":"Well written but it is hardly deep or cerebral. Read about someone who is very taken with herself and wanted to write a book. So is this what our new generation of writers is about? The world is full of miraculous wonders, great pain and suffering, revolutionary ideas that people die for, and Zippy got a \\"piano\\" for Christmas. My copy is for sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who's the writer in the family?","review":"I started A Girl Named Zippy prejudiced in its favor, based on reviews I'd read, and at first I wasn't disappointed. In fact, my initial reaction was so favorable that it took me a while to admit to myself how disenchanted I later became. After a while, the narrator stops seeming charmily witty and comes across, instead, as nasty. \\"I thought she just got disgusting,\\" my 19-year-old daughter said forthrightly. (More discerning than I, she simply stopped reading a third of the way through.) What appears to be a complete lack of any spiritual dimension is, I think, what does Kimmel in; it's one thing to reject the specific religious tradition of one's family, but a childish brat with no larger frame of reference just isn't appealing. It occured to me later that in the first pages of her book, Kimmel relies heavily on quoting from entries made in her baby book by her mother; maybe the mother is the one whose memoir I'd really like to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"to be avoided ?","review":"anyone wondering about this book would surely be warned to avoid it by the two official reviews chosen by amazon -picking four lines at random i quote, thus:'The truths of childhood are rendered in lush yet simple prose''Over and over, we encounter pearls of third-grade wisdom revealed in a child's assured voice''The startling baby photograph on the cover should catch browsers' eyes''multitudes of animals, including a chicken she loved and treated like a baby'i rest my case!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Small","review":"The book called A Girl Name Zippy , Zippy the word mean full ofzip , lively and energetic .

I thought it looked too wholesome and possibly boring. But while it was fairly wholesome, it was true to small town life and hilarious. The author does a beautiful job of bringing the characters to life and revealing a childhood filled with loving parents, siblings and friends. It was refreshing to read a memoir that was happy and even grateful."},{"rating":"2","title":"unbelievable price","review":"The book was in perfect condition (said only \\"good\\" but looked like it had never been touched) and came at a price so low I was afraid it was too good to be true.

Haven Kimmel's voice was so true that I felt like I was eight years old all over again. Did not want it to end. What a GREAT read! Will look for more from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Savor every sentence","review":"I admire this writer for managing to write a memoir about a fairly average childhood and make it so engaging. Her use of language is so stellar, I think she could have written about drinking water for 300 pages and it would have been fantastic. If you're looking for major plot twists and turns, this book probably isn't for you. But if you appreciate the turn of a phrase and fresh images, you have to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and sweet but not without sadness too","review":"I enjoyed this memoir of the life of a small town girl growing up in the 70's. It was certainly funny, poignant, and sharply witty. I did however come away with a fairly pervasive sense of underlying sadness. While I believe the author's childhood to be basically a happy one, there were certainly some elements of major dysfunction going on in this family (she devotes an entire section to the things her father has won and lost through gambling). It would also appear that her mother suffered from rather chronic depression (she spends most of the book on the couch reading). That being said it was obvious that the author was well loved by her family, and it's a pleasant change to read a memoir about childhood that isn't filled with pain and abuse."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect summertime read","review":"Each chapter I read put a smile on my face! I enjoyed the author's collection of childhood memories. A great book to read on carefee summer days.

Boring stories and boring characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd book","review":"I enjoyed some of the little girl humor, but was often confused about Zippy's age throughout the book. Notice I call it a book rather then a story. I kept waiting to find a purpose for this book and never found it. I would only recommend this book at 1/3 the price because normally you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful...just awful","review":"I read every book with an open mind and it takes a really rotten one for me to not finish it. I couldn't get more than 1/4 of the way through this book (and I had to force myself to get that far).I just can't understand the great reviews this book got...it actually made me wonder if people were reading the same thing I was. What I did read of this book was barely interesting and many parts were just nauseating -- talking about a dog and his wormy butt, her friend throwing a dead baby pig in to a dogs pen, her chicken being killed by a dog and her dad going off to kill the dog with a gun. I actually had to put the book down as I am afraid of what animal horror story awaits me next.Her stories are not funny, clever or amusing they are self centered and I can't believe she got this published."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE IT!!!","review":"I finished this book on a plane, and immediately wanted to read it again. Zippy is a wonderful child, a little girl so full of spunk. The characters as described by Zippy are so colorful. The whole book is just darling. I grew up in the 60's and could relate to so much in the book. I have been telling everyone about it. It is a book I will read over and over and over again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, great book!","review":"I am a little biased when it comes to Haven Kimmel. I have personally known Haven for over twenty years. I loved her book. I think anyone wanting a good laugh, read this book. She is wonderful in person and her book was just as good. Wonderful reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back Home in Indiana - Wonderful","review":"A wonderful book capturing a very special time. I bought this without benefit of any review or recommendation. How pleased I was with the result. It's a great read which captures the time, the place, the sights, the smells and the joy of small-town Indiana. Funny is most parts, sad in some, but a beautifully portrayed slice of Americana. This is an author to watch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet and funny","review":"It's a gifted writer who can credibly recall the voice of a child, and Ms. Kimmel is a gifted writer. Frank McCourt was able to do this exceptionally well in ANGELA'S ASHES (and the film makers weren't able to do it at all). The world does look different when viewed through the eyes of a child, indeed because that child has no other frame of reference. And Zippy's observations made this book funny and touching. I loved the way she viewed her older sister, especially in the beauty contest chapter. I also thought wistfully of days gone by, and how much more freedom Zippy (and I) had in youth. Today, in this much more violent world, I wonder if children can simply wander safely through even the smallest towns, looking for adventure the way Zippy did. And that cover photo! How can you look at that face without smiling?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A quick read that ran out of ZIP at the end","review":"I confess that I read this book in a few shourt hours. Fascinating. The author has captured her voice as a child admirably. The first half of the book is suprising clever and I found myself laughing outloud often, but by the end, the stories began to feel a little too over the top, like the author was trying too hard to be sensational... instead of just being her clever like she was in the beginning. Still, an awesome book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Girl Named Zippy","review":"Very slow reading. I'm having trouble finishing it. I bought the sequal to this book also, hope I can get to it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"I laughed out loud while reading this book. My 5 yr old son said, \\"tell me the joke\\". I just smiled and said it was a grown-up funny... Then I realized I sounded like Zippy's mom, as I sat on the corner of my couch!!!This was a wonderful read. And with two kids I love the short stories. It was easy to stop and come back to. I look forward to reading the rest of her books. I am thankful to a parenting magazine that mentioned her newest book, otherwise I would probably not have known to read Haven's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully hilarious!","review":"If you grew up in small town America, you will relate to this more than you'd like to admit. Be aware where you read it - when you laugh out loud, be prepared for funny looks from passersby! The sequel is worth reading, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it!","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend who knew I had grown up in the midwest. It definitely brought back a few memories! I laughted out loud at several parts. It was sweet and yet had an underlying sadness that is understood only now that we are adults. one of the best books that I have read in awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching, and uproariously funny!","review":"This is a book of childhood memories, presented simultaneously (and seamlessly) from the point of view of the child living these adventures, and of a woman who sees how limited that child's vision was. This book has an edge that reminds me of \\"Malcolm in the Middle\\" (but set in Indiana in the 60's). The heroine's matter-of-fact acceptance of her friend's inability to speak and her own to speak for her is rendered hilarious when the friend's mother calls the girl to have her interpret her daughter's unspoken desires over the phone. Her righteous indigation over the incompetence of her teacher is wise and witty, but when she confides her opinion to, let's say, a poorly-chosen confessor, the comedy is irresistable. Descriptions of her parents' vacation preparations will surely strike a chord with baby boomers from all over America. I'd love to hear more of this writer's stories!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Positively charming","review":"After reading \\"The Solace of Leaving Early,\\" I was prepared to enjoy \\"A Girl Named Zippy\\" and I did. Haven Kimmel has created an \\"everyman\\" small midwestern hometown in the '50s where people knew their neighbors and children grew up with strong relationshps to family and friends. Trust was a given then and suspicion of people one didn't know was rare. It is apparent that Zippy profited from a childhood where she was free to make her own decisions and draw her own conclusions. My favorite character is her dad, who treated Zippy, her sister and brother with the respect that everyone is due and allowed them to enjoy his wonderfully dry humor. He was also not a hypocrite, so they gained an early insight into integrity of character. I liked everyone I \\"met\\" in the pages of this wonderful book. I would like to have been Zippy's friend then - and now."},{"rating":"2","title":"small town enjoyment","review":"if you've ever lived in a small town, you will know this hits close to your heart. not until you become an adult do you yearn for simple things in life again. what a gem!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun...nostalgic book","review":"Zippy is the equivalent of A Christmas Story from a girl's perspective.It's enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tells it like it is-but with a lot of humor","review":"Haven has told her story with humor and thoughtfulness.

I have never thrown a book in the trash before. I have read about baby pigs being thrown to dogs, horses dying from eating barbed wire fence, rabbits being hatcheted, a chicken being eaten by a dog, dogs dying painful deaths in a number of horrendous ways, and a woman who, after death, was nibbled on by her pet cats. I have heard about the dirty, retarded, dysfunctional people of this town. Everyone appears to be either fat or filthy. I can find no redeeming value in this book. I cannot imagine finding anything funny about this book, unless one has such low self-esteem, that they enjoy laughing about people more decadent than themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"From A to Z on Janis","review":"Three slightly blurred pictures of the girl from Texas once voted: \\"The Ugliest Man On Campus\\".From the rising star: Cheap Trills.

The best of them all is \\"An Unwilling Conquest\\", which is Harry's story. Leaving town to avoid the machinations of match-making mamas following the revellation of the fortune recently inherited by the two Lester brothers, Harry determines he won't fall into any woman's clutches.

You have to press down on a protrusion in order to move the blade. At first I was somewhat annoyed with this requirement But, as I continued to use the cutter I began to appreciate this feature because it prevents the accidental extraction of the blade.

It was described as being a thriller revenge story with suspense and tension, and it could have been that, too. Instead, it bogged down and lost my interest. I still watched to see if there would be revenge, though we didn't get to see a revenge plot develop as I had hoped. It's well-acted but not very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great revenge drama with beautiful Brigitte Lin!","review":"Gorgeous Brigitte Lin on the warpath for revenge against husband Tony Leung. Superb performance by Lin and Leung as no-good husband!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BOTHER!!!","review":"After purchasing every available copy of this film on the market, please take my advise -- DO NOT BOTHER!There is obviously no decent print of this film currently available. Being that it was originally produced by Samuel Goldwyn and released through United Artists, one might assume that MGM/UA Home Video might hold the original negatives (since they appear to have the rights to other Goldwyn films presently). The truth may be that no better version of this film exists, and that would be a damn shame given its historic significance and the place it held in Soviet/US relations at the time it was made.But until MGM Home Video releases this title (IF they ever do), save your bucks and download it for free off of the Internet. The quality can't be any worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Movie - Awful Print","review":"It is unfortunate when a classic is treated with such disregard and carelessness as this one has been.The film quality is 'ok' but with some fuzzy scenes and a few missing frames and film burn here and there. The sound is of poor quality, dropping off to near silence at many points. To add insult to injury, my copy came complete with a manufacturing defect that stops the film short of it's conclusion.All is not lost however... \\"Reel Enterprises\\" was kind enough to include a persistant watermark of it's logo in the lower right hand corner throughout the entire film. Otherwise I would have definitly thought this was a bootleg or Korean import.A real shame for such an otherwise great film.No menu, no extras, no frills but cheap at $10.00"},{"rating":"1","title":"propaganda plus","review":"Good cast, some well-orchestrated scenes, but a strange choice for to be made by the director of ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT and Lilian Hellman at her worst. The \\"happy singing peasants\\" as a chorus of saintly comrades is especially cloying. Look instead to two other very similar films (with some of the same cast members): DRAGON SEED and, especially, the far superior EDGE OF DARKNESS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Agitprop","review":"Even if you aren't a closet Stalinist, it's still wooden, strident propaganda, and poorly executed. Although it manages to be even more repulsive than this, Mission to Moscow (Warner's contribution at the behest of FDR) is a better example of morbidly interesting propaganda.North Star presents the Soviet land of Oz, complete with dancing, well-fed, collectivized peasants (you half expect to see Shirley Jones make an appearance). Worth seeing -- although not buying -- if you want to see the Big Lie in action. And it's a whoppin' Big Lie too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five years later and we were told to hate these people!","review":"Here we have Walter Brennan and Dean Jagger leading an all star castin a movie telling how brave the Russian people are.There were several of these early 40's war movies showingour solidarity with the Russian against the Germans.The same governments turned on each other just a short time further on.In a time when the KGB has fallen we still have the CIA:they are the same sort of beast as these governmentsthat tell us to love them one year and hate them the next?There is a lesson here of history."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice period piece","review":"I think that some of the people who have reviewed this film have forgotten or miss the point that at the time the movie was made, the USSR was an ally of the USA and that the film industry was expected to show our ally in a good light...especially given the fact that for many years most Americans had been taught (as they would be again after the war) that the Communist USSR was the great boogy man.Although much of the movie stretches credulity today, it really seems little different in its heroics than other, more American propoganda pieces like BATAAN or CORREGIDOR or, for that matter WAKE ISLAND where all Americans are good and all the enemy are evil. It was a convention of the times. The cast and directing are really quite good, and the Hellman script is not really bad so much as being the required two dimensional. Forget the polemics, relax, and watch a first rate cast, director, and crew work with Hollywood's usual high production values."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok for beginners","review":"I am a dancer and use pilates to keep my muscles toned and my body flexible.

Moira Stott's soothing instructions is as easy or as hard as you want it to be. Excellent cuing, without bouncy, hyper movements. Enjoyed this tape and highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRAVO ETIENNE GERARD","review":"How Sir Arthur Conan Doyle can write a character that is irritatingly arrogant yet, charmingly loyal and naive is beyond me. The depth of Gerard's character rivals even the great Sherlock Holmes. Just as with his more famous counterpart(Holmes), Gerard is not just a hero(although there can be no questioning his bravery),he can also be a clown,(without ever realizing it)a ladies man, the greatest swordsman in the Grande' Armee(or at least so he tells us). With exciting short stories we venture through Gerard's career as a cavalry officer. He quite often bumbles his way into situations an officer of his rank should never allow himself into yet, it is these situations once gotten out of(after much daring and a little bit of luck)that build not only his career but, the readers passion for his character. These stories are an excellent companion to the more famous Sherlock Holmes stories. Where have all the writers with skills like Doyle's gone?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous fun in the Napoleonic Wars!","review":"Perhaps the most entertaining and funny of all Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's creations is Brigadier Gerard, hussar in the Napoleonic armies of France. Confident and brash but very foolish, he is the epitome of chivalry and adventure.These collected tales vary in quality, but most of them are vivid, exciting and very humourous. They are packed full of incident and memorable characters - none more so than Gerard himself - and are a marvellous evocation of that period of European history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Going to Mali next week","review":"I'm going to Mali next week to help build a school in a village there. I read this book in preparation for my travels. I could clearly visualize what everyday life is like in a small village in this country and the hurdles the people must overcome in order to live a healthy, productive life there. The midwife, Monique felt like a friend by the end of the book. I will not forget this story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really an exceptional story","review":"This is the type of book you read in several hours because you can't put it down. As Anne Fadiman observes on the back cover \\"there have been many accounts of studying people from other cultures, but few of actually being friends with them...\\" At the end of this book, you wonder who really has the better world. Community and friendship, \\"joking cousins\\" (and some very funny stories that result from a less-that-perfect grasp of the local language), a connection to nature...this community has many positives that will probably be a surprise to those surrounded by strip malls and isolated by modern living. More people should read this book. They'd be less cavalier about the lack of aid to African nations."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book opened a new world for me","review":"My niece sent me \\"Monique and the Mango Rains\\" - what a marvelous book! What a glorious memorial to a great woman. The whole book moved not only me, but also my husband, who read it first. Monique was made so real to us. The other thing that so impressed me about this remarkable book is the way Kris has told the truth as it is, all the way through! A very brave decision and so well carried out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful and fulfilling","review":"This is a delightful book, made more special by the fact that it is a true story. Kris is a skilled writer who captures the sense of life in Mali and the personality of her beloved Monique. I am glad she decided to tell her story: I will never forget it, or Monique..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monique rocks","review":"A delightful glimpse into Malian culture and village life. Well written and intimate. Also, a great testament to the men and women who step up to the challenges of the Peace Core to improve the lives of others, themselves and the world they came from. Fifty years and counting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real.","review":"I have read a handful of RPCV books - but this may have been one of my favorites. Kris Holloway does not have an air of pretentiousness about her as some other authors do, and I feel her reactions to certain events and discoveries in the book are similar to what my own would be. I was able to relate to her.Her story molds Monique into a intelligent, strong, selfless, beautiful and inspiring woman whose untimely death brought tears to my eyes. I think we all would have been lucky to have known such a woman.Kris' fight for Monique's personal rights as well as the service she offers to Nampossela was also inspiring and uplifting. I truly respect her and appreciate her writing about her time with Monique and the people of her village."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and fast read","review":"Definetely would recommend this book. Monique is a midwife in a male dominated society. She is the epitomy of many women in third world countries. I found this book to be inspiring. We are going to discuss it in my next book group."},{"rating":"1","title":"how to love Africa?","review":"I am reading the book Monique and the mango rains.I also lived for many years in Ghana and I am discovering the so many similarities in those West African cultures and traditions. The daily life described by Kris is exactly the copy of a day in Ghana in the rural areas.So congratulations to Kris for the ability in transferring images and emotions.I have some reserves however because eventually it seems that also Kris fell sick with the \\"Aid workers syndrome\\": willing to be involved but in reality totally distant from the souls of those people. It is the main sin of the Aid Workers: the pride dressed under an appearance of humility.No problem: it is the commonest sin and can be forgiven if only there is repentance.I suggest the reading of Dead Aid of Dambisa Moyo; The lords of Poverty of Graham Hancock; My African Mission (written by myself).A friend of Africa"},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic","review":"A wonderful story of friendship and an interesting look at life in the Peace Corps and Mali in the 80's.

Kris Holloway writes beautifully of her experiences with Monique, a young midwife in Mali (Africa) and about her culture and her heritage. I was so moved by her writing that I even wrote to her to thank her for such lovely prose. If you are looking for a great book, the kind you can't put down until you have reached the back cover, this is it! Kris, thanks for sharing yourself and Monique with all of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"I absoutely loved this book, couldn't put it down.

It is worth reading if you are interested in women's health, public health, birthing, or in Mali in general.

This is basically a boardgame copy of, this game: [...]You would definitely be better off playing the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most violent? Surely not?","review":"Well, maybe this is the most violent Eurowestern ever made, but that's relative. All the violence is very much IMPLICIT rather than explicit and it all looks a bit tame to modern eyes. During the 'rape' scene, for example, it's all about focussing on the faces rather than the event, which means that 'Chato's Land', as a very basic comparison off the top of my head, is far more raw, brutal, violent, believable and enjoyable.And obviously there's more to a film than simple violence. This movie is just downright grim, from the characters to the stark landscape.With no redeeming qualities, this film is extremely disappointing. Unless you really have to watch every Eurowestern ever made, avoid this one and look for something a bit more special and not as overrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Return to \\"Get A Clue\\"","review":"This is one of the least interesting books I've read in a very long time. No drama, no plot other than perhaps a middle-aged lawyer reliving his own disaffection w/ his comfortable family & wife & falling for a beautiful young woman. The history of New Orleans as related by the author is quite good, but as a book, a novel, give me a break. Perhaps this might fall into a category of \\"reimagined autobiography\\". A novel it isn't, that's for sure. The story line is trite, the writing brittle and boring. This book has about as much suspense, drama and engaging scenes as a walk down a midwestern street on a football Saturday. There ain't nothin' happenin' there. Please don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not just about Mardi Gras","review":"I was expecting a good novel about Mardi Gras. It took about half the book before the parades even started. It's an interesting story, but if you're expecting the plot to be centered around Carnival in New Orleans exclusively you might be disappointed. The book was hard to read because the editing was really bad. Being a Louisiana native, I noticed several misspellings of New Orleans' places and in more than a few instances sentences just don't make sense. That was the biggest disappointment - that a book would get out with these kinds of mistakes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Work","review":"A well-written classic, though not well known.

Five stars doesn't do it justice. I may write a second review simply to get the additional five stars this set deserves.Something's powerfully right when one of the weakest songs in a five-disc set is a top ten hit (In the Ghetto).

In between the lackluster films(which I love) and their respective soundtracks,Elvis recorded some real gems that only added to his catalog. What is special about this collection for me is that they have included the lions share of the tracks from Elvis' legendary album \\"From Elvis in Memphis\\". Recorded at American Sound Studio's in Memphis in 1969.This album which included such classics as \\"Suspicious Minds\\",\\"In the Ghetto\\" and \\"Wearin' that loved on look\\", revitalized Elvis' career and set the stage for the next decade of standard setting live performances.Well worth the money for the true Elvis fanatic."},{"rating":"1","title":"FRUSTRATED","review":"HAD TV/DVD/VCR COMBO FROM 7/06.

This book is great if you need some extra problem sets to help enhance what you know. If you have forgotten how to do the math and need a step by step refresher, do not buy this book. The author sets up the example without explaining why it is set up that way and then gives an answer to the problem without showing how it is solved. It leaves somebody like me very frustrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing for a Schaum's","review":"I've used Schaum's texts numerous times for everything from bookkeeping to algebra and thought they were extremely helpful and well-organized, so I was surprised by how rushed the presentation in this book is. The \\"solved\\" problems jump from a to b to z with no explanation of the steps involved or, often, even the formulas used.

Although I think the history is a good one and the story could have been a good one, the rambling narrative, skipping from past to present, skipping between the dialogue of one character to the other, going from the thought of one person to that of another etc., made this story very difficult to read. In essence, it was more work than enjoyment."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Wore Me Out!","review":"This book became such a tiresome experience! I read a lot (more than most professional book reviewers, I'll bet), and this is one that I'm not exactly sure how it has garnered some of the acclaim it has. It is steady flow of digressions and tangets and ho-hum prose. If I wrote a short story in the same style for a literature class, I would receive a failing grade. The basic plot carries some intrigue, and would probably make an excellent story under different circumstances. But it takes the entire book of 400+ pages to advance a mere 24 hours. Rather than being a book that you can't put down, it is an exercise in reading a book that you would rather put down. I suggest you skip it and read The Known World (Pulitzer prizer winner Edward P. Jones) if you're looking for a moving book that will teach you about slavery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Spare Yourself","review":"Please spare yourself and do not read this book. I finished it, only because I am compulsive about starting any book I finish. But it took me more than three months to finish this because it was so painful! I hate to reiterate what other reviewers have said, but the characters ramble, the time shifts from past to present, and not much of it directly relates to the murder that is at the center of the plot. I did enjoy learning about the history of the beautiful island of Barbados, and that is the reason for the one star. Disappointing, overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intruiging!","review":"On one level this book is about a murder confession. On another, it starkly presents disturbing images of the plantation system in Barbados in the first half of the last (20th) century.

It's not always easy to read, and on occasion the focus seems to drift, but personally, I found it riveting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Than Tylenol PM","review":"This book is 462 pages long.

However, the local language and references to many things I grew up with (eg clammy cherry trees) were enough to make it an enjoyable book. I was able to read about things I have not seen/heard since I left about 20 years ago. My husband enjoyed parts of the book that I pointed out to him - after only spending short holidays on the island every few years, he too was able to relate to some of the local references. A great book to give you a taste of life on the island."},{"rating":"1","title":"Madly uninteresting!","review":"I hated this book!

I took it out of the library b/c it had won the Govenor General's Award, so I figured it had to be good. Boy was I ever wrong!This book is dull. It is s-l-o-w moving from start to finish and it is written in this slang type speech (which I suppose was common for the age but) which makes it very difficult to read.

The plot had the potential to be worthy, but Clarke destroyed that.The story is long and sluggish. One should have no joy in reading the narrative unless one were a masochist. 99% of the book is in the patois of the area and can drive the reader up the wall.

Once we got it together, our daughter could not switch it to any other position...nor could I. The pieces kept snapping out and the plastic pieces that hold the frame together are already showing signs of stress. While pushing the stroller through the house, the front tray simply fell off. We were quite upset with the wheels also. The wheels are simply hard plastic and do not turn well. I was disappointed that I had to take this toy away from our daughter, she was so excited to get it.

My 2-year old daughter loves it though! Also, the \\"mommy\\" tray at the top of the handle is totally for show.

When my husband put it together the whole frame was bent. There was no way to straighten it out. It looked horrible. The sun shade couldn't be attatched because of how bent the carriage was. The fish bowl played this horrible music that was not appealing. If you tried to adjust the stroller a little bit the seat would pop off. I bought my daughter the graco one too and had no problems with it. I was really disappointed because this stroller was real cute and I liked the basket that hung on the back.I wouldn't recommend anyone buying it because I am sure they are all going to be bent somewhere and then you will just have to pack it all up again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Autobiography of an Allied fighter pilot","review":"This is a realistic autobiography of an ace Canadian pilot who downed over 70 German planes in WWI; he gives a realistic picture of what it was like to be there in person."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"I Have not heard this album in many years.

The book is full of interesting little tidbits: for example, \\"Mose\\" (meaning \\"son\\" or \\"one who is born\\" in Egyptian) was commonly a part of ancient Egyptian names, and kings had names like \\"Thut-mose\\" (so it makes sense that the egyptians would name a baby \\"Moses\\" or some variant thereof). Basically a work of history rather than theology--that is, it doesn't really purport to address the big questions of who wrote Exodus, etc. Rather, it shows readers how Exodus made sense to ancient readers familiar with heathen customs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Near East","review":"This is a commentary on the book of Exodus by the Jewish scholar, Nahum M.

The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that the question of the rape of slave women and the property in resultant children is not addressed. The author discusses what it might conceivably mean to own a person's labor power, but not what it also means to own her reproductive capacity and the children that resulted, on the one hand, from relations between blacks, and, on the other, relations between white slaveholders and enslaved women. The study is broad-ranging and provocative, but it would be even stronger if gender were considered somewhere other than in the (admittedly fascinating) discussion of the way certain issues play out in very early films."},{"rating":"1","title":"dated","review":"the rest of my workshop class liked this, but 5 years later, i wouldn't plan on re-reading it, and i doubt that any of my classmates would take it as seriously. sophomoric."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liberal-schmiberal","review":"This brand of crazy is as short sighted as the rest of politics today.

I am confused why this is marketed as a bath and kitchen waterproof sealant. At least it's easy to remove"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"We bought a tube of this at a local store because it was specifically marketed for \\"kitchen and bath\\" use, and we figured it'd hold up well against the rigors of the damp bathroom environment. Not so! After carefully cleaning, caulking, and waiting for this stuff to cure, my wife and I happily resumed taking showers. Not a week later trouble began: our new caulk turned to goo. This stuff is NOT waterproof, and should not be used anywhere where there's even a slight chance that it will get damp (in my case, that means it just shouldn't be used). I HIGHLY recommend that you consider other caulks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless stuff leaving me in the lurch","review":"Unfortunately I did not read any reviews before purchasing this at my local hardware store.

Now I have to tell them no showers????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work -- stay away","review":"After three tries, letting it dry for successively longer spans, still would not dry sufficiently. Once it gets wet from the shower, it turns soggy and does not seal. Let it sit for longer than the directions call for (more than 36 hours). I had a similar experience a year ago with this same product, and thought it was probably just a bad batch, but it appears it is a bad formula."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Product is Total Crap!! Stay away!!","review":"Unfortunately, Amazon wouldn't let me rate this product no stars. I used this product in a shower stall. After waiting 2 days for it to cure, I gave the family the OK to use the shower stall while I remodeled another bathroom. After 4 days the caulk turned to mush! I covered the joints with good old duct tape late at night to buy me some time to go to the store and buy a product that will work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!!!","review":"My husband just caulked our bathroom shower.

I took a shower then before I left I checked out the tub and the caulk was flaking off. Maybe I didn't wait long enough? I removed everything, cleaned it up, applied it and waited one week. After the first shower the stuff was flaking off again. Completely worthless and a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed","review":"Lots of prep work and three days without the shower operating just to be on the safe side. The first shower caused the apparently dry seals to ribbon up and pull from the joint. I am beyond frustrated with this product. Don't use around water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for decoden","review":"Yes, I know. This is supposed to be for kitchens and baths. I got this for decoden. If you don't know what that is, it's a hobby of decorating phone cases. I use this as the frosting. It is quite white and it does the job.It doesn't dry squishy like most caulk but pretty hard. It takes days to dry though. It dries faster if you leave it in front of a fan. I haven't tested the case in water but according to the other reviews, it doesn't seem like it would be a good idea. Good thing phone cases are not meant to be in water anyway.In short, if you're buying this for phone case decorating, do so without hesitation. Just make sure it is completely dry. If you are patient, wait 3-4 days. Leave it in front of a COOL fan to speed up the process. If you're buying this for kitchen and bath, it seems like you should look somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kwik Seal & Kwik Failure","review":"Followed the instructions to the letter (including in-depth removal of old caulk and cleaning).

Six months after using it, it is still in perfect condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't hold well","review":"I purchased this caulk to use around my tub. I also removed the old caulk and cleaned the area, as directed. The caulk was easy to apply. I waited over 24 hours before using the tub. It felt dry to the touch. However, immediately after taking a shower I could see parts of the caulk were peeling up. Other areas would tear apart when I rubbed my finger over it. I removed the caulk, re-caulked, and waited 48 hours...thinking this would help. Unfortunately, it hasn't. This product does not hold up well when exposed to water, even though it is specifically rated for such applications. I spent a fair amount of time on this project and am not looking forward to having to do it a third time (when I do, it won't be with this product). The previous reviewer's caulk failed after 6 months. I'll be impressed if mine lasts anywhere near that long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth 1 Star","review":"This stuff is a joke.

He points out a great deal of classical and modern history of outstanding merit and durability. This booklet, however, is published by the ISI's publishing house. Reading it is like being flung back into the academic culture of East Coast Universities in the 1950s. The sensation is bizarre, and horribly exclusionary. Almost any other introduction to the discipline for undergraduates would be better by showing that non-European, non-Christian stories also have merit. History is not only the study of personal and national heritage, but the trials and value of all human cultures, even those not personally relevant. The book lacks such generosity, often termed imaginative sympathy. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short, and Disappointing","review":"I've read and thoroughly enjoyed Margolin's seven other novels. This one -- to me, short at 292 pages less the equivalent of about 45 blank pages -- simply has an overcomplicated plot and underdeveloped characters. Sounds like a book forced out to meet a deadline. The fact that it's organized into 54 chapters -- so like 5 pages each -- gives you an idea of how choppy this story is. Plus real lawyers just don't do stuff like this. The one tactic I liked was the mini-novel of an much earlier murder (that more or less gets solved right along with our fresh one) as it diverted one from the story at hand while bringing you back to real time from out in left field. Tighten up the plot, get us better acquainted with the characters, hopefully fewer in number, and add some flesh to the story and we might have something here."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have read them all","review":"I love his style of writing there is never a dull moment, you get engaged in the characters.

I haven't quite finished it yet, but I will because I can't put down a book this far into it. I would not, however, recommend it to anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gone and Forgotten","review":"Margolin's latest effort is a far cry from the giants such as After Dark and Gone, But Not Forgotten. The book premise is ludicrous and does not get started. The book's plot development holds no suspense and is by far the worst of all his efforts. Usually, his books are the highlight of my summerr reading activity but this fails to generate any excitement. I wish they would find the real Philip Margolin because he certainly did not write this book. Oh!! How the mighty have fallen. This book is about 300 pages too long. Once you get past the copyright page, it is all downhill from there. This book should be Gone and Forgetten. I strongly recommend that you do not \\"Associate\\" yourself with this novel and wait for his next effort. Please may the real Margolin come back and replace this imposter."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment by Margolin!","review":"Daniel Ames, \\"the Associate,\\" keeps making the same mistakes throughout the book. His character becomes maddingly annoying simply for his stupidity. Since he supposedly was bright enough to put himself through law school and be hired by one of the top-notch firms in Portland, this premise alone lacks credibility. Actually, Daniel Ames is not especially likable nor the majority of the company he keeps. While the plot has some possibilities, there are no real surprises. Hopefully, Mr. Margolin will get back to basics and his next offering will be more entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent Margolin mystery!","review":"I've read all of Mr. Margolin's books and enjoyed every one. \\"The Associate\\" was certainly no exception, and THIS particular associate takes us on a wild ride indeed.We all learn by experience, but apparently Daniel Ames should have gone to summer school. Before we even get to know him, he's already in big trouble. We know he's been made the fall guy, but we can't be sure by whom. Things go from bad to worse, and, okay, while there isn't much \\"legal\\" in this thriller, the trip is exciting.Many of the details are unrealistic in terms of what happens in a real law firm, but reality is sometimes boring in the extreme. Who would want to read a medical thriller that detailed every little clamp and sponge?"},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF MARGOLIN'S BEST!","review":"I was lucky enough to get an Advanced Readers Copy of this novel, even though I paid a little more money. I just couldn't wait till it was released. Phillip Margolin is one of my favorite courtroom thriller authors. \\"The Associate\\" was very interesting. It dealt with Daniel Ames, a lawyer working for a firm in Oregon. He is defending a pharmaceutical company aganist allegations that one of their drugs is the cause to many disfunctions and problems with newborn children. The case picks up steam when a scientist who works for the company gets burned to death. The novel gets more complex from then on, going deeper into the studies of the company and more research. The conclusion is shocking and exciting. This is a must read for courtroom and Margolin fans.

MAYBE the makings of a good novel were there, but the characters were so one-dimensional and the plot so unbelievable that I wanted to throw the book away.

I'm mad at the publishers too."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I usually love Phillip Margolin's books and was so excited when I saw he had a new one but I was very disappointed upon reading this one. I think he may have written it a long time ago and resurrected it once he became famous. The dialogue is stilted and at times downright embarrassing, the plot is ridculously intricate for no good reason and the ultimate outcome is so obvious it makes you feel like you've wasted your time.

At it's best, it is a cookie-cutter novel, without any of the drama or suspense that the top authors in this genre (Grisham, Ellis, Lashner) weave so beautifully throughout their work. At it's worst, it relies on predictable plot twists that move this tepid novel along barely fast enough to keep the reader from putting it down for good. If you suffer from insomnia, then give this book a try. Otherwise, leave it aone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Satisfying","review":"I rate this novel somewhere between 2 and 3 stars. There are some nice plot twists, but overall the story is a disappointment. Without revealing plot, I can only say that the \\"bad guys\\" are a disappointment and not really that menacing or believable. The main character also makes some silly mistakes that make you crazy as it is obvious what is he is walking into. The best characterization lies in the female investigator who helps sort out what is going on. If you are in to lawyer suspense, I recommend you skip this one and go on to other novels this auther has written (or finish all of your Baldacci reads first...)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing, entertaining - a good read","review":"This was a really good book, one that keeps you guessing from the beginning. I found myself running through some scenarios to try and figure out my best guess to what was going on, and was completely surprised with the ending. Being about a pharmaceutical company, this book is loaded with medical terminology and is pretty much on the mark in some rather complex principles. There were TONS of characters in this one, maybe a few too many. I had to keep up with who was doing what, who was on who's side, and who worked for which outfit. This only adds to the mystery of the novel, and, overall, I was really impressed with this one. I'll be reading more of Mr Margolin's works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Margolin's Best","review":"The story kept you guessing all the way till the end. The book had very engaging characters which made it easy to follow them. I personally thought this ranked among Margolin's best work.

I am glad he finally came out with what I think will be a blockbuster of a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY disappointed Margolin fan","review":"After reading and loving the far superior \\"Undertaker's Widow\\" I was excited to get an opportunity to read another of Margolin's fast paced legal thrillers. Maybe I was hoping for another plot which places a highly ethical character in a morally ambiguous situation, but what I was treated to instead was an implausible scenario which is made even worse by the actions of the main character which defy common sense. Unlike other Margolin novels, this novel is full of flaws from the main character's reactions and actions that reach new heights in stupidity to the very contrived conclusion that wrapped everything up a little too neatly. Save some time and money and read any of Margolin's other efforts, and I promise you you will leave with a better impression of someone I believe to be a very talented writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cover is the best part","review":"The intertwined stories were so complicated and convoluted that the main characters had to review the actors (whose names and locations frequently changed) and explain the plots in the last chapter of the book. None of the characters were well-developed or their motivation clear except for the lead, Daniel Ames, \\"the associate\\", who lost his job, got arrested frequently, and shot up by assorted villains. One poor snook arranged to meet Daniel at night in a graveyard in the rain only to be shot in the head and have his brains and blood spill on poor Daniel, who is very hard on clothing in this novel. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only buy this book if you are used to reading highly academic pieces","review":"This book was very hard to read.

Kurt Raab's performance in this is nothing short of revelatory it also contains some witty dialogue and two of the greatest scenes in a film I have ever seen (i.e. scene w/ raab in record store and the shocking ending). The cinematography is cinema verite in style and gives hints of what was to come (i.e. dogme 95, the digital indie movement). In a weird way you might call this the granddaddy of those films.

They show the facts, explain the protocol flows at hand and via the TINA suite of protocol decoders (equivalents to the familiar tcpdump debugging tool) allow network adminstrators and developers to locate and eliminate real life ATM problems.One of the books you'll keep in reach of your desk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea... not well made","review":"I like that the truck is wood. It has a nice, substantial feel to it. But a lot of shortcuts were taken, and therefore for the price I'm not that happy with it. For example, the ladder is really just set on top-- there is a small wooden plug that tries to hold it in place, but if you carry the truck across the room, the ladder just falls to the floor. A little bit of hardware would have secured it to the truck, but they didn't bother. Also, the 4 \\"helping hero\\" figures are sold separately, bringing the cost of truck + firefighters to $45. I don't think I got a lot of value for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"best toy ever","review":"I got this for my 9th birthday and you can see the temp indoors and outdoors. you can show how fast the wind is going.

The video is exactly as reviewed - a tutorial for trainers and not useful for the home Pilates enthusiast. Moreover it is not a \\"workout\\" but a documentary as Moira takes her students through a short variety of stretches. I could not accurately adjust myself on the barrel at home, or I kept sliding off of it. Moreover, Moira shows most exercises on one side only.The barrel itself was a waste of money. I can't find any trustworthy resources to help me utilize it and it sits around the house. I can't even unload it for 1/25 of what I paid for it!! My husband calls it \\"The Hump.\\" The most activity I get from it is moving it to vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This is not a workout dvd, it is more of an instructional video on how to teach and perform arc barrel exercises. These exercises are not challenging, some require an assistant, and I never even came close to breaking a sweat. I have a very problematic lower back and this dvd promised to \\"strengthen and stretch core muscles, support and realign the spine, rehab and prevent injury, enhance athletic performance, and relieve back pain\\" all of which I need and NONE OF WHICH IT WILL DELIVER.

It's a bit gruesome in parts (of course, they are crime scene photos!) but it is an interesting glance into L.A.'s past, and I'm glad these folks are doing what they can to preserve our heritage. The photo presentation is great - this is a nice, large format book that gives you good sized images.

It, as you would imagine, took a long time to set up and wire properly for the 12 locations we wanted monitored. It worked pretty good. Wasn't too sharp but we could see what was going on where. The monitor quality started to fade after just a couple weeks and all they had all died within a few months. Replaced all the monitors and then the cameras started going. Spent thousands keeping it working over the next couple of years. Gave up and bought a \\"real\\" system from a security company. No troubles. By the way, the picture shows you can see all four views at once on each monitor - you can't. It flips from one to another but only one camera view at a time. Also bought the same replacement systems at Home Depot. They had different nameplates but were all the same junk. Really, really a bad experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have we lost something?","review":"Modern man has lost the knowlage of the spirit world. But not all of us. This is the true story of a Canadian Native Trapper and Medicine man who comes to know Jesus. But he is not your ordanary man for he KNOWS that there are spirits all around us and he knows what they are all about. Yet he does not know the greatest spirit of them all. At least not at first. Walk with him as he tends his trapline and watch as he learns about Jesus. Then be amazed as his simple faith changes the life of seasoned christians. Dare to belive as he discribes the spirit world around us and your life will never be the same again. \\"For we battle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers\\".

Wizard of Gore is one of the weakest of the lot. Even though all of HGL's movies look pathetically cheesy by today's standards, Wizard suffers from blah grossout scenes and way too much filler material between them. It's the type of movie where your finger's on the fast forward button for 7/8ths of the flick. A great intro to HGL's films is the impressive 2000 Maniacs, which combines original death scenes along with some sharp black humor. Wizard is just drab in all aspects."},{"rating":"1","title":"crappy movie","review":"just don't like it, i like horror, but this was just stupid, blood and guts but not entertaining, will sell soon..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this turkey!","review":"The plot is intriguing - Is the illusion the apparent deaths on-stage or the temporary continued zombie-like \\"life\\" of the murdered?But the acting is absolutely terrible!

The price was right and it seemed like a good quality sound card. Everything was fine until I plugged it into my Macbook Pro running Lion.

So after spending some time googling stuff, I came across this link:[...]Basically, it's a known issue and the only fix is uninstalling and reinstalling the sound card driver every time you want to use the DJIO. Freakin' ridiculous. And it doesn't seem like Numark is in a hurry to update their drivers.So, basically if you have a Mac running Lion, DO NOT buy this until they have resolved the driver issue.

The only noises that came from it were crackling noises. I am returning this product soon.

Every song is different, and they each have their own story to tell. He is able to reach out to people through his music, which takes an encredible amount of talent and dedication to accomplish. His tone quality on each song is outstanding. The dampening technique he uses lets the melody sing out. He plays difficult pieces, and adds his own personality to them not only by writing them himself, but by improving them by playing them a little differently everytime he performs. He is an amazing performer and vibist which set this CD up for success before he had begun recording. I recommend this CD to any and all musicians who come across it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, well-rounded album","review":"This album may be almost indistinguishable from a LOT of Merzbow, but it seems to have more energy than some.

I listened in headphones for the anticipated full effect; to play this on a stereo even a tick above minimum volume would earn a sure citation and scare the living daylights out of anyone of physical or emotional propinquity. I must take issue with the 5-star \\"classic\\" ratings, given the rather narrow audience. I like freeform just as much if not considerably more than \\"the next\\" guy, but I do not enjoy the sensation of blood trickling out of my ears. In the end, I wonder why I listened to this, and I do not think I will seek any more. I think I do see the \\"art\\" of this noise, but I cannot appreciate it.

Dr. Clarke has been a mentor for me, at a distance, and it began with this novel. It would be a dream come true to somehow thank Dr. Clarke in person for all he has done for me.

I think the secret to Clarke's best work is that he is perhaps science fiction's most gifted minimalist; instead of bogging the reader down with unnecessary jargon and info dumps, he writes in a crystal-clear style that gives the impression that you are looking at his brilliantly-imagined cityscapes and landscapes through a window rather than reading about them in a book. He also has the gift of defying expectations - I knew at the beginning of this book that he was going to take his protagonist on a great adventure; to say that that adventure went far, far beyond what I had expected is a vast understatement.Give this one a go.

I was given this book in 1957 and have never been with out it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sci-Fi Classic","review":"When it comes to science fiction, the best is written by scientitsts. And Arthur C Clarke's work is consistently top quality. I read this twenty years ago as a high school student, yet the story was so fascinating that I recently revisited this book. Other reviewers have already recounted the outline of the story of Alvin's perils and triumphs in Diaspar, a city in the far future. There's no need to go over it again in this review. Suffice it to say that for anyone with an interest in science fiction, this one should be near the top of your list."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best novel ever written","review":"This novel is so awe-inspiring and yet so down-to earth simultaineously. The main character's struggles are rich in superb symbolism. The setting Clarke describes is fantastic.I wish a movie would be made."},{"rating":"2","title":"You must own this book!","review":"Calling this \\"classic\\" science fiction seems like too droll of a description. This book will not let go of you once you've read the first sentence. The characters, the plot, the suspense and the reward are fantastic. It pulls you in so completely you won't even feel like you are reading -- as if you are traveling the moving ways through Diaspar itself, watching the Jester's tricks or struggling against the bonds of the City. I've picked up City and the Stars, flipped to a page in the middle and gotten instantly drawn into Alvin's story again and again and again. This is by far my favorite science fiction book ever. Buy two copies and put one in a sealed plastic bag for the time when your first, ratty and torn copy turns to dust!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clarke at his pinnacle!","review":"It has been some years since I last read this book. I have read it several times. As I recall it is one of the most compelling and moving stories in the genre of speculative fiction in relation to humanity. If you are a SF fan and a fan of ACC himself and have not read this story, you simply must! It is, beyond doubt, his finest work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clarke at his best","review":"This ranks up with, and probably surpasses \\"Rendezvous With Rama\\" as my favorite Arthur C. Clarke book (in the forward, ACC himself claims it as his personal favorite). Set millions of years in the future, the human inhabitants of a totally self-contained city believe theirs to be the last city left on the planet. People live for thousands of years before reentering a sort of hibernation chamber where their souls are put on ice for a few million years before they reemerge to live again and again. Society on-the-whole is content. Only one young man finds he lacks the inherent fear of exploring beyond the city's enclosure, and he sets out on a journey that forever changes the planet's history. This is one of those SF books that makes you wonder how any one person could think of so many wonderful, original nuances of the future"},{"rating":"2","title":"Make sure you have correct power supply!","review":"After ordering here and receiving this item (from Dell Direct), I missed the fine print.

Now with this cushion, I can sit for hours and not have any problems with a damp seat when I get up from my chair. The only issue is when I wear shorts and they don't cover the back of my legs completely.

The \\"7.92mm German Mauser\\" identified early in the film is clearly a Russian Mosin-Nagant. The stock, the single stack 5-round magazine extending below the stock, the bolt, the iron sights are ALL unmistakable.Clearly this movie had no intention of appealing to anyone who knows anything about rifles or sniping. No military sniper would plan to engage a target at the rediculously close range of 200 meters. No sniper would trust a rifle handed to him without first verifying its zero. Even more laughable, Berenger is handed a scope for the Mosin-Nagant and presumably mounts it, but then proceeds to use it without zeroing it! And where would he shoot it to zero it while being hunted? He was better off just using the iron sights!Sniper [1] was bad, but Sniper 2 is a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A must to avoid","review":"This is not so much a review as a public health warning - this boring, unbelievable, poorly-written and -acted(??) rubbish should be avoided at, if you'll pardon the expression, gunpoint.

I either like it or I don,t. I don,t look for all the mistakes that may be on a product.If you,re a Who fan, buy this DVD put on a pair of wireless headsets and rock your ass off.P.S. Ringo Starrs ex wife did cheat on him and have a child with Keith Moon. Check out Zak Starkeys bio about him and Moonie and a case may be made for why Keith showed so much interest in Zak.

Little too much with the film taking away from the bands performance, however worth the money nonetheless to have this performance alone.Tommy--unbelievable. The music overdub is out of sync with the actual performance. Makes Pete and Roger look like they are spastic dancing off beat and Pete strumming chords where they don't exist. The drums are the worse--hitting cymbals off beat to what you are seeing and fills that don't exist or are totally off. I had to turn it off. Couldn't watch such a total botch job of a great piece of music.Reminded me of watching Dick Clark's American Bandstand in the 60s where the band would horribly lip-sync over records and guitarists would play without cables leading to their amps.Pete--did you watch this production before it hit the streets?

Maybe 95% of the concert was filmed with the cameras really close to the band members. That sucks! It's the same shots over and over again, and it looks like a cheap production kind of thing.

In addition, I came from under-developed nation and have seen atrocities that deeply hurt to recall - but this documentary re-affirmed me what one of the classic symptoms of sick society continues to be. The oppression of women reinforced via static religious rules and regulations - as written by 'men' thousands of years ago.It is heartbreaking. It is more painful to know for certain that we can fix this problem for people dealt a life of such misfortune.

In this era of cookie cutter music (one band does something, gets popular, then everyone else has to do that same thing) SOP is a breath of fresh air. Loud, aggressive, and damn proud of it is the best way to describe SOP. I've had a copy of \\"EARTHSHAKER\\" for over 3 years, and it still is in heavy rotation in my CD listening.

Actually I don't think it was edited, or for that matter, reviewed in any way for accuracy. I suggest any one interested in this type of book read specifically from Spinoza or Newton and come to their own decisions about religion and science.

On the EP, you could tell the band drew alot of inspiration from Relient K post-the anatomy of tounge and cheek, which made the songs faster, catchier and more pop-punk. This full length is actually closer to pop than pop-punk, and once again, mike herrera reminds me of why I don't like MxPx; his dull, mundane vocals on the especially bad track \\"winters\\". Basically, I blame mike and the recent popularity of [...] bands like \\"october fall\\" and \\"the click 5\\" for this upsettingly bad release. The whole record just feels so safe and commercial, like the all american rejects, but not quite as bad (to their credit).

Her husband, the minister, had virtually no redeeming qualities, he saw her as a possession and treated her like a child.

No, no, no!!! Ben's backside needed kicking, and Dean was certainly justified in kicking it.Aside from that, the book was just too predictable. There were very few surprises, and I couldn't believe how long it took Dean to catch on to things that seemed so obvious to me. Overall, I was very disappointed in the book.

Based on the first 110 pages, one of the main characters, Augusta, is so snide and rude and intolerant of anyone who believes or thinks differently than she does, that she seems more like a 13-year-old brat than an adult woman. The author clearly has issues with religion and makes every religious person in the book a caricature and portrays the people who are basing their lives on the occult as the \\"wise\\" ones. And even given that conservative-bashing and Christian-bashing is what all the \\"popular kids\\" are doing in our society, I will say that even the author's characterization of Augusta is extreme.

Not only does it not have a 2-player mode, but the game is extremely repetitive throughout the entire story(with the exception of one level).Not to mention the insanity I went through on all the cliffs.There is virtually no way of telling how far away something is, so you always waste a life falling off.Trust me, this game isnt worth the ... I paid for it.For the most part,the graphics are OKAY and it is pretty smooth too. But most of all I blame all the shopping sites thatlist under features: 1 or 2-player mode.

I read the previews, poored over the screenshots and hunted for the best buy. Finally, I plucked down my hard earned money. Guess what? I got ripped off. My mistake? This game is geared for YOUNG players only. I'm talking pre-teen. Here's why: The game manual practically reveals everything your going to encounter and the controls are loose. Game play is strictly by the numbers. Slash here, run there, nothing challenging or any chance to explore the SW universe via your GBA. As for the graphics? My 5 yr old was beside himself. (I'll admit there pretty cool.)That's right, I'm a father, that's why I said not for mature fans. There's not enough meat here for hardcore gamers to sink their teeth into and as for the SW oldtimers, unless your a collector I say wait and see if SW2 for the GBA will be better.

The most amazing element of this album is when you realize that the music budget on Phantasm was a bare minimum, and it was before synthesizers were a mainstream instrument. The music you hear on this album is the real thing. The amazing boundaries the two composers take us on, in such tracks as \\"Silver Sphere Disco\\" and :\\"Or is It? (Outtakes)\\".

I don't know if it's due to stress, age, lack of sleep or a little bit of everything. So, I started researching the best cover ups cause the cover girl concealer stick was not working at all anymore. Found this product with pretty good reviews. Decided to try it even though it was expensive only cause I had a amazon gift card. When I opened it at first I thought omigod it's tiny for $18. I really didn't think it would be that small; it's like the size of a half dollar, maybe smaller and only an inch high. Anyway I am not that pleased with the results. I wouldn't even consider my eyes that dark yet just dark enough to bother me. But I use this concealer and my old cover girl stick concealer in order to get coverage that I am ok with for now. I don't think I would purchase this product again only cause it was expensive and works just ok. It was worth it for the $3 after my coupon though. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another concealer","review":"I had high expectations for this concealer given the great reviews and high price tag.

I did find even with the color difference, it blended well. Anyways, my undereye circles have become more and more prominant and figured this would do the trick. Even after applying two layers with a brush, this was no better than store concealers. I've been sticking with Neutrogena 3 in 1 and Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Erase Dark Cirles.

If you are put off by the pretentious sounding concept of ten short films based around the ten commandments, fear not.

Nothing less, yet it connects on a personal level as well as a spiritual one. Inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic.","review":"This is a brilliant series. When I first received it, I watched one every evening with friends and found myself spending my days looking forward to the next episode.

But I do want to go on record as saying that this is an excellent series. If Polish television is this good, it far surpasses American tv. Most of the episodes are relevant to that famous decalogue, the ten commandments, but they aren't all relevant to it. However, they are all interesting, and the series is a treasure. My favorite episode is the one about the man who learns that he is never going to be able to have sex with his beloved wife again, he agrees to allow her to have a lover, and then his jealousy won't let him live with that solution. It is quite an indictment of adultery, and a very emotional episode.

Eight months later, it is still accurate and many people have complimented him when they ask about it (mostly other adults). It's a tough, handsome watch that is hard to beat in my opinion. The description does not indicate this, but the crown screws in to prevent water damage. My son loves it almost as much as I do! Maybe I should buy one for myself as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another \\"you get what you pay ...\\"","review":"The watch itself is nice looking considering the price. Nice size, details, etc. The band was replaced immediately as the original was quite cheap looking/quality but that wasn't much of a problem.The big negative however is that I've had the watch for only a month or so and it continuously has condensation/drops of water under the crystal.

She said that the seat would never be a tightly installed with a flexible undermat and therefore this product is not recommended as being safe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slides too much","review":"I like the pockets in the front, but the undermat slides too much. I bought a rubber mat instead, although it lacked the pockets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item!","review":"This is great! Saves our seats from crumbs and kids stuff is always in easy reach (instead of rolling around on the floor and under the seats!)Perfect place for all the small things our kids like to have in the car including - a baggie of crayons, sunglasses, small toys, etc.Just make sure the child seat is strapped in tightly so it won't slide around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"My husband and I had one of these in our car and loved it! Beware though... When we went to a car seat inspection, we were told that these are not actually approved for use under a car seat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I really like this undermat,but...","review":"My husband and I both purchased this for our vehicles. It is great to store extra stuff in the pockets, but it doesn't really fit securely in the car. You have to tuck it into the seat a little to get it to stay. As for keeping the car clean? It is really too small to cover any part of the car. As for protecting your seat? Get the plastic undermats instead! I have leather in my SUV and the hard plastic on the car seat still digs into the leather. I like it, but... I would rather have bought a backseat organizer to use it to hold extras like toys and snacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compromises the safety and warranty of your seat","review":"We received 2 of these and were thrilled, thinking we would save our seats from harm. When we had our seats installed by a certified car seat technician (not all police officers are certified techs), we were told not to use these mats. They can A) void your carseat's warranty and B) be very dangerous as they may cause your seat to slip, even if it seems tight. The technician would NOT install our seats with these, so we took them back. I would rather have a safe child and dented seats than an injured or dead child and perfect seats.Another reviewer mentioned the Might Tite - again, we were told do not use this product as it is not tested to work with carseats and could come loose in an accident."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recommended","review":"These sounded like a good idea at the time we purchased them. Unfortunately, the state police trooper who installed our seat instructed us not to use them. Anything placed under the car seat can compromise the safety of the seat. The car seat will slide. Please don't buy ANY undermats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined my leather seat!!!","review":"Thought I was protecting my brand new leather car seat until today when we switched to the next type of car seat- hundreds of black spots from the mat in the leather that I cannot remove. Already spent more wasted money buying leather cleaners to try and remove with no luck. Not only a waste of money for product but now will cost me who knows how much to repair the leather. Stay away from this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I thought","review":"This product surely protects my leather seats but my car seat seat slides around on the seat when its in place. i'm taking mine out of the car today. I'll try it again when my son moves out of the infant carrier and into the big car seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not approved by public safety officials!","review":"We bought a car seat protector like this (don't think it was this brand) and took it along with our infant car seat carrier to the local police station, since we've read that 70-80% of car seats are improperly installed. The officer who installed the seat would not use it, saying that after-market products like this are absolutely not recommended. The only thing that passes muster with public safety folks, apparently, is a piece of rug pad, which helps the base grip the seat in addition to providing some protection of the upholstery. Doesn't look great, but it's better than thinking you've installed your seat securely when in fact it isn't safe!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Use","review":"My husband and I had one of these in our car and loved it! Beware though... When we went to a car seat inspection, we were told that these are not actually approved for use under a car seat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Also RUINED my leather!!!!!!","review":"I purchased this product with the best of intentions, It was wonderful. I didnot have the slipage issues as did others and the mesh pockets were pretty helpful as well. BUT, while cleaning out my car today I was so very angry to find that where my infant carrier and base were there is a big black stripe across the back seat AND where I have only had the full size carseat 2 months there are dozens of black dots on the seat that now make my tan leather look mildewed.Will not clean off!! BEWARE OF THIS SEAT \\"PROTECTOR\\". I will be calling the manufacturer to complain."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay...","review":"This mat should be bigger. It hardly covers much of the seat beyond the car seat. Also, it is a bit flimsy and moves around with each person who sits in the back. A beach towel would work much better! Only good thing about it is the pockets. They are very handy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended by police officers","review":"We had our car seat checked at the local police station, and the safety officer recommended that we not use anything under our car seat. In case of an accident or a problem with the car seat, using any additional product (such as this mat or an attached fleece covering) may void the warranty of your car seat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work Well","review":"I bought two of these undermats and wish I had not. They do not \\"grip\\" our cars leather seats and cause the infant car seats to slide a bit. We had our car seats inspected and the police officers doing the inspection said not to use these liners. They advised us the us to use shelf liner. I instead purchased the Prince Lionheart undermat that has the same sort of soft tacky feel as the recommened shelf liner. It works the same and is more attractive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not use this product!","review":"This is an after market product and has NOT been crash tested. It could cause your child's seat to fail in a crash and seriously injure the child or worse. I am a tech and we remove these when people bring in a seat with one to a clinic. If it doesn't come with your seat DO NOT use it without first consulting a Certified Child Passenger Safety Technician who is trained in car seats."},{"rating":"1","title":"be careful if you have leather interior!","review":"I registered and received this mat as a shower gift. I took it with me when I got my car seat installed by a certified installer and he warned me that it was unsafe with leather seats becuase the vinyl would just make the surface very \\"slippery\\" for the car seat. He suggested that I get a mat with something other than nylon, like rubber - something that would grip to the leather."},{"rating":"1","title":"All bunched up","review":"This was a nice idea and I thought it would be great for protecting the car seat and also hold toys, bottles, etc. However, like several reviewers have already noted, it just doesn't like to stay put. We have fabric seats and this undermat is just too flimsy to stay put. It is always bunched up underneath the car seat. I try tugging it out, but to no avail. When I went to a safety inspector to test my car seat, they pulled this out and instead placed a cheap rubber shelf liner underneath! Protects the seat and is sticky enough to keep the car seat from sliding around. That's what I suggest you do instead of buying this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not use -- safety for your child comes first!","review":"Although I have nothing against this product, I too went to get my car safety inspected by the California Highway Patrol and was advised not to use any after-marketing accessories. This product has not been crash testing and I did find that the car seat had less \\"grip\\" with the seats and more \\"give\\". He advised me to use grip lining (typically used for shelves) and I purchased a color to match the interior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Use - Damaged My Seat","review":"I purchased the mat for my leather seat, and used it for about 3 months. It appeared to be working fine, but when I went to remove the mat from my car, was I in for a rude awakening.... My leather seat was completely damaged (with hundreds and hundreds of indented black spots that resulted from the bottom side of the mat. I just received a quote stating that the repairs could cost me up to $2000. I definitely recommend against this, and would give it 0 stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"I bought two of these and thank goodness BRU let me take them back. They did not grip our leather seats, and actually made the car seat slide around so I took them back, and 3 1/2 years and two more kids later haven't felt like I missed them a bit. These are unecessary and really a pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Definite No-No","review":"On the day my daughter and I were discharged from the hospital, my mom and dad took my car to have the car seat installed. They had been advised to go to the Police Station or the Fire Department to have this done. The officer who had been called to install the car seat advised them against using the carseat undermat. He stated it would cause the car seat to slide which of course would be unsafe. I was hoping to protect my seat with the carseat undermat, but my daughter's safety is my priority."},{"rating":"1","title":"slips but gets the job done","review":"got this two years ago and it remains in my car always. Only problem is that in comparison with the one I got as a gift for my baby shower, this one slides all over the seat and does not remain in position. Can't find the name of the first one I have but that one has some type of material underneath so it remains in position without requiring any adhesive or tape or attachment to the car chair"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"I had my car seat inspected as well. Although they advise against any \\"aftermarket\\" products for car seats, I'm not opposed to them entirely. I will continue to use my bunting inside. But there is no way that the fleecey (top) side of this mat could secure a car seat at all. I'm sorry I bought it. The inspector gave me a small rubber mat made out of shelf lining material from a dollar store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not needed and not approved in crashes","review":"I got the undermat as a gift and I thought it was a great idea as I have leather seats in my car and I thought the car seat base was going to damage it.I went to a place to set up my car seat correctly and they told me the undermat have not been tested on car crashes so I should not use it, so I removed it. I was still concerned about the leather but I have have the car sear placed for over 5 months and the seat is in perfect condition, so no undermat is needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at all costs!","review":"This CD is so very bad.

Mally seems so sweet and likeable, I just had to place an order. All the colors looked wonderful and wearable. I choose Tokyo Rose, a sheer neutral. It was a little more pink that I usually wear, but pink is the hot shade this season so I wanted something neutral with a pink cast. This was the perfect choice. It looks wonderful with my medium skin. The texture is great: smooth and rich with no smell or taste. I wish it had a bit more pigment, it's really sheer, but other than that, it's good. I'll be adding more shades to my wishlist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mally lipsticks","review":"I did like this color wasn't the color i was looking for a darker color.

Very soft and creamy. I'm happy with that part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fact of Fiction?","review":"After completing this book, I was left with some unsettled thoughts and questions about Mr. Abraham's life.

The film makers made a very personal journey, from birth to birth again, asking all of Life's important questions along the way. All of the interviewees, Gangaji, Tony Parsons, Genpo Roshi, Timothy Freke, Tony Packer, Jeff Foster, Guy Smith and Amit Goswami added a colourful, diverse and interesting dimension to the meaning of Life, looking at why we are here and what it is all about, including the delicate topic of suffering and death. The film is beautifully shot and has lots of wonderful images. There is so much to take in, so much to hear and learn that it is impossible to see the film just once and be done with it. This is a 'MUST' viewing and we will watch it again and again.We love 'Who's driving the Dreambus?' and have recommended it to all of our friends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will save you tons of money!","review":"Lots of great advice, broken down into different areas of how consumers can not only protect themselves but take advantage of hidden secrets only the savvy have.

Michael, with his wonderful simplistic and easy to understand style, teaches us how to heighten our level of awareness and be a smarter consumer.Consumer Confidential is a book that can be read from front to back page by page, or you can pick it up and read it section by section in no particular order. I now keep Consumer Confidential as a handy reference guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful offbeat tour of America","review":"Loren Coleman has written a delightful tour of the unusual in America.

Within minutes we were both mesmerized and 84 minutes later had experienced a truly wonderful film.I'd read about Mary Pickford, but never seen her and really only bought this out of interest because I was reading Samuel Goldwyn's biography at the time.The end result? An good, solid introduction to silent drama and Ms. Pickford and a good quality DVD to boot.

The next level up is \\"Master Grade\\" MG. A teenager should be able to put it together in about 1 to 2 weeks. The highest level of model from Bandi is called \\"Prefect Grade\\".

Why is the utterly false history of him as the one who massacred the Innocents at Bethlehem - proven to be utterly fictional, and admitted so by every fair historian - still routinely perpetuated by christians and jews? It's not even that he was an Edomite arab as Robert Graves and others have said.He was the Roman tetrarch Caesar Philip, of Paneas fame, admitted to even in the New Testament and Josephus.

I take this to mean that Prime is removing everything harmful from my tapwater. With other water conditioners, I (or my fish) have not been so lucky. Some of the fish have shown stress following a water change, I believe due to a high copper concentration. Also, you only need to use a little bit, so the bottle is very economical. The directions call for 1 capful for every 50 gallons. To make this easier to measure, and to convert it to use for smaller amounts of water, just take note that Seachem says that each capful is 5 mL. Thus, you would use 1 mL for each 10 gallons, or .1 mL for each gallon. I use a syringe (no needle - easy to get from your vet, or order from vet supply), to measure by .1 mL. Very easy!

In many cases, he utterly avoids the crux of the whole abortion issue: is a fetus worth the same as a person? This is why I call is arguments circular and childish. Highly unenlightened.I would not recommend this book for two reasons: 1. the arguments are essentially the same as those you can find from any anti-abortion website, and 2. the book itself is available online.

This book is written by a guy who's obviously been burned by shallow women, and he has generalized HIS problem into OUR problem.

Therefore women on the go have the option to approach men whom they find appealing and interesting to them. We live in a society of domineering women and passive men. The majority of people in today's workforce are women. There are women who want to be the breadwinners.

There are a few good songs on here towards the end, but for the most part, eew. My least favorite is \\"Creepin' Up On You\\", about the narrator stalking a girl, \\"drinking the glass she left on the bar\\" and \\"following her around in her car\\". Fact or fiction, the song \\"creeps\\" me out, plain English. However, if you can look past the lyrics and just listen to Hayes' beautiful voice, you will enjoy the album thoroughly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Hayes at his best!!!!!","review":"This is the best!!!!! I am a huge Savage Garden fan and although I am disappointed they broke up and went their separate ways, Darren Hayes is phenomenal!! This album captures the true voice of Hayes and its truly a must have. His title track \\" Insatiable is so romantic, sexy and soothing. Every song on this album has Hayes's own special qualities. From soft and soothing tunes like \\"Insatiable,\\" to the up beat track \\"Crush (1980 Me)\\" every style is evident on this album. I think Darren Hayes is better off now on his own and this album proves that. If you liked the last two albums by Savage Garden you'll love \\"Spin\\". A must have in your cd collection!!! Truly Hayes's finest work to date!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice first step","review":"I enjoyed the cd, it is a tad bit different from what he did with Savage Garden. But still enjoyable listen for the most part. There were only 4 songs that i wasn't really feeling throughout the CD. But everything was solid. He has always been a great songwriter and you see that on different songs like Strange Relationship, Insatiable, I Miss You and Dirty. Which is kind of weird, he's like a stalker after someone that he really likes and breaks it down in detail. Its totally different. Also enjoyed Crush (1980 Me) , Good Enough and Like It Or Not.I know this was his first solo effort and even i'm an Savage Garden fan. This is a step in the right direction for Darren Hayes and i'm sure a sign of better things to come for him. Purchasing i would check out some songs to it first and see whether this one appeals to you or not. If not you should check his 2nd one \\"Tension & The Spark\\" a standout cd that hits on the all right notes..nuff said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steamy and Dreamy...","review":"I absolutely loved Darren's album. Insatiable is one of the sexiest songs I have ever heard. \\"We practiced love between these sheets\\"made me wish he was with me in my bed with me and my girlfriend.

Darren also hit some notes I didn't know a man could hit without taking a maximum blow to the junk... very impressed.Charlie M."},{"rating":"2","title":"No comparing!","review":"hey ppl, I thought this Album was great! What ever you do do not compare this with Savage Garden! because it is very different! Try to think of Darren as a new singer because for the ppl who listened to SG's music it's totally different. I can't stress on that anymore. You may recognize the voice and lyrics, but as i said before, the music is very different, this album is a bit r&b; and pop. I'm sorry to say this, but the music is a bit more slow. When they were SG the music if you noticed was very 'upbeat' and exciting to lift you up if you were in a bad mood. But overall, the songs are really great and the lyrics are really meaningful. I loved it. You really have to listen to this album 3 or 4 times to really appricate it!If you want to know more then you may want to visit Darren's offical website ...--Check it out!

First you think the whole band is disappearing and you'll never again hear the saucy insatiably delightful voice behind Savage Garden, and here he comes all by himself with an album that leaves a person wanting more and more and more! This man is unstoppable and untouchable and it just gets even better from here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing!","review":"\\"Spin,\\" The debut CD of former Savage Garden frontman, Darren Hayes, is one of the greatest debut solo albums you can lay your ears on. With a fantastic mix of poppy dance grooves and smooth ballads, this album is sure to please fans of the pop/r&b; sound.It was indeed a smart move to hire the brilliantly melodic master-producer Walter Afanasieff as the musical collaborator on this. Afanasieff's tunes and Hayes' voice blend wonderfully and the result is a near perfect album. While top honors go to the wonderful tracks: \\"Strange Relationship,\\" \\"I Miss You,\\" \\"Creepin' Up On You,\\" \\"Can't Ever Get Enough Of You,\\" and \\"Like It Or Not,\\" there's something to like in every single tune.

Darren is a incredible vocalist with a awesome range. I still dont understand why he hasnt had more commercial success as a solo artist. Spin is his first forey into the solo world after Savage Garden. I have all of his solo CD's and they are all great; Very different from one another but all great. Spin is definitely more on the commercial side but still has some great songs nonetheless. My favorite from this CD are \\"I miss you\\" \\"Like it or not\\" and \\"I cant ever get enough of you\\" Buy it and you wont be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A strong start for Darren's solo career!","review":"Having been a fan of Savage Garden's music for 5 years when this album came out 2 years ago, I was ecstatic to learn that Darren was coming out with this album. I won't say I was disappointed, but there is something lacking from his previous works. The lyrics are just as strong as the two previous Savage Garden records, however I think it is noticable that Daniel's musical influence is gone. \\"Insatiable\\" (the first, and subsequently, only single from 'Spin') is a really pretty song, though very sensual. \\"Like It or Not\\" is my personal favorite, with it's more ballad like music and moving lyrics. \\"Crush (1980 ME)\\", \\"What You Like\\", and \\"I Can't Ever Get Enough of You\\" are also very good. \\"Spin\\" definitely has more of a techno feel to it, though not as much as Darren's sophomore album \\"The Tension and the Spark.\\" Overall it's still a wonderful album definitely worth owning, just not the best out of the four I've heard!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not recognized enough","review":"This is a great pop album, but it doesn't seem as manufactured and fake as other pop. This is a good thing, and it is also partly why I loved this album. He has a beautiful voice and thank god they let it shine through the album. Insatiable, Creepin up on you, Good Enpugh, Strange Relationship, Heart Attack, are among the best songs on this disc. Insatiable is most definetely my favourite though. It is romantic, and spicy, and different from what you normally hear.It is somewhat of a departure from his Savage Garden days, but he could make more of an effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific CD","review":"Darren Hayes formerly of Savage Garden is starting a solo adventure.

Darren can't have the chemistry just by himself without Daniel. After all,I mean the whole is more than its sum in Savage Garden."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate","review":"I was hoping that Darren Hayes debut solo album would have some artistic merit, but unfortunately I was wrong. The entire album was charted out like any other bubble gum artist. Don't get me wrong Savage Garden were pop but they also wrote and played the instruments (or the better half did anyway), and its obvious to anyone that listens that Daniel Jones was the talent and Darren was merely a interpretive singer. That being said there are a couple enjoyable songs \\"Good Enough\\" being the only one that strives for a definitive sound that isn't already to cliched.Darren shame on you for selling out and doing anything the execs wanted in order to sell albums, where is your pride in this contrived mess of bubblegum? I'm hoping maybe it will grow on me....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get a taste of the tour!","review":"True Darren Hayes fans will love this! In addition to Spin, the first solo project from the ex-Savage Garden crooner, listeners will get a taste of being in concert as they experience the disc of live performances included in this package. The spectacle of Savage Garden shows has gone, and is now replaced with the exquisite vocals of a great entertainer.

Granted Darren Hayes still sings like he did in Savage Garden, but ends up coming across more like an early Michael Jackson or Prince. Rather than the distinct, catchy, \\"Euro Pop\\" sound that was going on before. If I'd wanted \\"Michael Jackson\\", I would have bought Michael Jackson!The tecno sound to the ablum is good, and earns two stars, but the lyrics and singing surely bring it down!In the end I have to say I gave this album every chance, but was uninspired by the mediocre performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad sad day for savage","review":"If I were Daniel I would be sorely embarrassed. The first time I listened to this CD I hated it. The second time I strongly disliked it - only \\"Insatiable\\" started to grow on me, but even that is not a quality song. There is essentially no music on this CD - just computer generated crap accompanying adequate lyrics but awful melodies and beats. Darren is nothing without Daniel, and this solo attempt proves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good start","review":"For serious Russian scholars - which I am not - this book will probably disappoint, since it's focus isn't on new discoveries, new papers, or an aspect of her life previously unwritten about.

The author takes a great deal of time debunking the sexual myths surrounding Catherine, which is sadly what most people remember.Overall, a solid read."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book reads like a drawn out soap-opera.","review":"I had the opportunity to read this book while I was studyingin Russia. Instead of it being awe inspiring, I found Ms.Erickson's comments on how Catherine the Great, like how shesuffered during her wedding cermony because of her constrictivedress, to be boring and unecessary. Ms. Erickson addedextranneous information that kept making me say, \\"get onwith the plot.\\" She then teased with sumptous banter aboutCatherine's sex life only to end up using vague referencesinstead of meaty tidbits. I would have like to have gottenmy hands on a copy before it went to press so I could haveasked, \\"do you really think this part is necessary?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not an inspired or engrossing biography!","review":"I was so excited when I first got this book. I was anxious to learn about Catherine the Great and the multicolored details of her eccentric life. I was unbelievably disappointed in the one-dimensional quality of the text. The author turns Catherine the Great into Catherine the Simpleton! There can be no historical basis for much of the commentary that Ms. Erickson makes. This is not a biography of an interesting woman but a medium for the author to preach from her left-wing lecturn. In my opinion, this biography rates as one of the sleaziest, most unimaginative, and biased books ever written on the life of a historical personality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live album captures the energy of the band","review":"I'm not a big fan of live albums, but I am aware of Front 242's ability to do powerful live shows so I gave this CD a chance.As live CD's go, the sound quality is excellent. It features all their most known songs, 'Headhunter' is excellent as usual! Many songs are given dramatic makeovers.What is most evident is the more dance-orientated feel of their live shows than of their stuido albums. They know how to work a crowd and throughout this show Jean Luc De Meyer and, in particular Richard JK, are constantly encouraging the crowd and talking to them. It's nice to see such a strong band-crowd interaction.Even if you don't usually like live albums, I'd give this one a go. But don't be expecting a sing-along type show. With their emphasis on dance in their live shows, this one is for the danceloor rather than for the mind!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works very well.","review":"Out of the box and mated to the Logitech i-touch keyboard, this mouse set up in 3 minutes.

Morning Glory is no great literary achievment-but its characters are deep, and no cookie cutter representations of other romance novel characters. The characters had real flaws (that real people have) low paying jobs, and real problems-like war. They fall in love over a number of years, not days.

Will and Elly are classic characters finding love and redemption from hard-knock lives. The only quibble I have is that the book gets a little buried in sincerity and goodness. A little more humor on Will or Elly's part would have gone a long way to liven up sections. I know Spencer was going for deep, homespun love, but at times it just feels lethargic.Still love it though and love what little humor there is in the book.Very much recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, no, no!","review":"I got this book, along with Years, after both of them were highly recommended by a friend.

Cardboard characters, dialogue that put me in mind of listening to toddlers try to converse, a story that was so predictable that I already had the plot figured out by the 10th page, and so on. I kept on plugging through in the hopes that it would get better--I loved some of the secondary characters, but the dreadful main story just kept dragging on and on and on and on.

Will and Elly are perfect on every level. This is what true everlasting love is all about. LaVyle Spencer brings these two characters alive and shows us what real happiness is about.

Someone once said \\"life is all about timing\\".What this show does well is to go behind scenes into the life of unbalanced players and their collective sense of entitlement.The show is not overly thought provoking, nor is it an adrenaline rush. What this show is-is light hearted summer fare, which happens to be broadcast during the network \\"dead zone\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best show on TV right now!","review":"The series is about a psychiatrist that is in the middle of a messy divorce, and while her practice is doing okay...

She deals with adult tempertantrums, irritable coaches, a semi-creepy go-to guy that seems to have come out of a mobster movie, and a cute physical trainer who got her into this mess.Truthfully, this mess is the best thing that could have happened to her, her kids, and even her mom, on occasion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have the Original Vinyl!","review":"Purchased the original at the release date, can't remember when, but just heard track from it on the radio, and remembered, this is one of my favorite albums of all time.I don't play vinyl anymore, sadly, can't afford, and don't have room and facilities for turntable.

The Teutonic subdued in a harsh war the pagan Baltic Prussians in the 13th century, but unlike what Anglo-Americans did to the Indians, did not exterminate most. Those who converted to Christianity were treated like the German settlers the Teutonic Knights brought in. The Prussian language died out in the late 17th century, after their intermarriage with the Germans. Hundreds of thousands of East Prussians descended from the old Baltic Prussians, as can be seen from their surnames. I am, a.e., a descendant of that merger, as well.The data in the book is very useful. The conclusions drawn from the data much less so, they are colorable, according to whether you hate Germans for being Germans, or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"They work just fine and preform as advertised.","review":"They work just fine and preform as advertised.

And NO, I don't own some dirt cheap music box.Nonetheless, I suppose this cd is a must have for all those die-hard DOA fans. Heck, I've added it to my collection.

Agreed, \\"Isn't it a pity\\" sounded better in the original version, but the remix of \\"You spin me round\\" is better than the one on \\"Fragile\\".

I would rather spend 50 dollars and gets 16 MB's of Sony than the Interact. Wait until Sony releases a bigger card. If you think about it, 8 MBs is a lot, when most of the games usually don't require more than 300 kb.

But I read the directions many times and the memory card still wiped out previously saved games. After playing Grand Theft Auto 3 for four hours the memory card was no longer recognized by the system. In the four hours that I was playing it worked fine.

It wiped out 3 of my video games so now I can't even play them, when you contact their customer service they will not respond to your letters or calls.

So out of desperation I bought this 16MB card since Sony apparently can't keep retailers stocked with the 8MB cards. The packaging is misleading and the card itself is hard to use and often I have to load it 3 or 4 times before it finally \\"takes.\\" Once it's loaded it works great but everytime you have to turn off the console or reset the game you have to go through the process all over again. Furthermore, the instructions included with the 16MB memory are practically useless. I ended up having to go to [another website] and download real instructions. Such a hassle. I'm dying for the time when 8MB memory cards become available again so I can get rid of this piece of trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"return to sender","review":"I just want to say that after reading most of the reviews of this memory card, I have decided to return this piece of junk.

I've tried loading the dic and whatever else it sais and mine does not work so you can see my opinion. Atleast 5 of my friends also purcased this memory card and all cannot get theres to work either. The only reason i may suggest you prhase this is because it comes with a disc that has loads of options:1.) Zip(crush)files on a regular 8MB or any other memory card2.) Unzip(Un-Crush) files3.) Transfer data t another memor card4.) Copy the dataI find #4 very handy incase one of your friends wants your gae saved. Maybe if they cant get past one thing or something.

In plain language this thing is the worst piece of [junk] I ever wasted my money on. The only reason I bought it is the shiny glowing 16mb size, and when I suspected it's too good to be true for the price, turned out to be completely true.

My reason for giving it such a low rating is not because of the annoying feature of having to insert the \\"Mega Memory Manager\\" disc every single time you turn the console on/off or reset it but is because it is totally incompatible with certain games. I know at least one game (Final Fantasy X) that does _not_ support this card, although the console itself does recognize it. In summary, if you want to be assured that your card works with _every_ PS 2 game, I would recommend getting the Sony one. If, however, you like to be surprised when it comes to finding out whether your card will work on a certain game, be my guest and buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has not been tested by Sony","review":"Do not buy this item.

This memory card is a piece of junk, if you think that you can just put it in the memory card slot and save the game you are very wrong. In order to be able to save the game you need to load the memory card in with a special disk which takes around five minutes. If you are looking to buy a good memory card, you should think of buying one that is made by playstation 2 or buy one that has the playstation logo of approval on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The thing is a pain","review":"First, I hate having to load the software any time you run a game.Second, when you get up to 99 or so save, it takes an eternity for the software or a game to read the card.Third, I can't prove this for a fact, but it's my opinion as a programmer that the memory management software uses enough of the Playstations memory that it slows the game down. I had Grandia II slow down considerably and even lock-up. Please, if anyone else does or doesn't have this problem post it here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked for a few weeks","review":"Based on price and size of memory (16M) this seemed like a good deal, so I bought it. I didn't realize at the time ofcourse that I would have to go through a special 'boot up' disk each time I turned on the PS2 before I could just go straight to the game. In hind sight, I wish I had just bought the official Sony version so that I could skip this rather annoying step. Let's be honest: it's only a few more dollars and well worth every penny. After a few weeks of owning it (and succesfully backing up data from about 6 different games), it has now completely stopped working. My PS2 has ceased recognizing it during bootup whatsoever. I have since bought the Sony memory card instead (requires no boot-up process) and I'm infintely more happy with it. I'm only upset that all of the hours of game play that are stuck on the InterAct memory card are essentially lost. My synopsis: skip this product, and just spend a few more dollars for the official Sony memory."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it sounds too good to be true, it is","review":"Don't waste your time and money. Seems like a good deal; double the memory for only ... more than the price of a Sony memory card.

This one is pleasant but regrettably unremarkable. The same comment applies to all other offerings on this CD.

From their impossible to find European released thrashpunk husker-du type record \\"Communion\\", Funeral Oration are more than a punk band should be. The singer is extremely friendly and they are the one band that you can say did it for no other reason then the music.\\"Lies for survival\\" is a track from one of their old European EPs, and shred with its tempo changes.

I have read other books on Buddhism but often times something is lost in translation. Not so with this. Kubose's understanding of Buddhism is excellent and he has the power to communicate it well with brevity and charm.Each article is only about 2 pages long but after reading just one article you can sit and ponder it for about a half hour.

And as for the versions of BMtL, the Bliss mix is by far the better of the two...but that's my opinion because I don't like 12 Stones.Honestly though, if you enjoy the Fallen cd alot...and have downloaded many of Evanescence's earlier tracks (from \\"Origin\\" or the '99 release \\"EP\\") as I have, you are sure to like this cd. Yes it is only four songs...but tracks 2 through 4 are worth it...especially if you love this band.

From the third season we have \\"Dead Man's Shoes\\", gangster's shoes actually, with a terrible curse. Both of these shows were written by Charles Beaumont. After that we get two episodes from the fifth and final season, \\"You Drive\\", a highly probable inspiration for Stephen King's Christine or \\"The Car\\", and \\"The Long Morrow\\" -the only story here written by creator Rod Serling- with a space sci-fi plot... The extra features in the DVD are cool"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pin to See the Peepshow","review":"The novel may soften the representation of the murder in the Thompson-Bywaters case it was based on but otherwise closely tracks Young's Notable British Trials account. Young too thought Mrs. Thompson innocent. What the novel most brilliantly does is show how its protagonist is executed not for murder but adultery and not so much even for adultery as for being a middle class adulteress, upper class adultery being quietly fashionable, and lower class unnoticed. Tennyson shows her character as a human sacrifice to the hypocrisies of the class system."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favourite novels","review":"This book is based on a celebrated scandal in England -- the Thompson-Bywaters murder. It is one of my favourite novels. Jesse creates early on a mood of brooding sexual danger without any overt sexual references at all. How this leads Julia to destroy her life makes a gripping and sad book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best NBA Street games yet!","review":"This game is awesome.

If there is another NBA Street game EA will be working a long time to make it better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robert Forward has done better","review":"I could not finish this book. Dr.Forward has produced some excellent speculative fiction including Rocheworld and Neutron Star. This book did not measure up to those standards. I found the character's to be unbelieveable and the attempts to inject sex into the book to be extremely distracting. Two different characters daydream about feeling someone elses fingernails down their back in the first 25 pages. I know Dr.Forward can do better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good book by Forward","review":"Can life exist in a gas giant's atmosphere? Intelligent life isa hard thing to find anywhere in the universe and this book gives us a whale of a story about a sea so far away. A mission of modern science has been to find other intelligent life and communicate with it. Very few unique kinds of intelligent life have been invented by hard science fiction writers. Robert Forward is one of the best at it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic story, if you can take all the science","review":"Okay, I got to admit, when I first started reading \\"Saturn Rukh\\" I didn't enjoy it at all. I thought there was too much technical details and too much scientific talk (which I'm not very interested in myself). But I kept reading and when I was finished I realised this is really a fantastic story. The aliens are impossible to describe. If you enjoy/can take all the science and technical mumbo-jumbo, then pick it up. I can't do nothing but recommend it. Even if you can't take all the scientific terms and technical jibberish, try reading it. It's a really well-written story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert Forward always rights good hard science fiction, but.","review":"I always enjoy the books of Mr. Forward, both the fiction and the science articles. I recommend this book to people who like hard science fiction.However, looking on page 214,we read his character's description of hiragana \\"...A single Japanese hiragana character can be either a word or a long phrase...\\" There is more, and this is simply wrong. Each hiragana is a simple character, and a student could easily learn the entire hiragana set in one day. Each hiragana character represents a simple sound and nothing else. Examples are ka, ki, ku, ke, ko. Mr. Forward is confusing hiragana with kanji! Other than that, a good job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best Forward's book","review":"Robert L. Forward's writing had always been mediocre at best. However, most of his books compensate for this by sheer wonder of the described worlds (like the surface of a neutron star in \\"Dragon Egg\\").This book - not so much. The setting is pretty dull compared to his other books and expository dialogs are sometimes downright painful to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book gets big belly laughs from my 4 year old","review":"This book contains 3 short stories, each starring Princess and her best friend and savior, Froggie. Key phrases are repeated in each story, so my preschooler delights in joining in the story telling. We must have checked this book out from the library at least 10 times in the last year; it's her standby favorite! I like it, too, because it's not very long -- perfect for bedtime."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant visual artist/genius educator","review":"Wendy Ewald's American Alphabets illustrates a collaborative work between children and visual artist; the book is a wonderful adventure into fine art photography and education; the result is a photography project (series) that puts both artist/educator and children/students way ahead of the learning curve;"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not much!","review":"I am very disappointed in this biography. I will admit, at this point, I'm only half way through but wondering if I even want to bother finishing it. To me it's just a glorified timeline. The bones are there but no meat. Miss Francis may have left detailed diaries but the details don't seem to have made their way into this book. What I have read so far makes me think two things . . . either the author is lacking talent or Kay Francis was pretty boring. Maybe it's one or the other or maybe it's both. This book gives no clues to the answer to that question. I can tell you one thing, I won't waste money on any more books by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very good book on a Hollywood Icon.","review":"Loved it.. It starts out a little slow with way too much time devoted to the carreers of Kays parents..But it sure picks up after that."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing to tell","review":"This biography of Kay Francis is short. And spare. The problem seems to be there is nowhere to find anything out about her life, just her diary, a few letters, and the biographies of her friends and employers. Seems all she did was work and hop in the sack with just about anyone. I was hoping for a lot more, but there is a dearth of material on her, it seems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Moving...","review":"Nice vocals. Pretty arangements.

As usual, Tyler has put out yet another book of monotonous sex stories that all sound exactly the same. Nowhere near as good as the anthology series which this so blatantly copies."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"who told you that you could sing?\\"","review":"This Cd gets a review of 2 simply because of the time it must have taken to record it in some low end studio somwhere. It has very few moments of clarity but overall the vocalist breaks into an unnatural vocal tone lamenting about trite life experiences. It sounds as if she is reading from a 12 year-old's diary. There is a mother load of contrived vocal style throughout the whole vocal performance and an overall lack of real talent.The music is dull and unspired. The production is a 2 out of 10. The arrangements are basic.suggestions: dump the singer, get a drummer, and write some normal songs that people may enjoy listening to more than half way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"My new favorite!","review":"I was lucky enough to hear Jodie and her talented crew in concert. I went from shocked amazement, when that beautiful and powerful voice first came from this petite woman, to being moved to tears as I listened to the raw emotion of her words and music. I couldn't wait to get my hands on this cd and am anxiously awaiting the new cd due out in October. We hope to see them live again soon but until then I will be listening happily . If you want to listen first, you can check out Jodie's music on her website: jodiemanross.com. But I promise you, if you buy this cd, you will not be dissapointed.

This gets used almost daily, and my only complaint is: IT'S TOO SMALL !! Realistically, there are different brands of pint jars, and quart jars, and they each hold different numbers in this canner. I would love to sit down in a canning session, and not have leftover product that has to wait for the next batch ~ 3 hours later. Spend the extra money, and get the taller one, where at least you can stack the jars on top of each other. This is just too shallow. But, it's a fantastic pressure canner, and would recommend this hands down. AAA+"},{"rating":"2","title":"pressure cooker","review":"i can greens, tomatoes, potatatoes, purple hull peas, lady cream peas, okra, beef stew. you take a cooks bone in ham and it is fantastic. i really like not having a seal, instead you seal it with olive oil. does a wonderful job on ham hocks, roast beef, chicken. it is my pride and joy. it even can hold quart jars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Home Canner","review":"I am very happy with my purchase of the 15 1/2 Quart All-American Canner...

I will be sending this one back, unopened."},{"rating":"2","title":"All American pressure cooker/canner","review":"The price may make you swallow hard but don't waste your money on anything else.

NEVER had a problem and never had a jar not seal. It is near winter here and I am enjoying the fruits of my labor, please excuse the pun, from this past spring and summer. This is the type of product America use to make and it will be passed on to the children and grand children because it is meant to last.

Now a whole new world has opened up because I am making kettles of soup and safely preserving them. Love this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Like It","review":"This thing is heavy and it is hard to wash. The lid is quite fussy, despite being well-lubricated with Vaseline. After several uses, the lid forms a vacuum each time and is very difficult to remove. It is also not as convenient to clamp down the lid compared to the modern lids that turn into place and use a gasket.I gave this item two stars because it did perform as it should, but the issues with the lid make this thing very inconvient for me to use. It is also quicker to use my Presto canner rather than lubricating the seal on this one.I will not be keeping this canner and I will use my Presto 16-quart instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I had eagerly anticipated this disc, but was greatly disappointed in the quality of the sound and the animation. Each of the segments was animated in a different style, and some of them worked OK but some did not work well at all. The Rigoletto, for example, was entertaining and imaginative, but the Magic Flute was disorganized and the story line was almost missing. The Carmen was probably the best of the bunch and the Turandot was probably overall the worst--bad, in fact.The sound was disappointing because the balance was off-the orchestra sometimes overpowered the singers. The singers were generally quite good. The singers were sometimes hard to understand, and the disc would have been better with subtitles, even though all the singing was in English. I love good animation and opera but this just wasn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Operavox.","review":"Operavox is a series of six animated operas- Verdi's \\"Rigoletto\\", Bizet's \\"Carmen\\", Rossini's \\"The Barber of Seville\\", Wagner's \\"Rhinegold\\", Mozart's \\"The Magic Flute\\" and Puccini's \\"Turandot\\". Each of the operas has been adapted into half-hour animations- each one in a different style and translated into English, to make the story easier to follow.Even as a teenager with a keen interest in music, I find that Operas are too long and too involved to take much interest in; however, Operavox was fantastic. It wasn't too long, it contained all the main points in the story, and it was interesting to the eye.I would describe Operavox as \\"Opera for beginners\\". It's perfect for anybody studying Opera in music, anybody who cannot sit through hours of Music, or even just for the mildly curious. The only thing that comes a disappointment is that there were only six of them made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Alexie","review":"Love this collection by Alexie.

Gone are the interesting, drifty sounds and alternative/indie sound of \\"Northern Star\\". The songs here are sadly uninspired, and very bland. One can tell she Tried to make it good, but it does nothing for me. The lyrics aren't especially meaningful either. It makes me quite sad to see such an artistic slump in the career of this very capable artist, and I hope that in the future, she chooses to write more interesting music. Until then, I'm greatly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Im her Biggest Fan!!! And anything she makes is great!!","review":"Melanie C is the one of the most talented artist in the world.

Im her biggest fan and I wish to see her in Canada more often!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different","review":"Melanie C is without a doubt the best singer I know of. But I was a little disappointed with \\"Reason\\". I was so used to \\"Northern Star\\" that I was very much confused when I heard several of the songs from this follow-up album.

It's very likely the best song on the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"MELANIE C REASON","review":"I am a big Spice Girl fan but, this album is awesome to people that don't even like them.

Her debut album \\"Northern Star\\" blew most critics away. Suddenly she was to be taken seriously.But rather than rest on her laurels, Mel C has bounced back with a seriously good album, set to impress yet again.You won't find bubblegum pop and numbing repition either.What you WILL find is a series of great tunes, carried by a soulful and unique voice.\\"Here It Comes Again\\" is a brilliant song, full of power and energy and it sets up the album well. Other notable numbers are \\"Positivly Somewhere\\", \\"Do I\\" \\"Let's Love\\" and \\"Yeh, yeh, yeh\\". Most of the other tracks are pretty decent as well.It is refreshing to see an ex-spice get some credibilty in a heavily cynical industry. Hopefully, the only way for Mel C is up up up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"You would never know that MelC was known as \\"talented Spice\\" after listening to this yawner. Mel sings \\"from the book\\" instead of from the heart. Whereas the other Spicers can't hit the high notes as well, you can at least warm up to their imperfections. NORTHERN STAR (Mel's first album) was great. Her voice was produced well enough and the \\"screechiness\\" was toned down. But REASON sounds like a demo version of the real thing. A stripped down, technical, rocklite bore. Get Northern Star instead. Better yet get EMMA's new one FREE ME or Victoria's new single LET YOUR HEAD GO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat Emptor!

The music is topnotch, worthy of FIVE STARS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"Melanie C is my favorite singer, but \\"Reason\\" just didn't make the cut with me. I had the expectations that this cd would follow some of the steps Northern Star had taken. Northern Star incorporated just about every genre while \\"Reason\\" is basically pop ballads. I think Reason fails to make any songs that stand out except \\"Yeh Yeh Yeh\\" while the others are mediocre. One major gripe is that the copy protection does not let you listen to the cd on pc and my cdrom is my primary cd player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here comes Melanie C. again...rockin' on strong!!!","review":"REASON - Melanie C's sophomore album. Is one of those albums that really stuck with me in 2003! After her first attempt to fly solo with Northern Star in 1999, she out-does herself with REASON. I've always considered her as a talented vocalist, even when she was still with the Spice Girls; let's face it, she has the pipes (Emma Bunton comes in second) and with this album, I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is not a fan of hers; if you're into deep lyrics and a different sound, this is the album to listen to! Very inspirational, a happy optimistic record! It's a shame that this album is not marketed right in the US because they don't know what they're missing. Each song tells her personal stories and her life experiences!

Never really took even time to think about Teri Hatcher before one way or the other, but the cover caught my eye in teh book store.I really, really enjoyed this book. As others have said not super deep, in a super deep way, but actually is in it's simplicity and honesty. I laughed a lot and cried a little even surprised at how honest she really was with her daughter in moments - - in a very good way!- - don't want to ruin the book.Highly recommend reading. It inspired you to live you're day honestly and with hope, and, for those gosh darn bleak days, to not beat yourself up, but know you'll get through it and just look for the lessons.You feel like you're talking to one of your very best girlfriends.Thanks for writing it Teri!!enjoy~"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but disposable","review":"This was a feather light book, but a fun and quick read. Teri's observations aren't especially original, but they don't feel fake or ghost written like some other celeb tomes these days. This is about as fun and as memorable as an episode of Desperate Housewives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't pay full price for this","review":"Thankfully I got this book as part of a swap, and didn't pay anything more than postage for it. Cos it was a waste of Teri's time writing it, and a waste of my time reading it. I read to about page 50, and ended up even more depressed than I already was, so gave up.This isn't a stereotypical biography. This is Teri Hatcher wallowing in self pity. Big time. It's nothing but saying how it's \\"tough\\" being a single mother, not getting many jobs until Desperate Housewives came along, how she didn't have any nookie with her husband on her honeymoon, how her husband doesn't love her, how's she divorced and over 40. Whoopee.Don't buy this book. There's no juicy gossip about Lois & Clark (like, my favourite show ever!!!), and she's full of it. Blah, what a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is only good for firewood","review":"I must admit that I have never been a fan of Teri Hatcher so perhaps my review will come across as biased. I think there is a lot wrong with Teri Hatcher and I have always felt that when I see her on tv or give interviews. I think she is very superficial and looks terrible these days. The reason she doesnt attract men is she is too into her own looks and not into being a real person. She has no confidence, no belief in anything real except whining about being 40 years old (which is not old in my book). I think she is a terrible role model and I wouldnt date her even if I was a hollywood star or someone paid me a lot of money. She is a very insecure person and only seems to have \\"Desperate Wives\\" to claim her fame when really its nothing but a cheesy soap opera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste Of Time! Another WOE IS ME Celebrity book","review":"This Book was a Complete Waste of Time! Teri hatcher Comes off like a head case in this book. most of the book she talks about her Insecurities, her years as a \\"Has Been\\", she whines about how she cannot get a man, Honey LOOK IN THE MIRROR! She cant get a man because she is a head case, this woman has so many issues and is way too High Maitenance! I thought the worst part of the book is when she spends a whole chapter on Losing The Emmy Award! This woman goes on and on about Losing the emmy and The worst part is that she REFUSES to actually name the winner in the book(which was her Costar the much better actress FELICITY HUFFMAN)! Teri states in the book that she \\"congratulated the winner\\" but you can tell that she was sore at losing the Emmy because she Actually did not name Felicity! I have two words for you Teri GROW UP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to read even an excerpt","review":"I clicked on a link to this book from my homepage. The link included an excerpt of this book and it was so painful to read, I could hardly get through it and it was only a couple of pages long. I can't even imagine reading the entire book. The example that was given in the excerpt did a very poor job of making her point. I had no idea where she was going with her example. And her analogy of burnt toast is simplistic, silly and laborious to read. Just when I thought it was over, she would go on about it for another couple of paragraphs. The message is old, boring and I've heard it over and over and over and over and over again. The writing is poor and sleep inducing. A great read, and perhaps a somewhat related topic is To Hell With That by Caitlin Flanagan. Excellent writing. Though she isn't a TV star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Puhlease","review":"I'm not sure what I was thinking by reading this book - temporary insanity perhaps?? - but I was willing to give Ms. Hatcher the benefit of the doubt. Thankfully, I borrowed it and didn't pay for it because this book further confirms for me that there's nothing more pathetic than a celebrity blathering on and on about their woes and their advice on life... like they're the only ones who: 1. have ever experienced a hard life and 2. are authorities on the philosophies in having a good life (easier said than done when you're making $100,000+ per week but I digress). I might have given this book another star or two if it was the least bit interesting but ... zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Ms. Hatcher should stick with what she knows best ... bad acting in bad TV shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing and irritable","review":"I read a reveiw that said this book is a \\"stream of consiousness.\\" Because of these ramblings it was hard to read and not very interesting. It is also a pity party that is boring and not one I want to be a part of in any way. I also read a review that said she needs to grow up. I agree!!!! Terri you are not in Junior HIgh anymore. It is time to act like a woman and not a teenager. I think you would get more dates that way. No man wants to put up with a whiner. I love your acting but I think you should leave writing to the professionals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for younger readers","review":"I'm in my early twenties and did not find anything in this book to be relevant to my life. I feel that it is intended for a more mature audience who may be balancing kids, husbands and jobs.To the younger fans of Teri Hatcher, wait a few years on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"She reminds women that is is ok to put yourself at the top of the priority list!","review":"Teri wrote a poignant view of growing more aware of herself and how good it feels to step away from the inner fears and behaviors that can be self defeating. I related to this book in so many ways as a woman of the same age, having put others first and having been conditioned like so many women, that that is what we are supposed to do.The bottom line in her lesson is that we are not only better for ourselves in allowing ourselves to be important and be \\"entitled\\" but we are better for all of those people we have been putting first. I really appreciate that she went out on a limb to creatively point this out to us in her book.I highly recommend this book to all women. You'll come away with great lessons, regardless of where you are at in life. And it is charming and hilarious to boot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over cooked Toast","review":"Teri Hatcher has been an actress with more than twenty years experience in the entertainment business. One would hope that when she wrote her biography Burned Toast (Three hrs, three cds, abridgement, Hyperion audiobooks /Time Warner Audio), it would be more exciting and entertaining . . . it isn't.The audio book seems more like pop psych class mixed with a slice of celebrity hype. She tries to compare life to the burnt toasts that made her life. Ms Hatcher does not do a TELL ALL bio, I bet she has stories to tell . . . Maybe her next book.This audio production isn't even fully narrated by Ms Hatcher, it narrated by Deanna Hurst. Ms Hurst's narrative abilities surpass the abridged text she is reading. Ms Hatcher does bookend (introduction and afterwards)on the audio piece.Does the words \\"Miss this one\\" help you make up your mind?Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I couldn't wait to read this book.

I think she is honest, and charming. But this book reveals too much about her insecurities and inadequacies at age 40. It has funny life stories mixed in, but the rest is just an account of how inadqeuate she feels and has always felt. Its sad. I think those thoughts would be better shared with a therapist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would you like a little cheese with that whine?","review":"Boo-hoo. My life is so tough. I am a single mother.

What the book revealed is a woman very like several I have known--less beautiful and famous, but still the same type--unable to find/sustain/enjoy intimate relationships.The advice seems pretty reasonable, and I hope Teri finds the relationship she needs. Unfortunately, the women I know who are like Teri are somewhat older and still unhappily single.

And enjoyed her honesty about her insecurities. I thought Beths' review was very judgemental. You have never dated someone and made fun of them with your friends? We all have at least once. You missed the point in the book, that we all have our own issues and dont know what the other person was or is feeling or going through.I am a Burnt Toast eater, a 33 year old married mother of 2 that hasn't learned how to do things to make me happy. Like Teri, when my kids are away, I feel lonely and bored, wondering around an empty house. This is for us mothers that spend 3 hours feeding bathing and putting to be d out children to squeeze 20 mins to do the same for ourselves.I cannot wait to take a wine bath tonight. won't be until about 1 am - when I am done gettign the house in order .:)This is a worthwhile experience.

I normally avoid books written by celebs like the plague, and I wasn't a fan a Teri Hatcher... I had a look initially out of curiousity over the title, and then the blurb was interesting enough to give it a go. I am so glad I did! It's a fantastic collection of annecdotes and ideas about all aspects of life. Sometimes sad, often funny - it's very 'human'. Reading this book is like having a heart-to-heart with your best friend. You can't help but feel inspired, and ready to take on the world (one slice at a time!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just too repetitive","review":"This book just said the same thing over and over. She constantly refers to her age and her bad choices in life. While reading this I also felt like someone was preaching to me about how I should be like she strives to be. She beats herself up alot in this book. It was a hard one for me to get through simply because of its repetitive nature.She does have a few good point to make but only a few."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I have ever read","review":"Don't waste your time with this - it is without a doubt, the worst book I have ever read. I was so disappointed in reading this since I am a Teri Hatcher fan. All Teri does in this book is feel sorry for herself, at great length, repeating basically the same story over and over. And, she wonders why she doesn't have a lot of dates??? Time to grow up, Teri, you are 40, not 14!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well until the DVD broke","review":"The picture is good and the combo was convenient. However, after 1 year, the DVD broke.

Not so with this model. Even with an amplified VHF/UHF antenna, and living in a major metro area, reception is subpar on many channels. The picture jumps a lot (doesn't sync), and is subject to image ghosting. This is a shame because the DVD player, and DVD picture quality is excellent. So, this unit is indeed a 'mixed blessing'. Look elsewhere for a quality 13\\" TV/DVD combo unit.UPDATE: 12/24/06; As of yesterday, I discovered that this DVD player will NOT play several DVD's I fed it! I had purchased some educational DVD's for my toddler, and out of the 6, it only plays 4. It turns out that this DVD player is in fact a P.O.S. Stay away from this subpar TV!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Toshiba Tv DVD","review":"I got this tv as a gift two years ago (2008). The picture quality is not bad for a small tv. Dvd works great and the controller is easy to use, nothing complicated. If you're looking for a good quality tv that is small and cheap this is for you. The only problem I had with it is that some of the words that come up in commercials or shows are too small to read, it's hard to make out some words. This tv needs a converter box. Sound quality is good. Doesn't take up much space. Lightweight easy to move.Extension cord is about five feet long.

Now...2 months later...it doesn't work AGAIN. I had it...it's going in the garbage TONIGHT. DVD is faulty and once it breaks it won't let the TV turn on...so I can't even watch regular TV.

Stories and poems and a very funny sex-story about an insect, of all things -- all of it together is as good as the Clean Sheets Magazine ever gets, and it has so much in it it's better than any Yellow Silk or any other anthology!

If you think it is, you need to read better erotica. There's a boring lecture about abstinence, a fishy story about a cat and canned tuna, a geography lesson that features a woman reciting the capitals of countries, and a simply uninspired recipe for a human strawberry shortcake.

Reminds me of current American political correctness, and the liberal bias of the US press. And why living in Texas is not all agreeable, but nobody judges my liberal views with malice.Liberty here is complete, and a breath of fresh air after, \\"life inside-the-beltway\\".But the true value is the accidental depiction of the good German woman. Accidental because that was not the purpose of the movie. And as such, probably gives us a valuable and accurate historical time capsule of how gracious woman used to be in the highly educated, pre-war Germany. And what all men would like to see in their woman. Especially poignant was the five minutes the German mom had with Dad, knowing he was going to die in the hands of the German captors. She didn't cry.

Second it is very hard to figure out how to adjust it and the instructions are not good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible in every way","review":"This product is absolutely horrible for two reasons. The quality is extremely cheap, making adjustments nearly impossible. The \\"key\\" and \\"tension lifter\\" used to adjust the part that fits into your car's cup holder is made of very thin plastic. It breaks easily, but it is so hard to move you practically have to break it to operate it. The second reason is design. The large, wide semi-circular section covers up anything beside the holder you're trying to create! So if you have two existing cup holders in your car, and you're trying to use this one to improve upon the size of one of them (the whole point of this thing, right?), then you have to sacrifice the other cup holder to do it.

Now knowing how to adjust it, the other one seemed to adjust fine, but the mechanism that holds the cup in place is not strong enough to hold the size cups of that size full of a drink; within a couple weeks, it was no longer the same size I'd adjusted it to (had spread apart about 1/2 inch farther.

It is also I think one of their most underrated albums. This album is a good example of what I have always said about Cowboy Junkies always changing their sound with each new album. Very different from their previous records. Anniversary Song and Ring On The Sill are the two best known songs from the album. Except for Cold Tea Blues there isn't a weak song in the bunch."},{"rating":"2","title":"starts very strong","review":"The first 5 songs are as good as anything they have ever done, but the album drops after that and is only somewhat interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good album","review":"A relaxing, moody and intelligent album. It took me a couple of listens to really appreciate it, but it's an album of subtle beauty and Margot's voice is soothing. I was first made aware of the Cowboy Junkies from hearing \\"Anniversary Song\\" which was being played on country radio. But I wouldn't really call them a country band, although I suppose there are some elements of country in some of their stuff, hence their name. But it doesn't really matter...I'm not really one for labelling artists as being of a certain musical category. This is good music and deserves to be heard. The booklet includes all lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtle Charms","review":"Another fine album from the Cowboy Junkies. \\"Pale Sun\\" is more brooding moody music created by Michael Timmins and sung by his sister Margo. Highlights include \\"Anniversary Song\\", \\"Crescent Moon\\", and the haunting \\"Floorboard Blues\\". I really find it hard to describe just exactly what this band does, but they do it so well it tends to seep into your being."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Money","review":"This book is utter nonsense and preys upon those of us who are chronically ill and desperatly looking for a cure for our illness.

First, I took it out of the box; next, I opened it. Once I did this, I couldn't lay it down. This book is so compelling I had to keep reading. I think everyone at times feels inadequate, but to have had to overcome the stigma that this woman faced as a child and into adulthood, gave me a new insight into how much prejudice hurts. That she should have triumphed over this thing, which was so shameful her own family refused to name it, hiding it and her away until she could be \\"normal\\" again, gives hope to all who suffer from being \\"different,\\" whether it's because of some physical or emotional impairment. Not only has the author overcome her epilepsy, she has used her experience to become the remarkable woman she is today."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT his best!","review":"I'm a HUGE fan of Fagen and Steely Dan, but this is really a lackluster album.

This was a phone in of an album, no difference among the songs and a major disappointment. Fagin has been heading in this direction for a while but this is a major drop in quality. If he's not interested in exploring musically anymore he should just quit and find a beach.

The songs sound like they were churned out by rote, and not written with a concept theme. There is no spirit to this collection of songs; It lacks the wit, innovation and thoughtful mood creation of Steely Dan's early releases like \\"The Royal Scam\\", \\"Pretzel Logic\\" \\"Gaucho\\", even the rough hewed and uneven \\"Can't Buy a Thrill\\" Fagan's 'The NightFly\\" is far superior. The musicanship of \\"Morph\\" is first rate, but does not carry this album. Finally, the title is dumb. Donald Fagan needs to regroup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fagen hits a grand slam","review":"Once again, like he has done with every Steely Dan album and his other two solo albums, Donald Fagen has released another superb masterpiece.

I have been a Steely Dan fan ever since I would find their music mixed in with a group called \\"SteelEyeSpan\\" in my L.A. neighborhood record store decades ago.I have everything between Fagen and Becker that was released, except any video. My first dvd was \\"Everything Must Go\\". I bought that twice because I purchased the cd without the dvd. I just did the same with \\"Morph The Cat\\".

It's nothing ground breaking but if you like Steely Dan, you'll like this. However the dvd-a is excellent. I don't have a surround setup, but still listen to music through a dedicated two channel system. Regardless of what others say you don't need a 5.1 or 6.1 setup to take advantage of the dvd-a. There is an option to listen in surround or advanced resolution stereo. Sitting dead in front of two speakers and listening to an album like this in 24bit/96kHz is something else. All the music just jumps out and envelopes the room. To really take advantage of it, do yourself a favor and turn it up ,this is really where you hear the difference.I for one just wish the industry would embrace this format, and packing (dvd-a + cd).

Miles, John McLaughlin and some have produced lasting listenable \\"Morphed\\" rock, jazz, new age gobbledegook.

In light of his \\"performance\\" if you want to call it that, there's no way I'd buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Morph The Cat is very good","review":"This album seems to get better every listen.At first I was thinking this is not Nightfly.This album sounds more like Steely Dan's Everything Must Go.Its filled with smooth jazzy sounds from subdued to perky.Although none of the tracks really stood out like his other albums its still Fagen singing about the dark side of life.If you like to relax this is for you.If you want a perkier album resort back.Songs that did stand out Security Joan,What I Do,H-Gang and Mary Shut The Garden Door.Its worth buying......Definately!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another \\"Must Love Fagen Before Listening\\"","review":"This album opens strong with \\"Morph The Cat\\"s incredibly pleasing vocal harmony, performed by Fagen himself, but you'll instantly become apethetic to the individual songs themes. However excitment from having another productin from your favorite artist, will make you spend more time with the album-and it will be well worth it. \\"The Night Belongs To Mona\\" is a deep and unsettling song, disguised by slightly a upbeat tempo and very listenable vocals, now my favorite on the album. This song is quite infectious. \\"May Shut The Garden Door\\" will leave you wondering what the song is really about, but understanding that its serious anyway. Its a little haunting, but a great song, nonetheless. If you like Fagen even a little youll grow into this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fagen delivers again","review":"Fagen delivers again with \\"Morph the Cat\\". When it comes to richness of sound and attention to detail, Fagen and Steely Dan have no equal. Morph is his strongest album since \\"The Nightfly\\" and is much more personal than the last 3 albums. He is in a major infectious groove with \\"H Gang\\" and \\"What I do\\", and \\"The night belongs to Mona\\", and \\"Mary shut the garden door\\" are also standout tracks. If you are looking for another 70's Steely Dan album, you may be dissapointed. But if you love the funny, oblique, sardonic lyrics that Fagen is known for wwrapped around some excellent jazz/funk/soul grooves, you will love \\"Morph\\". The session musicians are all stellar and the guitars and his voice are up front in the mix more so than on his last 3 efforts. Worth a buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"We're getting there......","review":"Firstly, let us rejoice in the news that \\"Morph the Cat\\" is a LOT better than \\"Everything Must Go\\", which was Steely Dan's car boot sale nadir, and the semi-vapid Kamakiriad.Sadly, its no \\"Nightfly\\", although we're getting there - there are songs in this collection which stand up well in comparison to Fagen's finest hour. Indeed, if you found \\"The great pagoda of funn\\" tucked away between \\"The Nightfly\\" and \\"The Goodbye Look\\", it would not seem out of place.It sounds to me as if Fagen has started to tap into what Steely did best, the jazz voicings, dazzling harmonies, magnificent ensemble playing, the harmonic side, rather than just rhythms and grooves.Will he ever make an album as good as \\"The Nightfly\\" again?On the strength of this collection, the answer is \\"quite possibly\\"..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Like It, But That's Not Always A Good Sign","review":"It's great to hear that typical late-Steely Dan/Nightfly-inspired sound in this new Donald Fagen release. I liked it right away, particularly \\"What I Do,\\" which has the same kind of instantly familiar feeling of some of the best cuts on Gaucho and Aja. However, that's not my usual reaction to a new production by Fagen. In the past I have found myself disappointed upon the first, third, or fifth playing of new discs, but they have generally grown on me to the point that I hang on each subtle note or musical variation. The fact that I liked this disc right away is a bit disconcerting. Does this mean that over time I will appreciate it less? Let's hope not. This is Fagen's best since \\"Nightfly.\\" While not containing a breakthrough cut or innovation that will become a classic, it's very listenable and accessible. Comfortable right out of the shrink wrap.

Mr Fagen does his usual trick of writing somewhat criptic lyrics but you gotta love it.There are only 8 tracks on the disc (not counting the reprise) and some seem to go on a little long but that is better than 12 shorter songs with lots of filler.I would definitly recomend this disc to anyone who is fimiliar with sd/df.

Even his performance was, I thought, a tribute to Anthony Perkins. Anne Heche was wonderful as well. One of the real heroes of the film, performance-wise, was William H. Macy.

This is the worst attempt at making a film i have ever seen. Personally i believe that Anne Heche was just insulting the movie, not to mention Vince Vaughn. You can not perfect perfection, and this movie proves that. Psycho is a God among movies, the re-make rates well below the devil. Maybe if i had seen this one first before the original) i wouldnt have thought it so bad, or judged it so harshly, however i would not be a rabbid Psycho fan if i had to judge the movie on those terms.

It would have been great if Vince Vaughn had not been cast in it. He's too cool to be creepy, and too tough to be meek. The rest of the cast does admirably, but why do a remake if you are not going to change things? It would have thrown Hitchcock fans off guard ( for better or worse ) and allowed for some things to happen that we always wanted to happen in the original. At least the remake of Wages Of Fear ( Sorcerer ) got a new plot, and new settings. Bottom line is that there is no reason to see this if you have already seen the original."},{"rating":"1","title":".","review":"It's true that it never should've been made, and it's equally true that it's a very poor remake. Why are the people of the 90s so obsessed with re-doing things that've been done well enough already? And always adding that \\"hip, 90s spice\\" to those things? It's sick, gaudy, soulless, and dull. As for the movie itself ... Vince Vaughn is atrociously poor and terribly miscast ... Anne Heche is adequate at best. I'm not sure about the rest because my interest lapsed in the first 30 minutes and I have to admit I only paid scarce attention for the remainder."},{"rating":"2","title":"BARELY.BARELY 4 STARS.......","review":"This has got to be the first movie in history that i marginally liked but bought anyways. it barely made a 4 star rating with me. I guess the reason i kind of liked it is because of the way it was filmed and the style gus van zant used. I enjoyed his use of colour and the costumes as well were borderline avant garde.This movie is in no way a \\"shot for shot remake\\" by the way! That would be literally impossible to do on film! Wake up cinema buffs!Psycho 1998 is no classic, Vince Vaughn's performance was at most, juvenile and restrained. As if he was embarrassed to really let loose the character. Anne Heech did a mousy job of playing her character but did add a lot of nineties trend and style to the film, which is a good thing!Overall the movie sucked but the style rocked. Worth owning for that only, in my oppinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beside the Point","review":"Simply stated, this near shot-for-shot remake of the original Alfred Hitchcock classic does nothing the original did not do the first time around-- and do much better.

Vince Vaughn was a very creepy Norman Bates, Anne Heche was a fairly good what's-her-face, and everyone else was great too. I have to critique other peoples' critiques though. Hitchcock did not film Psycho in black and white because color wasn't available. it was available. he did it for the effect, and it worked. i do agree, however, that Norman's new house was pretty corny, but everything was almost identical to the original, which i hardly noticed until i saw the making on the DVD where it compares scenes. thank you for listening. please give Van Sant a break, he's a great director, and he DID choose to make this movie, the studio did NOT tell him to do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, to whoever thought this movie was good...","review":"Sorry, but this movie really blew the big one.

Danny Elfman really did an excellent job in remaking the music, i don't see how he could have done it better, he is the man at freakness music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gus Van Sant shows more Ed Woodism than Hitchcockism!","review":"How can anyone possibly say that this version has better acting than the original!!! Obviously they know near nothing about acting! I'm sorry but Vince Vaughn does not make a better Norman Bates than Anthony Perkins. Anthony Perkins IS Norman Bates! And just because a movie is in color and it is gory does not make it scary! Of course there is nothing wrong with remaking Psycho for today's generation but they could have done a much MUCH better job.

If you were Ann Heche--who looks thoroughly bored in this film--you'd run out of the Bates Motel parlor and would rather fall asleep at the wheel driving all night than eat with Vince Vaughn.

No insult to the fine cast, and I especially like Vince Vaughn, but he isn't Anthony Perkins. Juliette Moore and William H. Macy do stand out, though. For a movie filmed and set in 1998, a lot of the clothes and furnishings seem awfully retro. I'll admit that the murder scenes are well shot and the climax is okay.

Vince Vaughn can't play Norman bates at all. Nobody can play Norman Bates as good as Anthony Perkins. The whole movie was like an exact copy of the original. The movie was not as classy.

Vaughan is not menacing or threatening as Norman Bates, but a laughable idiot who does not emit any fear in the viewer whatsoever.

It is a tribute to Mr. Hitchcock's genius that this version is so slow-moving and quite frankly boring. Anne Heche's performance is awful; when she's driving off with the 400 grand you want to slap that stupid smirk off her face. Vince Vaughn is simply too cool to play the Norman Bates role.

And that's where it really doesn't work. The dialogue has not been updated to the 1990s, and sounds ridiculous. Also, the situation between marion and sam is also way outdated. In 1960, it was feasible that a proper young woman would not bring a man to the home she shares with a conservative sister. Sam lives in his store, so a hotel in the afternoon is their only choice. But in this day and age, do they need to \\"sneak\\" around during lunchtime? Give me a break. Also, Sam can't marry her because he can't afford to support her, he's paying alimony, etc. That is also very outdated and totally stupid.If a real remake had been attempted, complete with an updated dialogue and story changes to suit a more modern era, it might have worked.

After the touchy-feely-cuddly, let's-pander-to-all-the-overachieving-masses glop of Good Will Hunting, it's safe to say Van Sant has long lost the indie spark that lit films like Drugstore Cowboy, My Own Private Idaho and most recently, To Die For. If Gus had only followed his own vision, instead clinging to Sir Al's, this might have been a good film. Van Sant thinks that shooting this one almost by the books is an homage----but in fact it insults Hitch in the worst way. Can you imagine Alfred Hitchcock hacking out a remake of \\"Citizen Kane\\"?

Not much suspense because the pace and tone of the book is so relentlessly dark that dead babies or idiots putting themselves in danger on the ice or suicidal teachers, just seemed pretty much second verse, same as the first.

There has been a lot of disappointment in the Rock/Pop/Rap arena in the past year, but this disc prevents '03 from being a rather disappointing year in music.That being said, buy the disc, put it in your car, turn it up, and go for a long drive.

Aside from the fiery single \\"Stop\\" and the sensually gothic \\"In Like the Rose\\", I return to it for the sound - a post-Jesus and Mary Chain roar that they explored to greater effect on their eponymous debut.

That is how BRMC present their music often. They just want you to hear the music and keep it to yourself. Their garage punk is for people who have heard of Spiritualized and Primal Scream. It doesn't have the joy and bravado of other rock and roll bands. \\"Stop\\" and \\"Six Barrel Shotgun\\" sound like tracks from their first album. If it is not broke why fix it? Why is anyone thinking that BRMC is going to do a prog rock album? Other songs like \\"Generation\\" and \\"US Government\\" deal with the disconnected feel of the times. They are questioning the current slide of young people into cliché, cynicism, and being jaded. They have hope in their music, even though their politics are more personal. This band has the coolest name, but who knows if anyone will discover how good they truly are?"},{"rating":"1","title":"simply terrible and pointless","review":"you won't remember any of these songs after you've auditioned this disc: there are no strong melodies or innovative musical turns. shameless rip off of a great band (jesus and marychain) who wrote deceptively simple lyrics. the lyrics here are just seemingly penned by simpletons. much better CDs in this dreamy category were released this year by the black watch (awesome songwriting--kinda like the house of love), sun kil moon (wonderful return of red house painters' frontguy), and robyn hitchcock (the acoustic \\"Luxor\\"). the languid (read: airhead) rock by these poseurs (you have heard the term associated with black rebel a zillion times now) is a sham. look up the aforementioned discs instead..."},{"rating":"1","title":"BRMC really does suck","review":"This band has no impact point in their music...no pauses, no nifty chord changes.

The songs are more accomplished, fiery and are great to listen to. In an age where the most significant rockers are Good Charlotte and their like, it is nice to see a band keep it raw(er) and real.

I like the very fast rate of fire of this gun as well as the compact size. The loudness of the rotating barrel also gives the weapon an empowering and more realistic feel. The 20 darts would be better if replaced by whistling darts in my opinion. this is definately a weapon of choice for troopers very close to the enemy. I have found that the rapid fire works best if used in teams of 2 or 3, so that 1 teamate could fire and hold off the enemy while the other dropped back & reloaded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gun.","review":"I bought this gun lastnight at Toys r us for $26.99 so dont let this price fool you. It's rate of speed it shoots is really cool for a toy and makes wars a lot more fun. It also lets you do single shots. But the only downfall is you have to pump it up so you can fire all 20 rounds and to reload it takes awhile. But all in all for the price you cant go wrong. Also the way the gun looks makes me think that it will really be hard to mod but it shoots harder than most guns. You can also shoot any 3\\" dart."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 seconds of fun","review":"This gun can unload its full ammo in about 3 seconds. It takes about 2 minutes to find the ammo, about another minute to reload. While that might annoy some fans, I find it worth it. IT can be a bit loud when firing, plus kids might find it harder to pump 30 times. When you have it fully pumped and in a kid's hands though, they will have a huge smile on their face when they unload this gun. While the newer clip system dart guns are easier to reload, this gun is easier to use and a hell of a lot more fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"The fastest shooting nerf gun yet.............","review":"Hi. I am an experienced nerfer, and this was DEFINTALY the best gun i used. This gun is just about avrage in accuracy and distance (maby a bit above avarge). The rof ( rate of fire) is amazing! Its the fastest-shooting nerf has ever produced!! No gun will probably ever replace it 4 me. Oh yeah, on the back of the box, it says that they r the \\"further flying darts\\". This is not true,however. Also, the pumping handle is somewhat flimsy, but uless u don't bend it and smash it, its fine. I recomend all of u peeps out there and look at this gun. This IS the rapid fire gun. Also, 4 a backup, i would NO DOUBT ABOUT IT, recomend the Nite finderPS: My gun, after u shoot it, it shoots again on its own. However, on any of the other reviews, that dosn't say. i dono if its just a problem with my gun, but whatever.

This Nerf weapon is not what i was expecting. with the massive amount of pumps require to even unload 1/2 of the darts, it takes too much time when under fire.

I do not reccomend this to my fellow Cube Warriors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle, practical, and Non-judgmental Author","review":"I almost didn't buy this book because of one of the reviews that said that the author was judgmental.

On the contrary, the author was kind, nurturing, and extremely helpful. I have read several baby sleep books and found this one to have the most practical and logical approach. The author helped me realize the bad habits that I had gotten into with my baby and offered great solutions to un-do my problems.

The techniques are very easy and this worked for me right away. It helped me to establish a routine when I felt so clueless in the beginning.The baby took naps in the family room during the day. At night she slept in a bassinet by the bed for the first 6 weeks. Then she moved to her room. She has slept there ever since. She is 6 months now. Up until this point she would go down without fussing. However, now she is more alert and wants to stay up to see what is going on. But after about 10 minutes or so she will go down.The only thing we did not stick to was her suggestions on pacifiers. We ended up using the pacifier on the way home from the hospital and have used it since. The good thing is once she falls asleep she does not cry for it when it falls out. She can get back to sleep by herself.The final perk is that the book is short and sweet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This was a great book for me.

These letters are spaced close together and then reversed (printed in white) over black and red backgrounds. Don't plan on just sitting back and reading the book, you have to work extra hard to read it. It is a major effort. Even the proofreader couldn't read it-a line is missing at the bottom of page 2.

This book, I think, was written a while ago but as always it's a page turner! Can't put it down, just like all his books!I also did like that the main characters were young adults. That is one of the aspects about his writing that drew me in many years ago, that his hero's & heroines can be woman, children even animals instead of always men! Not that I mind when his protagonists are adult men, but it's nice to have the variety!It's an interesting story and I recommend it to any Dean Koontz fan, but maybe for a new reader start with \\"Watchers\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"I usually enjoy Dan Koontz books, but I ended up putting this one down.

A crazy kid who loves to kill animals and people just to watch them die and, he thinks it is funny. Until this book, I had never put a book down before I completed reading it. I just could not stand anymore. Maybe someday I will pick this book up again and perhaps find out for myself what so many thought was such a good book. This book is sick!!

The first half of the book tells you about characters and different settings,and the buildup to the plot of the book. The book itself doesn't have enough action in the first half of the book to keep the readers attention. I think the author needs to fill his pages with more mystery or action. instead of taking half a book to build up plot,write the whole book on one. To me this book wasn't the best of books,and was too drawn out on the fact that it takes the author the first half of the book to talk about what will happen at the end.

One of my least favorite Dean Koontz book for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silence the Voice","review":"Let me begin by saying that in general, I like the literary work of Dean Koontz. However, this particular story is short on action and long on describing in excruciating detail the various character's feelings and thoughts. Before you assume that I only like books with pictures in them, let me clarify that in general the descriptions of the main characters thoughts are salient to moving the story forward. However, as with salt, a little enhances the flavor and a lot destroys the taste buds. This is a case of too much salt. So much to the point of destroying my interest and rendering me hopelessly bored. I became bogged down in the inertia of the infinitesimal detail of each characters' every thought and their over analysis of their feelings which they took turns in sharing with the hapless reader. I actually lost empathy with the characters' peril and started to wish that the evil supernatural entity would dispatch with them quickly and yes, painfully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely wonderfull read","review":"So far I have read ten different dean koontz novels, but this one, The Voice of the Night, skyrockets above all others in my opinion.

It is about a young boy, Colin, with a harsh childhood (typical Dean Koontz style) that moves to a new city where he astoundingly becomes friends with the most popular guy in school. This friend, Roy, starts off with a twisted and disturbing personallity right from the very beginning when he first reveals his interest in death and the joy he feels when killing things such as bugs, lizards, and alarming enough... cats.

I have read about five Koontz novels and for the most part I enjoyed them. But...this is an abomination of the one star degree. Every single aspect of this novel is weak. The plot, the characters, the scenes...Bah! It is about as solid as string cheese.

Rather like an Alfred Hitchcock episode, starring the kids.Lonely schoolboy Colin makes a good friend in his new town: Roy, an attractive, charming, confident boy, likeable in every way. But Roy has this little problem. He likes killing things.Koontz delves the gray zones in this piece, and demonstrates the difficulty the young face in acquiring a good moral compass. Colin's nature cannot allow him to fall down Roy's perverse path, yet he is all but alone in having to face-off the child psychopath in his rejected wrath - who will believe him? And who will help? As in some of his earlier period writing, the author seems almost to believe that good and evil are innate qualities at birth, though obviously anyone can cultivate either in the course of their development.This is a good, well-written thriller. Interesting and satisfying. And not a little nerve-wracking."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great book","review":"This isn't the best book that Dean Koontz wrote, though i will have to admit this book is pretty good.

Roy Burden is a strong, athletic, 14-year-old, who gets really excited about killing things, he says its a real \\"popper.\\" Roy trys to cause a train wreck, but Colin is a good boy, and doesnt let him. When Colin trys to stop him Roy becomes anger with him, and trys to kill him.

It's not one of his most complex books, but is still a worthwhile read. The book did not totaly absorb me but it also did not bore me. The story was another good guy versus bad guy, with colin being the nerdy hero and roy the deranged killer. Throughout most of the story you are willing colin on, but you are ultimately left feeling sorry for roy and how he came about to be so deranged.

I don't care. I'm tired of pretending every successful writer can actually write. This book was contrived, forced, the dialogue rang completely untrue. The things Koontz seemed to want us to feel or think about the characters we didn't naturally feel or think about them. I found myself disagreeing with every \\"assessment\\" the narrator made regarding the characters.

Now that he is a bit older (13 months) I'm a bit disconcerted by the routine use of sugar, fat, white flour, etc. in many of the recipes and recommended foods. While suggesting items such as bacon, frankfurters, etc. it does note that they should be limited. But many modern nutritionists wouldn't suggest them AT ALL (or so it seems to me as a layperson). I'd say this is a fine book for getting your very young baby started, but once s/he is older keep this book as one among several that you turn to for advice. After all, it can be nice to have a book that doesn't make you feel like a rotten mother for giving your kid a small amount of sugar or white flour!"},{"rating":"2","title":"buy it now!","review":"This is an excellent and SIMPLE book of fun and nutritous meals and snacks for kids of all ages. The recipes are so easy and made with the most common ingredients. My problem with recipe books is when they call for unusual ingredients that (not being a chef) I usually don't keep on hand. These recipes are fast and easy enough to whip up while the kids play. It even suggests new ways to serve less appealing foods (like veggies), in a fun way that kids think of it as being a treat. I think this book is a great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am quite disappointed with this book, considering my pediatrician's office recommends it! The recipes are unhealthy -most using honey and canned foods. The chapter devoted to making baby's first foods is not informative or helpful.

Lansky's information has stood the test of time, and while she has updated the material she has not erased the good old practicality that my mother enjoyed when she used it 28 (okay, almost 29) years ago. My daughter is a very picky eater--by which I mean not so much restrictive food preferences as a basic lack of interest in eating whatsoever--and this book has some good stick-to-one's-ribs ideas for foods that pack a significant nutritive punch.

So, as the name suggests it is a rather highly intellectual book, that most I think will find boring. I thought my nerdiness might seperate me from the crowd who thinks this is boring, but I was wrong. I had the incorrect preconceived notion that English translations would be available for the text, which assumption proved false. This volume consists predominantly of transcribed Sumerian and reproductions of clay tablets. It is more like a reference book for the serious Sumerologist, not a book for light reading.

I love Family Style for so many reason's mainly due to Stevie Ray Vaughan who was expanding his guitar vocabulary further than he had the previous year. Jimmie Vaughan was also at the peek of his career both of the brothers were a good mix between texas blues. I think for the most part the musicians were all different it added a new flavor to Stevie Ray's style. My very favorite song is Long Way From Home, and Brothers. Family Style would reach 7 on the charts becoming Stevie Ray Vaughan's most succesful album. I personally think this is a must have album for any die hard fans of the guitar.

I haven't tried any of the other uses (hooking up turntables or tape decks), but I did successfully hook up a non preamp pickup for my acoustic guitar. And it has to do with the vagaries of Garageband as well, which turns out to be more of a toy than a dependable demo maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Griffin iMic review","review":"This thing is pretty much a piece of junk. The cost of making this item has got to be less than $5 and it looks it. What's worse is that it doesn't really serve any useful purpose as there is significant noise on the microphone input. As best as I can tell the quality of the line input is no better (or worse) than what one could get by going directly to the line input on the computer, but with the noise on the mic input this thing really isn't a good substitute for a powered mic. All in all, not worth having."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't do anything","review":"I bought this item to connect a microphone to my MacBook. It supposedly has line and microphone settings.

Finally I bought a Blue Yeti mic, which works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Windows 7 Compatible","review":"Nowhere on the product description does it say it's not Windows Vista or 7 compatible.

The sound from this device compared to the internal iBook audio out port is much cleaner, much crisper, and the recording was very clear with almost no noise.

Very compact, easily fits in my laptop bag.Overall, oustanding product."},{"rating":"2","title":"must have for any PC Audiophile","review":"my introduction to such a device came after only listening to the raw audio from my Mac mini. I have high end studio speakers connected to the Mac but i always heard a strange high pitch sound int eh background. Leo Laporte always recommended such a device on shows like TWIT and the Tech Guy. It made sense to me that all the guzzling hard dives and DVD drives spinning inside machines (i also have an old custom PC Machine) could interfere with your sound card. The analog audio jacks really don't have much output or inputs if your careful about your sound. In this day and age of Dolby, THX, podcasting, extreme gaming, and sound editing one should definitely have a device like this. It ends up processing the audio signal digitally outside your computer which lowers the undesired hissing or high pitch noise. Honestly my computer speakers sometime outdo my home theater system. This is definitely,a must have for any audiophile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does NOT directly accept Guitar","review":"This device, despite the description, does NOT have 1/4 inch jacks.

Tried to use it to record some old vinyl records. I assumed that I was doing something wrong using the software.

I may have just gotten a bad unit but don't know since seller will not respond with a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Since this is touted as a product for connecting retrograde equipment to current computer quickly and easily, it seems really thoughtless to sell a device that is not plug-compatible. I suppose it would cost more to add two sets of connectors that might never get used, but it's quite annoying to buy this thing and then discover it needs an adaptor cable. iMic really needs be labeled and marketed with pictures of plugs it supports since the text description \\"1/8\\" stereo\\" isn't meaningful to the non-technical. I know what the plugs I have look like. If I had known I had to research them in advance i probably would have looked for another product. I wanted plug and play, and iMic isn't for me.And where's the software? I had to hunt through the literature to find website."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the right fit if this interface is what you need.","review":"There can't be many who are trying to bridge the analog and digital audio worlds through a USB port but if you're one of those people then this product could do the trick for you. Not only does it go from analog to digital but it has two levels: line and mic. They have different amplification levels to support typical inputs. I was surprised at how small, how stylish, and how effective this product is. Works like a charm. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for PC","review":"Manufacturer says the iMic isolates the noise of hardware. Well, I connected the iMic in my PC and began recording cassettes and vinyls. The first problem is the low input signal, so I had to increase it to hear the recorded songs in a good volume and to set a decent recording level. The sound is very good, but in the silence between songs a noise appears. It comes from the power supply unit fan of the PC. Is a high frequency noise being heard every time between songs, even at low volume. I've tried to filter that, but I lose quality of sound.If I connect directly my deck to the in-line of the PC, the signal is so strong that I have to set the recording level to the minimum and the noise of the fan is very low compared to recorded signal, so I do not hear undesirable noises, even at highest reproducing level. The solution for me is to connect a preamplifier to the turntable.Maybe the iMic will work well in a notebook, but not in a PC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gratuitous with most iMacs, but the software is still useful.","review":"If you have a computer with audio in and out jacks, you don't need the USB interface. What's disappointing is that Final Vinyl doesn't appear to be available as a separate program. As a previous viewer mentioned, it's superior to Spin Doctor, the vinyl-to-digital conversion program included with Roxio's Toast. Roxio has made no significant improvements to the program through the last several editions of Toast. Spin Doctor is colorful, and occasionally it does quite well by automating the procedure of recognizing the separate tracks on an LP. But the wave patterns are essentially useless for any sort of precise editing, and the capabilities for post-conversion filters, equalization, etc. are comparatively limited. If your primary purpose is to convert vinyl to digital, programs like WireTap Studio, Sound Studio, and Final Vinyl are the better bet. (If you use PC's, Cool Edit still leads the pack.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Griffin gets it done","review":"Burning vinyl to your computer and then to CD seems like it ought to be easy. It isn't. But the iMic makes it bearable. The device works as advertised, and the sound quality holds up fairly well. My CD had the same scratchy resonance as the record, and that was what I was looking for.However, the instructions -- to the extent that there are any --leave much to be desired, and if you haven't done some digital recording in the past, you may be a bit lost. The instructions are utterly useless in terms of explaining how the sound file will actually get to a CD once you've burned it to the hard drive. Still, a little ingenuity on your part will solve the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"High-Quality Recording...

Out of the box, I could not use any of the mikes that had worked on my prior Dell computers and essentially ignored doing any video voice overs or anything else that required microphone input. I recently needed to edit video that required narration and, after some research and some excellent reviews, I decided to try Griffin's gadget. I also bought a Koss M-18 electret microphone to go with it. Together, they solved the problem effectively and completely.

I suppose I'm entitled to yet another replacement under the one-year warranty, but I've had enough of this shoddy product."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUZZ.....","review":"They should have called it iHUM. It BUZZES a 60hz tone throughout every recording. I wanted to transfer my vinyl to MP3 and didn't have high expectations for output quality, but I never even ripped a single file with it because I could never purge the tone. A google search turned up hundreds of hits for imic HUM and all the solutions blamed software, connectors and default settings - but I am here to say - its the device. With the settings corrected and the only the USB dongle attached it still hummed. When I did try to use it, figuring I could remove the BUZZ after I realized that the tone got more intense the longer it played.If you are going to do any kind of archiving or recording I suggest you not be cheap and find something more reputable than this. Its not good for much more than replacing a broken input jack.

For instance, Hike No. 22 is shown on Map No. 18. The trail is described on page 70 and the map is on page 180. Does this sound confusing? It is. Also, the overview maps for each park show campgrounds and ranger stations, but they don't show where the individual trails are located. These desert parks are enormous, and the lack of good overview maps makes it nearly impossible to determine, for instance, what hikes are near the south entrance to Joshua Tree.

Anybody who denies the power of the Porter Ricks remix of Down, including Low fans, hasn't really listened to it without an axe to grind. I've played it for so many people, none of whom have even heard of Low, and they are almost always astonished. It's kind of like listening to a primordial ooze of white noise coalesce into a song played by ghosts in love. Low fans and yoga-practitioners with enough patience for this (13 minute long) song will be rewarded. The best songs by far are Down, Words & Over the Ocean. If you have this cd and like those three songs, I recommend The Notwist's \\"Neon Golden\\", Console's \\"Reset the Preset\\", The Postal Service's \\"Give Up\\" & Dntel's \\"Life is Full of Possibilites\\". Another good (though uneven) album like this is the Mogwai remix project \\"Kicking a Dead Pig\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really tried to like this.","review":"I can only repeat what others already have stated...This record could maybe please some electronica fans, but if you're a Low fan, you probably won't like this.The remixes seem \\"cheap\\" and I feel the end result could have been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a headphone pleaser","review":"This CD might make good background music at a coffee shop, but upon close inspection, like through headphones, this cd's flaws are glaring.Nice try though.

I also have been a big fan of the Dance/Electronica scene, and this album seemed to promise as intriguing fusion of both styles . Unfortunatley LOW'S incredible music has been swept aside by nieve immature non musicianship of amazing ineptitude. If this were just a cheap DnB album it would of been cast aside in the bargain bin along with countless other albums of Lift music. This is not LOW, just some a hopeless attempt to steal some light from one of the most incredible bands around. GO buy Trust, Things we lost in the fire or Secret Name .. and really experience LOW."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good.","review":"After you listen to this once, chances are you will never listen to it again. I actually made two attempts, but I was even more disheartened after the second. This CD probably doesn't deserve any stars, but I gave it one because if you're a diehard Low fan, Owl still a \\"fun\\" thing to have. It'll make a good conversation piece if you ever have another Low fan over for dinner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remixing Low...Why?","review":"I'm quite confused by this album. Why would anyone WANT to remix Low's beautiful music? Why not leave it be? It's amazing, and remixes couldn't do anything but take away from that. There are a few remixes on here which are ok, like Porter Ricks remix of Down, and even the Party Remix of Over The Ocean isn't bad, as long as you don't think about the original version. Most of the songs on here sound like a bunch a wall of noise, some drum beats and occasionally some piece of a Low song. If your looking for a good remix cd of this genreof music, you won't find it here (and I'd be surprised if you find a decent one at all) and those just interesed in Low being remixed, you will most likely be let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"the original beauty of the songs was destroyed by remixers","review":"i very much enjoy LOW's music. i listened to this twice. i think it sucks. yes, the songs were re-mixed. so what? they sound horrible. the original beauty of the songs was destroyed by remix artists.

If you get the Lil' Playzone you really should invest in at least one of thease extensions or you might as well use your Pack n Play. The playzone by itself is about the same size. Its great for a larger safe area for your child, but take those bear stickers off, they dont stick well and my child peeled one off and started eating it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An oversized play pen.","review":"We got this item for our 1 yr old daughter. This thing is great, it was set up in minutes and will somewhat keep the toddler in one place, by that I mean even our 1 yr old is able to push the playpen around and move it across the living room. Thats the only problem that I can see. The construction is very good because with a 5yr old and a 7yr old (that have no concept of the door) insist on climbing over the sides time after time, has held up very well. Being made of plastic it can be taken outside and cleaned with a garden hose and mild soap. I would highly recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make my living room childcare and not jail","review":"We bought this playzone after we returned the superyard. The reason we returned the superyard is because it is not sturdy, hard to set up, and high to be stepped over because it does not have a door. We are very satisfied with the playzone and recommend you to consider this product. The little door is helpful for the children and adult to go in and out, but yet I feel safe to know my baby would not know how to open the door. The set up is pretty easy, but most of all, the color and the toys that come with it. It makes my living room more like a childcare and not a children prison.The only thing that made me unsatisfied completely is the shipping cost. I want to buy some more corner extensions, but the shipping cost is almost the same as the price itself, and this product is not sold in stores."},{"rating":"2","title":"lifesaver","review":"I have two playzones each with 8 panels each. I have twins so I needed a large space to contain them. We got the playzone at 6 months when the pack n play was too small to hold them. We have one in the garage and one in the living room. I like how you can modify the shape where in the garage it's a large circle and in the living room it's a long rectangle. The only thing is the music is very loud on the panels and especially given we have three of the activity centers on each of our 8 paneled playzones, the music going all at the same time was too much. We took out the batteries so we don't hear the music anymore but they still use the rolling balls and telephone from it. We have the foam letters under it and we break it down and take it with us when we go to the in-laws or grandparents so they have a containment area. It can then double as a crib when we go on road trips as we put some blankets down and they're set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart Buy","review":"It makes total sense to purchase this extension kit.

Nilsson delivers raw emotional and intellectual experiences that emerge deep from gifted talents. Original all-the-way. This set is proof that standard CD's can sound great when properly recording great artists.Recording engineers and producer's please take note: Learn the important technical efforts used here to vastly improve your future recordings or re-releases.

The thing is, JW is only 60, but he looks and sounds like 80. I hope he is well, since Johnny Winter is possibly the finest blues guitarist (and vocalist) there ever was, black, white or very white, as the case may be.While Mr Winter shows himself every now and then, the performances are feeble and weak. If you get this, do so only out of respect for the master."},{"rating":"1","title":"father time slows the texas tornado","review":"it has been over a decade since johnny winter has recorded a studio album, the excellent 1993 album wheres your brother. since then struggles with illness and substance abuse have quieted the mad albino resulting in a much different album than any of his previous releases. gone are the growling vocals and the blistering solos replaced by a softer wispy voice and carefully played solos by a musicians who realizes his limitations. the best songs on the album are the acoustic ones that don't overwhelm his softer vocals and complement his more laidback style. it's when we get the the harder electric blues that the album really suffers and makes you long for the days when johnny winter was the unquestioned king of white american blues."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a Blue man","review":"Possibly one of the worst albums ever recorded. I had hoped Winters, a veteran performer, would emerge from his abyss with the polish and sophistication that can only be brought on by withstanding the test of time. That did not happen and this recording is a disappointment of epic proportions. The essence, the energy and the allure of this great rocker are gone. This recording replaced them with weak vocals, a muddy production sound mix, grating unimaginative lyrics, repetitious and trite guitar riffs that would have Methuselah praying for the end of the world. The title track and the monkey song are, in a word, nauseating. It's a pity our hometown boy has sunk to this level."},{"rating":"1","title":"leave this one alone","review":"i can't figure out why this album was even released. i know fans have waited about 7 years for a new album from johnny since the 1997 live in new york. in that album johnny was already showing signs of serious health problems that have affected both his singing and his once powerful guitar playing, the span of the last 8 years have seen johnny in such a state that his voice is but a whisper and his guitar playing is very labored. the only reason for 2 stars is a good backup band and a solid choice of material.this album will be a painful downer for any fans of johnnys music and playing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad chapter in a great career","review":"The band does the best they can in support of a terribly diminished Johnny Winter, but there just isn't much to work with anymore. The '97 live album was weak - and I'm a Bluesman never even rises to that level. This might sound cruel, but Johnny putting out this record is like Ali returning to the ring. Instead of buying this get one of his many incredible works, and if you already own them all buy another copy of your favorite and turn somebody else on to the best blues rocker ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"He is the best","review":"I just want to comment on the review saying that Johnny winter has never been an even average vocalist. This is totaly wrong. I have studied both song and guitarplaying for many years and I want you who don't think that Johnny can sing, to for example listen to I'll drown in my tears.

I love his stuff and listen to it often. In the last 20 years, his career and output have, to say the least, been uneven. I gather he has faced his share of personal problems in this period and I think this album shows it. I had hoped he would return from the wilderness with a stronger will and powerful band, but it was not to be. This is an average album with below average playing by Winter. I think that age has finally caught up to him, and that he has not gotten better in recent years, just weaker.

If you are going to Walt Disney World with kids I highly recommend \\"Walt Disney World with Kids 2002\\" by Kim Wright Wiley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always helpful, always on target","review":"I've used this book for years when planning Disney travel and always find the author to be right on the money. You can tell she's a parent herself - she never has those unrealistic game plans like \\"see everything at Epcot in two hours\\" that you find in other books. Since my kids range in age from 3 to 15, I especially find her ride ratings to be helpful, especially her ratings of which ride are too scary for younger children. The dining information has also led us to some wonderful meals.But where I think she really shines is in the hotel ratings. We always stay in a Disney hotel but now that they have so many even that can be confusing. Most books just list the hotels and their prices but she goes as far as to rate them and give advantages and disadvantages of each hotel. Last time we stayed at one of her recommended midpriced hotels and were very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable guide to the first time visitor","review":"When I was planning our first trip to WDW, I felt it was so important to get my priorities for the trip straight as the number of choices, from hotels to which rides to go on was scary.

It is written in such a readable style, just as though someone were talking to you and giving you advice. I found everything to be just as she described when I got the resort.

Beyond simple suggestions, that anyone with children would already know, this book offered NOTHING in new ideas or information. If you have been to WDW you will pick up errors in the book immediately. One example is the authors review/information on the Disney Village hotels. If you really want a guide that offers clear, relevant information go straight for Birnbaum's. \\"WDW with Kids\\" was my fifth Disney guide and Birnbaum's still has all others beat by a mile!!!

The stage is Huge and I feel they could've done a lot more to the stage and with props and stuff. I did like the Harley Davidson coming out of the smoke. I love watching the cute oriental girls head banging and rocking out with the songs, and damn, they are so adorable and cute. The crowd was having a great time and everyone was singing and waving their hands around, so that is always a great crowd to have. I love the several Heavy costumes that Rob Halford are wearing and the way he walks around the stage, he OWNS that stage. Great show"},{"rating":"1","title":"one word: DISAPPOINTING","review":"Gosh, this is the most disappointing music DVD I ever watched. Sure, old men like Halford do not have the same on-stange-performance as in the 80s, but Halfords performance on this DVD is awful and ridiculous. Please compare Halford to Bruce Dickinson or Dave Meniketti, to name just two of the still-in-shape metal-singers-legends of the 80s! Halford looks and moves like a rusted cyborg, which would be ok, if his singing was sufficient, but it is not...not by far! Just listen to his voice performance at Electric Eye or Painkiller, you will at once throw away this DVD!

I was ready to turn the DVD off after the first few songs because he sounded pretty bad and drowned out by the band, but by the time \\"Judas Rising\\" rolls around it's as if the old Rob has returned. I actually think he does a good job with the high notes; it's some of the normal lyrics that sound rough. But by the time we get to \\"Victim Of Changes,\\" all that is forgotten. And as usual, KK and Glen and the rhythm section don't miss a lick!

(Lots of things we cannot learn from books. That's why schools have teachers.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"simplistic","review":"You can't learn TM from a book and to give people the idea that you can just shows ignorance of it. It requires careful step by step instruction from a teacher over a period of days.

The book is really a disservice more than a service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"He writes well enough, and he tries to be objective, but he clearly doesn't have a deep understanding of what he is writing about.

Looking at it that way, its quite good and accomplishes what it set out to do. Bozza has met Eminem various times and starts off each chapter with a meeting of Eminem before going on to describing something else (like how hip-hop originated) for a few pages then getting back on how Eminem affected that.Not a bad book but definitely not a bio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dull account of the social impact of Eminem","review":"This is a tough read. If you wanted an interesting book about Eninem's rise to popularity and behind the scenes dirt on how Dr Dre discovered and nurtured his raw talent, then don't buy this one because this book has NONE OF THAT! Instead, every chapter is a dry account of how Eminem's music affects American society, media and culture. Really dull stuff. He even manages to make the history of rap sound boring. I've read 18 books this year but could not get through this one. The author writes for Rolling Stone and it shows... If you've ever picked up a copy of Rolling Stone and were bored to tears by the over analyzation of music and its social impact, track-by-track, then don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars purely for the photos","review":"After getting this book for Christmas, I was really looking forward to reading it, but kept putting it off. And guess what? I hated it. OK, I suppose I was expecting more of a biography about Eminem. This went into what happened before Eminem came onto the scene, including talking about Elvis, and more hip-hop music. You do however have some good photos, and some interviews with Eminem, as the interviewer travelled about with him. These were good, but there was too much inbetween the good bits, to warrant a higher rating. I will admit also, that I ended up skipping A LOT of pages, until I was skipping so many pages, that I gave up altogether, just after the second set of photos.Don't go out and buy this, seriously, it is not worth it. I definitely want a new, proper Eminem biography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow! This is shockingly bad!","review":"I bought this CD because I thought it would be interesting to hear Harry S. Truman's amateur piano playing, which I expected the modern professional musicians who made this album were going to jazz up with accompaniment. Instead, the people who made this CD got \\"artistic\\" and did all kinds of weird things with sound effects. I'm sure \\"Give 'em hell\\" Harry would be giving these people hell for making an unlistenable album using his playing, which was probably not meant for public consumption in the first place. This CD is truly, shockingly bad. I do listen to tracks 1 and 3 occasionally because you can at least make out Truman's piano playing in those tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hold your horses - look back for a while!","review":"It's very clear that something happened to ZZ Top after releasing the ground breaking \\"Eliminator\\". On that album, ZZ Top did it more or less naturally but since it became such a huge success, they couldn't let go. ZZ Top have two separate directions - the pre-Eliminator when they were a great blues band making excellent music, and then there's the modern ZZ Top trying too hard to make another \\"Eliminator\\". I would prefer if the little band from Texas took some time to look in the review mirror - maybe they'd discover what made them special in the first place. \\"Antenna\\" may not be an awful album but it sure can't compete with anything before \\"Eliminator\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Their Style Wears A Bit Thin","review":"I had a decent impression on this CD upon the first couple of listens. However, over time this collection of tunes seemed quite drab as most of the songs just sound a like. Pincushion, Lizzard Life, and possibly the title track offer some catchy riffs. However, over the course of fifty plus minutes, little new is explored. I respect ZZTop for attempting to return to their blues/rock roots and opposed to putting out another synthesizer based recording. However, the energy level is not what it was when thee guys first stsarted out, so all that one has with this CD is a plodding sluggish collection of basic three chord rock tunes."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZ Boring Top","review":"ZZ Top is so stuck in the 80's Afterburner days. This is nothing but same tired sound they sold out with in the 80's. Synth driven heavy overdubbed.

Every song is a classic, one of the few cd's that I can still throw in and not touch a button other than volume.

Starting with a foundation of hard, gritty beats and dialogue samples from kung fu movies, RZA kept things minimalistic, but added just enough minor-key piano, strings, or muted horns to create a background ambience that works like the soundtrack to a surreal nightmare. There was nothing like it in the hip-hop world at the time, and even after years of imitation, Enter the Wu-Tang still sounds fresh and original.

I've always been a fan of old school kung fu movies so seeing them adapt it to their rap personnas is very cool. I've heard some of their solo releases (Method Man, Ghost Face Killah etc..)

The beats were grimy, dark and dusty, the lyrics were ahead of it's time with metaphors and flows each distinctive from each other. Tracks like proteck ya neck, tha mystery of chessboxin and C.R.E.A.M proved that this crew was gonna put new york back to the forefront and show not just the rest of america but the world what Wu-tang were about.

When was the last time you picked up a guitar, plugged it in and blew the doors of your house? Well what are you waiting for? I don't care if you've never played guitar, go get one.

I could not wait for it to be over...in fact, I do not know why I even finished watching it.I guess it was because I was watching it with other people. At one point, I actually dozed off.The characters are mostly underwritten, unbelievable (except for the kids), and unlikable caricatures who are barely even funny. Jack Black's acting is so over-the-top and hyped-up that his character quickly grows tiresome.

He's fall-on-the-floor funny and, as a true musician, he's able to convey his character's passion for rock 'n' roll with tremendous intensity. The advice you see him giving the fifth-graders in his charge is actually useful and avoids annoying cliches.Another plus is that the movie knows its rock music, recommending Yes, Rush and Led Zeppelin over modern pop.And the film's finale is awesome, complete with an ending that once again goes against movie tradition.I highly recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like it","review":"I really tried to like this movie, but it was just not happening.

I really enjoyed the idea, and of course, Jack Black. This is definently one of Mr. Black's better films in my eyes. Kind of like \\"Shallow Hall\\", this movie sends somewhat of a serious message in a comical type of way. I believe this film shows you that kids can do big things, and sometimes they are underrated. This is displayed in a catchy, humurous way that will have you laughing the whole way through. My only regret is this DVD was in my girlfriends DVD player the day we broke up and she came and got it.Unique. Catchy. Worth the buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This movie's plot deals with a no-good wannabe rock star (Jack Black, wildly overacting as usual) suddenly and by mistake taking the job of substitute teacher at a posh school (right, things like this happen all the time), and using it to teach rock music to his students (who are around 9). Most of the music is from the early 70s, so probably not even the children's parents were born when this music was made. I think the rock of that era is wildly overrated by people who happened to be in their teens at that time (it reminds me of another poor movie, Velvet Goldmine, where glam rock, a marginal movement if there was one, was treated as a major artistic achievement, a la par with Oscar Wilde!). And shouldn't each generation choose the music it wishes to be represented with?."},{"rating":"1","title":"School of Dull","review":"Honestly, I really like Jack Black, but his talents are wasted in this film. I just didn't find it funny. There were some pop culture moments that were humorous, but nothing to laugh out loud about.Maybe it's just not my type of comedy? The kids were dull. I could care less if they played really well. OK, the kids were boring. There, I said it. Let the heavens fall.Was this about kids finding a new means of self-expression a la Dead Poets Society? No, it was about Jack Black's character needing rent money. Yawn. Dull.

They are absolutely astounding! I was really hoping to see more of that in the special features, even some outtakes, considering this IS Jack Black.Unscripted, he's as confusing to me as Robin Williams.

Why not? Not up to a five-star standard, even though I really liked it personally. It had a good mix of music, humor, and emotion, but it just wasn't up to par.The soundtrack is decent, especially if you are a Classic Rock lover like myself. Many references to AC/DC and some to other classic acts.It seems like a watered down \\"Sister Act 2\\" -- in acting, in drama, in sound. Not bad, just not as good as it could have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Movie Ever Made","review":"I used to think Jack Black was annoying. I hated High Fidelity with a passion (and still do) and ruined my opinion of Black for years. Being a person who works with kids and music, I obviously found something appealing about School of Rock's trailor and decided that I needed to give him another chance. After seeing it twice in the theaters, I just might be Jack Black's biggest fan. I think this movie was written for me...or people like me. I'm not sure if I can really be your friend if you don't like this movie.

He is given the space he needs to go rampant with his wild antics of rockacious fortitude; Like Robin Williams as an auction caller. He is able to show his dramatic capabilities as well, along with many hilarious quip's of sarcasm. I haven't laughed that hard and continuous in any movie that I can remember. Comedic Value?

I thought it would be a stupid and weird movie but when a friend brought it over, I watched it to be polite and to say it quite frankly, it rocked! Wow, was I surprised but it was some great fun and good laughs.The movie is about a rock star who is mad becuase he gets kicked out of his group. He then after getting a phonecall, takes a job as a substitute teacher for 5th graders. And when he learns that they can play musical instruments, he trains them to compete in a competiton where he hopes to beat his old band. The movie is quite simply fuuny and is also just really fun. You'll like all of the kids but you'll especially like Jack Black who was great. This is no brainer rent and a worthy buy as it's fuuny, interesting and really cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Implausible, but great fun.","review":"I doubt this movie was meant to be taken as a slice of life. If it was, it certainly didn't work at that level. I took it as more of a fable about loving something deeply and how that love could affect the lives of others. The Jack Black character wasn't very good at what he did (That song he \\"wrote\\" for the kid band was hilariously bad; kind of like Black Sabbath meets Jethro Tull at a crack house), but his passion for rock gave his life a spark despite his admitted mediocrity. You couldn't help but root for the man. I also liked the way the film tried to give the kids a little more character than the average movie of this type. The adult scenes didn't work as well, but I did like the part where the buttoned-down principal and Ned were talking in the van. Her explanation about the pressures of adult life and what they can do to you were spot on.The music, of course, was the star, especially if you were around when it all started. A little nostalgia never hurt anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those who love to rock....","review":"This film convinced me that Jack Black is a multi-talented person.

For those who love to rock......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked the music but not the acting","review":"I liked the music a lot because I'm a classic rock fan and Jack Black was really good too. My ONLY problem with the movie was that the kids in the movie were obviously not professional actors (except for one kid - the little smart girl that wanted to be in charge of everything - she seemed to have acting skills). Anyway, I saw all the extras on the DVD and it explained that these kids (I'm not sure if it's all of them) are musicians, not actors. Well, that's the problem. The children were bland and unexciting at times. Otherwise, this is a great movie for kids and adults (especially adults that love classic rock). Kids will probably love this movie. My rating: B-"},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended viewing for all teachers...","review":"Dewey Finn (Jack Black) is a passionate musician that is dumped by the band that he once started and is in financial quandary as he cannot pay the rent. Desperately Dewey assumes the name of his roommate and accepts a job as a substitute elementary school teacher for the states best private school. However, Dewey has no interest in teaching, until he finds out that the students are exceptionally skilled with a number of musical instruments. This leads to Dewey to initiate a secret school project that includes playing and learning about rock music. School of Rock is an interesting comedy that displays how an exceptional teacher must love what he or she is teaching in order to engage his or her students. Linklater grabs the audience in a very uplifting cinematic experience, which is full of wonderful jokes and shenanigans. This film should be recommended viewing for teachers as it can salvage their desire to teach and help youth."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for me","review":"I ordered this movie before seeing it at the theaters or on dvd.

In the genre of \\"wronged adult apparent loser molds group of kids into a winning team\\", School of Rock is actually exceptional for its emphasis on heart, self-expression, and excellence as their own rewards. A good movie to watch with your kids, and talk about regarding school.

Jack Black is at his best in this movie and is garunteed to make you laugh. And Joan Cusack plays an almost equally hillarious role of a strict priciple of a private school. I especially recomend this movie to fans of Jack Black or fans of clasical rock music. The soundtrack is amazing featuring bands like Led Zepplin, The Doors, and AC/DC. I think that everyone should own this movie and I would highly suggest this to everyone looking for a good time."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie was great!","review":"I am really glad that Jack Black made this movie because it was great and he was great in it.

Now, after watching School of Rock, I'm a Jack Black fan, too!A down-on-his-luck former rocker (Mr. Black) desperately needs money. Gets a call from a prep school, saying they're in great need of a subsitute. Dewey takes the name of his friend, Ned (who is a sub) and he's off to teach...a fifth grade class. But he doesn't want to teach at all. He'd rather rock...and bring the kids into it, too!School of Rock is totally original, hilarious, and entertaining. I'd love to see it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Schooled by Jack","review":"I thought this was a surprisingly good movie. Jack Black plays his enthusiastic rock and roll self, much better I think than his older attempts at romantic lead or cynic. His unique take on most topics contrasted well with the preppy fifth-graders he was matched with. I thought the chemistry of all of the characters was great, and that Joan Cusack was great as the principal. Definitely time wellspent in the theater."},{"rating":"2","title":"JACK BLACK IS CUTE AND THE KIDS ARE EVEN CUTER","review":"Pretty much a normal Jack Black vehicle, but for the element of kids and opening the world of music to them and all the positive, life affirming changes that are a result of this musical education. Black is very good (for what it is) in this role. In the back story in special features, the director said he wrote this for Jack Black, specifically. Very few actors could have done as good in this part as Black. In real life, Black is an accomplished musician, and, I believe a nice guy that is still a kid at heart. That really comes across in this movie. And there are laughs. And the music is good. This movie is not, necessarily, a long term keeper, but I liked watching it and I would watch it again knowing I would like it again. I recommend it. GOOD JOB JACK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining despite kids","review":"Normally, I can't stand films with cute kids. This is an exception, largely because the cuteness factor is played down.

Being the mother of 4 boys, I am appalled at the author's twisted point of view regarding not only the bride, but her family as well. Having been the mother of 2 grooms already, I can say that this is a misrepresentation of how most mothers feel when thier sons get married. Perhaps the author should have spent more time getting to know her daughter -in -law and less time resenting her while writing this book. For the Mother of the Groom is full of poor advice and poorer etiquette. For example, Ms. Martin reminds us that \\"your son can have more than one wife, but only one mother\\". Perhaps the author should reread her own work and consider the feelings of those she has most certainly alienated by writing it. The only way I would recommend this book would be as an example of how NOT to behave as the mother of a groom."},{"rating":"1","title":"failing to see the humor","review":"I purchased this book awhile back at a bridal show.

Nor do I recall needing to \\"lighten up\\" about my son's wedding. This book leads the reader to believe that the marriage of your son is a \\"loss\\" , and that it is appropriate to feel resentful toward the bride and her family. That simply isn't true. I would advise that the mother of the groom spend her money on something other than this book because the price and the time you'll spend reading this are just not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"For all Mother's of Sons!!","review":"I never knew that when your son gets married it is a totaly male experience, even for the Mother of the Groom!

I will be in line to return this book when the post office opens tomorrow. It is written like a poem that has no meaning, no entertainment or informational value - well, actually no value what so ever. I wouldn't spend 50 cents on this book if I found it at a garage sale - so you can conclude that it is not worth 20.99 as a paperback book. Under no circumstances would I recommend this waste of paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the Mother of the Groom","review":"I loved this book!!!!!! It is fun, thoughtful and real. Easy reading. Anyone who doesn't like it, is taking everything far tooooo seriously. I buy one for every Mother of the Groom. It really is the only thing that is just for her! I saw the author do an interview on WFMZ in Allentown.PA. The interviewer was a bride to be and highly recommended the book as well and said she understood her own soon to be Mother of the Groom because she read the book. My good friend has three duaughters and said that she will be a better Mother of the Bride because she read the book. Thanks for writing it!Soon to be the Mother of the Groom or as we are called MOG, Camden, NJ"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad but true","review":"I was gifted this book when my first son was married and the 'two key phrases' you will read about in this book have carried me through 5 years of that marriage now. Since then, I have purchased this book for many friends with sons getting married to prepare them for their new role as MOG = mother of the groom. The book is written 'tongue in cheek' but makes many good points, an easy read over lunch, but something you may read over and over again during wedding day preparations. I have known several FOG's = father of the groom who have read this book too, some more then once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional recording - full marks to all concerned","review":"Do not listen to any unfavourable reviews of this album - it is simply one of the best of its kind.The violin, recorder, cornett, mute cornett, dulcian,lute, harpsichord and cello playing is first rate, imaginative and daring. All of the music on this recording is wonderfully alive and vibrant. The violin playing is particularly good and the two mute cornetts and dulcians in the Riccio Sonata A 4 make soft and sensual sounds - unlike anything you'll ever hear from later Baroque music.Every lover of Early Baroque instrumental music should investigate this fabulous disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Il Gardino Armonico Viaggio Musicale","review":"Magnificent, the arrangement and interpretation!

Brilliant writing style but it plays too loose with the facts.

I therefore found myself doubting a good deal of the facts, and especially the anecdotes, presented thereafter. And the pitch by pitch recounts of entire innings of playoff games is like \\"being murdered by a glacier\\", in the author's own words.

The synth is very lame. Everyone that has reviewed this disc seems to be so impressed with this guy's speed. I'm not. Speed is not impressive if that's all you have to rely on. I think Mr. Big proved that when they used a specially rigged power drill. Tone, taste, and structure is everything and this player lacks the first two. A couple of stars for a few momentary points of interest. I know this will not be popular position and I will be the lone descenting opinion, but as a guitar player myself I really didn't find much of interest on this whole disc. Listen before you fork out an import ransom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost unbelievable - but get the domestic CD","review":"I'm not sure why Amazon only lists the import (which, as far as I can tell is identical to the U.S. version). What a wonderful disc this is! Of course the muscianship is next to unbelievable but what separates Shawn Lane from say, Steve Vai or Joe Satriani is that he's really well rounded (no pun intended). He can play keyboards and drums and he can write really beautiful, joyous tunes--not just pentatonic shred/blues-rock that impresses for an instant & then is forgotten.Shredders won't be disappointed however as Shawn Lane actually plays faster than Paul Gilbert or John Petrucci. In fact his speed would be almost a self-parody if the songs weren't so interesting and cool. He's not in a league with Allan Holdsworth (who is) but if you like Eric Johnson and you know who Michael Schenker is and you want to hear melodies, not just riffs, this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underappreciated","review":"I'm from Memphis, his hometown, and had the pleasure of seeing Shawn live and talking with him briefly between sets. He was at a small local club, playing mostly cover tunes, which he enlivened by his amazing abilities. It's a shame he didn't receive more accolades and more high-profile gigs. A gifted and talented man but apparently a somewhat tortured soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Master Shines","review":"Any guitarist who thinks Shawn Lane lacks musical credibility should hang it up. Lane's critics always cite his speed, which is awesome, when taking shots at him. I here little about his stellar note selection and overall musicianship--the two qualities that made him famous. Powers of Ten Live demonstrates Lane is one of the best musicians of my generation, who, for whatever reason, never received the interest he deserved. Top-notch musicians know this guy was a special talent. Shawn plays most of the songs on the CD almost exactly as he did on the original Powers of Ten. The guitar tone is kind of dark. I would have liked it if the guitar was a little brighter and louder in the mix, but the recording still sounds good. There is minimal audience noise on the CD, which I'm very thankful for. You won't find a better player to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"An important contribution to Siam and Satow studies","review":"This book affords a rare opportunity to see the hinterland of Siam (Thailand) through the eyes of the notable 19th century British diplomat, Sir Ernest Satow (1843-1929).

Hail the Buddha! Diximus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"This book presents a basic knowledge of fertility, and nothing you can't learn on the internet or probably already know. Most of it is common sense. Some of the advice is inapplicable or not always correct - for example it says that OPK's are 95% reliable, when I have yet to get a true positive. It says that Cervical Fluid is a poor indicator of upcoming ovulation, however many women find it is incredibly reliable. I got very little out of this book. Recommend Taking Charge of Your Fertility instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fastest Way to Get Pregnant Naturally","review":"Lots of good information about how to get pregnant fast! Very easy to understand and use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Dr. Williams' book provides little more than an eighth-grade level introduction to the male and female reproductive systems. If you have even a BASIC knowledge of what your and your partner's parts do, you needn't waste your time on this book. If you are truly interested in the best way to go about conceiving you should read Taking Charge of Your Fertility by Toni Wechsler. Her book is far more informative and explains how to monitor your own fertility signs to best improve your chances of achieving pregnancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't recommend","review":"This book contained much of the same information as some of the other books, however it was not as easy to read.

It outlines common sense theories and the basics of the reproductive system. To those with any basic knowledge however, it is a waste of time and money ... \\"So tell me something I don't know.\\" If you have read \\"Taking Charge of Your Fertility\\" by Toni Weshcler, you may even find it offensive as the author completely negates the importance of the use of charting basal body temperatures and the relevance of cervical fluid.

I strongly recommend \\"Taking Charge of Your Fertility\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource","review":"This book was helpful and informative. It is very straightforward and suggests the best way to get pg through the latest medical research. I am also appreciative that he put a section in about selecting the sex of your baby.

This pales in comparison to the details of the other. This book is VERY basic and is probably nothing new if you've talked with any doctor or gotten on the internet. To sum it up this book is about nutrition and sex often...and we all know those basics. I rated it a 2 because it does at least discuss reasons for infertility. But, if your not getting pregnant within 3 months anyway, it is still good to discuss this with your doctor, so you don't waste valuable time. I would have if I'd have waited 1 year like this book suggests. The other book enabled me to begin charting and it saved me from wasting a year of trying to get pregnant!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the fastest way to get discouraged, naturally","review":"This book was the first I purchased on the subject of fertility, and while it did provide me with information, it also discouraged my hopes of getting pregnant. I came away from the book with the idea that both aspiring parents must be in superb physical condition in order to become pregnant; and if the woman is over 35 the chances are between slim and none. After reading other books and talking to other over-35 women (none of whom were in 'peak' condition) I got a more encouraging view of the situation. Armed with a different perspective I did spend some time rereading sections of Dr. Williams' book and found it less disheatening. This book might be best for someone who has already done some research on fertilty; I would not recommend it as the first read on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought this book and promptly chucked it!","review":"This book gives some good basic information on conception, but frankly Taking Charge of Your Fertility by Toni Weschler was far more informative and useful. If you know the basics, this is not the book for you. If you don't know the basics, there are much better, more comprehensive books out there that will be of more assistance to you. If you have any fertility issues, this book is definitely NOT for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the fastest way? Mostly a common sense list","review":"There really is not any new information in this book. It seems to be mostly a list of do's (eat right) and don'ts (no drugs). I was looking for some novel ways to improve chances of conception, and there are really none. I have another book, Trying Again, and the focus is on emotional and physical concerns of couples who have lost a pregnancy or baby, and that book also has all the same facts on how to conceive as this one. The only thing I really like about this book is that is has a chart listing the quantity of caffeine in various beverages and foods. Overall, I think the title of this book is misleading. There is nothing in this book that I can add to what we have already been doing and what we have already learned from other free sources (like patient handouts at the doctor's office - it is all there). Considering his big tip is to use an ovulation predictor kit, you should probably save the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative and easy to read!!","review":"As the parents of two children, 11 and 7, we decided we wanted another child, I had no idea how to plan getting pregnant, I hadnt planned it the two previous times, I was just pregnant!

Even when I turn the toasting level as high as it will go, the bread barely gets brown at all and dries out terribly. In my opinion, its a hotness issue. This toaster doesnt get anywhere near hot enough to toast the bread brown in a single toasting cycle. Sure, I could toast everything twice, but then the dryness gets worse. I WISH this toaster actually made toast as it should, but it just doesnt. If you like your toast not brown at all, and/or dry to the point of shattering when you bite it, this may be the toaster for you. I like my toast dark on the outside, and still at least somewhat bread-like on the inside. So disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"The toaster looks great, but I think I got a klinker because it seems to toast in bagel mode even when I haven't selected that mode.

It is taut and exciting; sharp-eared aficionados might notice a few precursors to \\"Star Wars\\", too, particularly in the action cues.

As with all Immortal, this release doesn't have one bad song on it. The sound on this one isn't as killer as the later albums, but don't think it's so bad that you listen to it and can't make out anything in the songs. The logo Immortal had in the beginning was better also, and I think the cover of this one was just plain evil looking. No artwork, but Immortal look like they were in the middle of a dark forest near some gothic looking structure right out of a horror movie set in Transylvania. Important for diehard fans to have and also anyone who wants to hear what this great band sounded like in the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different from Later Work","review":"This album was recorded before Immortal decided to play as fast as possible (resulting in the guitarist having to retire early) so it really stands out from the rest of the inventory. Although much slower than Immortals mid-career music, I find it to be very well written and preformed. I can't say the same about the music video they made for one of the songs. As in all the early releases, Abbath plays the Bass instead of Guitar. This was another album that I had a hard time taking out of my cd player. The invention of the MP3 player really made me happy.

His latest achievement and perhaps his greatest is his translation of the Chumash, the five Books of Moses.In these essays he writes with great skill of the giants Agnon and Kafka, and of more modern Israeli writers Oz, Yehoshua .This is a valuable work for anyone who truly takes interest in Jewish, Israeli Hebrew Literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Runs Large","review":"I bought the large for my 40 lb.

The central character wasn't very appealing, and acted like a jerk a lot of the time (he's 50-something and complimented himself for restraint in not having sex with an underage teenage girl; plus his interactions with police were pretty juvenile).

It didn't require much thought process, didn't make you analyze the characters or events, it just droned on and on about sexual encounters and a few killings. I didn't finish it because it was that engrossing, it was more like turning each page just because I wanted it to end already. There was no development of any of the other characters except Sherry, which isn't that interesting of a character in the first place. The plot jumped around and in most times almost seemed forced. Sherry and Payne's relationship had no chemistry aside from sexual. How did they even manage to fall in \\"love\\"? This book was predictable and felt like an old slice of bad pizza.

Good heatsinks typically utilize a smooth copper plate which makes contact with the CPU. Heatsinks and CPU surfaces should be as smooth as possible to maximize surface contact.

Now it's almost silent.","review":"I bought this to replace the noisy 3-pin stock fan on my Socket AM2 system.All the reviews said this was a very quiet and affordable 3-pin fan, even at full load. I thought I would need a 4-pin CPU fan to utilize PWM fan control to keep things quiet, but decided to give this one a shot.Installation was very easy, especially if you're already familiar with installing CPU fans.Unfortunately, when I booted the system, it was rather noisy. The sound of plastic lightly hitting on something with the rotation of each fan blade at high speed.I unscrewed the fan from the heat-sink portion and punched the rotational fan portion into its fan-guard, in a frustrated attempt to locate the source of the sound (which was not visible with inspection).This maneuver completely removed the annoying sound, and now it's operating at near silence at full speed.I would have given this 5 stars if I didn't have the initial noise issue.

However, if you plan to put an extra-thick car key (like so many newer vehicles have today), don't bother. My Honda Pilot key (about 3/8\\" thick) makes the case hard to snap shut and sticks out the bottom of the case about an inch or so. Because of the thickness you can't put it directly on the clip ring but have to use an intermediary ring. Except for this, all my other keys that I use regularly fit well in the case. I should have considered the Anello zippered key case, also made by Dionigi."},{"rating":"1","title":"juvenille writing","review":"I bought this expecting to like it. I agree with much of his politics, I loved his \\"no war\\" message during the academy awards and in general agree with him. However, he sounds better in soundbites than in a book. His writing is juvenille/dumbed - down. Maybe he thinks everyone is stupid - and not just white men. While on the subject what's up with the retarded title. Maybe he feels guilty about being a white man and feels compeled to \\"suck up\\" to every non white male. The book would have been better in an essay or a long magazine article. But not much substance or credible facts backing his opinions."},{"rating":"2","title":"You're enjoyment will depend on why you buy it...","review":"This book makes lots of assumptions and critisims about pretty much everything that happened during and shortly after the 2000 election. It dates itself a bit what with the events of the day, but also serves to remind us of how outraged we SHOULD have been about the events in our country during that time period and how liitle we did about it. It makes me realize how powerless we have allowed ourselves to become in our own country.I didn't buy this book to substantiate any of my political views, I bought it because I think Michael Moore is funny and I wish there were more people who weren't afraid to say what they think right or wrong, whether it goes against the grain or not.This book delivers. Minus one star because many of the conclusions drawn are unsubstantiated, but otherwise very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"woooweeee!","review":"This is the first book I've read by Michael Moore and I definitely will read more from this talented, pointedly funny author.Nothing is safe from Moore's poisioningly honest pen, his jabs are accurate and painful.

Moore's book, though somewhat quaintly dated in its pre-9/11 perspective, is right on target with Bush and the state of the oppressive Right.The conservatives have always been more organized, better armed, and more filled with vitriol than the Left, and Moore is helping to change this. I see a change coming. Get ready, all you Fundies... the Left is a rising force in this nation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read this only if your IQ is below 12","review":"I research a lot of work regarding political positions for the Democratic Party in our area. This book is the work of an angry individual who basically ignores the facts and presents his arguments based on the most preposterous assumptions. It is sad to see the decline of intelligent discourse in the United States. This piece doesn&#65533;t help our cause at all. As a life-long Democrat I&#65533;m really embarrassed at the lack of substance in this book. I think we are going to lose the election based on this apparent anger.

Unfortunately, it seems that the author spends a couple hundred pages ranting and raving but doesn't really give us any options to solve the problem. And he is very \\"mean\\" in his presentation. The information is good and helpful, it is just hard to \\"wade through\\" all of the outragous mud slinging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required reading....","review":"This book is so important and relevent to our times, that if I were a college professor I would place this book in the required book list, even if I taught physics! We need to know how our society functions (not only for our well-being for the planet's well-being as well), and it's sad that people living across the Atlantic (in the UK) watching their BBC news are more knowledgeable about the US than we are (which is why I watch the BBC news).After reading this book you'll be shocked, entertained and disgusted all at once. But you'll be glad you picked it up.I'll just say that this book (along with the film Bowling for Columbine) should be a wake up call to all Americans. No, I am not a hippie or greenpeace activist, I am just a regular citizen that wants to know the truth, and this book will do that for you. If you only purchase one book this year let this one be it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even Good Propaganda","review":"This book comes off as the ramblings of socialist who truly is out in \\"left field\\". Good propaganda should at least try to be convincing. I found his arguments devoid both of reality and humor. The far left may enjoy this book, and I mean far left. For everyone from moderate-liberals to ultra-conservatives (who aren't much different) this is a testament of how out of touch with reality the far left end of the spectrum can be.\\"Stupid White Men\\" really is as far as you need to read. It goes down hill from there. One race of stupid people to blame for all the problems of the nation? That sounds familiar...maybe he's a closet fascist? It's that same kind of mean-spirited whining that goes through the entire book that we are supposed to find \\"funny\\". Good propaganda should at least try to sway people to its way of thinking. Moore is just silly, divisive, mean-spirited and quite frankly...boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice autobiography","review":"Moore is the epitome of political correctness.

Should be fascinating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written but utterly wrong","review":"In this book you will find an entertaining and well written explanation of what's wrong with America. In short, Michael Moore thinks America is in a sorry condition because too many people actually believe in things like interpreting the consitution based on the original intent of the authors, the value of traditional values, the blessings of individual (rather than collective) liberty, and all the other factors that have made America a great nation. Mr Moore never seriously addresses these issues, preferring to make his case by character assaults instead. He may well be correct in some of his well written and engaging details, but he fails to see that order requires law, that liberty means inequality in economic outcome, and that the real source of our America's problems is a crisis of character fed by the leftist assault on our culture and institutions. Mr. Moore's book is another salvo in that assault, fired from the wrong side."},{"rating":"2","title":"The truth. Finally.

Even if you don't agree with all, you can gain a lot of surprising insights from this book. Plus, you'll get a good laugh. It's all well-documented with complete foot notes for each chapter.The humor part is important because the information in this book is so depressing, you'd be crying otherwise. Instead, the book inspires you not to believe every thing they hear (especially fom the democrats) and (...) and do something. Among other things.I'm recommending this book to everyone I know. It's an important read with elections coming up this fall."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least he got the title right","review":"I can't help but wonder if Moore was thinking about himself when he was considering the title of this book.Here's a suggestion for anyone considering buying this book: save a tree instead. Mr. Moore's embarrassing rantings at the Academy Awards revealed he's full of bluster without substance, and has no intellectual grasp of the issues. I think it's appalling that some so-called celebrities take advantage of the public platforms like the Academy Awards and inappropriately use them to voice their pseudo-intellectualism on all things political. Give it a rest.And by the way, Mr. Moore...you're really bad at math. There were A LOT more people (than 5, as you proclaimed) booing you off the stage at the Awards, not to mention the countless thousands of TV viewers across America. Your time is up...and hopefully your career is over, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"racist , sexist book","review":"If Moore disagrees with government policy, he should be intelligent and say what he disagrees with and why. But he is a hyprocrite who claims to detest racism and sexism, but is guilty of it in relying on race and gender for his insults (white men). If he checked his stupid anger, he'd see our administration had Karen Hughes, Condi Rice, Colin Powell -- not all white or all men. He is a lowbrow, hate-filled rabble-rouser in need of a kick in the butt."},{"rating":"1","title":"***** Way to go Michael *****","review":"As a Lebanese citizen who is not much into politics, I saw the book with a friend so i took a peak on some of the contents inside. Couldn't wait for the next morning to buy me a copy. As a result, I finished reading it in three working days (It usually takes me at least 2-3 weeks to finish a book). Once you start with reading it, you can't stop. Stupid White Men is one of the most entertaining and full-of-facts book. It should be nominated \\"book of the decade\\".

However, after purchasing this book I can see that Michael only wants to become the Rush Limbaugh of the Liberals., spouting the same old rhetoric as if there is a difference between the two parties.

I opened this book thinking that all my questions would be answered regarding the current political atmosphere using information that could be backed up. The info Mr. Moore provided was interesting, but the book is written in an almost \\"tabloid\\" fashion. I need facts. I rated this with 4 stars because the book does make you think.

We thought it would make for some interesting discussion, especially after viewing \\"Bowling For Columbine\\". Instead, we could barely make it through Michael's incessant whining. Although at times you can see his feeble attempts at humor, you ask yourself constantly what's his point. He offers no solutions but has a great ability to rant like a manic-depressive off their meds.The kicker was his comments on Cynthia McKinney. At that point, he lost 100% of our respect. We decided it was time for a ceremonial book burning to rid ourselves of this inane writing.The worst thing is that we actually purchased the books and gave him $$ to continue pumping out this crap.Don't waste your time unless you have ample time to waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"Another irrational diatribe guised in the veil of reason.

Or better yet, donate it to something that you *don't* believe in. You might get an idea of how taxpayers feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need more like it","review":"Very timely book. So much of what Moore comments on is just plain common sense. Many of his points are things that over the last 16 months many of us have kept to ourselves.

Bush has caused in two years. As a 14 year old who has generally liberal views, I was shocked and surprised at all the evidence. Not only did this book reassure my beliefs but left me PRAYING he doesnt get re-elected. Mr. Moore has delivered it all. He shows us how Bush and his corrupt \\"honorary white men\\" have corrupted the elections system, ruined our environment, ruined public relations, and have continued to discriminate against minorities. Although this book was great, it was very disturbing. Most of the content was sad and very true. The more people who read this book, the more aware we will all become. All in all, this book was SUBERB and should be read by ALL! Please dismiss the bad reviews and purchase this book. If I may add one more thing, GOOD work to Mr. Moore for his title. It certainly caught my eyes!BUY IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mike is the S.W.M","review":"The book begins with a rant and how he rants!!!

I watched Moore on Foxnews and his comment about Bush's approval rating, high at the time (yes, Moore was likely high from [stuff] at the time too).. his comment: \\"Well, the pollsters are intimidated so they rate Bush highly..\\" Such is his book, which I read recently. There are few facts or evidence for his points. It's written by an angry, bitter man, that much is evident. Moore would have had them recount ONLY Florida... and Democratic countires in FL at that. The hell with the rest of the nation and close-called states... so he thinks. Like I said, people resort to name-calling when they are out out of truths."},{"rating":"1","title":"Autobiography?","review":"After reading this book, I'm suprised that Moore didn't save the title \\"Stupid White Men\\" for his autobiography. The book simply complains about everything, while offering no solutions to any of the presented problems, and only attempts to [fool] the reader into believing that the U.S. is the worst country in the world, inhabitated by the worst people in the world. Worse, his writing skills are ficticious at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wildly Overrated","review":"Remember that kid in high school that was full of angst, angry at the unfairness of the world and telling anybody who'd listen about how sucky his life was? Never really doing anything to make it better, but griping nonstop?Imagine that kid all grown up and, considered a spokesman for the disenfranchised (though he's now wealthy), still telling anyone who'll listen, spewing it onto a page and considering it literature, or, God forbid, \\"advice\\" on how to improve the state of the world.This book makes me ashamed to be a liberal. Save your money and subscribe to a newspaper, so you can get your facts straight, instead of the re-hashed, re-spun poser nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny, but racist","review":"This perhaps autobiographical work by Moore is packed full of wonderful sarcasm and clever double entendres, but his arguments lack any proof or substance, and the book contains one factual error after another. More disturbing is Moore's bleak picture of White America which portrays whites as inherently evil and racist. One can't help but wonder if the author includes himself among this wretched group. For someone who views Americans as \\"possibly the dumbest people on Earth\\", it looks like Moore has found the perfect audience for his craft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humor with bite and truth","review":"I bought this book yesterday and have been unable to put it down! Actually, it just confirms what I had known already. ... How can we know all these facts and not ACT!

Hopefully the paperback version will be available soon - so everyone can buy it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"He's done it again!","review":"Michael Moore has become an icon for all people who care about ordinary Americans, the little guy who works hard trying to keep home and hearth together. His voice is a beacon of light in the dark world of the reactionary right!Moore successfully tells Americans what the truth is regarding the beliefs, motives, and actions of our 'stupid, white, men' leaders. If you care about the average American (and not just the rich and famous), if you believe in a level playing feel that supports ordinary Americans and not just the corporations and war machine, this book is for you.

Highly recomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Moore for President","review":"Way to go Mike! Michael Moore is definately saying the things that need to be said. There is a leadership vacuum in the USofA and Michael is not afraid to stand-up and ask the questions that so many in the so called Democratic party are afraid to. Mike takes the Cheney/Bush/Ashcroft crowd to task and is truly a hero to the \\"silent majority\\" in this country.Buy the book...send a message. And let Mike know that you want him to run for President. Yes, it is a long shot, but none of the current potential Democratic candidates will have the guts to take on Bush the way he needs to be taken on. Michael Moore has already proven he's willing to fight the good fight. America's working class hero against the spoiled rich kid.Let me know what you think and I will begin drafting Michael Moore and we can start building the campaign.Think about it...We've got Bush, but America needs Moore!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not funny and certainly not insightful","review":"When I read through \\"Stupid White Men\\" I kept on thinking, \\"this can't be true,\\" and I wasn't surprise to find that it isn't. Moore often misrepresents data throughout the book ... (it's easy to find out about on the web if you're interested). What makes me slightly sad is the number of reviews trying to present this book as an insightful piece of political analysis. This book egregiously fails in this aspect, as you have to have actual facts for political analysis and not submerge your writing in bombast and slogans.The only way this book could have redeemed itself was by being humorous. To me it was not, perhaps because I was so overwhelmed by Moore's shallowness and absense of truth. All so he can get his Marxist convictions across in the name of satire. The reason I gave this book two stars instead of one is that I can see why someone would find this funny (and, evidently, many people did). I, however, was not amused by Moore's misguided ramblings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book Ever","review":"As a 12 yr old living with in the extremist conservative neighborhood i had never actually liked michael moore that much until this summmer when i fell upon his book in the library. I read it twice! It was that good. It was a shocking outlook on to politics that i had never seen before now. I didnt belive it was all true. We couldn't be that bad. Could we? So i did a little bit of research and found out 98% was true.WOW!It doesnt matter what race,gender, or age you will love this book just the same"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth","review":"Michael Moore's book tells it like it is. His rants range from guns, racism, corporate greed (in other words, everything our current administration values). Being a minority, most of the things he writes in this book are not new ideas to me. He's just put them down in writing for others to read. While most people who buy this book will have some similar political views as Michael Moore, I think this book should be read by conservatives. Those are the ones that should start seeing things as they are, not as they are told. This books describes situations as they really are. My guess is that people who are offended by this book are ones who have never taken the time to consider somebody else's point of view. It's time to stop accepting things as they are told to us and open our eyes to the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sparking yet imperfect gem","review":"As a member of the Green party, I'm one of Michael Moore's biggest cheerleaders. Go Mike.Unlike a lot of conspiracy theorist rants, Moore cites all of his references from reputable, and mostly conservative, sources. This places _Stupid White Men_ in a league of its own.In the chapter \\"We're Number One\\" I learned America leads the world in oil consumption, carbon dioxide emissions, and hazardous waste production. But he doesn't just finger-point: He makes clear, and often irreverent, suggestions about how to change our world for the better.My only complaint: His hit-and-run style of prose is more suited to talk-shows than to \\"serious\\" non-fiction. I wish he spent more time developing his ideas than making his point and quickly moving on to a new target.The book is too intelligent, witty, and brutally honest to ignore. Go Mike."},{"rating":"1","title":"F&ck Michael Moore","review":"F&ck Michael Moore! He is a fat a$$ college drop out with a god complex. He takes what are very complex issues, over simplifies them, and twists them to his view point. I would recommend anyone with 1/2 a brain cell to avoid porky's trash. Buying this junk only serves to feed his paranoia and convert impressionable people to his worthless cause."},{"rating":"1","title":"Part of the problem","review":"Obviously, the Middle East isn't the only region of the world where America is hated. Michael Moore's fact-based writings might carry more credibility if he didn't mix in a huge measure of \\"fiction helper\\" in attempts to enhance them. Instead, he is part of a growing legion- both liberal and conservative- that fuels the hatred being spit out from both sides. This only serves to polarize and separate the nation as a whole, and to continue the malady of partisanship and political gridlock for which both sides are at fault. There was a time when opposite sides of the political spectrum came together to try to work their differences out for the betterment of the nation instead of using juvenile name-calling. So much for a \\"kinder, gentler America\\" in the new millennium."},{"rating":"1","title":"Babble","review":"Typical left wing BABBLE from the same school as James Carville and Paul Bagala, Moore just throws out idiotic charges with no facts to support him. But he's getting rich off the people who believe his B.S. This is a guy who loves the slimeball Clintons who nearly destroyed this country and saw nothing wrong with their sorrid perfomances and criminal acts-(oops sorry that was Ken Starrs fault). But unlike Clinton I think Moore inhaled too much. Buy a good book backed up with FACTS (SLANDER) a tool that Moore uses on every page of his hate filled book. My bird cage will not want for floor covering for awhile"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Good As Downsize This...","review":"Having been a fan of Michael Moore's brand of political satire since first seeing Roger and Me, I had high expectations for his new book. This book has got to be on a par with Canadian Bacon as one of Moore's most insipid moments. Yes, George W. stole the election, but by surrounding himself with proven statesmen, he's acquitted himself far better than Android Al ever could. Unlike Downsize This..., there's plenty of passages in Stupid White Men...and Other Sorry Excuses for the State of the Nation that just seem to ramble on without even a hint of sharp-edged wit or irony. Perhaps Mr. Moore should just consign himself to the fact that George W. is well on his way to a second term, and divert his attention elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vile liberals and their utter nonesence!","review":"I was interested in buying this product, and before I did so I found a chapter of it online. Wanting to check it out I read it- it was the chapter with Moore's facinating views on race. This chapter and the fashionable hatred of Bush that Moore [ like all those other rich, white Hollywood folks] has, convinced me that I couldn't possibly waste my money on this peice of garbage! Thank goodness I did not go through with buying this shameless peice of propaganda for the liberal wing of the entertainment industry who would destroy today's hellhole of a nation and replace it with a hellhole without personal responsibility.

I am insulted by his premise, and the title as well. Michael Moore is obivously someone who hates this country and my suggestion would be to buy the book \\"The Savage Nation\\" by Michael Savage. Dr. Savage is truly a man who loves this country and supports the roots that our country was founded on.Michael Moore, deserves to have his book used for toilet paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rape of Nanking, anyone?","review":"He LITERALLY says that white people are responsible for every bad thing in history. He blames them for slavery. Ha! It's true they did it, but they didn't invent it. It has gone on for thousands of years, and still goes on in some places, to much worse degrees and in larger numbers. And how about the Rape of Nanking? That is one of the most infamous slaughters in history (along with Tianemen Square). I'm glad I found the book \\"Why the Lef Hates America\\" by Daniel J. Flynn. The kind of people mentioned in that book fit the description of Michael Moore exactly. If he wants to \\"Kill Whitey\\", to quote one of his chapters, he should take a nice long walk off a really short pier, or go live in China. Whichever's worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm the Stupidest White Person!!!","review":"For reading this book that is! A complete waste of money. It was required for a class that I took and provided for some lively discussion. Fortunately for myself I was able to find it in a library and spared providing Michael Moore with any additional income.His endnotes are all but worthless! He documents little and places his own opinion in place of facts. While it's humorous it's sad to think that there are really people out there with the lack of individual thought that take this book seriously.If you mistake much of what's contained within this book for fact then you probably believe just about any conspiracy theory out there. Get over it! This is \\"junk science\\" at its finest.

It's the usual socialist anti-american, anti-capitalist, anti-white, anti-male [stuff] - coming from a white american male who clearly wishes he were something else. It's the typical liberal attitude of despising society because it doesn't agree with him. That eternal whining, badmouthing, politically correct filth emanating from the far left is really sickening. How about writing something positive for a change. and - if it's really so horrible here, for god's sake, move to Canada or France."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can One Man GET Any Dumber?","review":"If it were possible, I'd strongly encourage the makers of the film, DUMB & DUMBERER, to go back in time and cast Michael Moore in both roles.What I find interesting about Moore is that he's convinced that pounding his head against the wall works. It appears as if he honestly believes that, if he does it long enough and hard enough, society will eventually crumble and cower beneath what he perceives as his own gargantuan intellect ... basically just a wiseacre mind disguising Communist ideals.Still, the book would've worked if Moore had stuck to what he does best: stand-up comedy. He's downright funny when he needs to be, but, unlike the superb Dennis Miller, his words carry little weight when he's arguing the state of world affairs. Despite what he would have you believe, \\"one man does not a democracy make,\\" unless you're living on a very small island and willing to live by very limiting visions.This book is not intended for adults with a brain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh please...","review":"Moore's a sharp guy - sharp enough to produce a biting documentary \\"Bowling for Columbine\\".I sometimes agree with what he says but this is not one of them.This is a terribly-written left-wing rant at best. Those who belong in the political left should enjoy this book, but as with any agenda-ridden books like these, not terribily accurate or entertaining. Blanket, emotional statements without fact-checking is everywhere, but that's his prerogative - this is a free country. As an Asian-American, I never could really understand some white men trashing their own so much - does that make them feel like they are better than the rest of the white men like Moore does?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Misguided","review":"This book was hard to read because it was not completely factual. It omitted many facts which would have discounted much of the book. Michael Moore is an extreme leftist with the intention to bring down the Right even if he has to lie.

If he asserts this as true in thepreface, what are the chances of the rest of his information being any more factual?

It does not matter to Moore if one thing happened before another or in a different place, if tying the two together will make it seem like the government (especially republicans) are corrupt than so be it.To those who love this book, while it might make good reading, it is not a valid reference piece.

The only problem is that \\"Stupid White Men\\" is true. Mike's book is the \\"Emperor's New Clothes\\" for the new Millennium. Our leaders are cloaking themselves as the protectors of the poor and weak while they are using their influence to let corporate America fleece them.

Keep up the great work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Downsize This, but still an entertaining read","review":"Considering that many people consider Moore to be the \\"voice of liberal America,\\" I'm actually a bit disappointed with Moore's second book. It's less funny, more preachy, and less motivating than Downsize This. Much of this book's content is swiped right from his 1999-2000 TV series, \\"TV Nation.\\" Having said that, I am very glad Moore is on our side, and that people are reading his work as opposed to Fox's Coulter/O'Reilly clan. It's still an entertaining read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should be made to read this book!","review":"I read the book in about two days and was amused, shocked and educated by it.

So refreshing. Yeah, its Michael Moore, so you probably already know what its about. What's most interesting about the book is that Moore is spouting extremely depressing stuff, but manages to keep you smiling the whole time.

Everyone in this book is evil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very annoying delivery....","review":"I did not purchase this book with preconceived notions and really thought it would be entertaining, maybe even insightful. I was wrong. Mr. Moore comes across as an pseudo-intellectual malcontent who whines about the \\"State of the Nation\\", then offers up a ridiculous way to correct his perceived ills. I could understand this drivel if he had any comedic ability, but unfortunately he doesn't and his \\"punchlines\\" are highly predictable. A very entertaining book for an uninformed person with an IQ under 100...Even while leaning towards liberalism, I find very few redeeming qualities in this book. It has its moments, hence the 2 stars, but not enough to carry it.

Unfortunately, he diluted the impact of his writing by failing to distinguish between reports in the press and facts. As a trained medical scientist, that reads peer reviewed scientific literature in many disciplines, I am distressed by how often he gets it wrong by relying on reports of reports about matters that are scientific in nature. When there are so many errors in areas that I am qualified to judge, how can I believe the rest of what Moore writes?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid White Waste of Time.","review":"This book was a big disappointment.

It was total letdown.The only thing this book accomplished was to cause me to pause at any future projects by Michael Moore. Take seriously at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop the complaining and insinuations already...","review":"What I've always liked about Michael Moore's work in film and television is how he can take up a single cause, and keep an audience captivated about. In this book, he merely meanders from one point to another, often piecing together half truths and insinuations to make it out like he is taking the moral high ground. I suspect he is trying to be funny, but there are many out there who will consider his past record of accurate research, and take some of the conclusions he reaches with faulty logic as gospel. Frankly, that scares me. Now I can't tell if he has always been full of it, or if books simply are not his media."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of stereotypes and half-truths","review":"Moore seems bent on making broad generalizations about large segments of the American public, particularly if they're the conservative, church-going type. I did gain a few grains of grudging respect for him: he's an eagle scout and believes in getting involved instead of just complaining. The book is funny in parts, but mostly derisive humor, which is annoying from the left and right. And don't buy the line that this book isn't liberal and hard core left. When Moore is criticizing Clinton et al, it's for not being a true lefty. Interesting book, but I wouldn't use it as a solid argument for the left."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunning work of fiction!","review":"From WSJ (\\"Unmoored from Reality\\", 3/21/2003):In print, too, Mr. Moore plays fast and loose with the facts.

These three books were funny, informative, and allowed a bleeding-heart like me feel good about being a liberal again. \\"Stupid White Men\\" falls well below that level. While Mr. Moore hits the mark discussing the 2000 election, it seems that he's run out of things to talk about. His chapter arguing that women would be better off without men and the chapter that blames every African-American problem on white men like me, seem to be based on small ideas with merit.

The only thing I disagree with Michael is his support of abortion. I do not understand his criticism of death penalty while on the other side he supports the homicide of innocent children.

If you were bored out of your skull by these campus liberals who were terrified of being labeled racist and did everything in their power to convince you that they really did \\"dig it\\", then avoid this screed from one very angry and stupid white writer. Michael Moore tries desperately to show his contempt for conservative ideas and he over-kills his agenda. The whole tone of the book is one long piercing shriek. He doesn't just over-kill the conversative movement. He jumps on it, screaming, hollaring and then wallops it relentlessly with an axe. It's so hypocritically leftist that one could read this book as a complete hoot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the $$$","review":"...This is a biased view of the world according to Moore. Very little facts presented to substantiate the opinions or alleged facts. Not even funny. The author likes to think of himself as a bit of a comedian. I am sure he is laughing all the way to the bank with his profits from selling this book of diatribe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is it a bestseller?","review":"That is the question that it should be asked.Filled with generalities, embezzled statistics, circular references and logic borrowed from The Simpsons.If the author really thought that Bush is the greater evil, he shouldn't help the cause by voting Nader and taking votes from Gore.Can't believe the author made milions writing smtg like this but then again it won't be the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary!","review":"Many years ago, I enjoyed some of Moore's work.

If, however, you are looking for any insight, read something else. Michael Moore seems to feel that banging out his somewhat random thoughts on a keyboard is an excuse for a book. I felt that every minute I spent with his book was a minute of my life wasted.

It is a shame that this country is being brainwashed by this insane left wing fanatic. I can't wait for Bush to win the 2004 election so I can rub it in his face that he is a lying, manipulative extremist (ironically, what he \\"claims\\" Bush is) out to destroy everything that makes America America. Don't buy this garbage and support this nut. Thank God, I didn't (think library)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liberal polemics","review":"One would think from the title that this is an autobiogrphy. It should have been. The argumentations presented are self-contradictory, as they assume some standard of values while all the while rejecting the world-view that provides for the preconditions of rationally justifying said values. Moore offers arbitrary opinions predicated on his personal predilections.

It reads as if Moore got angry one day at the state of affairs in American politics and put his thoughts down in an undisciplined fashion- childish insults, exaggerations, and all.

This book reads like an angry rant from a bad stand-up comic. Moore slings schoolyard insults, describing Republicans as \\"stupid\\" and Democrats as \\"wimpy [and] spineless\\" (p. 10), and rivals Coulter in the sloppy-research department..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent Facts, Distateful Style","review":"I was very pleasantly surprised with all of Mr. Moores documentation. I think he did a great job on that, but must the delivery be so crude. I got the sense that Mr. Moore's ego is more important to him than the facts he is writing about. I do not consider him one bit funny. He merely detracts from some very important issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michael Moore Stupid White Men","review":"The lowest possible form of humor, gender bashing, people bashing, culture bashing, all I suspect to raise his sense of self-esteem, which must be extremly low.

I largly enjoyed this book as well. However, as with his movie \\"Bowling for Columbine\\" it is subject to hyperbole and slightly distorted facts. By and large, though, it is a totally entertaining book that makes many good points (i.e. the 2000 election and right-wing \\"Democrats\\") as well as a few points that he doesn't back up enough (there are a few statistics that come to mind). And for those of you who would recomend \\"Slander\\" over this book, I recomend you read Al Franken's \\"Lies and the Lying Lairs Who Tell Them\\" or at least Chapers 2 and 3. That'll shut you up about Ann Coulter."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST READ","review":"This book is amazing... I just starting reading it and can't put it down.. The book is thought provoking and funny at the same time.. Read this book, and pass it on to your friends... The US needs more people that are educated on what our tax dollars support.. I also highly reccomend his latest movie \\"Bowling for Columbine\\"... A must see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Misguided","review":"Being a huge fan of Michael Moore, and a proudly independent voter, I was nonetheless disappointed with this book, and must vehemently disagree with the positions taken. This respectable director has unfortunately fallen prey to the one-sided political view of a left-wing Hollywood crowd. Those who would cheer upon reading these pages are nothing less than ignorant of both the vision of the current administration and the blatant hypocrisy of liberal American politics. The bottom line is that Mr. Moore does not correctly portray American issues, neither in domestic nor world affairs. This reviewer hopes that this author will soon see the forest for the trees, and honestly use his given talents as a tool for a better world. America deserves better, and Michael Moore possesses the talent to provide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Factually inaccurate and grossly distorted","review":"This book is an unmitigated piece of trash. I read more than half and then just skimmed the rest because I couldn't justify wasting the time to complete it. The book clearly is based in very poor research (footnotes indicate he has used very few if any primary, authoritative sources), and gross distortions and misapprehensions of fact. This book is an embarrassment to liberal causes since it is so obviously flawed in so many ways. Rather than promote points of view Moore undermines them with mindless ranting that adds no clarity or insightful analysis to the debate.Take this book with a bag of salt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid White Men","review":"You would have to be very desperate to sit and read this book, willingly. I found watching ice melt off the trees more interesting. I do enjoy light hearted reading, unfortunately this is light headed. You don't have to be a republican to dislike this book even I had a hard time with it. One of my \\"Stupid White Men\\" friends thought I would like it. The only part I liked about it was it was given to me so I don't feel bad about tossing it. I just might keep it in case someone irritates me, I'll give it to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Always a critic, never a solution","review":"This book shows the deep rooted psychosis that Michael Moore and many other liberals like him exhibit. He's an eternal critic but does not have any constructive suggestions for a model in which things could be better. Maybe we should follow a model like Cuba or North Korea, would that be better Mr. Moore? Michael Moore has become one of the richest men in the world with his books and movies. He obviously feels so guilty about this that he tries to bring down all white men with him. Well, it's not white men who are bringing the world down. In fact, over 90% of the inventions that we enjoy today were made by white men, that's not racist, it's just a fact. The USA - the country with the most freedom, the most mix of races, where anyone practice whatever religion they want - was founded by white men. I'm sorry, but I don't apologize for being a white man and I don't feel guilty, like Mr. Moore appearantly does."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book you will have ever read in your life","review":"Finally, someone to speak from the side of common sense.

Hopefully Michael Moore is a harbinger for ideological progress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stupidity Comes in All Colors","review":"That said, this is overall a good book.

Enough Michael, the world has changed from the first time you took acid in the 60's, it's time to wake up and get some therapy !!! I think Mr. Moore's paranoid ideas and arrogance have led him to think that he can make up trash and people won't question it's validity. Why doesn't Mr. Moore ever explore the problems with his own beliefs ? Why doesn't he do an expose on how trial lawyers AND corporations have bought the Democratic Party ? I'm not a conservative, but at least with Republicans you know what you're getting: God and Corporate Welfare, and they say it. Why doesn't Mr. Moore expose the fact that his own party says they represent the common man and the under class, but all they do is create laws that make lawyers richer AND take care of corporations ! And Mike, Murdoch of FOX IS NOT related to the Bush family, nice try but very foolish !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wake-Up America!","review":"I truly enjoyed reading Michael Moore's recent book and am thrilled to see how long it has lasted on the Best Seller's lists. It certainly says something about George W.'s true support. Moore does an excellent job of gleefully exposing the corruption fueled by corporate greed in our present political system. Most importantly, Moore offers inspiration for the common citizen to take charge and make changes. A good example of two citizens who took heed of Mr. Moore's message is the authors of \\"Be Careful Who You SLAPP.\\" That is an incredible story of two \\"little guys\\" who struggled to expose corporate corruption and abuse of the legal system in the heart of Silicon Valley. If you liked \\"Stupid White Men\\" for its battle cry against abuse of our fine legal system, you will love \\"Be Careful Who you SLAPP,\\" the story of two individuals who took charge of their own struggle for Constitutional rights against the onslaught of a corporate abuse."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth reading","review":"Honestly, for me some of the chapters were interesting and some of them dragged. That is the way most books are. The First chapter was very good. It is on the problems in Florida, and it made me angry at the American media. Moore writes about an innacurate fellon list. If that list wasn't used Al Gore would probably be president. That is as far as I can go into detail or my review might not be allowed for giving up to much of the plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"...A fun read overall. Lots of insight, facts and humor. Every white person ought to at least read the chapter Kill Whitey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michael Moore is swayed by emotionalism","review":"Michael Moore as usual fills his material with emotionalism and \\"feel good\\" material, igoring facts and truths.Sometimes the truth hurts, and facts are just facts no matter how they make you feel.You time would be better spent watching day-time TV like the \\"Lifetime\\" channel for \\"feel good\\" material, and save your reading time for more worthy material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!!","review":"Instead of calling this book \\"Stupid White Men\\", Michael Moore should have penned it as an autobiography and titled it \\"Stupid White Man\\"..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jackass","review":"If you like opinions without facts then this book is for you. Just like in his documentaries, he presents little or no facts for any of the stupid rants in this book. Moore is just a stupid angry fat [man] that hates America, and since he is unable to stage events and edit in \\"facts\\" in this book like he does in his documentaries it is glaringly obvious how misinformed he really is. This book is a waste of paper, do not buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liberal Propaganda","review":"If Moore had his way, our country would be in total chaos. Let's ban everything and be socialists -great plan.

I don't know how people can buy this garbage. He is about as extreme a liberal as you can be on every topic and close-minded to boot.If you like reading one-sided innacurate drivel, buy this book. When I first saw the title and saw he was the author, I thought he finally wrote an autobiography (\\"Stupid White Men\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly ... Book!!!!","review":"After pushing myself to keep going after the horrid first chapter, I now wish I would have took this book in my backyard and used it in my campfire. All this book is good for is a doorstop or a fire starter.This book is very anti-white and anti-American. The crackpot theories are based on no facts, just silliness. The obsession with America's faults turns the author into a tool of America's enemies.I do not just dislike this book because of my politics, it is boring. The jokes are not funny. The logic in the ideas are bad...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Trash","review":"I was forced to read this book for a sociology class I was forced to take at College. Just another example of how liberals take and contort knowledge in their liking. Liberals like Moore are so concerned with gaining self popularity and power, they completly miss the point of politics. Read it if you want to get inside the wild world of Leftism at it's fullest extent. Not very recommended, there are many better books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn.","review":"After some predictable digs at the Florida election and Bush in general, this book loses all focus and humor. Moore seems like someone that has just discovered the internet and includes a lot of URLs for almost everything (including step ladders and vibrators.) The middle of the book is a vast waste of disconnected ideas that seem to be there only to increase the number of pages...you wonder how many stupid white men other than Moore had a hand in this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Michael Moore really makes sense of whats going on in this country. This is a well-written and well-documented book, aside from informing the public about whats really going on, he also makes this book fun to read. I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A politicians are the same!!!","review":"This book should be required reading for everyone regardless of their age or country, because at the end of the day all politicians are the same and Michael Moore does a brilliant job of highlighting this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of Baloney","review":"Michael Moore is certainly off-beat with the majority of people in this country. Lucky he lives where he is free to share his views. I'll be sure to donate my copy to the local library so no one else has to waste their money purchasing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appauling","review":"I checked this book out of the library and was thoroughly appauled. An author who did not even graduate college, spouting his venom filled words about things he has absolutely no knowledge concerning. This is not a non-fiction book. It is a book of opinions that have no factual backing. This is a free country and people have the right to publish whatever they believe. If you are looking for something to somewhat \\"entertain\\" you, then you may like this book. If you are looking for something on political issues with hard based documented facts, then get \\"The Savage Nation\\" by Michael Savage, which I find more informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishingly Eye-Opening!","review":"I must admit that at first I was not particularly thrilled at the prospect of reading Stupid White Men when a friend leant the book to me. I was used to seeing Mr. Moore behaving as an 'angry white man' ranting about the injustices of big business & politicians is his films. Therefore, I found myself unprepared and pleasantly suprised by the intelligence and wit with which he wrote this book. This is a great read that exposes a lot of political agendas and comments on everything from the 2000 'election' to the state of our nation. This book shows another side of Michael Moore, beyond the irate man on tv & film you will get to know the intelligent witty man he really is & learn a lot along the way. I'm now planning on reading his next novel 'Dude, Where's My Country?' as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening, funny look at what's wrong with our country","review":"Michael Moore has done it again! Here is an entertaining book that makes the bitter truth a little easier to read. It's a very funny look at the ugly manipulations of the corporate takeover of the US. Every chapter provides plenty of food for thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually 2.5 stars","review":"Although I am anti-Bush and I generally agree with Moore's viewpoints, this book could have been a lot better. Instead of wasting pages making fun of republicans, Moore could have developed more meaningful arguments against the right-wing agenda. Although I think some of the stuff he says is amusing, we can't fight the right-wing by just going on about how stupid they are. We need something more substantial than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"forget about political differences--Just a BAD book!","review":"Despite coming to some of the same conclusions that Moore does(albeit by different reasoning), this is just a BAD book. It really is not funny at all. ...It is nothing more than his opinions, but he is not humorous. I agree less with P.J. O'Rourke or Christopher Buckley politically but find them more enjoyable to read.Anyone can rant on without facts or logic and Moore does just this.I particularly find interesting how he categorizes all the \\"bad guys\\"into White Men. When he comes up against women or non-Caucasianswho are on the \\"wrong\\" side, he names then \\"Honorary White Men.\\"What a jerk!..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really not that good","review":"I agree with a fellow reviewer. Moore's movies are OK, but his humor doesn't translate well in book form. In fact, I found his jokes pretty tiring and annoying after a while. If I'm reading a book about politics, I want facts not a bunch of social commentary mixed in with lame jokes. I actually think Moore comes off a little hypocritical in the book. Frankly, this book was a struggle to finish. Good for a grade schooler or high school at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate and Ignorance from the mouth of a Fat Leftist","review":"It was difficult reading a book that attempted to demonize and alienate anyone whose views differ from his extreme liberal position. The book is an extension of the conspiracy theory campaign which attempts to paint anyone conservative view as stupid, self serving, racist. The book is a joke and would be more appropriately titled Stupid Fat Man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glib","review":"This book has about 10-15 pages of useful information regarding government policy, contacting government officials, etc. However, the bulk of this book is a rant or whine that becomes tiresome. When MM is still writing quotations around the title \\"President\\" (referring to GW Bush) 150 pages into the book, it's time to let it go. His wit is short-lived and information too sporadic. Interesting how MM insults the rich - yet after movie and book deals, what is he?Somehow Michael Moore was able to drop out of college simply because he could not find a parking space. Many of us would enjoy that type of luxury.Buy this book used. There are many copies available. Do not keep this type of sub-par material on the NY Times Bestseller list any longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"BULLSEYE!","review":"Michael Moore has one bad habit: Telling the truth in plain English.He is hated by conservatives and their apologists for his in your face delivery of the facts. If his ENDNOTES were put to the test, they would pass.The one true \\"sorry\\" state of this nation is the emphasis on \\"infotainment.\\" I love how, in the beginning of the book, Michael states that he was watching grown men audition for a sports quiz show asking each other little (useless) bits of sports trivia. I agree that it's a sad commentary on this country when people know the stats from 1943 of a baseball player yet they don't know who their representatives and senators are.Michael, like Gore Vidal, touches raw nerves and I say if more people acted like him, we wouldn't be in the current mess we're in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading and Factless - Controversy for it's own sake.","review":"I read this book after a friend asured me it'd get me thinking and know the truth. The only problem is that there aren't any real facts and everything is a one-sided argument. Parts of the book are actually disturbing. The chapter \\"Kill Whitey\\" where basically he blames how horrible this country is (here I was thinking it was a pretty keen place) on white males. The bit about him firing all his white employees because they were white was pretty feeble. The gist of his book was all the world's ills are caused by republicans, jews and white guys...nice. I notice that he didn't mention that he lives in a 2mil dollar home in New York nor that he owns more than one luxury import.The truth is that Moore sold out after the success of Roger and Me and now he does anything he can to generate controversy and trick liberals into buying his tripe. I'd avoid this book and anything Mr Moore tries to hock in the future..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not worth the money, check it out at the library!","review":"Dennis Miller meets George Carlin!! That about summed it up for me. Parts of it were wonderful, other parts like the beginning of chapter 4 were ridiculous!!

I can't believe I wasted money on this book. I agree with a previous review. It is boreing, not funny or satirical. I think Michael Moore has become what he detests, a rich white male and is having trouble with his image. Attacking everything that is white, male and upscale is popular, but it all borders on class envy. Micheal Moore adds nothing new and if you find his humor funny...man it doesn't take much to make you laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book of the last several years!","review":"I would say that this is one of the best books I've read inthe last 5 years or so...perhaps since \\"Secrets of the Temple\\"was published.I had the privilege of meeting and hearing Mr. Moore speakduring his recent book tour.This author really \\"gets it\\" and understands TOTALLY what isgoing on in America today and he figured it all out WITHOUTa college education!Michael Moore is one of those rare innate intellects who hasthe ability to tell very serious subject matter in a cleverand very funny way....READ THIS BOOK...and give it to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"*Yawn*","review":"More propaghanda, nothing else.

Don't waste your time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not Stupid!","review":"To tell you the truth, I found this a bit of a disappointment. I really liked Bowling for Columbine but this comes off as a bit preachy. Moore tends to treat the reader as a child. We read too Mike and we have the ability to form our own opinions. He means well and the book does have good points. It is even entertaining in some bits. But he does contradict himself alot and also seems to need some kind of validation by the reader. Don't get me wrong, I think this guy has an important part in the greater scheme of things. It's just that the book is a bit unfunny, simplistic and a bit boring in some parts. He also tries to represent liberal minded people who aren't much like him. When he stops preaching and starts treating the reader like an equal, I'll be there. Borrow it from the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore John D.

I would call it a collection of stupid and hypocritical opinions and ideas. So why did your bridge fall down Mr. Engineer? Oh, I dropped my structural steel class so I could do a course in another language. I don't think it's right to criticize something like a college degree if a person doesn't even possess one. Actually I think that something like a college degree would be a great start before writing a book like this. It might decrease the chances of writing a book as stupid as this one. This book insulted my intelligence and I wouldn't even recommend it for a laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading","review":"So I finally got around to reading Stupid White Men. I was disappointed. I have enjoyed reading other left-leaning political satire, especially the works of Al Franken and Jim Hightower. However, this book wasn't funny, wasn't insightful, and was pretty stupid. The best part was the chapter on education, where Moore clearly states what is wrong with America's education system, and what needs to be done to improve it. At the beginning of the book he explains in vivid detail exactly how the 2000 Presidential Election was stolen. The rest isn't very good. In the chapter on the environment, I had hoped Moore would use scientific evidence in his arguments. I was disappointed. Don't expect to learn any science from Michael Moore.I think Michael Moore should stick with film. That's what he does best. I would recommend any documentary by Moore, especially Fahrenheit 9/11, and the book \\"Adventures in a TV Nation\\", over \\"Stupid White Men\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't change a thing!","review":"From the way I read these reviews, Moore seems to have changed nobody. The people who agree with him already believe in his message from the beginning. Moore has not convinced conservative/right wingers, he just gave them more ammo. When will we learn that to convince people to change, you can't go bashing what they believe then expect them to change. No wonder I don't see conservatives who have suddenly turned extreme leftie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and illogical","review":"I picked up this book to get a better understanding regarding the state of the nation and realized this book was an absolute joke! The book is written with poor grammer by someone who appears to have less than a high school education. In fact, the author admits in the book that he dropped out of high school.

Typical views from an anti-American who takes things at face value, and refuses to look further into matters, before drawing a conclusion. I wouldn't expect anything more from someone as small minded and uneducated on politics then Michael Moore. But if you choose, join him in hating America and our troop's purpose at home and abroad, since they defend, with their life, your right to hate them.

He claims to have all the answers, claims to know how to do everything, but when it comes down to it, he can't do a thing but talk. Well this is America and we all have the right to free speech, but couldn't we all do a book like this? Why does Michael Moore get to have his insane opinions published for his own financial gain?

The sections on mad cow disease, the environment, \\"kill whitey\\" and \\"the end of men\\" were just plain boring. Nothing new - just read the papers or watch the news. And what the hell were all those grey boxed comments for? They didn't even manage to get a chuckle out of me.

Well, \\"phony\\" is another word.Moore makes a point of telling us how he lives as a wealthy white man in the whitest, wealthiest section of Manhattan. He then spends a chapter telling us how much he cares about black people. Well, a move some 40 blocks north and Moore could actually LIVE amongst the people that he so loves, but like most liberals, Moore is all talk when it comes to race. Moore also laments the fact that his publishing company is all white. Again, Moore had the option of publishing with a black-owned company but then he would have to give up the huge advance.

Moore's direct questioning of \\"President\\" G. W. Bush was both riotous and shockingly blunt about issues of his competence as a leader.This book really doesn't cover any new ground, but the presentation is impeccably sardonic, simplistic enough to be understood by products of the US Public Education system, and presents a viewpoint that is far outside the scope of mainstream publications.I would challenge even the most staunch Republican henchmen to keep a straight face while reading Moore's commentary..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid White Men","review":"I am in the minority of people who think this book is perhaps one of the worst I've ever read.

But since the mass murder of Sept 11, Stupid White Men reads like some adolescent whining by a kid who refuses to grow up. As a result, much of Michael Moore's sharpest barbs come off as petty and shallow. Most thinking people I know have shared this opinion.I'm always amused by multi-millionares trying to pass themselves off as blue collar heroes. He markets himself well.

He also takes many things out of context. For instance, you can say that President Roosevelt declared war on the Japanese and from that make the argument that he was a war-monger.

He is just a narcissistic liberal who feels he is smarter than everyone else and that people will listen to him because he is so brilliant.I read this book right before he made is inane, idiotic comments at the Oscars.

Unlike the nuts on the far right like Coulter and Savage who simply try to create irrational anger with their distortion of fact, Moore at least attempts to poke fun from his (far left) point of view.

Moore, in his attempt to unveil the evils of our government, forgets to remind us that there is good there as well. I do feel like Moore makes many valid points when discussing the fact the Republicans and Democrats came from the same cookie cutter but the liberal bias of the book leaves me a bit distrustful as to the validity of his opinion as a whole. Yes both Clinton and Bush have not been environmentally friendly, but they reflect American Society as a whole. We talk the talk but no one wants to make the extra step to buy a Camry over the Hummer. It is often too easy to blame our leaders for our problems when in fact they only reflect the public.

His portrayal of a moody almost stupid highly trained Jedi blows my mind! What was Lucas thinking? Yes Jedi have human bodies and are therefore subject to the earthly needs, thus they turn to the \\"Dark Side\\", but they are still powerful, but for personal gain, not universal peace and justice for all. Strange character he was! In all fairness he didn't write the part, but I got the feeling he didn't believe in the character."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think Lucas did a fine job! GREAT EFFECTS!","review":"It is very difficult to give the characters the depth they needed for this movie to be an oscar nominee, but Lucas did a fine job putting this film together. I believe those that hated Jar Jar Binks with the passion they do are overly cynical, and overly pragmatic. I didn't particularly enjoy his onscreen presence, but I don't subscibe to the \\"Die Jar Jar Die!\\" principle.Wonderful effects, the characters needed a little more depth, and Annakin should have known what he was doing flying that Naboo fighter as opposed to, \\"What does this button do?\\"Overall, an excellent movie, but it is missing some icing on the cake."},{"rating":"1","title":"question?","review":"I have 1 question why are all of you buying it when you hate film. every one whines about it but your buying it. i didnt really like this film and i am not buying it. make a good purchase like the GODFATHERS or snatch. this is no EMPIRE, this isnt even jedi and jedi was the worst until this. the same with battlefeild earth it got up to like number five and jurasic park three its like six, and both roaly suck. and every one thinks it sucks but you are buying them, as a whise man once said if you stop seeing and buy sucky movies they will make less of them. so take my advise dont buy this cause it sucks.ps empire rules"},{"rating":"2","title":"nice","review":"this was the best right here they did me so ridht i like theys guys thangs guy for all thet you do to help us thanks and have a nice day your friend tommy rogge"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cinematography can't hold up a bad story.","review":"Cheers and congratulations are in order for ILM's masterful work on this movie, but here's the problem: The story wasn't thought out enough and bores it's way to the Jedi duel. Lucas should have paid attention when constructing sets that look more modern than the original (Star Trek's Enterprise could do the same in some areas). There is too much backstory to be told and I'm sure the script didn't allow enough running time to delve deep into Anakin, the Jedi Council, or even Yoda. There are a lot of things we still don't know, and maybe would if the pod race & Jar Jar weren't taking up that time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily one of the worst film's of the year","review":"The Phantom Menace is technically beautiful but other then that there really isn't much there.

If you are saying that you don't like it but claim to be a Star Wars fan, I don't buy it. It was fashionable to be 27+ years old and claim to have seen the Trilogy a hundred times but bash this movie in the same breath last summer. Get over yourself and knock it off. I am a fan. I like the first installments, and I like this movie too. I have seen this movie a dozen times on the screen and a few times on the TV at home. True the big screen is the best forum for viewing and DVD would be the ultimate medium for the home viewer, but this is the only option at this time. I accept this. I choose not to complain. When the DVD is released, I will rejoice. In the meantime I will sit on the couch, pop some popcorn and enjoy the ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe anyone liked it!","review":"This was the most disappointing and frustrating movie experience I have endured in a long time. It has nothing to do with looking for something to dislkie, as is the alleged hip thing to do, it is just a bad movie we are talking about. I feel that the supporters of this film are either looking for something to like 'cause they invested so much time and money and energy into this, or they are under the age of five, or they simply have lousy taste in movies.There is nothing here worth seeing. Well, maybe a nice light saber battle, and an exhilirating race scene, but really, there are many better films with action like that. A few pearls in a large pile of garbage does not make for good art. It isn't even good trash. It is a waste of time. Period."},{"rating":"1","title":"PEE-YEW!!","review":"Man, who'da thunk such a highly anticipated movie in one of the world's most beloved sagas would be so bloody awful? Who to blame? Lucas! After all, he had potloads of money to throw at the thing, the best SFX studio in the world, and nobody looking over his shoulder to tell him what to do. It's his baby, and it was stillborn. From the painfully racist characterizations, to the slow paced plot, to the pallid attempts at humor, this flick was a clunker from beginning to end. Only when the Jedis get into action does it begin to take off - unfortunately, there's only about fifteen minutes of such action here. Don't waste your time - check out the original trilogy (actually, the first two flicks) instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did anyone notice.....?","review":"Did anyone notice that the technology was better in the earlier days then the later years.

Unfortunately, hype has repeated itself and Lucas gave anticipating audiences a dramatic decline in what anyone could call an epic. Maybe the most anticipated cinematic event in the history of filmmaking, but far from the great film. The pod race is worth the admission alone, but as for an unoriginal story and horrible use of the Star Wars license, this movie just doesn't cut it, and you'll find yourself surprisingly sleeping through half of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Wars history","review":"Now some have siad that lucas killed Star Wars with this film.

This was about how the whole thing began. Even Lucas said it himself, \\"Don't bother looking for Luke, Leia, Han and Chewey. Cause, they won't be there\\".

The fun and humor has been drained out of the story and replaced by computer animated horror Jar Jar Binks. The story follows young Obi-Wan Kenobi and his master Qui-Gon Jinn as they attempt to stop the Trade Federation. It is nice to see how the \\"Star Wars\\" saga began, but without such memorable characters as Princess Leia, Han Solo, or Darth Vader, it just isn't the same.

It features some of the most vulgarly bad writing and directing of the past decade. What was charming and clunky and even kind of clunky about Lucas' rather forced dialogue has since ossified into a stilted preaching quality, as the dialogue becomes little more than exposition. The attempts at comedy remain mere attempts. The less said about JarJar the better.And if that weren't bad enough, we are expected to pay more money for a widescreen version than for a pan and scan version! The widescreen SPECIAL EDITION is merely a scam, and a transparent one at that. George Lucas is now clearly interested in one thing, and one thing only: lining his pockets with money.And this is the creator of Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi? He looks more like the Grand Moff Tarkin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jar Jar Stinks","review":"WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED?

The action sequences will truly take your breath away as well as the eye-popping ariel shooting of the majestic cities that may one day represent our own cities several thousand years from now. And the young queen who ascended the throne so early in her life is the most fascinating character of all, with her really bizarre hairdos and her plucky exploits. The story, however drags on a little and I did squirm about in my seat at those times. In addition, there are some pretty silly parts like the king of the swamp shaking his jowls until his spittle flies everywhere and a desert mount suddenly breaking wind for no good reason. But the special effects, especially produced by the sophisticated computer technology of the '90s are quite beautiful and awe-inspiring to watch. So go enjoy the ride nevertheless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on man! Be wise. Don't watch that!","review":"A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME! This film was a complete waste of time.

First I should say that i would have given this film -5 stars if that was possible. The characters are flat likea blackboard. Jar-Jar Binks is stupid. Anakin shows an IQ of 50 points or less. The two good Jedis walkedaround like two boredcops tryingtofind someoneto knock down. They were so dumb, that inthe end i sympathised Darth Maul. He was the only guy inthe film who, despite being stupid, won my sympathy.

The hype on this is very over rated. All the news on the deleted sense being so great. They were ok but the better ones of course were on the second disk and not part of the movie at all. Who was the idiot that decided that one? I don't know about anyone else but I buy DVD's to see the deleted sense during the movie not separate! Save your money. It's not worth it unless you are a die-hard fan but even then be prepared to be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than \\"Jedi\\"","review":"Why rehash all the stuff already written here? While Ep 1 is no where near as good as Ep 4 & 5, it was BETTER than ROTJ. Aside from Luke's confrontation with the emperor and Vader, ROTJ is a joke! It took all the great developments of Ep 4 & 5 and flushed them down a toilet with a bunch of stupid muppets! I'll take Jar Jar over the Ewoks anyday! Ep 1 had many great scenes and the beginning of a great story. While it's no Empire, it's still better than Jedi. As far as the CGI, it isn't by any means perfect, but it's a great alternative to the Muppet Show which Jedi is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watchable, but bad acting ruins the movie","review":"The movie on the whole manages to paint a wonderful picture of the world before the evil empire takes control. The all star cast do a good job, but it is not enough to overcome the flat acting of Jake Lloyd. The special effects are wonderful and the battle scenes surpass the first three. Unfortunately, there's a lot of history and myth to the star wars universe. If the first three episodes of star wars didn't exist, the movie would get a higher rating.

Maybe he did and maybe he didn't, but I don't even remember him talkig! So it dosn't make sense to me to go so wild over that wierd person. I also did not like Anikan Skywalker. He just had bad acting. He also had a bad scrip too, but mostly it was the acting. The character just wasn't realistic, he didn't act like a real 8 or 9 year old boy.

The countless millions he spent on the boring pod race and the cliche \\"blow up the big enemy ship\\" would've been better spent on a script-writer (or maybe a whole team of them). How humiliating for McGregor and Neeson to be tied to such a third-rate production.Save your money and go see The Lord of The Rings this winter- Tolkien's trilogy is a thousand times better - with much more interesting characters, plot and no pander-to-the-8-year-olds Jar Jar character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fan from DAY ONE...","review":"The minute I saw the first ever trailer for Star Wars, I was hooked!!

I am completely intrigued with how this is going to play out, the connection between Episodes 4-6 and 1-3. So much food for thought and speculation is provided in this new film. As a Star Wars fan, I thouroughly enjoyed this movie, but I believe it stands as well as a fine film in its own right.

I felt dumber for watching it and it pisses me off that I'll never get those 2 hours of my life back.I thought it was a fluke so when the Attack of the Clones came out, I, like a complete dumbass, went to see it. Needless to say, now there are 4 hours of my life gone with nothing to show for it. I could have spent that time slamming my testicals in a door jam or trying to score at the nursing home.Should I even bother seeing the Revenge of the Sith?

They are flat and lack ANY of the emotional buy-in needed for a legend film series. The orginal series was so good that it became part \\"religion\\" to many people. They were so good, you had a frenzy when these new movies were coming out. The orginal movies were made for adults with a story so compelling, you didn't need 100 million in special effects to pull it off. Lucas should have done what he did with the first series...let other people direct them! What a disgrace to the orginal Star Wars trilogy.

It lacks all the spirit of the originals, and is a soulless phony."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointing, but not without some merit","review":"first off, I am a big Star Wars fan, and was quite excited about this movie. Unfortunately I was disapointed. Certainly the film is not without merit, there are some great action scenes, and special effects. The movie is also not without a few good characters. Unfortunately though the movie is almost 100% eye candy. The characters could have been much better than they were. Jar Jar Binks is a commonly used example, and for good reason. He could have been an enjoyable comic relief character, but instead he was just intolerably irritating.Then there is the pod race, a scene which got a lot more focus than necessary, which left me feeling like Lucas just wanted to throw in something to take up time. This could have been a good film with a bit more focus on character developement, and plot, and some better acting (though not all of it was terrible)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phantom menace","review":"This new STAR WARS film is better than ATTACK OF THE CLONES,though lots of movie goers hated this film.but there all wrong because this is a masterpiece of STAR WARS series.George Lucas puts some exciting scenes in this one like the scene with the race and has evil Darth Maul.only reason this deserves 4 stars is because retarded Jar-Jar Binks ruined it,other than that a entertaining film."},{"rating":"2","title":"What happened??","review":"while i still give this movie a good rating i think that people should know that this are nothing like the original three star wars films. this film is good but not as revolutionary as its predecesors. it is still worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"sweetnass","review":"Alright..this movie is great. It lacks some essential star wars things like a classic star battle and such but it has one unbeatable thing. The lightsaber fight with Darth Maul, obi wan and qui gon. If you haven't seen it you must. The rest of the movie is good as well but the lightsaber fight is just...WOW!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre in all but Special Effects","review":"This first of three prequels to the Star Wars trilogy is big on special effects (indeed it deserved to win an Oscar in this category but had to make do with noms for Visual Effects, Sound and Sound Effects) but mediocre in terms of any human qualities, story interest or humor. It's dreadfully serious and uninvolving and rather formulaic - geared more for children than for adults. Not as deserving as the trilogy itself. For Star Wars groupies only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"What a letdown. I'm a diehard Star Wars fan, and I can't tell you how mediocre this film is. My heart started pounding with excitement when the opening music blared and the Star Wars logo appeared on the screen. It was all downhill from there. The much-hyped pod racer scene is dull and free of suspense- how many laps are left? Who's ahead? You can never tell, so after a while- who cares? Can't hold a candle to the speeder bike chase in Return of the Jedi- or any scene in the original trilogy for that matter. Liam Neeson's and Ewan McGregor's talents are totally wasted. Natalie Portman's performance is wooden, and what's with that accent? The computer generated effects are distracting and cartoonish. The finale is laughable. What a bummer. I think I'll skip Episode II. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY WERE SCENES EDITED!","review":"The regular tape has poor video and sound quality relative to most other movies, the Widescreen or \\"Letterbox\\" version is much better. However, both versions have scenes edited out, mostly subtle but one scene which explains how Darth Maul traced the good guys to Tatooin was removed. As for the script, it is good for kids, but rather flawed for \\"intelligent\\" adults. References of Anakin as \\"Jesus Christ\\", and linking it (the Force) to something that can be measured in blood, as well as \\"Barney\\" style acting by the boy ruined the movie for me. As for the DVD issue, nevermind that there is NO DVD of ANY Lucas Films, the original Star Wars Trilogy is not even commercially available any more in any format, this and the removal of scenes from both vhs release of Phantom Menace, tells me that Mr. Lucas has truly turned to the \\"Dark Side\\" of capitalism. Disney style."},{"rating":"2","title":"How can you go wrong with Star Wars","review":"The idea alone of making a trilogy and then making the fourth movie in the set the first is genius. The technology won't seem as amazing as it used to because we have come to expect it, but this movie is a good beginning to the explanation of how we got to where we started in the 70's. I was expecting more out of the fight scenes but the characters made up for where the fights lacked. It's Star Wars! How can you go wrong? I can almost gaurantee that you'll end the movie and find yourself doing Jedi impressions."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],W={key:0},H={key:1};function B(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(a(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",H,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",W,"See more"))],8,N)):b("",!0)])}const R=d(O,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-3372872e"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/62.md","filePath":"quotes/62.md"}'),x={name:"quotes/62.md"},P=Object.assign(x,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
