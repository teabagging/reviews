Typically, one is presented French, British, and Spanish regional influence upon local indigenous populations. Calloway provides this, but also discusses the impact of each regional upheaval on the whole. One sees how the Iroquois could affect the Comanche and the Frenchman rattle the Don.Equally refreshing is Calloway's impartiality. He is no one's apologist. His narrative is matter-of-fact and free of any apparent agenda. The book's subtitle is a bit of a misnomer as Calloway expounds quite frequently upon peoples and events substantially east of the Mississipi. But, no matter, for this serves to complete a remarkable story.Occasionally dry, but fundamentally entertaining, One Vast Winter Count is a comprehensive survey deserving the attention of anyone interested in the Native American story.

If you have programming experience and are looking into using flash, I highly recommend that you DO NOT buy this book. The whole books basically teaches motion tweening and using basic drawing tools. It doesnt teach the power of flash or even teach you how to use the built in flash components either. If you want to learn how to make a cat dancing from one side of the stage to the other, than this book is great. If you want to learn how to build rich flash programs, then buy something else.

In this guide the first 240 pages are basically useless unless you've never used any image editing or illustration software before (or possibly ever used a computer). This would normally make it ideal for novices, but frankly, most will be disapointed with what little they will actually be able to do with the software after digesting the whole book.

In our case, street curb to gnome is about 35ft, and frankly, you can't see it.The product itself is a ceramic based, and that comes into play when you're trying to secure it from potential thieves (12yo neighbor boy and his posse). I tried to put a eyelet screw in the gnome's heel which would then be tethered to a chain and stake in the ground. No luck. Gnome's now close to heelless now, as the screw cracked it. Instead, I took the chain and encircled his ankles. Still a deterrent, but less than ideal.Otherwise, is it really burnt orange, not some orange that's close? Yes.

There's really only one important thing to point out -- that this play is still funny, still disturbing, still radical, and still entertaining. The plot twist at the end, which resolves the major conflict, is rather unsettling and leaves a bad taste in your mouth. But it's also so weirdly coincidental that, somehow, you accept it as a comic device. In fact, Joe Orton's \\"What the Butler Saw\\" has a very similar resolution, which suggests that Terence's plays are still highly influential.Maybe if Terence were alive today he would be writing scripts like Pedro Almodovar. These two men, separated by 2000 years, have created the same outrageous, violent and sexual stories.

By page 94 (one third of the way through the book), the solution to the main mystery was obvious.

I spent two thirds of the book scratching my head, trying to figure out why Fletch, who is supposed to be brilliant, can't figure things out. There's no answer to this. Also, the ending tied to the secondary mystery is horrible. Unfortunately, there's not much I can say about it without giving it away. It's just all-around terrible and depressing.

I also found very distracting the negative tone that he uses regarding his past co-workers in the FBI. It left me wondering just how much back-stabbing goes on in that organization, instead of pondering the criminal mind which was why I purchased the book. Also, being told over and over how important he was to the cases featured in this book became hard to stomach also. I did find the excerpts from the Gacy and Dahmer interviews amazing. I was just astounded at how the human mind can turn things around to make facts easier to deal with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking content","review":"The book is next to useless as a source of information on the mind/thinking of serial killers.

The text, what little there is, gives the reader scant insight to the craft. For example, a section is dedicated to the fact that his armoury produces their own rivets, while this is an interesting tidbit, it has more of a feel of a company ad brochure than an instructional work.Often the photos are not in sequence (for example, early in the work, a breastplate is shown being worked, and then suddenly on the same page photos of a chin piece) and lessen the impact of the work.

There is just too much filler and not enough substance. Her sining is marginal and the beats all tend to blend together and each song somewhat sounds like the previous one. In this industry people get by all the time with a \\"thin\\" voice but in that case you need to come correct with a strong production team and melodic lyrics to boot. Kat's CD is lacking both.

Catalyst games just created Leviathans & loved the history twist on it. Even I am interested since I am more of the history geek.

Perhaps because Berwald spent good portions of his life in relative musical backwaters such as Stockholm. He also did not promote himself as aggressively as some of his contemporaries. As a result, his works have somewhat fallen into neglect.If not for Sixten Ehrling, we might not know these works at all. I first heard a battered recording of the 1st Symphony performed by Ehrling about 20 years ago, and was hooked on Berwald's music. I have other Berwald recordings by J?rvi in my collection, and they are very good, but I still think Ehrling offers the best interpration of all.If you don't know Berwald's music, you need to listen to it! He is very much his own man, and his music is just delightful. You will wonder why these pieces are so seldomly performed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Delius Sampler","review":"This is another great Chandos release!

After reading this book, it is difficult not to be touched by Harnell's humanity whether or not one is aware of his work and contributions to popular and television music over the last five decades."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super durable.","review":"the case works great with the GPS.

A GREAT CD TO OWN THANKS DIANA................."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Diana Krall Lover","review":"If you are not already a fan of Diana Krall, this is a horrible record (yes, and I even remember playing 78's)to start an association. It is essentially the Thunder Bay Jazz quartet with (in extremely small letters) Diana Krall on vocals. And, there are very limited vocals, even in the songs where she actually sings a few words. She appears to be a wonderful Jazz pianist, but, it is not evident from the cover of the album that this is going to be a showcase of her non-vocal skills, and so the number and length of the instrumentals is startling. Virtually all the songs with vocals are up-beat, up-tempo, and in many cases cutesy. So much so, that I began to wonder if some were chosen from an Alvin and the Chipmunks album. Finally, and most damning to me is the fact that she seems to show a vocal range of about half an octave. I cannot believe that anyone praised the range of her vocals in this album because she does not show any."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one stands out","review":"When you load the CD player with a morning's worth of music (and then not really hear any of it) this album punches right through the fog. The recording is special -- organic and crisp, and the mix has Ms. Krall just a whisper behind the rhythm section, with a tasty reverb in her vocals. The tunes are a nice combination of uptempo jazz and her patented laid-back ballads. Her piano stylings are also well spoken -- this lady can swing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to go back to the beginning","review":"I found and bought this CD after collecting the subsequent 4 recordings. I thought it was great fun to go back to the beginning. I love the slightly \\"rough\\" quality of this CD - I agree it is more playful, the piano tracks have more bounce and with Hamilton/Clayton, they must have had great fun recording this, because that's the quality that comes through. All For You may be my favorite to date however."},{"rating":"2","title":"HIGH STEPPING AT ITS BEST!","review":"I first heard Diane Krall on the Rosemary Clooney/ John Pizzarelli CD , \\"Brazil\\". That was enough to make me want to hear more. This gifted singer/pianist warbles in a dynamic, fresh style. With vocals reminiscent of the late Carmen Mac Cray, Diane sings your blues away. You'll be toe-tapping in no time. Her \\"Sunny Side of The Street\\" is bright, crisp, and happy.

Kevin Roderick reveals the Valley's history through a combination of well-researched prose and historical photographs which say even more than the words do. By the time you finish this book, you're almost saddened by the present state of the Valley because Mr. Roderick has illustrated just how beautiful and inviting this sunny prarie used to be, why it appealed to so many immigrants and developers, and how lovely it could have been. The timing of this book's release is noteworthy, too: it appeared in stores just before the movement for the Valley's possible secession from the City of Los Angeles appeared on the November 2002 ballots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use Caution!","review":"This book is fatally flawed in that the author does not rely on the bible for his information, and instead uses his own reasoning to draw his conclusions. Even though the book has a lot excellent information, I would not recommend it. On many occasions I found myself wondering about all of the scriptures the author could have referenced to clarify the topic. In a number of cases the author is clearly mistaken and directly contradicts the plain teaching of scripture."},{"rating":"2","title":"An open and honest view on sexuality.","review":"This book is very straightforward about sex and its relationship to people. In college, this was one of our textbooks for an Ethics class, and I remember being impressed with its view of sex as a joyful, beautiful and SACRED part of a marriage. It seems that with media we get a \\"do it all you want/can\\" morality that leaves out the sacred/spiritual part of a person, so this book is a good balance to that view.I plan to give this book to my eldest niece for her 13th birthday so that she has another perspective from which to view sex and to make her own decisions about her body and her sexuality.I wasn't too keen about the view of homosexuality in this book, but I tend to be more liberal about the gay lifestlye than most of the fundamental Christianity camp."},{"rating":"2","title":"My girl is the best, and I am so proud of her","review":"The CD is simply beautiful, much like the woman. She is combination of beauty, charm, intelligence and love and it comes through in her music. I am fortunate in that I actually know and love this woman. Not only do I love her talent and her music, but also her character, of which she has plenty!! Buy this CD and listen for yourself what the rest of us have known for years.

But many may say that I am biased because I know the artist personally. I can truly say that my \\"little\\" sister has grown with her music. Delilah has away with words and expression. She has always strived to be different and she has totally succeeded in this venture. To know her is to love her, and to love her is to love her artist genius.

(I don't know if this is part of a national program, or just KC.) I was very disappointed with this book. Expecting to read some real \\"stuff\\" about black nuns in the rural south, I ended up skimming much of the going-nowhere story looking for those parts. They were almost not there. The last 20 pages redeemed the story to a very slight degree but overall, this book was a waste of time. Lots of character development -- no real story, no plot, no antagonist, no protagonist. As another reviewer stated, the thoughts and dialog of main character, 10-year-old Vivien Leigh does not ring true to her age (even if she is \\"wise beyond her years\\"). I also felt the story itself did not ring true to the period, or place. At times I wasn't sure if they were in present day or the 50's; California, or Louisiana or somewhere else altogether. The many incongruities were annoying to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"I read the entire series as a child.Grandchildren will like.","review":"After 40 year, I just reread the series.

I was browsing free books in Kindle and saw the title and thought I might as well download it since it was free. One would think the subject was candidiasis or maybe alcoholism and the temperance movement. There is a long preface to the fourth edition where the author talks at length about the Poor Act in England and farming but having scanned many pages of this work, I really have no idea what it's about.

The counter-tenor, Yoshikazu Mera, is one of the artists on this CD adding his incredible, almost surreal, voice to this fascinating collegium. When I am in need of a spiritual soul boost I put on a CD like this one with the voice of Mera. I recommend the CDs \\"Romance\\" and \\"Nightingale\\" as being two of the truly most exceptional classical CDs I have ever heard.

Bad acting followed by worse acting and tied up in a bow of horrible acting. The story line was fine and the gore was okay...those are the things that would have been overlooked or seen as quirky if the movie had been even halfway good...hell, a quarter of the way good. Washed out cinematography and the use of the same sets only added to the dud that was movie going experience.

I didn't mind the low budget or the acting, it was more the story that seemed to fall flat. It was almost like it tried to be better than it should be, but really fell flat across the board.

Although I didn't always agree with the author's assumptions or conclusions, I found many of his arguments thought provoking. He obviously loves his subject and has given it a great deal of thought.

So I got an e-mail requesting whether I wanted another one sent in its place or my refund. I opted for the refund. It's been well over a month now, and after 2 phone calls over the past few weeks I still have yet to see a penny of my refund despite the Amazon employees telling me over the phone that it should be just another day or so. Yep, I'm pretty upset. Like I said, not a review on the bed, though I'm under the impression it's a bit flimsy if there are so many reviews that involve destruction in transit. But I'm sorely disappointed in Amazon at this moment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misfit pieces","review":"Upon unpacking the box and beginning assembly I noticed that one of the pieces was manufactured incorrectly and the bed would not assemble correctly. I called the company and they said they would send me a replacement piece. It should arrive in 5-7 days. That was the week before Easter and I have yet to receive it and it is now the second week of May. I am in process of recalling the company."},{"rating":"1","title":"returned it","review":"this bed frame is extremely heavy. therefore, UPS broke the bed frame during shipment. plus the UPS guy was pushing it around and dropping it when he brought it to my building. as a result, one of the side pieces snapped in half during shipment. unless you have a strong person willing to help you unpack this bed and also you can avoid stairs, I recommend you to NOT get this bed. it was a real hassle to return it. it was a big pain to order, have it delivered, and then open the package only to realize it was broken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke","review":"This must be made out of some cheap fiberboard because it was broken when I received it. Not just broken, but SPLIT perpendicular to the length of the box. The split was THREE BOARDS DEEP!! This wasn't just some sort of chipping or scuffing. It looked like some super-awesome Karate Master had chopped it. This may or may not be amazon's fault...it could be UPS; who knows? Haven't decided to get a refund or try this again yet. It doesn't look like it's made of anything sturdy to begin with. I've used this kind of wood to make shelters for farm animals before, never to support the weight of a foam mattress AND 2 adults. Would probably snap if there was some shifting weight on top it. But who knows, maybe the UPS driver didn't want to carry this 150lbs hulking cardboard behemoth up the stairs so he tried to cut some of it off. UPS is the KARATE MASTER!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have trusted the reviews!","review":"The bed arrived with many broken pieces. Several of the reviewers mentioned this, but I thought I'd give it a try. The bed is poorly packaged, just cardboard, and the pieces are long and made of particle board, so it's not surprising that many had snapped in half. Also, this box is 140 lbs, so be sure you have help getting it into the house.It's just what I want in our spare bedroom, but as a long-time Amazon customer, I should have trusted the reviews and my instincts.Again, I don't think it's the bed per se, it's that it is very heavy and packaged as if it were a book, one cardboard outer box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money!","review":"Make sure you follow the instructions or you'll have things backwards. Great product, worth the money. Even lasted through 3 different moves!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product for Someone Who is Not Planning to Move","review":"This bed frame is a great product and for the money I would buy it again. The construction is somewhat complicated but once you understand the directions and have someone give you a hand with the larger pieces the final product is a great looking bed frame. I was not thrilled with the fact that the screw holes were not pre-drilled and the supplied screws were coarse thread which split the MDF cross braces because I did not have the ability to pre-drill and counter-sink. I found the bed impossible to put back together when it had to be disassembled to move to another place. Would highly recommend for someone who plans to keep this product for a long time in one place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what we hoped for","review":"We were a little concerned about this platform bed on reading some of the reviews but we are very happy with what we received. My girlfriend was able to install nearly the entire frame, with the exception of the railings, by herself. It's very sturdy and ably supports our eurotop mattress. All the pieces arrived in good shape with no nicks or markings. Basically, I don't think we could have done much better for the money. Great purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"crooks","review":"never buy any product from this manufacturer.they sent me the package but it was missing all the nutts and bolts. So i had to call them again and the operators aren't helpful at all. English isn't their first language so you can imagine. From what it seemed like while telling them what had happened, they seemed unalarmed by the missing pieces in their package. Gave me an impression that this is very common for them to miss out on stuff we paid for in advance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get What You Pay For","review":"I'm overall satisfied with the bed frame. It's sturdy enough and came w/out defects. It is 100% particle board however (minus the astetic trim which is actually cardboard), so do not plan to make any home moves after constructing ... it will break.Things to note -1. 98% particle board.2. Requires 2 or more people to construct.3. The instructions are ambigious, confusing, and misleading.Prepair to be 125% smarter then the instructions or a disasterous assembly.Beware of that the instructions fail to say which way the boards must face/ stand. That they fail to identify all the measuring scraps. That they fail to illustrate how the bed should appear in some immages--hinting that one side of the top slates may be augmented further then the other. This is not the case. The bed should be square and even on all sides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money! Don't buy this!","review":"I think I got ripped off with this item. First of all, for the price, which wasnt that much, it still lacks quality. Second, all manufacturers of any type of wood products should specify if it's real wood or cheap particle board...like this item! It is so flimsy and cheap I regret buying it. And the shipping cost is way too high! And that makes this item TOTALLY not worth it! Now I have to try and sell it because there's no way I'm keeping this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't know!!!","review":"I can't give a honest review of this product because after I ordered it I never received it!!!!

I bought a different kind locally."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad quality, arrived broke!","review":"Item arrived broke and was of bad quality.

I will never purchase furniture from Amazon again. Horrible quality!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy South Shore Furniture unless you are a self-hating, masochist.","review":"This was not easy to assemble by myself. The instructions were somewhat confusing and difficult to follow. I called for assistance but the person I spoke didn't sound like she'd ever assembled the piece herself and was somewhat rude. I'd recommend letting people know, before they order, that the piece requires two people to assemble. Personally, I will NEVER again buy South Shore Furniture."},{"rating":"1","title":"this bed is terrible.","review":"This bed looks nice enough in the pictures. When they shipped it, it was damaged because these huge heavy pieces of melamine press-board stuff were all in one thin cardboard box. It was absurdly heavy for just one box. Some of the pieces were the wrong color. And it's so low, you might as well be sleeping on the floor. and the drawers are pretty bad too. The bottom of the drawer is just a thin piece of cardboard with a fake wood-grain sticker.Amazon was awesome though, they refunded me and made it super easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The price isn't worth the pain","review":"This seemed like a good deal to go with our new memory foam mattress, but the corners and edges stick out brutally, causing untold amounts of shin injuries. Might be good for a guest room, but nowhere where you will be walking around frequently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Platform","review":"This is relatively easy to put together. The directions aren't the best, but by studying them all the way through to see how it will end up helps. It is a very sturdy platform and I'm looking forward to many years of use. The exterior is excellent, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of JUNK!","review":"Don't buy this! If you plan on moving ever, this bed will not survive. Even moving it from one side of the room to the other the nails started coming out, the wood on the corners shifted. I guess you get what you pay for, better off spending the extra on something that will last!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't recommend","review":"Pros: Looks GoodCons: Bed is of cheap quality and difficult to put together.

I believe that his strategies are good, and fortunately, he encourages paper trading. However, as usual, I am disappointed in the EXTREME amount of advertising in his books. Most of what he says could be summarized in a pamphlet (once the advertisements are taken out).

Cochrane peoples this story of child abuse that spawns child abuse with a style notable for its directness. Namely, he doesn't feel the need to show off. Flaws and all, these characters speak on their own. The dialogue is also relentlessly accurate, a rarity in a time when our fictional conversations rarely sound right. This novel has its taproot in honesty, and while the plot summary you'll see above might read like an episode of a horrid talk show, Cochrane instead renders a family torn by abuse with elegance and caring. This is a fine book by a fine writer, one who will no doubt present a equally well-done but richer novel his next time out.

This set of 6 CDs may not be the most reasonable in price, but after you listen to them, you will conclude that the purchase was worth it. Holmboe is truly one of the best symphony composers of the Twentieth Century. I feel that his symphonies are as good as those of the more well known Danish Composer, Nielsen. I also think that his Symphony No.8 is one of the finest symphonies ever written. None of the symphonies struck me as disappointing. I had one minor problem with the set. The CDs were so well set in their holders, that I had to carefully remove them, to avoid bending or breaking them. Removing them a few times will alleviate this problem. This is a must buy for those who appreciate Twentieth Century music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mozart without puff-powder","review":"This is the first cd of Mozart sonatas by Ronald Brautigam that I bought. I already have got a cd with Beethoven sonatas on fortepiano. I think the recording of these sonatas sounds very christal-clear and pure. It is like I feel Mozart on pianoforte should sound. There is no doubt about the fine toucher of Brautigam and his interpretation of e.g. the sonata KV 331 'Alla Turca'. Not too fast like a merry-go-round, but very stately. The recording has not a very dry acoustic but a beautiful light feeling which makes the fortepiano sound like it does, heavenly. This is Mozart without puff powder. Exellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"Playing Barrios requires more than just excellent technique. The performer has to capture the darkness in the light passages, like a yearning in moments of gaiety..Also, capture the light in the dark passages, as a ray of optimissim in moments of sorrow. Ms Goni captures all these emotions profoundly in this highly recommended CD.The programme features rarely heard gems like Humouresque, Pepita, and the magical Tu y Yo. Her expressive phrasing often breathes new life into the often played works such as Maxixe, Junto a Tu Corazon, Vals no4.Romantic guitar music, with Latin American folkloric influence"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome sound","review":"I would most definitely recommend this to any trombonist such as myself, and also to anybody who just loves good music. As always, Christian Lindbergh puts forth a practically flawless performance. Precision playing, wonderful display of emotion, control, it has it all. Wonderful solo work, a beautiful job of accompaniment from the band. The band has it's moments in the sun though, particularly in the second movement of the Bourgeois. Lindbergh's like a machine. Fast and slow, loud and soft, marked and smooth, serious to burlesque... This is good stuff!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Accents and narration kill this story","review":"Spotty and intrusive bits of third person narration pop up in random places, disrupting the flow of the story, not adding much to the story that couldn't have been covered in the rest of the book. These interludes also have a haughty tone that distract from the reading experience.Written accents are automatic turn-offs for me. Reading what is more or less a \\"cute\\" speech impediment as seen in five year old children has a detrimental effect on the flow of the story. If the author were to describe this unique feature in his aliens' speech patterns, that's one thing. Putting every added \\"z\\" and \\"w\\" sound in only serves to irritate the reader.I only got about a third of the way into this book because of the above two mentioned turn-offs.

Apparently there is a guide that you can order to create lesson plans.Unfortunately my favorite track is not one that you can sample here but Taj Mahal's \\"Don't you push me down\\" is the absolute number one favorite of everyone and is often put on repeat.

This book talks about all the work, financial cost, and luck involved in getting to the top. (not to mention talent!) Just being good is not enough. Jacob walks us through his own thoughts and insecurities as he goes from playing in bars to the top of the charts and back. If you are looking for the down and dirty party world of rock, this is not the book you are looking for. If you want to know the workings of the music industry from the drummer's eye view, than this is your book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So much I never knew.","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed the insight into the world of recording artists.

The insights into the mechanization of the music business were very interesting but the writer himself is a total bore. The whole band seems really lame. They don't DO anything. They apparently don't interact with other musicians their touring with, no groupies, no road antics, nothing. The highlight of their tour with matchbox 20 was watching Law & Order reruns. The highlight of their trip to Vegas? Watching TV in the hotel room. I get his point about the absurdity of the music business but the cover would lead you to believe these guys actually attempted to have fun once in awhile.

I agree wholeheartidly but this story is like bones with no meat. It lacks depth and, well, OOPH. You know what I mean, I assume. It is like Anne wrote it in a few minutes, and then ran off to her publisher to get the book published. I love the BSC books, I have been an avid reader from the very start. But it is getting very clear to me that all the new BSC books are getting flowery and kind of, well, stupid. I think it's time to move on to a new series! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was okay...","review":"Abby's Un-Valentine was okay, but not that great. First of all, Kristy and Abby are 13, and they don't seem to have a mature interest in guys. That's kind of unrealistic, but that's not really the reason I didn't favor the book. The plot is sort of boring. It might be a good subplot, but not a real plot. It dragged, and it was pretty tedious to say the least. I really don't suggest you read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of time","review":"Obviously, the weakest point of this recording is the pop singer Bocelli. Though I've enjoyed some of his solo discs, he is out of his element here. Even his sound is out of place, and he is very closely miked (because of his small voice). Thus his sound does not match the rest of the soloists. I guess Philips felt they would sell more copies with a pop singer than with a classical tenor. What a pity! Was Renee fleming just substituting for Madonna? Aside from Bocelli, the recording is not remarkable."},{"rating":"1","title":"let ME sing that","review":"I always loved to sing at school, in the choir and .... also while taking a shower. I have a tenor voice and can hit the right notes with a probability of 98%. I have never had any lessons but I AM SURE I WOULD NOT SOUND WORSE THAN MR. BOCELLI!Stay away, this recording is RIDICULOUS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"Given the splendor of Gergiev, Fleming and Borodina this recording has been highly touted. BIG disappointment......While Gergiev's operatic approach is viable, this performance is like a string of stop and go ideas. Yes Fleming and Borodina maintain their reputations, as does bass D'Arcangelo, but when will record producers stop pulling Bocelli out of his Pop element and let him blast away at ballads instead of blistering opera? This ends up being a commercial vehicle for Bocelli fans instead of a contribution to the bulging ranks of recorded Verdi Requiems. Makes you wonder why Gergiev consented to record this. Pass......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Requiem for Philips","review":"No, don't even try it. Leave this recording right where it is. Verdi's Requiem is too great a masterpiece to tolerate this disrespect."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of the worst","review":"Universal has used its PR department to hype a substandard performance of the Verdi Requiem. They obviously do not care about music - they care only about capitalizing on Bocelli's popularity. This performance is perhaps the worst of the worst! Bocelli lacks the weight, nuance, tone and musicianship necessary to sing the tenor part in the Requiem. As for Gergiev and the others - they should hang their head in shame. How anyone like Renee Fleming could participate in a recording like this mystifies me. Anyone who wishes to buy a truly great performance of this work should search [...] for the newly reissued Giulini/Philharmonia on EMI or the Ormandy/Philadelphia recording on Sony or the Muti/Philharmonia on EMI Forte. This recording is just plain POOR!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The ultimate marketing and hype gimmick","review":"The good points:The exquisite voice of Renee Fleming(what in god's name is she doing on this recording?)and an excellent and spirited performance by the Kirov orchestra and chorus.The bad:Not so much Bocelli's singing(faux Enrique Iglesias crooning)as the decision of the higher ups at Phillips to stoop and give more momentum to the worsening plague of \\"crossover\\" albums;a marketing con that sticks pop music performers into the classical world and vice versa.Naturally, the result of this abominable crossbreeding is compromised standards,compromised integrity and a spate of cd's useful only as drink coasters.We can stop this insidious plague by not buying these gimmicky recordings.I've learned my lesson the hard way;don't waste your money on this tripe.If you want a great recording of the requiem try Solti's Vienna Philharmonic version or the immaculate Robert Shaw 1987 Telarc disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding","review":"This recording of Verdi's requiem is one that will chill you to the core of your soul. Of course I mean that in a good way. The texts are nicely compimented by the haunting melodies of the composition, and several tracks help to make the impending wrath of God seem very vivid, and very real. This piece is a wonderful reminder of what we do in this life truly does matter, and it is comforting to those who do well, and terrifying to those who choose to live after their own selfish desires."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disaster!!!","review":"I have never heard a worse performance of Verdi's Requiem and I think the great composer would turn in his grave if he listened to this crime against his masterpiece. Fleming and Bocelli are miscast. Things just fail to come together. If you want a good requiem, in my opinion the best in the market is the DVD with Claudio Abbado directing and a cast that includes Angela Gheorghiu and her husband."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh please","review":"Why was this recording produced? There are multiple good recordings of Verdi's Requiem, and this cannot compete with them. Gergiev's operatic tendancies do him well here, but the orchestra isn't quite up to it. The etheral, religous sections lack passion and the full roar of the orchestra is a littel anemic. For sure, Fleming and Borodina sound very good, and D'Arcangelo holds his own. The worst part of the recording is anytime Bocelli sings. He is a pop star that sings Italian, not an opera singer. His entraces are crude, his tone weak, and his contribution to the piece is zilch. There really are many other recordings that are better than this, and this version should be avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"This rendition of Verdi's requiem is unacceptable","review":"I agree with many people who have a problem with Andrea Bocelli. Surely, they could have chosen a much better tenor, like Jose Carerras or Roberto Alagna. Renee Fleming does have a charming voice, and Borodina has great depth in her emotion, but these two don't seem to fit as a balanced cast in this requiem by Verdi. And personally, I prefer Gergiev conducting the Russian operas, not an Italian piece.All in all, I wouldn't recommend this version of Verdi's requiem to anyone. Bocelli is just not operatic with his voice. He should stick with his Pop music and stay away from Puccini, Donizetti, etc.I would recommend conductor Emil Tabakov's version, with singers Romanko, Ombuena, and de Grandis. As long as the CD on Capriccio Records doesn't run out of stock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run away. Run far, far away","review":"I FINALLY got around to listening to this recording after a friend bought it out of curiosity. Oh my. I realize this was at the height of the Andrea Bocelli craze, but the Verdi Requiem? Sacrilege.There are so many things wrong with his performance, it's hard to begin. First, the vocal quality is amateurish - he is obviously amplified. His pitch is questionable, his phrasing odd and his diction sloppy. I've heard other Bocelli recordings and even his Italian is bad!Renee Fleming, as always, is magnificent. The other singers are adequate, as is the orchestra. Nothing inspiring.In short, it sounds like a high school student won a contest to sing with the big kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"The weakest point of this recording is, Bocelli!","review":"The Orchestra and the conductor did a great job on this CD, but Bocelli's sound doesn't have enough dept for such a great piece that Verdi composed. If you heard the Karajan, Mutti or Solti recordings, you can feel the main difference. Bocelli doesn't have operatic voice like Domingo or Pavarotti. So this is very worng idea that choose him for sing in this piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like Bocelli...","review":"To save time I will put it simple. If you are a fan of Bocelli you might enjoy this recording. However, if you are a fan of good singing don't waste your time. The soprano voices in the choir also drown out all the others. An all around poor recording. Shamefull."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the overlooked","review":"I still say to this day this was and still is one of the best games of it's day.

Oh, and sense there seems to be some confusion, the song the girl plays in the scene with spacey is 'Don't Let it Bring you Down', by Neil Young.

It was well worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a workout","review":"It's not good as a workout. I feel like this DVD functions more to give you ideas of how to stretch throughout the day rather than as an actual workout. The seated stretch section could be useful for the elderly. I did like some of the stretches but I thought it was going to be a workout and it wasn't. The instructor just doesn't get much in for each ten minute segment and each section is so specialized that I thought it was kind of all over the place.

They are creative and expertly played. The sound quality is excellent. All the instruments are recorded very clearly. The musicians have a natural felicity for this music. I had never heard them before and now play them regularly. You will enjoy them as well if you like the classical period. As the back of the CD states: \\"Admired by Haydn and at one time a colleague of the young Beethoven, Romberg was a prolific composer...brilliantly elaborated and expressively condensed four movement compositions, illustrate the freshness of Romberg's musical language, with its use of dance movements and variations on well-known melodies...\\" You will not regret this purchase, especially at this low price.

It's so sad to see Mark Matousek spent most of his life searching for his father who had abandoned him when he was 4 years old, and not finding him, but to have to give up his hope on him. I can relate to the dysfunctional family and abandonment issues, so this book really spoke to me and help me deal with these issues. In this deeply moving book, Matousek wrote about his friends, lovers, and his abusive mother while pursuing his career and hope to locate his father."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Oversight or an Omission","review":"This strange history of Christianity either overlooks or omits all account of the relationship between Judaism and Christianity from the moment of origins through the medieval and modern periods. As a popularized history, it chooses not to delve deeply into theology, but it is strange that it offers nothing about the influence of religious, cultural, and social differences between Judaism and Jews, and Christianity and Christian on the history of the latter. This history of Christianity resembles what might have been the story of its past if the early Church had decided to omit the Holy Scriptures from the Bible and pretended that Jews ceased to exist after the Crucifixion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of information.","review":"I have not read the entire book, but it does contain all the information I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not top quality","review":"My husband wasn't happy with these hammers.

However, the knife is next to useless - it looks like it should cut well, but the edge is very dull and because it is not serrated, you have to saw at your food to get it to cut. We used it on a Calzone made with pizza crust and ended up having to hold the crust with the fork and tear the pieces off with our hands. NOT good. Will not order these again unless they find a way to make these cool-looking knives actually cut! And the spoons seem very shallow - we didn't really need them for dessert, but I would think for something like ice cream or something with any liquid to it, they would tend to drip over the sides as they are relatively flat. As the pieces all are, attractive - but that doesn't trump usefulness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless utelsils, will crack when dry and can't be washed!","review":"These utensils cant be washed in the dishwasher or submerged in the sink.

I originally bought them because I like how bamboo is an environmentally sustainable material, and I do not like to use plastic.

An eye patch relieves the problem. This eyepatch has a tented shape that clears my eyelashes when I blink. It also fits under my glasses reasonably well. The only weak point is that on my face the light seal around the edge of the eye patch is not 100%. But it's good enough. They are sold in quantity 2, which is good since they are easy to lose!

I was at a conference recently where we went straight from standing out in the sun to trying to navigate a really dim lecture hall full of stairs and found out that it really does help: I switch the eyepatch to the other eye and my previously covered eye is already adjusted to the low light of the room, seeing to it that I was the only one who didn't stumble around trying to find their seat.

However, it actually isn't compatible when it comes to reinstalling the harmonic balancer. The problem is that Ford's 4.0L engine requires a very long M12 x 90 mm threaded bit in order to reach the crankshaft threads for reinstallation. OTC went cheapo and the M12 bit they provide is nowhere near long enough to catch any of the threads. I ended up just using the old balancer bolt to get the balancer on, and then I torqued in the new bolt. Very disappointing...the item is well made, but heck...there are how many million vehicles on the road that use Ford's 4.0L V-6, and OTC couldn't be bothered to give you a bit that was just 1 inch longer?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"It takes way to long to pull the balancers off.

It presents and, more importantly, *compares* some *real* toolkits that can actually be used to develop agent systems, something that I have not seen in any other book. The methodology chapter tied the toolkits and architecture chapters together by showing how you can start to design a real system, while the standards and technology chapters nicely complemented the rest of the information in the book and provided good pointers to follow up.

The good thing is that it's a novella, so it's a fairly quick read. It's a solid story with some surprising depth behind it. The bad part is that a lot of the story seems to be a showcase of how gross the authors can get. It almost feels like a competition between the two authors to see who can come up with a more disgusting scene. At times, things are so ridiculous, I just had to laugh at this nonstop freakshow.

A sampler disc arrived with a Gramophone magazine and it took me some time to get around to listening to it, thinking that he was \\"just another counter-tenor\\". However, it became apparent very quickly that Yoshikazu Mera is not \\"just another counter-tenor\\". His voice floats, it soars. It is haunting, sometimes it seems to come from another world. I have also listened to his Baroque recordings, but this disc (as well as the recent \\"Romance\\") sets Mera apart from the other counter-tenors. The material on \\"Nightingale\\" is very evocative and Mera paints beautiful pictures with the shadings in his voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music If Familiar Vocals","review":"Some may be put off by the obvious influences of Bob Dylan,Tom Waits, Nick Cave and Benjamin Smoke on Joe Pena's vocal stylings. But others will find this equally attractive, especially as the music that accompanies Pena's singing is similar -- particularly with Dylan's later albums -- and just as good. It could even be argued that the music on this disc is better and more solid in quality than most of these artist's output. If you are fans of any of them, you really deserve to check Greyhound Soul out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not since the doors!","review":"Not since THE DOORS have I heard anything this good! With me, the cut RAIN is one of the greatest rock tunes ever recorded! Some of the other stuff is not bad, and I love the instrumentals--but, man, oh man, RAIN is unbelievable. Makes me wish I could belt out a tune like that. You might think, for a while there, that it's Dylan rockin', or Jim Morrison or even Tom Waits (Cause the singer sounds a bit like them)--but it can't be and it isn't--because Joe Pena, the vocalist is an original. I can't say enough. Rock with a bluesy flavor. The tune blew me away. I haven't been able to stop playing it for three days now. You get the feeling there's more great stuff to come from Greyhound Soul. Drummer is topnotch, guitar playing, organ, etc. Makes you love Rock 'n Roll again--just when you thought rock was dead and buried."},{"rating":"2","title":"It feels like it's raining everyday in that desert town","review":"Perhaps still not reaching their potential. This band might be the best unknown band in the world. This record is better than 90% or more of the music you will hear on the radio, yet it still is pretty weak compaired to what you will hear if you see this band play live. On an average night, Joe Pe?a will rock you like it's the first time you ever heard music. He'll puncture your soul with feeling and emotion locked in with a band so tight you'll want to put a ring on it's finger. This record is just a half drop of a $800.00 bottle of wine.

I like the song Headhunter a whole lot, Night Wolf is superb, and so is Eat the Rich. But by far my favorite part of this Krokus album is White Din/Russian Winter. This little mini-suite really evokes a time of revolution. We Americans, I think, sometimes don't have a sense of history like Swiss people do. I think the Swiss people like to look at the history of the world from their neutral stance, and I think Krokus got at the insanity of the 1917 revolution with these songs. I actually gives me the shivers everytime I hear them. I think everyone should buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for 80's metal collectors","review":"This is the best Krokus album ever. This is a must have for any 80's metal collector!

Yes I know they are classicly trained but what they might have in chops they don't have in real emotion musically. This record is all over the place.

It would be neat if they could include some of their native songs, such as the one they played on 60 miutes. It was lively and so well done and fit right in with their country songs.

Those dissonant places; where we feel doubt, where we fear our convictions, where we feel alone in our faith, are not ignored, but revered and expressed by this composer in his music.

These sonnets tackle every aspect of love; from Platonic love to friendship, to abandonment and disappointment to the loss of loved ones. It is rare that a book can make me cry, but I often found myself weeping as I read some to the sonnets, and smiling deep within as I read others. You can not read love Vignettes without being affected.At times I found the sonnets a bit too personal, and some were a little sappy, yet I found myself identifying with the thoughts conveyed. The ending couplets in each of the sonnets always conveyed a deeper message: \\"Frindship's not to be had by possession/But by making an inward concession\\", is one of my favority couplets.

I took one star off of this album because at a few points on the album he doesn't make any sense, and at other points he rehashes some old schticks we've all heard before. The good thing is that he does branch out on this album and performs a couple of comedy songs which are really different from the song on Raw Hamburger.

Maybe that's why my hopes were too high for this study guide. It is very cerebral and dry. I agree that a deep understanding of Scripture is important, but I also would hope that there would be a more practical, direct approach to learning from Jesus than is presented here. Most of the exercises and \\"lessons\\" are very internal and academic. The early chapters in particular seem more oriented towards learning \\"about\\" Jesus than learning how to live your life from him. With all the best intentions, I believe this workbook to be too narrow and not \\"beginner\\" friendly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent knife, especially for cutting vegetables","review":"The KAI Shun Pro Nakiri knife is really an excellent kitchen product for traditionally styled Japanese chefs and average cooks alike. This knife, like all of the Shun knives, is extremely sharp; Shun knives are at least as sharp as Global knives, albeit with much more comfortable handles. This is as good as it gets when it comes to chopping up large vegetables, but will also work for mincing onions or dicing garlic cloves. Although it looks somewhat like a meat cleaver, it really is not intended to be used as such; if you are looking for a knife that will cut both meat and vegetables, the Shun Classic santoku knife may be more your thing. Also, please note that the blade on a nakiri knife is one-sided, and may be awkward for some tasks. If you want a great knife for splitting large vegetables such as pumpkins or squash, however, than this is your knife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great even for a left-hander","review":"This knife is incredibly sharp right out of the box. I had some trepidation about using it, because I'm left-handed (they've since come out with a left-handed version, but it didn't exist when I got mine a year and a half ago), but I haven't had a problem. I use it for vegetables, fruit, and herbs, and occasionally for non-bony meat, and it's an excellent slicer. Although it looks like a cleaver, it should not be used like one; it'd be a shame to wreck such a beautiful knife.. The knife is beautifully finished and fits my medium-sized hand perfectly. This is the first Shun knife I've had, but it will not be the last.

Some of the actors seem bored with their role. Also the scene with the three teenagers (two female, one male) speaking about how large they are/like it to be is rather...well the acting is so bad it really should have been left out. The first half of the movie is rather slow considering it shows one sexual encounter after another until the two main characters meet.The movie does show some interesting techniques to ummm deal with the main characters' issues but aside from a few of those we found rather funny (and I am not sure they were ment to be funny) that was pretty much all we got out of it. So we gave it one star for the humor and the other star was for the view from her vagina. That was indeed a first for us.We watched it and it wasn't something we enjoyed enough to watch again.

Starting with Basket Case (ok, the sequels weren't the greatest), then Brain Damage, then Frankenhooker. If you like these kind of B horror flicks, then you should be able to appreciate what he did with Bad Biology.In many ways he outdoes his previous works. Not by more blood or gore or violence, but with a great idea that turns male and female sexuality into a horrorshow. Of course there is some blood, gore and violence but that's not the highlight in Bad Biology.Give this one a chance. You'll be hooting at some of the dark humor, dialogue and scenes. Bad Biology is not perfect but, like all Henenlotter films, if you've got a taste for his work you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another forgotten classic......","review":"Well, here's another fine album that I hadn't listened to in many years, and am now kicking myself for not getting it on CD sooner.

The fact that Grey and his warrior's time travelled to the present six years ago and are already acclimated to this century was a plus.I only had two problems with this book. One: Morgan was still a bit too \\"13th\\" century. He should have learned by Grey and Grace's relationship that in \\"modern\\" times you don't order a woman around and make her decisions for her.

The first book was imaginative, fast-paced, with a complex hero torn between his medieval roots and the need to adapt to the modern world in order to survive. This 2nd book, however, features a hero who still acts as if he lives in the 13th century, a heroine whose obsession with her scarred back makes her extremely one dimensional, and a plot that's yawn-inducing.

For the book explains the hardships of the insect's nymphal life, it enemies, and about its brief existence above the ground. The author also explains some of his scientific notes as the book's conclusion as well as explaining the \\"Brood\\" which the book's story evolves. I first read this book at the age of 11 which opened my eyes and ears to summer's little tree musicians.

I wouldn't have had such a hard time if the author would pick a position and stand with it. The flaws in his logic and his conclusions were too obvious not to laugh at. For example Bloom says \\"this Jewish spiritual genius [Jesus]\\" then in the next paragraph says \\"We again know nothing verifiable about what Jesus taught.\\" How do you qualify the opinion that he was a spiritual genius if you don't have a clue what he taught?Bloom does like to use big words which was great.

Bloom's elaboration of the ideas of course makes you think a lot, but not too long into this book, I realized it would not do much more than toss around thoughts I had mostly already had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bloom Forever","review":"Critics of this book find deep fault with Bloom's grasp of Biblical history, research, archaeology, and biblical scholasticism in general. Bloom's mission here it seems to me is to apply critical thinking to the writings of the Christian New Testament. Bloom airs his own ideas in a kind of poetic, Joycean stream, and at the same time, points out the very many contraditions and oddities that the various authors of the books of the bible indulge in. Bloom is the anti-Sunday school teacher--as children we are taught to simply accept Biblical teachings without thought or critical thinking. As educated adults, Bloom leads us on a field trip through the Bible, focusing on Yahweh, Jesus, and bringing in his old favorite, Hamlet, as a talking point--Bloom's wide, deep and ferocious grasp of western civilization, literature, and critical thinking inspire the reader to question, argue, and re-think his or her fondly held beliefs regarding the Jesus of the gospels. An invaluable work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult","review":"Unless you have spent the past thirty years studying theology AND Shakespeare, you won't have a clue what Bloom is talking about.

While sonicly they do have some common threads to bands like Radiohead, Coldplay , and U2; Pilate is without question a completely fresh, new entity.My personal favorite track is \\"Alright.\\" It is a haunting masterpiece of jangly guitars and Bono-esque vocals. Other favorites include Endgame, Melt Into Your Walls, Mercy, Fall Down, Perfect Thrill, Overated, The Travell Song... I could go on. But of course \\"Into Your Hideout\\" (their first single and most mainstream piece of music) will always have a special place in my heart as it was the song that first grabbed me and pulled me into the world of music that is Pilate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...This is one of the GREATEST CD's I've heard!","review":"A buddy of mine from work recommended that I take a listen to Pilate...He claimed they were \\"amazing\\".

Undoubtedly, listeners who fancy themselves critics will throw out Radiohead's name when trying to scrounge for Pilate's influencers, but that's okay - consider it a compliment to singer Todd Clark's vocal abilities.

These danzas require EXTREME Left hand control of technique along with many colors and swing. I as a Cuban know this very well. I have never heard these pieces played better. Tirino's HUGE technique, beautiful sound, varied phrasing, and delicate subtelties never fail to amaze the listener-its incredible. Forget any negative comments-they are silly, stupid and uniformed. A better pianist, and better playing of this music you will never, EVER hear. If you want the best recordings of Lecuona's music, Tirino's series on the BIS label is IT.

Not only is this book filled with typos, I found this to be more of a brain dump than a professional, organized tutorial. We are asked to read pages and pages of the most mundane concepts and wordy explanations, and then are left out in the cold when it gets down and dirty -- key steps and definitions are just missed entirely. The first animation lessons are totally inconsistent and vague, and then the author goes so far to say \\"by now you're an expert!\\" Right.

Not only that, it looks like the author never actually finished the site. There are references there to tutorials that were supposed to have been put on the site years ago, which like the files your lessons are supposed to access, are simply not there.Up through Lesson 8, I thought the book was fine and thought it did a nice job of teaching a fairly tricky subject.

The treatment of actionscript is... well abrupt. She covers functions, variables, loops, syntax and other important issues in less than 4 pages.Your head will definitely spin on that one.There are some good points in terms of resources and an overview of Flash features, but this text was worse in its treatment of Flash as a tutorial.

Wil writes in a frank, honest manner that draws you in and connects. I found myself identifying on several of those pages, and then he would make me laugh out loud with his wonderful humor. Wil shows us that he is really just an \\"everyman\\", suffering all the same emotions and hardships that we do, he just happened to be on this little show called \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"a good read","review":"when you have some free time or when you just like to read, this is a good book to have.

But be sure you have a few hours to spare first! The time you spend will be well worth it.Even if you have only the mildest or even no interest in either Star Trek or computers, this is essentially a book about coming to terms with who you are, even when that isn't who you thought you were - and also recognising your past as being a part of who you are, as well.There is a great deal of promise here for more books by Will Wheaton. Make it so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wil delivers a great point of view","review":"It's always refreshing to read material written by somebody who gives it to you \\"straight up\\". Wil doesn't hold any punches in this book, he is always acknowledging his faults and his triumphs- which is a great quality in a person. The vast majority of us tend to think that actors have it very easy. Well, maybe a few do, but most don't. Wil writes from the perspective of an actor who has had ups and downs in his career... and after reading his book, most people may get a better idea of what goes on behind closed doors in Hollywood and in Wil's more personal world."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!!","review":"Mr. Mailman brought JAG to my door exactly 2 hours ago.

There must be some metal in the glaze, as if you try to make tea in one of these cups, it will get so hot that you will not be able to pick it up. Same goes for heating up anything on a plate. This is a really bad feature for dishware and I'm sure it's not good for your microwave.I've been regretting buying these for a year now, and hope I can save somebody else the mistake.

Some mugs are too large (just make another cup if you want another) and some are way too small. They are also fairly light-weight - not that heavy diner stoneware. This is in between and should suffice any need. Best thing is there is no staining inside like there is in lighter color mugs and there is no logo or design. The best things are kept simple!

I have been a Tool fan since their first EP, but this is the biggest let down I have experienced in music. There is no passion in the lyrics. It almost seems like this album is B-sides. You are paying for three to four songs at the most. I think Maynard put more effort into A Perfect Circle and eating his cereal than in this album. I have had it since the release date and I still don't like it after days of usage. This is the first Tool album I have to turn off. I can't listen to it from start to end.

Lots of instrumental [stuff] and disjointed noise. The case design is innovative, but that is not always a good thing (anyone remember Pearl Jam's vs. case?).

Tool have gone for an ambient approach on Lateralus. Stretch out about 3 minutes worth of music into about 9 or 10 minutes of tedium. None of these songs have any hooks nor do they have any mind blowing instrumentation. They are just................long...............and...bland. It's like they are just jamming in slow motion. Hit a tom there, strum a chord here, pluck a couple of bass notes. Maynard asks \\"Have we reached 10 minutes yet?\\" ...Adam Jones looks at his watch. Maynard sounds like he recorded the vocals in about 15 minutes in between touring with A Perfect Circle.

It's apparantly one of those records that you really have to listen to again and again in order to appreciate. This doesn't excuse it from the monotonous and useless transitional tracks, or the fact that none of these songs are good enough to have been on either of the first three albums, but songs like Schism, The Grudge, Parabola and Lateralis make this album worth borrowing (still not worth buying yourself). Still a fan, but this album was definitely not worth waiting 5 years for. At least the pitiful and shamefully commercial Salival had all the videos on DVD as reason to purchase it. This record has no such redemption."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain ...","review":"Tool's return has not been worth the wait. This CD is just plain self-indulgent. And when it's not self-indulgent, it's just flat out boring.Does Maynard really think that anyone wants to listen to a three minute, static-filled phone call, where someone is reporting an alien siting to the authorities?

Sort Of","review":"The long wait for Tool to come out with new material was well worth Lateralus' subtle, yet emotionally charged music. Indeed, in many respects, it is difficult to imagine that the same band that produced Aenima, Salival, and Undertow could be capable of Lateralus, which defies description. I've been a Tool fan long before Lateralus was released, and I still love to rock out to the earlier albums, but Lateralus has a different effect - brooding, meditative, it taps into streams of emotion without having to flush them out in typical nu-metal style. The thought-provoking lyrics of \\"Schism,\\" the emptiness and longing of \\"The Patient,\\" and the spirituality of \\"Lateralus\\" alone make this album worth the money. But these are just the beginning. It seems that Tool has reinvented itself as a band. Same name, but their \\"game\\" is on a whole new level."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG DISSAPOINTMENT","review":"I like tool's music, i'm not a huge fan but i have the albums and was genuinely looking forward to hearing the new album. I like a different sort of tool to most people - i like the tool songs like 'Crawl Away', 'Sweat', 'Intolerence' and 'Eulogy'. I don't like the songs like 'third eye' or 'disgustipated'. What i am basically trying to say that i am unnapreciative of ...their new album. It's boring and there a basically no proper songs on there there is now 'prison sex' or 'stinkfist' on this album. ....If you're new to tool, buy 'opiate' or 'undertow' instead...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Justification for (...).","review":"They were once great, but, this is a joke. Where are the songs? This CD contains barely three or four songs! The rest are just random sound effects/noise and song \\"fragments\\", that's not ART, that's unfinished work! Tool has now joined the ranks of those talented bands who have turned their backs on the roots of their success. If you don't believe me, listen to Ticks&Leeches again. They're yelling at the Record Execs and Producers! This CD is just a vehicle for their angst against the record company. If Tool set out to make a junky, unfinished, unlistenable record... they've Succeeded! I say DON'T BUY it, and maybe next time they'll have to return to making real music (or they won't get a contract). We certainly don't need more releases like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak a huge dissappointment","review":"The only reason to buy this cd is for its booklet, it is the only good thing about Lateralus. As for the songs, they are all a letdown. The lyrical content drops from the previous albums greatly, and could have been written by anyone over the age of 7. As for the music, what was once innovative has been traded for repetitiveness. A prime example is schism, which is like 6 minutes of the same sorry guitar riff on repeat.Tool peaked at aenima."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull...","review":"I must say, I'm baffled by the overwhelmingly positive reviews this album has received on this site. Aenima is perhaps the best album I have ever heard, so I had high expectations for Lateralus...I bought it the day it was released, and was immediately disappointed.I listened to it many times, forcing myself to give it a chance even though I had to constantly fight the urge to turn it off. It never did grow on me.Dull. Boring. Songs that stretch on mindlessly...just length for the sake of length. What has happened to my favorite band?!?!

This release is stale, monotonous, and repetitive. It seems that the members of Tool were more involved with the packaging than with the music. Of course, to the masses, \\"Laterlus\\" will be hailed as a masterpiece.Tool does nothing new, nothing innovative, nothing gripping. The cd is frankly one big potpourri of songs ripped off from their own library of music.After having to swallow the muck \\"LATERLUS\\" has to offer, listening to the earlier material becomes increasingly more difficult because after the mystique they had created as a band, how can one take them seriously now?"},{"rating":"1","title":"hong ming ling ching ning sing jing","review":"hong ming ling ching ning sing jing ling bong bing zing nong dong tong ring ting ling ning zing fing hing fong jong kong tong ling ming ning sing kring fling sling ning ting ying lng ming!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I'm just not smart enough to enjoy this","review":"I don't see how so many people love this band.

Maybe you have to get high before you listen in to it to really understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS OF 2001","review":"Tool's latest album, Lateralus, is a tight, complex weave of incredible sound. It's almost like the album is all one song. \\"Ticks & Leeches\\" reminded me of an earlier \\"Opiate\\" Tool band. \\"Parabol\\" and \\"Parabola\\" are both reflections of each other, creating one of their tightest tracks yet. Tool is known for wrapping up their albums well--and they make no mistake with \\"Triad\\" and the eeire \\"Faaip De Oiad\\" to polish it off. And, of course, you can't forget the other eight tracks either. I'm only making highlights. It's well worth the wait after 5 years. Good job guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tool has made a huge evolution...","review":"And it's a great change. The songs in this album are considerably logner and yet still more enjoyable. While much of the Cd is filler tracks, the true songs are great. My favorite Tool song of all time is \\"Lateralis\\". The songs no onger have the sameness they did in the prior records, andit takes some getting used to, but the new style is great. This is not a \\"sell out\\", this is an evolution and an improvement. Don't get me wrong, Undertow is still one of my favorite albums, but this is just more varied and engaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"...a long wait...but well worth it","review":"This CD has been on my mind for a long time, and finally I got it today. I have already listened to it twice and can say it is just as good as I had hoped. The CD starts out with a blistering song called \\"The Grudge\\". When you get this CD, crank up the volume right away cause this song throws bolts!! The already relaeased \\"Schism\\" is so good and the music is addictive. The last three tracks are one momentus excape into another world! BUY IT NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tool at there best","review":"Opiate, Undertow, Aenima, Salival, all excelent albums. How do they expect to top them? They dont. All Tool is concerned with is making music that speaks to them. And then the music speaks to all. That being said Lateralus is brilliance. Perhaps not what you would expect from Tool. But who really knows what to expect. Maynards volcals are better than ever. The songs are long and involved perhaps the only thing you can really expect from them. All in all I give this the highest recomendation. And if your new to Tool, I definatly recomend all the other albums from this brilliant band. Take the time to listen to rock at its best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd","review":"This cd has many classic tool sounds, but has lots of new stuff that is really awesome. One thing i do not like about some of the songs is that maynard's voice isn't genuine, it sort of has a little edge on it in some of the songs. Nonetheless, it still deserves 5 stars. If u are a fan of tool already, this is a great new cd by tool, if u want to get into tool, buy undertow or aenima."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE review","review":"This album, as Aenima before it, is a perfectly firing synapse. Both are immediately identifiable. Lateralus is a train of thought upon genius rails. If you can't understand this, then you were not listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lyrical Masterpiece","review":"A Lyrical masterpiece, but not a musical god. Undertow had the anger in the music and the lyrics. Lateralus has angry lyrics somewhat, more meaningful. I didnt hear anysongs like nema, other than The Grudge, I didnt hear anysongs that were powerful and shorter like Stinkfist, and i didnt hear much stuff like Sober, with the meaningful screaming. I cant listen to Schism because its overplayed on the radio. Tool was better underground.. Listen to Opiate."},{"rating":"2","title":"lateraus","review":"I got this cd for christmas, and still i'm listening to it.Although it does get kinda boring and repetitive in some songsthat still doesent make it a bad album. first off you get intothe grudge whicth is a pretty cool song. then it fades intoeon blue apocalypse, imo should of been longer whicth would ofmade it more of an intersting song but hauntingly beautifullwith its finger picking. now on farther with the rest of the cdI personaly like the slow soft parabol fading into the hardparabola. now imo one of tools worst songs to dat is ticks&leeches, NOTE: maynerd, what were you thinking? the rest of thecd is for you to jugde."},{"rating":"2","title":"CDU","review":"It has been a long time and waiting for some new tool.

If you liked their last album this one won't disappoint you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tool is back!!!","review":"...Tool is the one true constant left in hard rock (a point made blatantly clear by the release of Lateralus). The album starts out with what may be the best track on the CD in Cornerstone and doesn't let up until Disposition. You'll hear elements of both Undertow and Aenema all rapped up into a shiny, new, more polished case. If you liked both of the previous two CD's, Lateralus will blow you away. It's absolutely rediculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"This is probably one of, if not the best CD I have ever heard. I bought this with extremely high expectations, but it surpassed those by leaps and bounds. I thought that Tool would not be able to surpass the monolithic expectations for this album and topple the greatness of Aenima, but they proved me very wrong. Every track is amazing. Please buy this CD. Everyone should hear this album. After just a few listens, I believe this to be Tool's greatest work, and since Tool has been my favorite group since '94, and that is NO small complement. Essential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing like a long wait...","review":"This is not the Tool we were expecting. Its better. More refined, mature, and sounding like they needed to get something off their collective backs. I am amazed at how melodic and soulful a few of the tracks sound, then I get my head blown off by the next one. Sounds like Tool to me. We waited a long time for this one, It was worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Melting Pot","review":"This is definitely not the Tool of the previous albums, this is a mellower, but deeper Tool. This album is not as harsh on the ears as the previous albums. It would seem that alot of the feel of A Perfect Circle has melded into Tool's sound--in a good way.What we have here is a balance between silence and noise, a delicate balance where the space between the peaks and valleys of sound are enormous. The rage intersplices with the meditative in such a way that gives both multiple levels or more depth and meaning. The silence finally shattered by the noise--the noise ultimately stopped by the silence.Keep listening. It get's better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"Short and Simple: One of the best new CDs i've heard in ages. I'm not into any of the 'current' metal/rock music. I tend to just stick with my trusty Rollins, NIN and Pumpkins CDs for visceral artistic value, or Metallica when I just want lead-veined thrash. I took a leap on this album and was pleasantly surprised. Favorite Tracks: The Grudge, Parabol/Parabola, Lateralus. I really like the lyrics and sound to these songs. The whole CD is outstanding, really. Only track I don't care much for is the last one (which doesn't actually qualify as a song anyhow), which is a little too pretentious and silly even for art-metal, but even it is tolerable. To sum it up... if you're looking for mindless pop metal, this ain't it. If you're looking something vaguely spiritual, meaningful, artistic and yet still heavy and uncompromising... I highly recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just leave it in the cd player","review":"I love Tool. I loved every album that this band has come out with. Interestingly, I was a little let down when I first heard this album. However, after hearing it more, I must say that it is an excellent album. Tool is still better than 99.9% of any of the other bands out there these days. But, I wonder how long that will last.Tool was not so good in concert. They seemed to be just going through the motions, and took huge breaks inbetween songs - on top of all of that, they did not play an encore. They employed cool visual effects at the concert, but Maynard stayed in the shadows for the entire concert - pretty dumb. My recommendation: buy their albums, but skip the show, and wait for some new bands to emerge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent album","review":"This was the first Tool album I actually bought, as I'd used... to get MP3's before it. I had only songs from the previous albums, so the first time I played this CD, it was totally new.And man, did it blow me away.From the first mechanical griding sound right before the Grudge's guitar kicked in, through the slow revolutions of Schism, into the powerful Parabola, to the incredible title track and the final track, this album is truly incredible.Lateralus is, without a doubt, progressive rock through and through, harking back to the old band King Crimson many a time. It's a shame only Schism is being noticed the way it is, as I, and many others, find Lateralis and Parabol/a to be underrated perfection. This album is a great change from the angrier, grittier AEnima and Undertow, and it seems far more polished and, as the Amazon reviewer said, crisper and clearer. This album is worth the money, easily, and probably even more so.True gold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the best","review":"It's funny to read reviews of Tool by people that don't like them or think they haven't progressed. They haven't progressed??? Get Opiate and compare it to Lateralus, there's a huge difference. I've listened to the \\"other\\" bands. Neurois?? Please, yelling in yours songs doesn't make you brillant. They do have some good drumming and musically are on the same level as Tool. But Maynard's voice is far superior. This CD is smooth, not as great as Aenima. See these guys live and you'll see why they have such a following."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"This cd is perfect.It was worth the long wait. I don't have much more to say it's a tool cd so what do you expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"its a TOOL cd , How Can i NOT give it 5 stars ?","review":"I Must Say Ive been listening to this cd relentlessly since the day i bought it. this is an outstanding piece of art , and a must to any TOOL Fan. To Me , Lateralus is the best Tool Could get out of themselves after Aenima. im not trying to compare between the two albums , just saying it's hard to make two masterpieces in a row. ( Ask Thom York From Radiohead About The Making Of Kid A 2 Years after the beautifull O.K Computer C.d ). I Think TOOL haD really Put their soul into this one , The Music And Lyrics Are Just Breathtaking.( Buy it if u wanna find out for yourself ! ) Favourite songs : The Grudge , The Patient , Parabola , Disposition , Reflection. The Other song are excellent as well.Cant Wait To See The Schism Video On MTV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tool's Lateralus (-)(-) or (^)(^)","review":"If you are trying to make a choice to buy this album or not, I recomended buying either the first c.d.s this band has put out which are Undertow and Anemia. But if your a major Tool fan like I am I recomend this album. Long, dark, and well performed songs make this c.d. come alive. This album I would give a 4 and 1/2 on the count of some tracks aren't as good as the bands other c.d.s but still an awesome albulm espically if you are a fan of this band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo","review":"This album is an amazing work of art, both visually and musically. To be honest, i have never really listened to tool untill i bought this album on a whim. I had always gone by what other people have said about tool and i have created a very narrow minded view of them as a band. But with my new firsthand look i see that this is an incredably musical band. they arent going for totally loud headbanging metal all the time and i admire that. It takes more talent to be able to hold an audiance with music rather than volume. Dont get me wrong these guys really know how to rock! I regret being so ignorant because this is a damn good peice of work and i see myself buying more albums in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shallower","review":"I've got the new cd. I think it's more complex, strange, above the ground and lots more... But I don't think it's better than AENIMA, wich was a masterspiece. This one is not so deep, more simple in terms of sound, especially the guitar sound. And Maynard's voice, it's kinda low, and to much the same. Some times, it reminds me of Opiate, when they were just \\"kids\\" jamming riffs, and yelling also. Why doesn't Maynard speak more, like he did? I just think they will never go so deep, inside themselves, as in \\"Third Eye\\". But I like the same way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tool fails to impress me...","review":"What can I say? Lateralus simply bores me to death. I used to be a fan of Tool's. I loved AEnima, so i was pretty excited to hear that the band was releasing a new cd. Schism was a decent song upon first listen, and i was expecting better with the rest of the songs. I listened to the album a few times, I WANTED to like it. But alas, i didnt. It's such a shame. The only reason I gave this album two stars is because i like Parabola. Too bad Tool has become a victim of overhype."},{"rating":"2","title":"A haunting journey","review":"This flawless album is by far the most complex artwork we have seen in recent music history. Every song flows into the next, taking the listener from peaks to valleys. It is impossible to rate every single song on its own. This cd is not one where you can skip to your favorite track, because the true essence of what TOOL's music really is about will become blurry. The lyrics are amazing, the drumming is amazing, the atmosphere is amazing, and Maynard's voice is the most beautiful, yet haunting, voice in music today. Please do yourself a favor and pick this cd up, listen to it in a dark room, and be ready to be blown away. I never thought music could change a person's whole life perception until I gave this cd a chance. Thank you TOOL.\\"Recognize this as a holy gift and celebrate this chance to be alive and breathing.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"bravo","review":"This is the first album of it's type I have ever purchased. It's an amazing album. I'm 47 years old and never thought I'd like something like this. The album is most enjoyable as a whole. It looses something listening to individual tracks.Something about this album touches the dark side of my soul and it feels good. It's a perfect mixture of anger, testosterone, melody and power; and it's put together well. The melodies are carefully constructed and there is just enough harmony to add a gentleness to the composition. Just like The Verve and Urban Hymes, I will enjoy listening to earlier stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened!?!?","review":"I guess I expected too much after listening to Undertow and Aenima. I found this cd to be very bland and too repititive. It sounded to me as if they sampled parts of songs from their previous recordings and stretched them out for 8 minutes. A little to ambient for me. I hope they get back to kickin out jams like Intolerance and Stinkfist on their next effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good listen, \\"The Grudge\\" is where it is all at.","review":"Although not one of my top ten favorite albums, this terrific disc does contain my ABSOLUTE favorite song, the ferocious \\"The Grudge\\". \\"The Grudge\\" is so good, in fact, that the momentum from this singular masterpiece lasts until the beginning of \\"Ticks and Leeches\\". If \\"The Grudge\\" was not included on Lateralus, I doubt that the album would be even considered a positive experience in music listening.This is a good listen indeed. If you're not into the whole intellectual conceptualizing of Tool albums, just keep in mind that Tool can rock pretty damn hard, and are incapable of delivering unoriginal riffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!!","review":"i totally love this cd. the best one tool has made, in my opinion! : ) great price and delivery time, thanks amazon! love the graphics and art on this cd as well! oh how i love everything about this cd!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A great album on a not-so-great-medium.","review":"Lateralus is my favorite rock/metal album of all-time. I thought it was about time to get a vinyl version. However, I was extremely disappointed with the sound of this album in picture-disc format. There is an extreme amount of surface noise on the record which includes a constant background hiss and way too many pops and clicks for a new record. In addition, the more complex passages of the album (heavier, louder and layered) sound distorted.It was only after I listened to the record that I really started to research picture discs. In general they are thought to be sub-par sounding and only meant for display. I would agree with this assessment.Do yourself a favor and go with traditional vinyl whenever possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"........Thank you TOOL","review":"Are these guys the last of the Mohicans?...........Can artist's STOP singing for money and just sing for the ART......."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really respect tool","review":"Anyway i think a perfect circle much better than tool.although i have all of tool's album.This is good album.You can buy it.I really respect this band.All of my friend respect tool.Nobody believe this is bad album.A lot of musician of new metal also like this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"I prefer Aenima but still strongly recommend it","review":"I prefer Aenima's darkness and angst over Lateralus's intraspective complex style. This is a great album and definately different from Aenima."},{"rating":"2","title":"--------------------------------","review":"I know by giving this album 4 stars I'll just be considered a sheep or MTV fanboy or whatever but I dont care. I am tired of reading review for cds with people saying \\"Oh all the little nu-metal generation kids will love this but only them and only because they think it is cool.\\" I listen to music for my self and no one else and I dont need corporate rock radio and MTV to tell me what it cool and what it not.This CD is OK by Tool standards but certainly nothing incredible. Musically they are advancing but Maynards lyrics are kind of bland and cookie cutter. My favorite track is Ticks and Leeches. just because cannible corpse and nile and stuff can drum at hyper speed doesnt make them talented. The worst track is probably the last with a bunch of static and some guy talking about area 51. dont buy this just because you're linkin park buddie says its cool but if you are a tool fan or music lover pick it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Dare You!!!","review":"I can't believe anyone would call Tool boring as \\"donkey poop\\".... Tool is an experiacne it's not music in my mind it's a being..... Being a fan of Tool for about 5 years I have gone long distances to experiance there unigue sound and vibe. To anyone who would have a negative word for Tool I say eat your own words and don't say a thing.... thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"good cd with good music","review":"this cd is a good cd if u like that kind of music. 6 of thesongs are pretty much just music and about 2 minutesthe last song is a weird song with them talking about getting abducted.shcism is a great song and so is the grudge. they have that hard rock edgethat is a great mix of rock metal and good music. parabola is a great rock song and so is lateralus the title track. every song has great music annd that creepy metal feeling. if u like rock metal then u should get this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tool's \\"Best Yet\\"","review":"Tool are talented musicians, confident in what they do. The new album couldn't really be anything other than what it is, because Tool is Tool and the music that is Tool seems to emanate autonomously from the band members. It is natural, this album, and can be described no other way. I believe Lateralus is head and shoulders above Aenima, but of course that's just me. Progression is natural when a band is artistically unpretentious...Lateralus is alive as opposed to stagnant and reified. Lateralus is becoming as opposed to become. Also, the liner notes in my copy smell GREAT."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best I have ever heard!","review":"Wow! Incredible. The people that gave this 5 stars are completely right! Listen with your soul, not your mind - and this becomes a moving experience. Tool has a gift and it is evident here. They tap into what's important, they tap into something new. I am not a big Tool fan from way back but I must say that this recording ranks as one of the most unique ever. Brilliant in it's flow and emotion. It is perfect.I love all types of music and this recording by Tool is by far one of the most progressive recordings I have ever heard by any artist.I want to get in a room with Maynard and ask him how he and his bandmates create something like this because it worked. It worked like nothing else I ever had heard. It flowed so perfecly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Majestic Superintelligent Album","review":"No amount of words from the english volcabulary can describe the wonders of Tool. Their fourth album lateralus was worth the five wait after Anemia. Maynard's experience from A Perfect Circle really has influenced and improved his vocals and it shows in lateralus. Danny has also emphasised his drumming by the use of his double kick more in this album since opiate. Also Adams amazing spectacular riffs have given this album the TOOL factor also bass player Justin obviously has been practising as his bass playing in this album is outstanding. Overall Lateralus is an album suited best to those who have been listening to tool for a whole, those who just started liking Tool as a band it is a wise choice to start with opiate and then the following three albums, to really experience the incredible sound of what is Tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"noones' opinion","review":"this is definitly the coolest album tool has released with the exeption of aenema, of course.

GET THIS ALBUM!"},{"rating":"2","title":"xtc420 TOOL is GOD!!","review":"Definitly worth the wait. I've been a TOOL fan since the opiate days, and have to say that TOOL is God. The day I bought this album I went camping and played this album while stareing at the fire all night. The band has evolved so much but they still retain their uniqueness that makes them who they are. This album will take you to another demension so I suggest taking the time to sit back and devote your complete attention to the Reverand and see why TOOL fans call them GOD! If you buy this album even as a new TOOL listener I guarantee you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Album","review":"Lateralus is an excellent album. This can only be expected since Tool has not put out an album for six years. I would not go as far as to say it was as good of an album as Aenima, but nothing can compare to Aenima. Lateralus was mixed brilliantly and it has a sound that can only be described as perfect. I would recomend this album to anyone who was interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn.....","review":"This is your typical Tool album. Tool is quite possibly the most overhyped/overrated band since Nirvana. The have a good vocalist, and write excellent lyrics but the music overall...well it just fails. They've been around for over a decade and haven't really altered their supposed \\"genre-redefining\\" sound. It's all the same, the quiet to harsh vocal stylings, the percussive guitar/bass playing, the only thing that changed is the drumming which sometimes can get pretty interesting. Tool's typical flaws are here as well. The redudant, often mundane guitar playing, the samey-sounding songs, the 2 or 3 weak tracks that really have no purpose...Tool too often borders the line between mood setting music and boring filler BS. If you want a band that reaches the deep, mind-blowing experience Tool tries to do, try Neurosis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Progressively worse","review":"A much better band before they could afford 10,000 hours of studio time. Overproduced, meandering and lacking that hair-raising Tool crunch of old. Hooks are sparse, crescendos abandoned, more and more like Yes every album. MJK isn't into it anymore, and it shows; there's enough dull introspection on this one to fill 2 Perfect Circle records. Take me back to Undertow for the love of god. Yeah great cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brand new Tool","review":"Lateralus is going to prove to be Tool's most accessable album, I'm sure. Even though the songs average over 6 - 7 minutes each, the band's melodic sensibility has increased ten-fold over Aenima. The single, Schism, is a sprawling epic, yet still manages to hold your attention (the line \\"I know the pieces fit\\" will stick in your mind for days). Other songs on the album show Maynard's voice in top form; being exposed to Billy Howerdel's songwriting in A Perfect Circle has definately had an effect on him, and it's rubbed off onto the rest of the band, who coax some of the most memorable lines out of their instruments that they ever have.The downside of all of this is that, at times, the album isn't as hard-hitting as it could be, and the production just doesn't bring the guitar out like it should. On my first listen, I can't think of a soul-rending riff around here like the one from the title track to Aenima. Mutedness notwithstanding, this really is a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums ever","review":"Lateralus is one of the best albums ever created. Along with Dark Side of the Moon - Pink Floyd, and Led Zeppelin IV. Maynard's lyrics are so unique as is his voice, while the rest of the band backs it up with creativity and great rythm. \\"Disposition\\" maybe one of my favorite songs musically, and \\"Lateralus\\" is my favorite song on the album. Lateralus is the best we've seen from Tool, although I'm hoping that when they release their album in the fall we will see greater things."},{"rating":"1","title":"POSSIBLY THE MOST BORING OVERRATED BAND???","review":"I think this band is SO overrated, first of all why are they so geat..hmm they can play a simple riff over and over again, and its called BRILLIANT!... But seriously these guys arent anything special"},{"rating":"1","title":"Think For Yourself","review":"With all the hype of TOOL's new album, one should stop and think... If you have not been with TOOL from the begining and you find the album \\"Phenominal, brilliant, mind bending, The coming of a new dawn(?), etc.\\" more power to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I wanted","review":"I think AEnima is a really terrific album, five stars all the way, and I really like the first Perfect Circle CD, but this disc I just did not like. I know that's not a popular position, but this disc just lacks the great wicked hooks and action of earlier Tool/APC stuff. I like my rock albums to, you know, actually ROCK. And this album simply does not.It's like Tool started to read and buy into their press clippings; it's contemplative, self-indulgent art rock, almost totally edgeless. Because I liked AEnima so much, my expectations were high and this disc just completely disappointed me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Masterpiece","review":"You cannot go wrong with buying this album. I own every Tool album, and Lateralus is easily the best. It's one hour and twenty minutes of absolutely amazing music. Some songs on this cd will put your brain on another planet, and change the way you think about life.Even though this cd is long, it never seems hard to listen to or digest. I've had this album since May of 2001, and I still listen to it religiously today. This album is a CLASSIC, and no rock fans collection is complete without it. Please, if you don't already have this cd, get is A.S.A.P. If you don't, your depriving yourself of a true classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disgusted by 1 Star Reviews","review":"I have a respect for Tool that I'll probably never be able to verbally explain to anyone. All I can say is that they are masters of their instruments, and write incredible songs with emotionally/spiritually driven lyrics. If you have the brain power to explore, just read the lyrics for \\"Reflection\\". This song is especially powerful to me. The 66 and counting one star reviews disgust me. Enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insanity at its finest","review":"ALL of Tool's albums are 5 stars, we have no room to pass judgement on the band's album(s). Even Salival is out of this world. Tool is the best band by far for the past 15 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think I'm missing something...","review":"I saw a lot of stuff about how awsome and amazing TooL is and everything, so I decided to try them out. I heard Schism, and I thought it was okay, but not to great. Anyway, I've concluded that TooL is not what it's lived up to be. TooL is not very good at all, in fact, it's horrible. Totally horrible. I would not reccomend this CD to anyone at all. I was hoping TooL would be better than this, and Manyard would have a decent voice. I can't stand listening to his awful singing. Ugh. Maybe I'm missing something. Don't waste your money on TooL, and listen to something better, like Taproot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grimmace and Wince","review":"Bloated bombastic flatulent nonsense for all the tough-guy mascarad drama-queens of the neo fad age. The musical equivalent of an airport newsagency pulp fiction novel. My life and awarenesses are none the better for this pointless exercise in stadium melodrama. For crissakes, it's just pop music, a trival inconsequential side annexe of the global corporate entertainment industry - hardly Revelations. Why blow it out of all proportion? Tool fans must lead sheltered shallow miserable lives. Wake up, team, and smell the roses. Get out of your sad dog boxes and go camping or fishing or something.

Let's not forget the fact that MTV and all the \\"rock\\" radio stations ran Schism into the ground. They really don't sound as original as most people think. I mean, sure they have that \\"freaky\\" sound, but Marilyn Manson has that sound too, and he is so horrible I'm afraid I would have to pick 3 Doors Down over them. The only reason I'm giving them 2 stars is because of Danny Carey. He is one of the better drummers I've heard recently. But, I would consider buying Mudvayne or System of a Down (one of the greatest bands ever) over Tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"A true Tool fan, a true person could not give any thing less","review":"I've noticed the constant \\"its not like thier other album which spoke to me\\" if you'd learned any thing from Tool it would be to open you \\"Third Eye\\" and see some thing new and different, with its own, not the one before, art work.Tool is not some thing you just get into because it sounds good, I like that guitar part and I like that drums part.\\"Tool is what you soak into your brain which opens it to what you don't see and don't want to, but its there\\"Maybe I didn't give it a 5 put thats because I'm being different as is this CD which very well is ignored, just looked at with \\"Undertow\\" and \\"Aenima\\" glasses that you put on that Tool never created.\\"Tool is some thing that you can listen to, and not even understand the words to but you get a feel, you know its art and beyhond\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Your a tool if you like tool!","review":"This is by far ?

It is perhaps one of the most unique albums ever made, but that does not make them so great. Tool is one of the worst Progressive Metal bands to walk on the face of the earth. Heck, they are not even Progressive Metal, more like Pseudo-Progressive Metal. The guitarwork in this album is terrible and the drumming is way too unpaced and random. Maynard's vocals are terrible and hardly shows much talent. My point is that Tool is one-terrible Metal version of Pink Floyd. Don't buy this album. Instead pick up one of these cds: Dream Theater- Scenes From A Memory Pain Of Salvation- Remedy Lane or The classic Pink Floyd- The Wall. Tool is a bad waste of time and definitely a waste of talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a letdown","review":"There is a reason that \\"Schism\\" is the first single off the album, it's the only good song. The rest of the album seems to go nowhere. It's like listening to someone in a monotone voice that goes on and on. If I wanted Pink Floyd i'd buy one of their records. Other reviews here mention that if you don't like the album you don't have the capacity to understand the album. Well, a song has to sound good before I care about its meaning. I loved the first two albums, but Tool has let its fans down on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woah.","review":"Woah. Tool. Dude. This \\"C-D\\" is a metal band trying to be intelligent.

It is my first Tool CD and it makes want to buy more of their CDs. The reason i bought this CD was because of the song Schism, i herd it on the radio and i had to have this song. I am now a Tool fan, and hope to buy more of their albums soon. I highly recomend this album. It is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing, hypnotic dark sound...So very listenable","review":"This is actually my first Tool album...Of course, I've heard bits and pieces of their previous stuff before, and while some of that stuff might have been a bit more catchy, songs like Sober and Prison Sex, the overall feel of that music isn't as hypnotic as this release. This is one of those albums that you can just put in player, sit down to play video games, or do internet stuff, and you just become mesmerized by the music. You don't really care what song it is because they all sound pretty much the same, but hey that is a GOOD thing. A very long album as well which is also a good thing. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this album. Great mood. Great atmosphere. Excellent musicianship. This is a masterpiece. Best rock album of 2001."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you need from a Tool album!","review":"It's been five long years since Tool's released anything. However, Lateralus is more than worth the wait. Lateralus is the quintessential tool album. Maynard James Keenan, the most versatile vocalist in music, has outdone himself on this album. That is not to say, however, that anything else has been sacraficed. This album is the ominous, free-floating magic that you've come to expect from Tool, spiked with the vision that only a five year hiatus can provide. That said, Lateralus also has the most amazing art (cover, sleeve, etc.) that I've ever seen. It is a true pleasure to behold. In fact, even if you don't like Tool, buy this and throw the CD out. Keep the cover.In short, Lateralus is the most amazing CD I own. Buy it, buy it, buy it! Shut up and buy it! Send more money! Shut up and buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Album, quality problems","review":"I have heard this album many times. I have to say, the vinyl release sounds incredible, its mixed and mastered very well and the music is very 'present' with great soundstaging. There is one major issue though..My 2nd disc is defective. It sounds like it is made out of dust, even after mutlitple thorough cleanings. I have tried listening to that disc twice now and it sounds like it is made of dust and held together by static cling...highly disappointing for a $43 album to have so much white noise its not listenable. I promise this isnt my gear...other 'new' vinyl plays and sounds fine with only very occasional and minor white noise.I'm not entirely sure how to proceed. The 2nd disc sounds absolutely terrible! I hate feeling like I've wasted money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a guess- I don't own it.","review":"However, I have not JUST heard the 2 songs that EVERYBODY has heard (\\"Schism\\" and \\"Parabola\\"), but they're still great songs, along with the other 4 songs I heard: \\"The Grudge\\", \\"The Patient\\", \\"Lateralus\\", and \\"Ticks And Leeches\\". All 6 were amazing in one way (especially \\"Ticks And Leeches\\"- who knew M.J. could scream like that!) So I plan to pick it up at some point, and check out the other songs on the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surreal","review":"It's difficult to write a review for Tool's latest album, Lateralus. It is the kind of art that is so complex, so beautiful, that it can only be discribed by single words and phrases. Here's a few:HypnoticTrance-InducingSurrealUnfathomableIn short, this is quite simply one of the greatest musical achievements of our time. As I have described it to others, it is \\"Subtle Hard Rock,\\" which seems to be an oxymoron... until you listen to the album. It is True Rock, with the beautiful, hypnotic qualities of Trance.Nothing can fully describe Lateralis. You need to buy the CD, put it in a CD player, put headphones on, and close your eyes. Nothing can prepare you for the nirvana that is Lateralis."},{"rating":"2","title":"tool is back.. older, wearier, wiser","review":"like one of the many fans of this band.. i have been waiting in anticipation for this cd, and.. today i bought it.. and was just silenced. this isn't what i'd expected.. this isn't what i'd hoped for.. but.. this is tool.. and it is good.the songs are wrapped in a more melodic density.. heavy.. and..intricate.. i've listened to it at least 6 times already today.. and each time i find myself captivated by a different track.it's not undertow.. it's not aenema.. it's not what you think.. if you like tool buy this cd and make up your own mind. this cd returns to us, tool, as a living, breathing BAND.. and not just a sound from the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"How can you not love Tool?","review":"I own every Tool cd and id lie if i said this was the best one, becouse there is no best one, they like Tool are all different and good in their diferent ways. If u never heard Tool buy this cd and all the rest, If you like Tool buy this cd, If you already have this cd, why are you reading this and not listening to it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tool older and wiser","review":"After five long years, Tool is back with a new album that should be considered as their best effort yet. Lateralus is an ambiant and an agressive album that any of the fas will love. Songs like Parabola, Schism and Reflection will someday be listed among the most powerful metal songs ever to be reccorded. No kidding! An amazing leap forward for the band and a charm for us, bored listeners of regular prog-metal music."},{"rating":"2","title":"New album lives up to hype","review":"Anyone questioning if this album would live up to nima need not question anymore. Danny Carey rips this album to shreds.. Any drummer will definetly find this satisfying. 5 stars isn't enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!!","review":"Here is a run-down of the cd..........1. The Grudge- Good song2. Eon Blue Apocalypse- no lyrics3. The Patient- ok song4. Mantra- no lyrics, kind of freaky sounding5. Schism- classic song6. Parabol- it's kind of an intro to parabola7. Parabola- great song8. Ticks & Leeches- a little different than what tool normamly sounds like but is still an ok song.9. Lateralus- best song on the cd!10. Disposition- All Maynard says is \\"Mention this to meMention something' mention anything, watch the weather change\\"11. Reflection- a little to long of a wait for the song to start.12. Triad- dumb13. Faaip De Oiad-dumbBUY THIS ALBUM"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked!","review":"Always knew the song Sober and liked it, saw them in 93, never had much interest, until Schism came out. This CD rocks. Saw them Oct,2001 in ATL. It wasn't a concert, it was a show of great imagination. It was like watching a cut up movie or videos and a band happened to be performing. The show was awesome. If you like rock and the imagination Pink Floyd shows, go see TOOL and get this album. The album has a flow to it unlike anything else that is being produced these days or the recent past. You have to appreciate a band that has total control of their trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Absolutely Amazing Epic","review":"Tool has always been one of those bands where when you first get the cd, you almost have to \\"break it in\\" due to its vast complexity and artistic nature. But Lateralus is the ultimate example of this, but this also means it is the most complex album and their best. This cd is absolutely unbelievable and is not to be forgotten, ever. It in my opinion, is THE BEST cd ever to come out and its value only goes up with each listen. All those... lovers and pop... lovers please stay away, tool is what music is truely about and without them i dont know what the point of a cd player would be."},{"rating":"2","title":"best of its kind","review":"probably the best cd of its genre. it takes a little to get used to but after that initial phase it just gets better exponentially everytime you listen to it. can't wait to see them in concert."},{"rating":"2","title":"well done!","review":"Tool has done an excellent job in the creation of their next album, laturalus. Their songs are amazing and well written, and Maynard never gives up on how to entertain his fans. Tool has alot of talent and they have the greatest mind of creativity. Their songs (including parabol, parabola, lateralis) are awsome. If you are a big fan of tool, then this is one album that you should not miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but not as good as Aenima","review":"well, 5 years waiting, and to tell you the truth, i'm a little dissapointed. i got Aenima the first day it came out, and i still listen to it all the time, it is phenominal. i was also one of the first in line to get lateralus, and i put it in my cd player as soon as i got in my car. i'm not saying this cd isnt good, it is VERY good, but it doesnt live up to Aenima. influences of a perfect circle are found throughout this new release, and i'm forced to admit that Tool has continued to mature as musicians. The songwriting is still excellent. Lateralus is definately worth the money i payed for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"how can you not think this album is great??","review":"this album is amazing!!! To even say it is weaker than Aenima goes to show how some people really just don't know good music anymore. The fact that as I write this review this album is below 5 stars truly angers me. If someone could do me a favor and name one bad song on the album please do. From track 1 to track 13 the music evolves throughout and amazes me. It really makes me wonder how these guys ever do it. Well anyway TOOL rules and everyone should have everything they ever put out. That is if you appreciate intelligent and good music. They are the most innovative band out there right now and the best song writers. TOOL will rock on in everyones mind forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you merciful gods of rock!","review":"I have been waiting 5 years alongside the other thousands of Tool fans for Lateralus. When I first got it and stuck it into my CD player, I was waiting for some instantly hard hitting opener a la Stink fist from Aenima. Instead I found a gradual buildup of rage and or joy at finally hearing something new from them. Maynard says that he &quo; t;know[s] the pieces fit&quod; in Schism and I take this to mean that he this album is exactly what the music industry needed: a swift kick.... Try not to swallowthis album whole or else you might choke on the pieces.To sum up: Buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extensive, Innovative, Complex, and Challenging","review":"This is a Tool album that is not to be taken lightly. Lateralus reminds me a lot of NIN's \\"the fragile\\" in the sense that on the first listen all I could think to say was, \\"wow...that's different.\\"Now that I've listened to it more, it is one of my favorite albums that I own. Songs like The Grudge, Schism, Lateralus, and Reflection keep me begging for more. Some words of advice: You have to give this album a chance. Believe me, it will grow on you quickly. This is one album that you can't just download (illegally), take one listen and pass it as (junk). This challenges you into having an attention span.Of course, this is still Tool, and they are still very heavy and in your face. Where Lateralus differs from past albums is the roller coaster ride it takes you on. Songs like \\"Ticks and Leeches\\" literally stop on a dime and start back again just as quickly. Give this album a try and learn to have an attention span. I guarantee you will not be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Also sounds like a bad pressing to me.","review":"This is indeed a superb album in every aspect, one of my favorites. I was expecting this vinyl to bring it to a whole new dimension of musical goodness, as most vinyl tends to do. Instead I hear lots of distortion and crackling even after cleaning the vinyl many times. I am very disappointed, but at least the picture discs themselves look awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"The TOOL boys do it again.","review":"Incredible rhythym, signature guitar work, and of course Maynard's fantastic voice lure the listener in with Tool's most melodic album to date. They work their magic, leading the listener into a false sense of security before sublimely pummelling him with the sound that's made Tool the masters of all things metal and beyond. These talented artists will surely receive the accolades they've long deserved with Lateralus. It's intelligent music for people who just aren't satisfied with the typical radio sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"After 5 years, Tool still throws the Thor Hammer Down!","review":"5 years in the making. Worth almost every single second. This album has a little more of an APC (A Perfect Circle) twist than previous albums, but is still Tool definitely. This is probably one of the most anticipated albums of all time, and if you're a Tool fan or A Perfect Circle fan, if you don't have this album already, you're loosing out. Get it now ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every ambitious band out there has to play catch-up now.","review":"I think people were expecting Maynard & the boys to release Aenima II, but this is totally inspired, and perhaps more of a masterpiece than it's predecessor. This will probably grow on you over time and will blow 1996's Aenima away by leaps and bounds. Tool have taken us to their next creative level on this one. Everything is still angst-ridden just the way we like it, and ambitiously progressive. There's stuff on here that you have never heard before, not even vaguely, and that's what makes Tool so great. Absolutely no one sounds like the mighty Tool! I give this 5 stars and can't wait to hear more stuff in the future. Just so it doesn't take another 5 stinkin' years. lol Thanks Maynard, Adam, Justin, & Danny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 1st Tool album: Now I'm Hooked!","review":"I first learned of Tool in an article in Spin Magazine, which waxed poetic about the album's artful displays of musical talent, and the enigmatic men that dream up these epics. I was intrigued and bought the disk on a whim. I was blown away. Seriously, this band has been on to something big, and I've missed it entirely. Not only does the music take you to unimaginable heights, but the thought put into the lyrics is palpable. \\"Schism\\" teaches of the art of communication in a relationship, and \\"The Patient\\" tells of the occasional restlessness in life that comes from living in a sometimes impersonal world. I find it hard not to identify with Maynard's soulful rebellion against the norm, and his wish to understand the world and the people in it. I recommend using this album to get away from everything, but don't become anti-social or anything drastic:-). Bravo Tool! Here's to the albums to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tool is great","review":"Its a different sort of Tool album, not what you'd expect, not quite. I has an overall softer feel and is a bit more melodic than Opiate, nima, or Undertow. Someone accused Tool of selling-out with this album, but thats not at all true. Its not my favorite Tool album, but, like all Tool, there isn't a bad track on the cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hypnotic","review":"The vibe on Lateralus is more mystical and reflective than on the previous albums. The sense of humor (AEnima is secretly one of the funniest albums ever made) is gone here but Tool more than make up for it with a heavy conceptual feel and even stronger compositions (the word \\"song\\" doesn't really seem to fit here). Tool has a way of making an album feel at once ridiculously complex and sublimely simple. Likewise, each composition feels tightly wound but in reality, this is their most expansive collection yet. The lyrical motif of the spiral is quite fitting for this album because listening to it is like being inside of a steadily unfolding spiral. If you listen to the album focusing on things like songs and hooks you simply won't get it. I reccomend lying back and just letting it play. After a few listens it should come to you. Just relax..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even BARGIN BIN material........","review":"I can't understand how this cd can sell. I listened to each sample track and didn't hear anything that sounded like creative music. Which leads to one conclusion. The song writer/writers arn't creative either. If your into good rock & roll this isn't for you........KEEP SHOPPING"},{"rating":"1","title":"oh dear","review":"19 minute songs? horrible vocalism about being patient and human dna? i think not. want real music, go to radioa@aol now go to pop their ya go! theirs yer music or go buy all the good charlotte cds, listen to limp bizkit's break stuff that song has inspired me to play the turn tables"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary","review":"It's scary how good Tool is.They have to be the best band on the planet right now and should go down in history as one of the best ever, even if the majority of people have never heard of them.Lateralus is a definite move forward from Aenima, having its own unique sound, but still remaining faithful to the overall Tool sound.Five years was worth the wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Tool fans","review":"If you were a Tool fan for Opiate, Undertow, or Aenima you would probably be better off borrowing this from a friend. It lacks the emotional lyrical release we all expect and crave. If you are into weird feedback and guitar effects, go for it! It would make better background music at party than something to really get into. 3 songs are pretty darn good the rest is pure FILLER. I think this will be their last album together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed pressing?","review":"I had the same problem as fellow reviewer CitizenRain: ridiculous amounts of white noise (crackles and pops) on both discs, all sides. Sounds like it was pressed in 1936 using a screwdriver and a lathe."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the hype on this extremely BLAND album???","review":"There is all this hype about how good this album is, this CD is terrible. I have listened to the album a good 20 times or so, and I just cant bear to play it any more. There are some tracks on the album that you would wonder why they are even on the disc! The Grudge and Schism may be the only 2 highlights of the disc, and the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because the album cover has some of the coolest artwork ive seen in awhile on it. Otherwise, the disc itself is mindless, repetitive drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark, enjoyable, deep metal","review":"You either love them or you hate them. It seems there's no middle ground. Well, if you're the kind of person that likes Tool (like me) you should love this album, it really delivers. It's fun to listen to, with a dark and brooding quality and fascinating lyrical writing (something I think is true of basically everything MJK does, whether with APC or Tool). Everybody knows Schism, of course. That was the first Tool song I ever heard. There's just such an amazing, deep quality to this album that you really have to listen to it to understand. The kind of music you feel like you can just drift and sink down into while listening to it, drifting off into it's darkness. If you can enjoy rock, and enjoy an album that speeds up, slows down, and does it all while blending the songs into a big long enjoyable experience; this should be a great CD to add to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better With Age","review":"As tool goes along they only seem to get better so of course Lateralus is tools bets album to date. Every album is amazing and unique but Aenima and lateralus are the finest. If you are starting to get into tool or just dont have this cd for some reason buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is WIERD","review":"This is my first and last tool album i ever bought. It was also the wierdest and most spiritual music i have ever listened to. The music itself has great maturity and feeling...... but after a while, it's just BORING. There is nothing cool about the guitar or drum playing, and Keenan's voice is too soft and monotonous. If you are looking for great music listen to British Metal. \\"Iron Maiden\\" and \\"Judas Priest\\" are just awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess it's o.k., if....","review":"you like listening to a whole lot of nothing for what seems like an eternity. I think I'm the only person who realizes that this album is at least 85% music. That works for some people, but I personally can't stand it.This album sounds like a modern-day regurgitation of the acid-tripping late 60s, early 70s [bad] rock. Such as---and I know I'm going to get crucified for this but---Dark side of the moon and any of the late Beach Boys [stuff.]I'm sorry, but I need lyrics to accompany my music, and it would be nice if I could here them over all the \\"genious and creativity.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"tool sucks","review":"listen to a perfect circle instead. tool fanboys are the most pathetic examples of humans, anywhere. everyone of them would suck maynard off if given the chance. they act like tool are gods. they make music..nothing else. they aren't a spirtual force of unstoppable nature that cures the sick. they write songs. yes, they do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than Aenima!!!!","review":"I have listed to this album...it is the achievement I'm proud of...this album is full of music straight from HELL!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lateralus.. more like Stinkeralus","review":"allright, i know nu-metal is like, the best thing ever and fred durst is easily the coolest guy around, but Tool just isn't.the singer tries to look all freakey and stuff like the guitarist from limp bizkit, what a copy cat.the drummer does all this complicated stuff that you cant listen to, the guitarist plucks actual strings and uses all these stupid effects, he doesnt even play a 7-string ibanez.. lame or what huh?i cant even hear the bassist, he must be so rubbish they filterd him out!and the singer is rubbish, gimme some jonathon davis over maynard keenan any day!!!!11"},{"rating":"1","title":"F Tool","review":"I'd like to Puch Maynard in his FAce- tired of this tough, wierdo act- what a freakin loser- just an act to get money-- WHAT AN OVERRATED BAND"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"metal\\" for depressed 14 year olds","review":"tool has to be the most over-rated band in recent memory. all these losers who consider their albums to be \\"mind-blowing\\" and \\"brilliant\\" and \\"poetic\\" are only kidding themselves. you want real heavy metal, with actual riffs and drumming? listen to megadeth, judas priest, iron maiden, early metallica, pantera or anthrax. it's a shame when watered-down bands like tool are considered heavy nowadays, though i guess when compared to avril lavigne they are somewhat dark. there's no brilliance to their songwriting or production, and this is nowhere near as good as classics like paranoid, master of puppets, powerslave, or rust in peace. but all you wanna-be metalheads can continue to listen to this bad music...tool will be forgotten soon enough anyway.thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"... This reeks.","review":"I've been a Tool fan for a decade, but it seems they've lost it. It's hard to stay young, angry and alive in rock and roll. If a rock star keeps partying for too long, the drugs make just about anything sound good, and it seems that's what has happened here...The vast majority of this stuff is aimless, spiraling, and totally lacks any accesible or interesting melody - like a big, repetitive buildup machine that never leads to anything. If you're new to Tool, start from the beginning of their catalogue in your acquisitions. By comparison, this stuff [stinks]. It's no worse than most of the kiddie-punk...on the radio...but it is by NO means among the best albums of 2001. And it sure ain't quality Tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"I got this CD a week after it came out expecting it to be as good, or better, than the previous Tool album. I had heard the song \\"Schism\\" on the radio a few days earlier and found it to be, well let's just say I didn't think it was as good as everyone made it out to be. When I got the CD I was expecting the other tracks to be a lot better(usually the ones that aren't on the radio are very good), but it was quite the opposite. The one song on here i did like was \\"Parabola.\\" This sounds less like tool and more like all the other mainstream bull$#?! out there. If you are going to spend your money on CDs then get the new Slipknot album or the newest Sepultura. Stay away from this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Round of Applause","review":"I'll start by saying that it's only a result of my usual musical dispositions that I don't give this album five stars; that is to say, I've a taste for an eclectic variety from Phish to Dave Matthews to Pearl Jam to Radiohead to Dylan to Wu-Tang to Grateful Dead to the Doors to Bob Marley. Perhaps it's a fairly typical spread for the college student. As such, I'll admit that a 6:00 AM insomniac viewing of the frighteningly abstract video for \\"Schism' urged me to give a listen. And, I was not disappointed. 'Schism' flies as the obvious commercial flagship, inbounds just enough to earn the radio play that it deserves and stir up some zesty capitalist consumerism along the way. 'The Patient' stands out as my chice for the album though. Throughout, the songwriting functions on an epic scale, that is the tempos rise and fall and evolve without the naseating effect of the pop-hook. The album is an intelligent departure from commercial rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get *Undertow.*","review":"Unnecessary repeat of the Aenima and Undertow sound, but without the hooks. Very mediocre effort.*Undertow* is a great cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"intelectual music","review":"Had the lateralis copy and could not wait to listen to it, then when listening to it I thought to myself intelectual sounding music--loved though the song watch the weather change. Sound was too techie, had all these formats, but one thing only was that it lacked to me the driving bass lines of paul d'amour so out with it to have maggots somewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"They've lost their edge","review":"Yep, fraid so...When I first saw tool I was impressed. They seemed to be offering something new, dynamic and impressive.But really, there are only so many mysterious songs about taking it in the arse you can write before you bore your audience silly.A few albums down the track I'm bored. If you've never heard tool much and like their sound, give yourself a couple of albums before finding something else to get into...these guys are too much of a one trick pony. Sad to say, but true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Boring Boring","review":"For the life of me, I cannot understand what the big deal is with this album, or this band. I saw them live a while back, and left after the 4th or 5th song...I was so bored, it hurt. The crowd was as bored as I was..I love it when people try and make them this super group..please. Deep? Spiritual? Come on....Prentious, pompous might be more like it. Maynard was so bored he turned and faced the back of the stage for a few songs...turn your back on the audience?. He stripped down to just his red underwear....boy, that is deep and spiritual...I've seen hundreds of bands over the years, and this was one of the four most boring shows from the last 40 years...they will disappear in to the din of rock and roll..No loss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music straight from Maynard's mind","review":"Only Tool could make an album like this. To be more specific, only Maynard could. The main theme of the album is advise about life. Maynard tell us that we shouldn't waste our lifes fighting and to just enjoy it for every second you breathe. Tool's mesmerizing intrumentals and vocals combine to make a sound I have never heard any other band come close to. The song Schism is a song about how relationships are broken between people. I guess because Tool's main goal was to prove that metal music can be different, they tryed to make this basic song topic as complicated as possible. Anyway, I basically worship all the somgs on this album but my favorites are Reflection, Parabola, Disposition, The Patient, and Schism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something lost.","review":"The thing i liked about Tool was their originality.

In 2002, they won a Grammy (Best Metal Performance) for the WORST song (my opinion) on their latest album (Lateralus). [Don't get me wrong, when I say \\"Tool\\" and \\"worst song on their album\\", I am comparing only Tool songs, which are ALL musically better than anything you will find on Makeover TV.] Knowing this, you should realize that if you like dark, heavy music, you will LOVE this album.I have had Lateralus in my car since the day it was released last year, and nothing else has been in it to this day. My steering wheel has taken quite a beating!My only suggestion (other than to buy this masterpiece) is that if you are a drummer and have not heard this album (or any other Tool album yet), you better make sure you have an extra pair of pants and underwear on hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"jammin","review":"Everybody every where should own a copy of this album.

This album is truly the best Metal Album out there right now. Listened to it about 5 times fully today. Don't be fooled by first impressions. You cannot take in everything on the first sitting. You must slowly digest it for it to work its affects on you. You cannot use the mindset that has been molded into us by the Radio/Record Industry. They are not short songs. They do not have hooks or catchy choruses. Don't buy Lateralus because the of the cool-looking art on the cover. Buy it because you truly want to experience something not new to Metal, but forgotten. Great Music."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"I have owned this CD for 6 months. The first time listening was a revelation. I have listened consistently throughout those 6 months with ocassional breaks. I just listened to this CD again on 12/28.It sounds better then it ever did! This band has a gift. Listen and reap the awards that gift offers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Realm, A New Standard?","review":"First off, this disc is great. You can't deny that. I would buy this very, very fast. It's mature, it's moody, it's the kind of disc you can pop in and listen to front to back and feel like it's once fluid piece.It's Tool's 'Dark Side of the Moon'.But...........Tool's progressive efforts here in Lateralus are good, but could be better. By today's \\"Metal\\" standards, Tool just blew everyone out of the water with this. But, by \\"progressive\\" standards, this leaves a bit to be desired.Does that make sense?Tool have upped the level of their play and have stepped into another arena of music. But, there are many other bands inside this arena and they are doing it better than Tool. At least right now. I predict Tool will expand on this and their next disc will be REALLY AMAZING! Let's hope so."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Artistic Journey continues.....","review":"I just got done listening to the new album by Tool and I was totally blown away. Before this my favorite album was Aenima but the boys may have outdone themselves with this one.From the angry, aggressive \\"The Grudge\\" to the quiet and reflective \\"Lateralis\\" this cd is one of the best I have listened to. Highlights of this album are \\"The Grudge\\", \\"Schism\\", \\"Parabola\\" (my favorite song) and \\"Ticks and Leeches\\". Get this cd...you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Tool (and you should)...","review":"...you'll love their latest effort. From start to finish, this picks up where Aenima left off sonically, while Maynard's vocals and songwriting shine possibly even brighter than they ever have (his vocals definitely do). Adam, Danny, and Justin are in top form. Listening to Lateralus is one of those rare experiences that lives up to your expectations.There's not a bad track to be found on this disc (the last track is a bit superfluous), but my personal favorites are The Grudge and Lateralus. In those two tracks the msuic is extraordinarily well constructed and put together, and Maynard's voice is at its fiercest, beautifully raw best. Like Tool's previous work, however, viable arguments could be made for just about any other song as well.Buy it, live it, love it. It really is that simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tool has done it again","review":"This cd is Tools best by far. It combines all of the sounds from thier previous albulms and adds a lot of new stuff two. the cd starts out with some melower songs like the grudge, eon blue, the patient, and schism. These may be melower and slower but are still great exspecially the patient and schism. The second half of the cd is awsome. Parabola, disposition, and triad are heavier songs that are classic tool with a lot of undertow and opiate in them. The three best songs on the cd are Ticks and leeches, reflection, and Lateralis. Ticks and leeches is ulta heavy with maynard screaming through most of it. Reflection is an epic with many mood changes. Lateralis is the best overall track on the cd and also goes through many different emotions like most of tools songs. This cd is amazing and words really can't describe it. So if your sick of all of the copy cat bands and the one hit wonders out there right now then you can't go wrong with tool the greatest band in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the wait!!!","review":"If you didn't think that Tool could top Aenima, then think again. I feel this album is heavier than the previous ones and the sound, the lyrics are much better. I really like 'Schism', 'The Grudge' and 'Parabola'. Buy it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tool does it again!","review":"Unbelievable! I had high expectations to begin with, but this album even exceeded those. Tool never seizes to amaze. Highly recommend!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I really just wanted to correct the music fan","review":"Alright....First off, Opeth deserves everything they've ever gotten and more.Secondly, Mayhem have an album with a very dead...umm....dead on the cover and his brains leaking out from behind.Third....Didn't cobain use a gun to kill himself...so what's with the word actually in your sentence?Fourth...there have been some great american bands....Nile, Deicide, Morbid Angel, Pig destroyer....should I continue? So next time you wish to display your vast musical knowledge....make sure you have some."},{"rating":"2","title":"the one","review":"this is the album that got me into music, seriously, no one is the same after they hear this."},{"rating":"2","title":"I honestly do believe this is the best album from TOOL ever.","review":"Yes everyone, TOOL is still alive and still thriving with the same musical brilliance we saw in Aenima, however this album, on its own is quite brilliant in its own. Frankly, I find it to be even better then Aenima. This album has definately grown in brilliance from the other three. I especially enjoy the less use of swearing, as Maynard's god bashing and F*ck this and F*ck that got considerably old. Thanks to TOOL, I can still have hope in the music industry to support mind blowing, Prog geniuses such as this band."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd Best Tool Album","review":"One of the main reasons I like this album, is that it's enjoyable on so many levels. If you don't feel like taking the time to read into all their songs, that's fine, they're all perfectly awesome regardless. However, if you decide to take the time to decipher the songs, you're in for an experience. Each of these choices are enjoyable in their own. I also really like how this album was able to stick with one main underlying theme, yet make their songs completely different. So, all in all, a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"music experience","review":"After 4 years the new album just can't be a bad album. But it ain't as good as \\"aenima\\". As a whole aenima is much better than lateralus. There is amazing songs in lateralus, like: The grudge, The patient, schism and the best song on the album; Lateralis!! That song makes the album have 4 stars! But nothing like : stinkfist, eulogy or Aenema. There is the sister song in lateralus which includes ; Disposition, reflection and triad. And that is the most disapointing in this album. There is just too little singing and too much arty things!! But reflection is a pretty good song still!! Lateralus is a great album, eventhought it techinally contains only 7 songs. And only 6 good one's because \\"ticks and leeches\\" is a awfull song....but if you want to listen the best music in the world...you buy this cd!!! Tool rulez!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definatly Not Limp Bizket","review":"To all the reviewers who are complaining because this cd \\"Drags on\\", and is too boring, I ask you.. Did you complain in gladiator when people werent fighting? Were you bitching when they were setting up the rest of the movie? If so, go back and watch Nsync on TRL. Tool's new album is trance like rock. And its great. Friends who never have liked tool before, sat and I made them listen to this. They thought it was great. Its not as agressive as any of Tool's other works, but if I wanted more like before I would have bought another copy of Aenema. Tool has proven themselves to be great, without one bad album. Let them take and transmutate your leaden grudges into gold. Sorry, couldnt resist."},{"rating":"2","title":"for inmate","review":"This item was given as a gift to a friend, who specifically requested it, and expressed great satisfaction on receiving it.

So they can play in 7/8, whoopee. Its basic radio rawk.

No kind of excitement or catchy riffs, nothing. It reminds me of some kind of Hindu meditation music. I'll stick with Slayer, In Flames, and Slipknot."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a horrible album........","review":"not only was it incredibly neanderthalish lyrically, but the music took a nosedive as well. carrey's drums, once one of the mightiest, have become a complete and total joke. what a pity. save your money........"},{"rating":"1","title":"Laterfailus","review":"Fans waited 5 years for this??? Tool is the victim of their own hype - how could they follow up the legendary Aenima? In my opinion, they can't and they didn't. Are you amazed that this album has been reviewed over 650 times? I'm not. Credit the high school generation for this slathering of inflated reviews.If you thought Undertow and Aenima were classics, I believe you will be disappointed with Lateralus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing worth the wait","review":"waiting for the new tool album for like 5 years you can imagine the complete bitter dissapointment when I heard schism the first single and absolute crap song that needs to be half as long sure long songs worked out on aenima because it was an amazing album but this album is listless trash. Probably one of the biggest let downs in the last five years in music. Tool became pretty much nothing more than sellouts. By the time you hear tracks like ticks and leaches or lateralus you'll plead for the horrid music to stop, tool's creativity has run it's course, every music video is the same claymation etc... If tool would've left it with just aenima and undertow they could've went down as one of the best bands of the 90's as well as respectable, but now with lateralus they've destroyed any credibility they had as musicians, even mer de noms was a better album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your money","review":"I don't understand what is so great about this album or Tool in general. The only good songs on the album are parabol and parabola, and everything else is just dark and annoying. If you like music that makes you feel like shoving your head in a toilet, then I'd recommend this CD to you. If your interested in bands that use their talent, check out linkin park, 311, deftones, incubus, and even Maynard's \\"side project\\" A Perfect Circle. At least Maynard came up with tracks that are worth listening to on Mer De Noms. Tool wouldnt be half bad if they used their talent instead of making dark, muddy, and annoying music. This is not worth a penny, and im so glad that I burned it first. This is just another dissapointing Tool album."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Second Coming of Yes","review":"My theory is that Rick Wakeman (frontman of Yes and public enemy #1) is the bassist for Tool, and he writes all of the music. It is seriously that bad. I've never really liked this band but before my biggest complaint was the childish anti-christian lyrics. Now I dislike them for all the same resons I dislike Yes and the Alan Parsons Project. Maybe next they'll do an album about stonehenge. That'll be rad. In the meantime all you sheep-like drones can sit around and pretend that time signature changes constitutes \\"brilliant music\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"urg","review":"Remember trhey days when metal was actually quite fun when bands like Iron Maiden, Cradle of Filth and Metalica rulled with songs about...........well it never really matterd you could go to a concert fully aware that you never really needed to care about the lyrics and you just had to bang your head too and there was always a giant skull to be seen.Ah but then nirvana came alng and everything changed these days tool and their like rule their world of metal and without any of the fun that their the old guard possesed you now really do have to think about the lyrics because the music is so unlistanable its a shame because metal should never be like that hopefully another spinal tap will come along and expose this music for the sham it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tool in a not so interesting jam session","review":"Some people are into this style, I personally am not. That is, songs that are not catchy, do not have very interesting melodies or arrangements or discernible parts (verse, chorus, bridge, etc). The songs on this album come across more as a jam session that Tool is meandering through. It just sort of goes on and on and there are few memorable moments. As I said, if you're into that, as it is clear that many people here are, then this may be your thing. I prefer the Tool on \\"Undertow\\" (Prison Sex and Sober both being standout tracks on that album)."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOD BYEEE!!!","review":"Let me start off by saying that until this album came out I loved TOOL's music. It just misses the creativity they posessed in the old days when they just kept evolving from 'Opiate' to 'Aenima' because they probably wanted to make a more commercial album. And this means that the music must sound less complex (too many notes, Mozart. Cut a few and it is perfect). And just what is going on on their site? I visited it lately and there is this Blair guy who just keeps talking about Crowley and the Rennes le Chateau-mystery (It's solved a long time ago: the supposed grandmaster P. Plantard who was in reality the son of a farmer who produced wallnuts, made the whole story up with a companion and forged the parchments himself, he confessed this after a fight over money with his friend de Chaurissey, money from Lincoln & co), and poses on pictures which he shows on the Tool site..it's a funny looking guy...who is he anyway??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it - Tool has degraded to pop","review":"Don't buy this if you are expecting something like the earlier albums. If you liked Perfect Circle (which I didn't) then this album is for you. This album has none of the raw power that previous Tool albums were based on. This is more of a melodic mellow pop-style album. Think of Metallica selling out and how bad there music became and you'll get the idea. I'm not saying that Tool is selling out but this album is not the Tool that I loved for so many years."},{"rating":"1","title":"album is horrible","review":"this isn't music, and either is the other tool albums. i'd give it 0 stars if i could"},{"rating":"1","title":"BOO","review":"That Schism song sucks ass its easily the worst song I've ever heard. When it came on the radio I wanted to rip my ears off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"masterwork??? I think not.","review":"It's amazing how people overrate this band so much and use words like masterwork to describe this album. They obviously don't listen to anything else so there is nothing se for them to compare it too. There is way better music out there then this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Great Song among many bad ones.","review":"I bought this CD thinking I love the song Schism so even if the rest of the CD is just OK it will be worth the money. I was wrong. The CD is just boring. With the exception of Schism the entire CD is forgettable. This was the first Tool CD I have ever bought and it's also the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Noise Radio Band ... Run For Your Lives! Zero rating=0.","review":"Anyone who actually can make any sense of the noise on this CD, and call it serious music, should be locked in a room with the boys from Hanson for 10 years: now that's torture man! This band along with countless others, System of A Down (the worst!) etc., always make me wonder one thing: if they're such great musicians, why not prove it? Why not show it? But, in these days of Noise-Rock-Sounds like everything else-Radio, it's the money and not any sense of passion for music. I would only tell you to listen to this CD if you comitted an atrocious thing, like losing a GOOD CD, with a great musician on it, someone like, Yngwie J. Malmsteen-THIS WOULD BE A SIN IN MY BIBLE! Only then punish yourself by having to listen to this one! ZERO RATING=0."},{"rating":"1","title":"There Best CD IN FIFE YAERS","review":"Tool is for music fans who got to half some intelegince in there music.

Never!!!! How is that? Not one bad album. This is no acception...same great Tool sound. They still rock the socks off."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this album !","review":"The best tool album recorded so far and one of the best albums of the modern rock era !"},{"rating":"2","title":"An underrated Maelstrom!!!!!","review":"If you are capable of listening to the song \\"Ticks and Leeches\\" as loud as your stereo will allow, and not desend into a myopic trance, then I suggest you seek medical attention immediatly. You would have to be completly void of any soul at all if this one song dose not awake some kind of heart pounding response. For those of you who are still able to appreciate raw talent, in it's purist form; then I suggest you purchase this musical masterpiece as soon as you can. Tool has raised the bar for music with edge, passion, and pathos. Every second of this disc pulsates with rich textures, and exacting brilliance."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"This CD is a regualr Tool CD. An album that makes you think, a sound party. Their music is probably some of the most technologically advanced in all fields of music. I mean you even have to think to get to the CD itself. But once you put that in your stereo and press play, my God you will be blown away.This was my first Tool CD (and won't be the last) and I am completely blown away by this band. I have heard of them for a quite awhile, but first heard their music on MTV2 when they played Schism. That track is my personal favorite, but all others are good. Even the little intermissions between the 7-8 minute songs on Lateralus. They can get hard at times, but I believe that they are better when they are hard and break songs down. In these types of songs, they are part acoustic, and part metal. But don't sleep on this album, or any of theirs for that matter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful Work from a Talented Band","review":"i read the other reviews placed on this cd. in one it said that if you bought the album it would sit on your shelf collecting dust.. the only reason mine collects dust is i burned a second copy so i would not damage the original from using it all the time. i absolutely love this cd, the song laterlis has to be my fav on the entire album, but there are a great number of good songs on here along with it. i like the entire album. true the songs are somewhat long but no where near as long as some of the other bands i listen to, so for me they are rather short for me. if you are looking into getting this album know that yes some of the songs are considered long, but never dull. again i say it is a masterful work from a very talented band."},{"rating":"2","title":"What more can I say?","review":"This is TOOL at their finest! I have all 5 discs, and this one is by far their best yet. Maynard just keeps me on my toes wondering where I will be led to next, never knowing what is just around the corner. Then once I actually see it, it slaps me in the face so hard, I go back and beg for more. If you're a TOOL fan, then you're already in the know. If you're not a TOOL fan, buy it, then go back and get the other 4. I guarantee that you will like where Maynard takes you, even if you never thought you would enjoy pleasure mixed in with a touch of pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tool's best yet","review":"I picked up Tool's latest album the first day it came out. I had only heard one song off it but already I was impressed. anyways, after I picked up the album, just one word... amazing!!! This is definitly Tool's best yet. Everything is done right from the complex song structure and amazing riffs, right to the cool packaging. Definitly a must buy for anyone who has any interest in the band or simply music for that matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tool: The Classical Music of Generation X","review":"Although my favorite album is Aenema this comes in 2nd place. BUt Lateralus has something all the other albums does not have. ORchestration! This MUSIC WILL PUT YOU IN A VOID, if you like it that is. IT incorporates all instruments well, especially drums because Danny(drummer) admit himself that this is meant to be drum driven, so with that said, take a listen to Lateralus and be appaled by their orchestrations and NOTE TO ANY DRUMMERS, IF YOU HAVE NOT LISTENED TO TOOL YET, GET THIS ALBUM and ANEMA and YOU WILL SEE WHO THE BEST DRUMMER OF OUR GENERATION REALLY IS!!!!!! IF Beethoven were to come back from the grave and collaborate he would defenitely call TOOL!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"they can just stop and go home","review":"not much can be said that hasn't already, but i would only add that some quality headphones enhance a completely seamless musical composition that the world hasn't seen since the classical period. which may explain why other tool albums have been attempted by full orchestras."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Well, If you don't have this CD, I think you should get over 78 minutes of explosive music."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the wait","review":"Despite a five year absence, Tool did not lose its edge. Lateralus is another great tool album. The album is intregate and filled with the same sort of great music that we have come to expect from tool. It does't let down. Each song is great and has its unique qualities to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing CD","review":"When I bought this CD, i didnt know what would be on it. After listening to all 78 mins of it, i knew that i had made the right choice. The music will stay in your head for weeks and you will be left thinking about what MJK was trying to say when he wrote the songs. They all have deep thoughts to them and will take a while to understand the meaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"plain and simple\\"WOW\\"","review":"You have to applaud a band that can come up with 4 different albums that are great and don't show a slump in them.Many bands change their sound and come off terrible and others keep the same style and become stale.This band has changed in the last 12 years but have given us classic each and every time, how many bands can you say that can do that, not many I bet.This cd is less agressive than Aenima or Undertow but has a darker feel to it.Just put this album on and just lose yourself to a dark, complex world.Every song here is a gem from the Grudge,Schism,Parabola,Tick and Leaches and Lateralus.I can say with certain knowledge you will love this group, especially Maynard James Keenan who has a voice that is uniquely beutiful to spine chilling.I would alsp recommend their other three albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"the most creative one","review":"this is not the best album tool has ever put out but id have to say that it is there most creative one, i think they will never top aenema, this album is great to listen to when your alone for some reason ,its just kind of a freaky feeling.and i have good news for all the tool fans, they just started recording new material for the new album, i dont have a clue when it will be finished or released or what it will be called but im hoping they will take the creativity noch up a little higher and kind of have like a lateralus part 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be patient","review":"I've had this album almost 3 years now and I continue to enjoy it. There are alot of heavy songs and alot of soft songs, which I think are perfectly balanced out. Even though \\"Disposition\\" only contains 2 lines of lyrics (repeated over and over), its one of my favorites off here. The guitar line in \\"Lateralis\\" is phenomonel, the song starts out with it and then the band comes in... wow! Alot of people might not think this as their best album, but I think it's pretty damn good. The band has yet to disapoint me and hopefully their new album will be just as good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WHY DO OTHER BANDS STILL MAKE MUSIC?","review":"To begin with let me just say this is the best albumn in the world(period). Honestly i cant stand any other type of rock or metal or watever the hell they call that crap they make. Tool is in a genre of their own and it is more evolved than any music on the planet. Maynards voice and lyrics are unbelievably incredible and thought provoking, and the music the rest of the crew makes has a sound that uv never heard. I can ramble on for pages about this albumn but im just gonna get to the point....DO URSELF A FAVOR AND GET THIS ALBUMN....ULL LIVE A BETTER LIFE!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Niiiice Album, great evolution for a band.","review":"Ok, this album's great. For all TOOL fans this is a perfect album: Great guitar riffs, great lyrics, AWESOME, and i mean AWESOME drumming, and a nice evolution in MJK vocals.It's way more introspective than other Tool albums, so take your time and listen to it carefully in a completely out-of-light room, so you focus only in the music.Tool's music isn't very technical (besides the drumming), and has it's beauty in the simplicity of it, and the emotions that they grow on you. I love bands like Dream Theater, but lyrics like the ones you find in tool's albums aren't so common, and so mmm...ok, let's say it once again: GREAT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"Well, they did it again.When I first listened to this CD, I never really cared for it... but, as with all of tool's stuff, once you listen to it a few times, you will start to absolutley love it.Can't recommend enough that you buy this CD... it is truly an instant classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS CD RULES","review":"This cd is awesome. I got it first thing the day it came out and i've been listening to it none stop since then Being an avid fan of tool i have to say that it's much better than Aenema and Undertow and harder as well OK, i'm off to listen to it some more"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenominal","review":"A mixture of grudge, metal and alternative rock, this album reflects what rock should be: loud, hard, fast, but soft in the right places, with those pleaserable little tweaks in between like 'Mantra' and 'Eon Blue Apocalypse' and 'Faaip De Oiad' that calm you down before the next song. The title track is awesome, building up and up into a driving cresendo that blows the listener away. Not frightening, like their last album, but not so comforting either, as we learn when the album ends with 'Faaip De Oiad'. It's as if Tool picked up where Zeppilin left off: this is what Led would sound like now, if John hadn't died, and they had lived to be a hundred years. Music at its strongest, and I eagerly await their next album, which should be coming along in five more years,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Tool yet","review":"There isint a lot to say that the other reviews didint, but I completely agree that they are the best rock band. Adam Jones' guitar playing is simply amazing on Lateralus. I thought that the first single was pretty disapointing, but this album has eased my doubts...Whether you like heavier music or not, this album is the best ive heard this year so far (im waiting for Amnesiac by Radiohead) I suggest that YOU buy this"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Tool","review":"Many have been waiting since '96 for some new Tool and here it is. And its for real, no hype. You will not be let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"there's nothing like Tool","review":"this is a wonderfully produced album along with great musicans. I've only heard this album once and I already love it. Usually tool takes time to grow on you, so I'm hoping that I will love this album for years to come. ticks and leeches is a great song. It's a little like the deftones. I highly recommend this album along with all other tool material."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truely awesome album!","review":"I use the word awesome in it's true sence...amazing, breath takeing...whatever you want to use in substitute. I've been a fan of tool's since '96...and I can say that I've yet to hear a band anything like them. Their music is true art! They bring back what should be in music...Art...music is a type or art, and tools brings that back to us! So many groups are out today, but they all sound similar..and there truely isn't any art in their music. It's all simple chords, simple beat, and most of it, they aren't even singing. I must say again, this album is truely amazing, and you'd be a fool not to own it! You will not be disapointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank muses for Tool...","review":"I really just wanted to add my share to the praise voiced by other people here. Tool is truly something altogether original and their music defies attempts at description and categorization. Since I am perfectly aware that anything I say about the music on this album will be no more than my own personal opinion, I will not say anything. But I believe that the mark of a true work of art is that it resonates strongly with different people, albeit it may do so in many different ways. I am convinced that this album is indeed a work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than the previous","review":"Tool's Lateralus comes into view as a jumbled mess upon first hearing it, but rather unfolds to a highly rewarding experience to the seasoned Tool fan and bearer of patience. The songs take about eight or so minutes a piece and the best parts you have to wait for. (Except the chorus for the album's seventh track, Parabola, which comes in at around forty seconds.) The disc proves Tool to be experienced musicians, still pushing their limits of playing and arranging, showing off their improvement of arranging and altering the typical boundaries of song structure. Most songs don't even repeat the same parts twice. Once you get through the skin of Lateralus and pick up it's innumerous nuances, you'll find it to be the most genius album ever created by humans anywhere ever. Buy two copies"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was worth the waiting","review":"I just bought this CD today, but I cant tell that the boys did again. If all the bands faced music like this guys do, in a passionate and intense way, we wouldn't have to hear [bands] like Papa Roach, Backstreet boys, and so on..."},{"rating":"2","title":"ITs Cool","review":"MAn, is this Cd good. Right from the very first song it'll get you engrosed in it. The combination of Maynards vocals with the guitar is just amazing. There are some pretty small songs. But, the whole album is just a piece of art!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Play it LOUD","review":"Ok, i am too old for this kind of music - BUT - i love the song \\"Schism\\" i bought the CD just for that one song. Play it LOUD, and just dig it. the rest of the album... too heavy metal for an old gal like me. my teen age son turned me on to Tool. my dear hubby, Norman, laughs when i stop everything and get jiggy with that song! but, hey, if you love it - you know what i mean! just have to rock out. not for sleepyheads or whimps."},{"rating":"2","title":"tool","review":"The first single Schism off the lateralus cd is probably the best out of all the tool songs save Sober. The songs are good if you have the time to listen to them. Theres not a song on here that doesnt last for less than 6 minutes. A few radio friendly songs that stayed under 4 minutes would have been welcome, but i guess Schism will have to do. Otherwise this is a good record if you can stand the ridiculously long play times."},{"rating":"2","title":"79 minutes? Really?","review":"For me, an album (or even movie) that loses interest for me is when I first play it and start to check my watch to see how long it'll be before the album (or movie) is over. And for a 79 minute album, this one didn't make me look at my watch once. Even though is has some songs that could easily be shortened, it doesn't detract too much from the whole listening experience. I gotta give Tool credit for trying to do something different from the music out today (like Backstreet N'Sync 98 whatever) and making a solid album that proves that there's nothing wrong with having seven minute songs on an album, especially if they're good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"This is yet another great album from a great band. Tool continues to impress me with their writing. Although all of their albums are awesome, I think this is their best album to date. If I could only suggest one of Tools albums this would be it.

I loved AEnima. But, Lateralus doesn't even come close. It's kinda like a really poor re-mix. It's just endless, repeated sound.

Nearly every meaning could be debated until the end of time since Tool refuses to comment. That being said, I think the central theme of this album is that of Plato's theory of Dualism, that the mind and body are separate entities. Specifically, in the songs Parabol/Parabola and Lateralus.Tool has never ceased to amaze and Lateralus is no exception. Tool's timing syncopation, driving bass, and intellectual lyrics bring this album to the top of Tool's work (actually, I love all of their albums equally, if you're not counting Opiate).A Tool fan has no excuses for not having Lateralus in their collection and, for that matter, no one should be able to get away without having experienced this provocative assembly of musical genius.

Mia Maestro is nice looking, but that's about it. Carlos Rivarola has nothing to offer, zip, nada. He is there because the producer used him in the \\"Tango Bar\\" movie a few years back.

So, fans, beware. This elaborate co-production utilizes some of the greatest talent from Argentina, Spain, Italy and the United States. Shot by Vittorio Storaro in Univision using Technovision cameras and lenses, \\"Tango\\" is supposed to be framed at 2:1, an aspect ratio that lies somewhere between the Academy Standard (1.85:1) and CinemaScope (2.35:1). But for the DVD someone approved a 1.75 transfer that hurts some of the exquisite compositions and the larger-than-life feeling the movie had in theaters. To confuse matters farther, the DVD jacket indicates the film is presented in the scope aspect ratio. Not!!! Aw, well, it's a very good movie nontheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master piece","review":"In order to appreciate this movie, I think one has to know about the popularity of tango in South America. After all, that is where tango is still very much in fashion even today. This movie captures the very essence of tango.

If you don't like dance, this may not be suitable for you. If you don't mind the dancing, it is definitely worth seeing. If you love tango music, then you must see this. You can also buy the sound track of this movie. The music director/composer of this movie is none other than Lalo Schifrin. He is the one who arranged for the Three Tenors for their concerts. He is also the pupil of Astor Piazzola,yes the father of modern tango. The music is wonderful and the dances are equally good. The cinematography and the story are excellent.

The mechanics and graphics are good, but nothing revolutionary or even unique. Basically, the gimmick of this game is that you are a man exiled by the mafia who can control demons. A novel concept, but it is more burdensome than useful. You will constantly be shooting out light bulbs to use these abilities which is not very entertaining. The A.I. is sub-par as is the convoluted story line. Level design and enemies are very mundane: a clear sign that more money was spent advertising on this game than making it.

The game is dated so don't expect the visuals to pop in fact in kinda reminded me of an old Sega game but better smoothed out. I believe because of that the game was harder (the dated feel) than it should of been, but it was interesting and pretty fun with that old game appearance"},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome","review":"the game is very fun and for anyone who dosent mind lots of heart eating violence the controls could have a little more flexibility but overall its a reaally enjoyable game."},{"rating":"2","title":"A twist on the standard FPS","review":"Great lighting,excellent controls and engaging story.Well worth the price of admission. The story line is saprisingly fleshed out.Seemed to be about 15 to 18 hours on the hardest dificulty in the single player portion.Accually controling an evil entity was interesting.And as long as you can keep the lights out or stay in the shadows you are shockingly powerful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just couldn't get use to the lighting","review":"I started playing the game the day it came in, but the lighting in this game is just so dark or murky. I know the game is called the darkness, but does it really need to be so dark you can't see the gun you are carrying or so bright from just one room light that you get a headache. That aside, the gameplay was decent considering the age of the game and I can see why they would make a second one, hopefully with better contrast. It plays well, past the intro where you can't skip it, but heck, who cares, you only gotta go through that once. On top of that, there isn't many games out there where you get to play a mob hitman with inner-issues. I probably would have rated the game higher if I could get past the simple fact that I couldn't sit down and play this game for more than 15 minutes at a time without wanting to shoot myself from the migraines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light in the Darkness","review":"I will keep this short and sweet. Pretty darn good solid game and the story was pretty cool. Definately would recommend specially at the used price. And you dont have to have read the comics."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"All I have to say is this is the best case ever. It is pure hard plastic with beautifully crafted paper cover. It had some sort of strange circular device in the inside. I am pretty sure it's a frisbee which I have to say is another great thing about this. So if you want the best hard plastic miniature frisbee holder around buy this now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Darkness","review":"the game is good. the story line is long but you are very dependent on the powers you are given but all in all a good game"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Game","review":"I heard this was a good game and so bought it from the used bin at gamestop. I liked it but it wasn't necessarily a favorite. Basically, if you aren't into blood and gore, this is definitely not the game for you. I got lost a lot in the game for a while because I had no idea what to or where to go. Maybe I didn't listen as carefully as I should have. The game is pretty short which disappointed me. I don't want to spoil anything but it's worth buying for cheap and definitely worth renting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insanely awsome game for the price!!","review":"I bought this game for about [...] here on amazon and it was waaaay better then i expected!! extremely detailed like if you turn on a tv u can actually watch real life TV shows and movies i was definitely surprised!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Horrible","review":"The game was great in concept, and visually for it's time- but actually playing the game sucks- characters I don't care about, darklings that work horribly, and lighting that just makes gameplay painful rather than suspenseful. I fear that everyone on Amazon who gave this game a good review is either working for the game publisher, or is a goth who truly wishes they has the protagonists powers so they could go back to middle school and beat-up all there bullies."},{"rating":"2","title":"More action, less talk and travel!","review":"Awesome theme / mechanics / ideas. If you like eating hearts and summoning the dark forces. I think storylines (in general) are overrated. This has too many breaks and jumping around. The mob angle doesnt fit.If you like DARK horrific themes u cant go wrong"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this game, it has some cool themes!","review":"Got this game because I downloaded the demo. If you want to play something new with special themes get this! It is way better than BulletWitch, so if you like the dark gothic scene and first shooters get this! It has some nice artwork and the storyline is good! Better than Bioshock, but got this on Amazon with Bioshock for $49. Thanks Amazon for the deals, keeep them coming!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shattered idols","review":"XPlay gave this game a horrible rating. Complained how the aiming was done wrong, how some of the missions were based on the first person template and a poorly done story.Thankfully I only watched that review after I bought it, played it, beat it, and was on my way to pick up all the 'side quests'. Thankfully.This game is a lot of fun to play and a story that did not let itself to be known until it was all over. The main character's voice, I felt, was all wrong but did not distract from the fun.During load sequences he talks about the story, the other characters you meet, amusing anecdotes, or just shows him wandering around or his guns. The timing was great since once his story was over, so was the loading time.Not the greatest game of all time, but it does happen to be a lot of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where there is smoke.....","review":"While I do believe that it is almost impossible to prove anything in history beyond a shadow of a doubt, the authors present just enough evidence to make you wonder. If it were a trial in a court of law, I would have to find in their favor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, it reads very well and kept me glued.","review":"Having just finished the book, \\"The Hiram Key\\" I heartily recommend it to anyone interested in a great mystery spanning centuries. The reading scholar may argue specific dates or places, maybe even the circumstantial evidence, however, I am anxious for the discoveries waiting under the Holy of Holies at Rosslyn. Enjoyable to the professional and the adventurer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Documentation","review":"My biggest problem with this book is in its footnoting and documentation. Many of the titles in the footnotes (pp 71 among many others) are not in the Bibliography. Other information and quotes are never cited at all. The so-called facts about what occured after the Jewish War of 70 AD are not cited with any primary sources. In fact I don't believe there is hardly ever mention of primary sources. The only reference we get is SGF Brandon's \\"The Fall of Jerusalem and the Christian Church\\" This book might persuade the average reader, but if the authors wish to sway the opinion of anyone with any knowledge of the field, they must do better."},{"rating":"2","title":"good history","review":"The book is one of the best when it comes to the history of Freemansonry and the famous Knights Templars. It does give you an excellent detailed account of the fate of the Templars on those fatal nights and what they where accused of. I also liked their account of the Jewish war in 70 AD. The authors argue persuasively that the Rosslyn chappel was built by the Templars and could be housing the invaluable scrolls excavated by the Templars from the Jerusalem temple. The book also covers the mystery of the Turin Shroud. They argue that the image on the Shroud is Jacques de Molay, the last leader of the Templars! Yet, I was NOT convinced by their conclusion that Jacques de Molay was the Second Jesus Christ or Messiah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read","review":"This book is enlightening especially about the death of the leader of the knights templar, Jacques DeMolay. I think anyone interested in Templar lore will really get a lot of information out of this.The shroud of Turin and its connection with the Templar legends is also interesting. You will learn about how Jacques De Molay was tortured and see some potential proof that there may be a relation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heresy or Truth?","review":"This book is bound to tick off a lot of people. Having read both books by these guys, I must say I'm impressed. I've also been trying to find as many of their reference books as possible.From what I've found so far, I'm convinced that there is a lotthe orthodox churches are not telling us.This book gives a possible explanation to some long lingeringquestions that I, and I'm sure others, have been asking.Read the book, then decide for yourself.But remember, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, Mohammed, and Akhenaten allsaid the same thing. And that is to worship God.This is what the Knights Templar believed, and what could be simpler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting","review":"Seems the author likes to daydream and believes his random collection of information somehow adds up to indisputable proof. Fellow needs to read a bit more on scientific proofs. Other than that, well the book was interesting and entertaining. But should be on the fiction or UFO shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless trash","review":"I feel 1 star is too great an honor for this book.The authors in their honest search for the origins of freemasonry tend make the facts fit together, in their owm liking.Their drive to find an answer caused them to think of things that are just hogwash.Everything form the origins of the shroud, the truth of christianity, and the lies about catholisicm are just plain false."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Messiah: Templars, th Turin Shroud and the Great Secret of Freemasonry","review":"He gets caught in his own trap!! A lot of truth is discussed, but much of it does not understand the role of the Masonic Order. The Masonic Order and Temmplars kept the family safe. In 1832, this role was changed, as the book acknowledges. But the author is not able to give answers as to why or how it changed. Today this is not a challenge for the Masonic Order, klor the Templars. Completion of the a special Grail objective allowed the need for protection to be stopped. Now no one knows how to either get permission to unwrap the mystery!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"can't be taken seriously","review":"When a book contains the following sentence, it's hard to take it seriously:\\"The establishment of the Romanised Christian era marked the beginning of the Dark Ages: the priod of Western history when the lights went out on all learning, and superstition replaced knowledge. It lasted until the power of the Roman Church was undermined by the Reformation\\" (70).This flies in the face of extensive historical scholarship over the past century, and alone casts doubt upon the credibility and motives of the authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"More mumbo jumbo","review":"It's amazing what two people can \\"discover\\" when they make so many leaps of faith. Therein lies the irony--the authors betray such a hatred for catholicism and organized religion, yet essentially ask their readers to take a leap of faith to accept the authors' conclusions.Very mundane and the research leaves much to be desired. Then again, if you really want your readers to accept your conclusions, why bother putting in any evidence to the contrary?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy research work","review":"What could have been quite a good read is spoilt by evidence of shoddy research work. There are several anachronisms which irritate the discerning reader. Examples are the reference to \\"the Vatican\\" in connection with the Templars' excavations c.1100 (the Pope only moved to the Vatican in 1871), and the setting up of the Hospitaller Order of St John \\"of Rhodes and of Malta\\" (this Order moved to Rhodes in the fourteenth century and to Malta in the sixteenth). The translation of \\"Rex Deus\\" is a howler which has already been pointed out by another reader. The vow of obedience taken by the Templars (which aroused the authors' suspicion) is a customary vow taken by all entrants into Roman Catholic religious orders. A cursory query would have shown as much. Otherwise passable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real science","review":"What I like about the three books by these two guys is their freethinking that is underpinned by a scientific approach. They do speculate but over time much of their ideas have been proved out by other people - and themselves. They certainly have the support of a lot of heavyduty academics!There are some really crazy reviews on their books, but its easy to see who the fruitcakes are when they actually describe Knight and Lomas as mad.Keep up the good work guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title is misleading","review":"It would be nice if Knight and Lomas' supposed findings were true. One would expect then that they would also be more widely reported, especially by the anti-mason press. As they aren't you have to read the book knowing that you're skimming around the edges of conspiracy or what is known as fringe or speculative masonry. I had the distinct impression that the authors were hoping for some masonic recognition and were snubbed, thereby fuelling their conspiracy fire even more.Nevertheless it provides an otherwise enjoyable read and does renew an interest in taking a trip to Rosllyn. However, the title is misleading as the authors try to fashion their 2nd messiah to be like Jesus, forgetting that divinity pays no heed to history, however tenuous the links."},{"rating":"1","title":"Esoteric and Occultic balderdash","review":"One of the unfortunate aspects of Masonic history is that just about anyone with an opinion can, with the blessings of some publisher, \\"discover\\" the lost secrets of Masonry, and more often than not, these \\"secrets\\" lead to an apology for all manner of occultic and theosophical twaddle. The authors of THE HIRAM KEY waste little time getting on to the task of making Freemasonry the implict enemy of the historic, orthodox Christian faith. Fortunately, the Craft has been blessed by the earlier efforts of sound scholarship and research, such as that of Henry Coil, the late John Robinson, and the time honored work of Robert Freke Gould. Anyone interested in learning the REAL history of Freemasonry is encouraged to spend his time with these brothers, and place THE HIRAM KEY where it belongs: in the \\"Fantasy and Science Fiction\\" section of the library. Aleister Crowley would be most pleased with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, if it was satire","review":"This book is an essay on the ridiculous connections that can be created when \\"it seems reasonable to assume\\" and \\"it seems likely\\" are treated as fact. If it was satire parading as history, I'd have to say it was brilliant. As a historical work, it holds water like a cheese grater.It is pretty entertaining to read if you can get past grinding your teeth over the amazing leaps of presumption."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not believable","review":"I started to get a bad feeling about this book already on page 8, where the authors cite Hugh Schonfield's off-the-wall book, The Passover Plot, as if it were a standard reference work on early Christianity (they also seem to think it was published in 1993) ... and things go downhill from there.The authors believe that the crucified figure on the Shroud of Turin is not Christ, but (pause for drumroll) Jacques deMolay. The problem here is that while deMolay was certainly martyred by the Inquisition, there's no indication whatever in the historical record that he was crucified. The detailed and gruesome description of this \\"event\\" is presented as narrative fact, but is actually pure speculation. Bah! If you're looking for a book about goofy theories on the history of Christianity, I recommend Holy Blood, Holy Grail: it's much more readable and sometimes is almost convincing."},{"rating":"1","title":"too many secrets","review":"Cass was Maximos mistress for several years when she decides she wanted more. It was not the plan so they part ways. Six month later she shows up to a wedding with Maximos slimy enemy. My first take of Cass was that she is pathetic and a lunatic to show up just for closure. Maximos had his own secrets too that just keeps unraveling. The dialoge was repetitive in regards to how she should of expect more from him and how she was leaving when she never does..I am partial to books where the heroine has a backbone. At the end the Maximos cries to keep Cass that made it better considering she was the one pleading and crying throughout the book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane Porter at her best!!!","review":"I strongly agree with the reviewer that compared this book with a ride on a roller coaster! Cassandra is a lovely character that has gone through a lot. At first, I was mad at Max, but the way the author made up for him towards the end was great. You truly get to put yourself in his place and understand. I loved that Cassandra finally learned to stand up for herself. I could not put it down; the day I read this book no one at home got my attention. I strongly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A different love story","review":"The Sicilian's Defiant Mistress by Jane Porter is somewhat different from Jane Porter's other Harlequins. It's a much darker story filled with secrets and revenge.The heroine is fighting with a lot of emotions and she has a hard time figuring out what she needs and what she wants.I had a hard time reading this story. It did not have the same easy flow as Jane's other books.I have read many of Jane Porter's books and really love them, but this one is the first one that is very different from her other books and I had troubles enjoying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing pieces!","review":"The throw back arrived with incorrect pieces in the box.

Even the company admits it is a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"A strong and occasionally risk-taking anthology.","review":"Though not all the stories are as taboo-shattering as the cover hype implies, a good bit of them are still excellent. Danielle Willis shows us the decidedly unromantic and unglamourous life of a vampire and her lover; Lucy Taylor gives us deadly autoeroticism and shows us what lies on the other side; Don Webb turns torment into art and Steve Rasnic Tem twists the family ties. An incident in a junior high school locker room destines one teacher for revenge in a story from Edward E. Kramer. There's also great work from Rob Hardin, Mike Lee and Howard Kaylan. A collection with far more hits than misses."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor example of fiction, masquerading as fact.","review":"After reading this text I was physically sick in several locations of my local shopping centre. Needless to say, the book needs a lot more editing before it could pass as a script for any high school assessment, and I find it hard to believe that it has sold more than ten thousand copies in the United States alone. Had I been the publisher, as I wish I had been, I would have recommended a total overhall of the story-line as well as the total removal of some of the weak characters that are the basis of the novel.

This movie is very entertaining, however, and is a great treat for Katharine Isabelle fans. Lots of great humor and some really good drama as well. One of my favorite scenes is in a restaurant where KI's character is forced to repeat a very tongue twisting and confusing pizza order. It's also nice to watch Katharine stand up to a casino owner who suspects her (rightfully)of counting cards.

While I appreciate examples to help cement an idea, this book has to many. For each bullet the author would provide,there would be no fewer than three examples. If the author cut down the examples to only one or two per bullet, this book would be half as thick.As a professional who has gone back to get a masters degree, I would not recommend this book to an active practitioner, nor would I recommend the book to anyone who is looking to get started. I would recommend the Harvard Business Essentials series for anyone looking for information on how to initiate and manage change."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Change twice\\"","review":"Built on the thesis that sustained change (and in particular the change to living with continuous change) requires that we 'change twice'. The first change - in arrangements, structures, relationships, processes and so on - does not stick without the second change, which is in perception - how we see the world. The author works through tools and techniques that challenge our established mind-sets and so facilitate this second change. The text contains useful lists - for example of types of questions and the impact of asking questions in different ways - and a variety of visual puzzles designed to challenge our view of 'the obvious'.The style and coverage is somewhat reminiscent of the de Bono books, but with a tighter linkage to change in organizations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back in the time","review":"I was nearly 10 years old when this album was released.

With a lot of 70's prog music, you expect it to sound dated when returning to listen to it today. That can ruin the experience, at least in my opinion. Except for a few examples (some use of flutes for instance) you don't get that with Focus 3. This is an exceptional, vibey album with incredibly tight musicianship of all the players. Jans' axe-slinging needs no introduction. So, moving straight along..... Buy it. At the MP3 price it's a steal.

It wasn't hard to install and setup once you understood how it goes together. The locking mechanism is solid and seems to hold well. the only thing that takes away from a 5 star review is the hardware (nut,bolts,washers). I don't think that the manufacturer could have used cheaper hardware if they tried. Come on, the thing is 275 dollars!!!! At least splurge and give grade 5 bolts!! And what's with a 1/4-20 bolt having a 10mm head, (really they have 1/4-20 thread and a 10mm head, WTF!!! I still REALLY like this fence for it's simplicity and repeatability but not for it's hardware. After the fence is shipped to you and you're going to install it figure out what bolts you need and make a trip to the hardware store and spend the extra 2 bucks that the manufacturer didn't want to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!! But bad/cheap install hardware & tools","review":"The fence, rails, and legs themselves are very well built. My fence was only .010\\" of of true, which was easily offset when adjusting it to the blade. Proper installation will take upwards of 2 hours but its worth it. My only complaints are with the cheap installation hardware and tools they include with the kit. Do yourself a favor and make a trip to the hardware store for some grade 5 bolts before you start the installation. The drill bit which was sent with my kit is bent about 15 degrees off of dead center, making it impossible to use. Surprisingly the tap wasn't bad, it lasted long enough to make the 4 holes I needed to. Overall I'm very happy with it though and wouldn't hesitate to purchase it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"fence is nice but rails shipped damaged twice","review":"The fence is nice, no complaints there. However, twice they shipped me rails that came damaged. At first I blamed UPS but after the second time I figured the problem is how they package the rails. They bolt them together with two tiny bolts in a box that is slightly too loose. By the time it got to my shop the bolts had broken off bending the rail around the holes and stripping them. The first one that was shipped had some pretty serious dents in it despite the fact that its a thick piece of metal. I kept the second one they shipped me but I had to re thread two bolt holes. I would rather have paid more money and not had too fix a brand new tool. I will say Grizzly's customer service was good I just don't have time to ship things back and forth or fix brand new tools."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very inaccurate","review":"I just browsed through this book in a local store and I'm amazed by how inaccurate this book is.

However a number of reviewers have pointed out that it has inaccuracies.It also has a strange stress on a limited number of languages. I can appreciate for instance the author's passion for Yiddish, and the little paragrah he writes on ways of cursing and insulting in Yiddish- but I wonder at the total absence of Hebrew and Aramaic in this work.There are little essays which are informative including one on languages which are threatened with extinction. Another discourses on the number of languages in the world. I was surprised to learn at how many different languages there are in Papua New Guinea.I found the little section on especially long- words, compounds of various kinds also interesting.This book has a lot of amusing information in, and should be treated as a work of entertainment not serious scholarship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mutually Assured Destruction on a cosmic scale","review":"If, somewhere in this universe two interstellar enemies assumed the trait humanity demonstrated during the 20th Century, took 'I'd rather be dead than Red' to the ultimate logical extreme, killed one another off entirely after having set their killing machines on autopilot, just to make certain, you'd have the 'other side' in the Berserkers series.

The references to Tony Soprano are completely contrived, and embarrassingly serious. They made me want to yell, \\"Hey, he's a fictitious character, created by a roomful of Hollywood writers!\\" If this book were written 30 years ago, it would be called Leadership Captain Kirk Style. It's a prime example of borrowed interest, and should wind up on remainders tables in about three years."},{"rating":"2","title":"dynamite","review":"Great band, and a great live electric album. Naturally there are those purists who lament the fact that Horslips shed their folkly ways and plugged in and let it rock for this phase of their career, but I love this dynamic, ramped-up version of the band. I saw them in concert the year before this album was released and they were electric --- in many senses of the word. The early folk/concept albums were very, very good, but don't ignore this rockin' set and the excellent \\"The Man Who Built America\\" album."},{"rating":"1","title":"The emperor\`s not wearing any clothes...","review":"I am au fait with all of this band\`s albums and I can assure anyone unfamiliar with Horslips that, as an earlier reviewer stated, the studio versions of these tracks are far superior to the live versions on either the double album \\"Horslips Live\\"(from 1975) or on this later effort, \\"The Belfast Gigs\\"(their final album, released in 1980)which, although better than the earlier live album, which was appallingly bad, fails to do justice to any of the tracks and makes up with noise and improvised sloppiness what it lacks in substance and musical dexterity.I never saw these guys play live but I suspect that there was more than a little truth behind a contemporaneous music critic\`s claim that \\"Horslips couldn\`t really play...\\"The fans who rave about \\"The Belfast Gigs\\" are those fans who think that Horslips could do no wrong and are therefore not prepared to be objective and realistic about how good, bad, or indifferent Horslips really were, at different times."},{"rating":"1","title":"belfast gigs","review":"Yes, this album is a big improvement on the other(earlier) Horslips Live album in terms of production values and overall sound quality. Not that that would be difficult, considering how bad the first live album was. However, all of the tracks(apart from Shakin\` All Over, which is a cover, of course, and not a Horslips song - another minus!) are inferior to their original studio versions. There is energy and enthusiasm here, sure!... but, musically, the studio versions are a hell of a lot better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was this redone?","review":"I have the earlier two disc set, which is awesome. And everytime I rip it, this one comes up and names the songs wrong! I can't believe they've redone this CD and left out some of the best songs. Ok, I don't miss King Tut but Seasons in the Sun and Walk on the the Wild Side and Miracles, shoulda left it alone. Maybe you can find the old two disc set used, but I'm not parting with mine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perspective Shifted","review":"You can tell the author is a poet. This story was beautifully written, insightful and certainly rang true. When I finished reading it I felt I had gained a new perspective about how it must be for people who have their homeland torn apart by war. They love their homes, so the answer isn't just fleeing to freedom and safety. For some, there just is no answer. This book turned on new lights for me and moved as well as frustrated me. We can't just save the world with our wealth and generosity, as such actions are viewed by so many good and honest people as signs of arrogance and naivety. I enjoyed the closure the author proveded with the epilogue (after all, it was in part, a love story), but in reality the fugitive's fate probably would remain a mystery. This is a wonderful book, a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romance, Politics, and Imagination combined","review":"This novel brings romance, politics, and a fantastic imagination together. You are drawn into this novel and it almost feels as if you are right in the midst of it all. The characters are described in such detail that you can see their faces in your mind. It is a semi-easy read and is not too long or not too short of a book, it keeps your attention and you don't want to put it down. The mixture of romance and politics is a combination that goes well together in this novel. Demetria combines reality with fantasy and she does it very well as she puts all the characters and the parts they play together. Maria and Jose Luis are perfect, they are both struggling and fighting their own wars, in their hearts and in reality and the fantasy they have made amongst themselves and in their relationship sustains them through the rough patches. This is a novel that is definately worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This movie is completely worthless. The director had a very successful debut with the first HC, but the sequel is pointless. It consists of disgusting scene after disgusting scene strung together with little to no story in between. I'm a fan of torture and gore, but when it's thrown together just for the sake of being disgusting, don't bother.

His facial expressions are deserving of an oscar. The film was the most disgusting that I have ever seen and we are promised that HC3 will be even more gross. It is not without its flaws however. The very first warehouse scene has the owner talking to the guy hiring it. There is a sudden jump in the editing and we next see the owner lying on the floor with blood gushing from his stomach.

This flick exists for the sole purpose of gore and it does not even do that right. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um, no.","review":"This movie is an hour and twenty eight minutes long.

The first film -- something of an instant cult favorite, even if it made pennies at the box office -- seemed to have fully explored its central premise, so what could Six do to up the ante? This time around, he goes with the meta commentary, focusing on a disturbed, overweight parking garage attendant named Martin Lomax who's obsessed with the first Human Centipede film. Eventually, Martin decides to recreate the experiment therein portrayed, and what ensues is a brutal, graphic depiction of his efforts. The Human Centipede II: Full Sequence is so over the top that I simply got tired of it and felt the weak attempt at social commentary was undone by its own boundary-pushing. Nevertheless, the improvement in technical skill over the first film at least holds some merit."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"And then there were twelve...\\"","review":"Whereas the original HUMAN CENTIPEDE had a mere three unfortunates joined together at their rectums, this smash sequel ups the ante -- or is that centi-ante? -- by nine for an even dozen and succeeds in making an ass out of everyone involved, most of all the \\"filmmakers.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't regret much in life","review":"....but I regret ever watching this poor display of what the human mind is possible of.

People who say this has no class or background were simply too distracted by the gore of the film or had a bad thought in mind before viewing which made the experience nothing. I watched the film 3 times... first to watch a sequel second to find the character development and third for my final understanding. Now a days viewers only look at the surface of a movie and miss the psychological games and, in this movie, the chance to get into the mind of Martin. People need to approach movies like this with an open mind and if you don't like the movie you don't like the movie, don't force your opinion on others saying the movie was a waste because that other parson may not think the same way.

I did personally feel a few scenes where a little unecessary but hey I got what I payed for. It took me a few hours to get over the pure freakiness of the film.

This is not a horror film.The only way I can really describe it is if they were to give a pad of paper and pen to John Wayne Gacy and told him to write a story line for a film. This is not entertainment for the average person who enjoys a horror film. This (In my opinion) is for people who may become turned on by the sight of human suffering. Though it's not real, it really doesn't matter. It's the mind that thought this up that is more frightening. The fact that a film company would even allow a budget to produce this.

People calling it the most grotesque film ever made haven't seen enough gross out films. Sure it has moments and it is twisted but much more boring than the original. Zero character development. I am sure that was the direction Tom Six wanted to go but it didn't work for me. And the whole black and white thing? An artistic statement? Why??? I like my blood red!

I wasn't exactly excited about there being a Human Centipede 2, but I saw that it was at the top of my amazon.com recommendations and that it was available to watch instantly on netflix. So I watched it. It starts off okay, but it gets worse from there. This is the most disgusting movie I've ever seen, and I've seen a ton of Troma movies and John Waters movies. In the third act of The Human Centipede, we get to see several people defecate in someone else's mouth. That scene alone should make any sane person not want to see this movie. This is the worst piece of trash I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"seen one seen 'em all","review":"the shock factor and potty humor is what made the original so memorable.

The menu format is very accessible making it easy to tailor the instruction based on your own time schedule. The drills are broken into \\"levels\\" that are appropriate for beginners and intermediate students.

I find this very disrespectful in light of the tragedy that occurred there. And, if the author hasn't bothered to update this edition with regard to something so important, he has absolutely no credibility with regard to anything else listed in the book. It's one thing, in updating an edition, to miss the opening or closing of some small, out of the way cafe. It's another to, TWO YEARS LATER, still list the World Trade Center.

We went to three restaurants he recommended, and they all matched his recommendation. This is a book you can trust. It tells you about the good hotels and restaurants, the high-priced ones that are worth it and the ones that aren't, the ones that are the best value, and the ones to avoid.

I look at the book, and have to talk myself into starting it. Do the blurbs make it sound boring? Is it the lack of an intriguing cover? I just don't know. Each time I start reading his work, however, my trepidation is proved to be completely misplaced. Duncan's books are always fun and interesting, and I can never put them down. I really enjoy how he can infuse the characters with splashes of arrogance and cockiness (they are the greatest swordsmen on the planet, after all) but still have them retain endearing qualities. If you want to read a book filled with action and swordplay, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great story by Duncan","review":"What can I say-- Dave Duncan is the master of the ripping yarn. He is like a modern day Alexandre Dumas. His books are impossible to put down. His characters are riveting, and he isn't afraid to slay them to make a point.Each book is a stand-alone novel, but the more you read, the more you get an understanding of the Blades and their world. Duncan is witty without being forced and his characters are absolutely fascinating to read.Duncan is an amazing writer who should be required by law to write at least 2 books per year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely good, but interesting enough","review":"Well theres alot of good reveiws for this book.a few things I didn't like about Paragon Lost:-Beau is more than slightly unbelievable in his planning of ALL the events of the Novel. He seems to be in control of almost every event that comes his way.-The moral laws of Duncans laws are quite pathetic and absolutly unrealistic. He seems to imply that sexual relationships shoud never be questioned, and if questioned, it is wrong to do so, which does not add up to reality as every sexual relationship has in itself a consequence involving not just the participants but all those arround them.-The magic is a wee bit too easy, unexplained and quite boringwhat is commendable:-Intersting political intrigue.-Some very memorable characters-Great swordplay"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still solid gold","review":"Very good once again an old fashioned fantastic adventure that is light on the magic (thank god). The book follows a group of Blades as they leave their country of origin and go to a country that in a lot of ways mirrors medieval Russia.Its sort of a back story for the events that were chronicled in \\"the gilded chian\\" so some of the characters are very familiar.

And, like the other one-star reviewer, I quit after 100 pages -- something I RARELY do.

However, when I started to read this book, I could not get past the first few chapters.

I thought that the original version played by piano and orchestra would have to sound more melodious (it doesn't). I am not a real fan of the \\"postmodern\\" classical music style which disdains melody and structure, and strives to assault the ears.

I am a woman motorcyclist also, and take cross-country as well as cross-town trips on my bike, and I think that anyone I meet who is adventurous enough to ride, whether just for the day or for a month is a pretty cool person.

About one third of the book consists of a comprhensive discography which is notable for it's objectivity in reviewing all of Monk's recordings. This would be very helpful to anyone looking to begin or expand their Monk collection.

In \\"Expendable\\", Festina Ramos was very effective in this role. Her complex personality, with pain and paranoia foremost, came across as believable because she was telling the story, and made the entire book compelling.In \\"Ascending\\", Oar is the first person narrator. And (excuse the pun) Oar is a bore. We have no reason to like her, or care about her at all. In fact, the tedium of reading her banal comments virtually destroyed any joy in what otherwise might have been an interesting story concept.The moral of the story: Only try the first person ploy if it's a person you would want to hang out with.

The editorial and other customer reviews explain the characters and plot quite well so I have little to add to that.

Strohmeyer is trying to be Evanovich, but she fails in every respect: character, romantic interest, eccentric family member.

Try as I might, I couldn't warm up to this dopey, pale imitation of the truly hilarious Plum books. This book didn't elicit so much as a half-hearted smirk from me.

Sarah or Janet?","review":"Very sad imitation of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum stories. I looked for this book all over the place and was so excited about finally finding it.

The similarities are astounding and I am actually surprised that this series could be published since it is so much like a whole other series.See below:Bubbles, hairdresser to reporter - Stephanie, from sales/marketing to bounty hunterBubbles wacky mom - Stephanie, wacky grandmother and friendBubbles hot guy - Stephanie, two hot guysThe list goes on and on.The big difference here is in the writing. I have laugh out loud moments in my Stephanie books and none in this one. I care about Stephanie and have a hard time caring about Bubbles - she just seems ridiculous.The story is not good, the wit is not there and it was hard to finish this book.I wish only good things for this author, but I cannot recommend this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bubbles Unbound","review":"How can anyone put this book down?

I found the name \\"Bubbles\\" to be very annoying and made the character hard to like and the story even harder to believe. Strohmeyer's characters was obviously very similar to Evanovich's (love interest, crazy family, etc.) -- which could be a good thing. But it wasn't even as remotely entertaining in it's own right."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck?!?!?","review":"This is the first book I have read by Sarah Strohmeyer. I can't believe how slow-moving this book is. The characters are so out-of-this-world. Nothing is believable. I threw this book to the ground half way through. It never got started. If you like mystery, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK! Sorry Sarah."},{"rating":"2","title":"can't wait to read the next one","review":"Bubbles was the first mystery I've read, recommended by my roommate. I'm from the Lehigh Valley, so the book was naturally appealing. It was fun to know exactly what was going on and be able to picture the locations in my mind as I read. It made me homesick (I'm six hours away at college) when Bubbles talked about A-Treat soda and scrapple. The book was fun and engaging; I couldn't put it down! My roommate ordered all the other books in the series, and when she's done with them, I get to continue in the adventures of Bubbles.

There is very little plot to go with the idiot main charecter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bubbles is NOT even close to Janet Evanovich's Stephanie","review":"I was really hoping for another type of Stephanie series. I've only read this one (but purchased the others) and I'm sincerely hoping they'll get better. I don't like the way the author has made Bubbles an airhead. One can be a hair stylist that enjoys nail polish and have brains on top of that. She's written as if she doesn't have a clue to what's going on and doesn't really care.I prefer my heroine's to be a little stronger"},{"rating":"1","title":"not really that entertaining.","review":"I like to read a book when I work out. The measure of a good book is one that makes me forget about working out and that I want to keep reading when I have finished the work out. This book failed on both accounts. Of course I will have to admit to comparing it to Evanovich's books, and this frankly isn't even in the same ballpark, I am sorry to say. I really wanted to like this book. But the ideas were not really new, the characters seemed to copy that of Janet E, and the lines were not as humorous. Stick with Janet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super fun!","review":"Bubbles is so much fun.

The Beauty tips were cute, sort of like the recipes you get from a Diane Mott Davidson book. I really enjoyed the characters, especially the Mother and her friend. It is nice that Bubbles has a daughter as that adds some dimension as well. Bubbles is sort of an Erin Brockovich and a Stephanie Plum all rolled into one person. Now if we could just add a little Anita Blake to her character, that would be a treat. Only problem, I wish that Bubbles would leave her high heels at home when she is chasing the bad guys...I wish she were tougher. I loved the book Barbie Unbound and this is a great start to a new series...."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish all mysteries were this good...","review":"If you like Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum, you will love Bubbles Yablonsky. (Horrible name, but great book) It is a laugh out loud mystery. Run, don't walk and get this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wannabe Plum","review":"This book is entertaining, but what takes away from it is the fact that the entire time that I was reading it I kept thinking of Stephanie Plum. Bubbles' mom reminds me of Stephanie's grandma - Stilleto is obviously a copy of Joe. Even Mr. Salvo has similarities to Vinnie... same story line. Not perfect Jersey girl finds herself in trouble that she's not cut out for, in love (or lust) with men she shouldn't be, and surrounded by kooky characters.It's worth reading for the fact that it is an easy read. However, I would suggest if you're looking for a good book of this nature, read Janet. If you've read them all already, read them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"What a great, quick , fun read!

Great!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"abundantly passionate and loving","review":"When I first saw a clip of this movie, I must admit, I was attracted to the beautiful bodies and handsome faces. I was also drawn in by the sexual energy. However, watching the movie in its entirety, I found \\"From Beginning to End\\" to be so much more.There is a loving, extended family that share dinners and laughs. There is the main relationship between the two brothers. It is very clear from the beginning that theirs is a bond that can not be broken. The moments when they are in bed for the first time, confessing why they love each other is one of the most beautiful, romantic scenes in any movie I've ever seen.It is so interesting to see how they cope with having to be apart for the first time in their lives.After a while, I forgot they were brothers. It isnt really a factor in the movie after they become adults.I didn't particularly care for the subtitles, but this movie won't disappoint.From Beginning to End"},{"rating":"1","title":"SKIP IT SKIP IT !!!!","review":"The most boring dvd I now own. It was a waste of the camera crew and the actors and the writers. I may toss this into a donation bin somewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh!","review":"First off great subject, but I am not used to a movie with out tragedy or action. Mellow drama if there was any drama. Could have been better with more disastrous twists and turns. I was hoping one would die or commit suicide to make it real heart breaking, but it ended happily ever after."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really reflecting the struggling love between brothers","review":"I was quite disappointed after viewing this movie. I was expecting to see the struggles when older brother realizes that he falls in love with his younger brother, but this part was totally skipped. The movie portraits that the parents found out the unusual intimacy between the brothers when one is 16 and the other is 10 years old. I think this is ridiculous. That kind of intimacy to me is totally normal. And therefore the transition from brothers to lovers is kind of strange to me. If this intimacy happens between two brothers both in their adolescences, that will be something to worry about. Many other books I read to talk about this kind of forbidden love are hundred times better than this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, and again a refreshing change","review":"Yes a refreshing change of pace for a gay film, so I really liked it enough to buy it later after I rented it. Two good looking guys staring in the roles and so good writing to top it off I recommend it for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exploring Brothers Loving each other....","review":"Exploring brothers loving each other and expressing their love in intimate, sexual and sensuous manners was somewhat disconcerting. I think most of the world's cultures share the view of incest as a taboo subject. By film's end, I could see how it could happen, but have never known personally of anyone who was in such a relationship. It challenged my values, but I leave judgments about this subject to One who is, in my mind, is the only One so qualified."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully filmed, well acted, but plausible story?","review":"This film intrigued me due to its content, setting and controversy. I found it to be beautifully filmed, the actors were very good and the storyline interesting. All things considered, I kept wondering how likely this situation would ever be, unless there had been some kind of abuse to sexualize these boys early on. I also wondered how likely it would be that two brothers could fall in love and move out of the traditional brother-to-brother relationship. In spite of my doubts, I found myself enjoying the film and wondering how all the dynamics between parents, friends and others - as well as the brothers themselves - would play out and became hopeful for the brother-lovers. I wasn't disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Largely engaging but odd in ways","review":"I enjoyed the film. It makes you watch out of curiosity, because the plot and the subject matter are both novel. Novelty is by no means synonymous with merit. This film is poetic in its dialogue and it's production value (the score, imagery, etc...) What's most striking is its irregular timing, and also its lack of several normal features: a clear trajectory, antagonists, climax, a clear ending. Watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly (not in a good way) like a 1980's movie of the week","review":"This film had so much potential but simply did not live up to it. First off the musical score is the absolute worst, like something from an early '80's movie of the week. Next too much time was spent in childhood with emphasis on the parents, who have little to no impact on the incestuous brothers in adulthood. So one has to ask why such time was spent on them in the first place.The subject matter of the film could have been really interesting but in that this film exists in some bizarro-world where pretty much everyone involved in the brother's lives seem just about 100% ok with their relationship that shatters social mores of both homosexuality as well as incest. That alone makes it seem too unbelievable, especially all the family members.Of course some of this can be forgiven whenever the two incredibly attractive leads romantically cavort, but overall does not make up for the films flaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"This film was a let down, the story line was not there.

This however was a who cares regarding the story. Poor quality disc from vendor, skipped at times but didn't matter as didn't feel was missing anything important or interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spare yourself!","review":"If the write-up on this film leads you to expect an interesting story about a quasi-incestuous relationship between two half-brothers, spare yourself. Spoiler alert: the boys love each other as children, as teens and as adults. Period. There's no story development, just tedious sequences of the boys swimming together, then kissing, then swimming. It has all the drama of a 4-hour commercial for speed-o's. To paraphrase a critic's assessment of Poulenc, this director had absolutely nothing to say...and he said it. If you want really soft-porn, but have a heart condition, go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"deceiving reviews","review":"The movie was at best a gay soft core porn. Its acting was awful, the editing was choppy and story line was artificial. I never really comment on movies, but before you spend your money, reconsider this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising and Beautiful","review":"The subject of two brothers in love (half-brothers, actually) would seem to be the main hurdle to get over in order to enjoy this film. I would - kindly, gently - suggest you get over it. This is a beautiful, very sweet and ultimately very moving film - and one that is surprisingly sunny considering it's a story about death and incest as much as it is about the trials and joys of love.Wonderfully, naturally and subtly acted - no, embodied - by an attractive cast and filmed with a languor that is suitable to Brazil, I would highly recommend this to anyone with an open mind and an unjaded heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing story","review":"Though very controversial, this story is very touching. Uncontrolled love in the hands of children \\"watching the world upside down,\\" as they say. The dialogues could be better developed and so could the characters, but not bad for a low-budget production. Worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely developed characters","review":"This story, as startling to our sensibilities as it may be, is nonetheless believable (the sexual attraction between twins) and compelling. The actors are physically attractive, but the nudity brief and appropriate. The plot move slowly with the camera lingering on individual scenes longer then we in the US are used to. The transitions between scenes (blank screens) are unsophisticated, and a little jarring. The cinematography is excellent. The family is obviously upper middle class, well educated but still surprisingly liberal and broad minded about how their children develop sexually. I think the movie portrayed an ideal world that we aspire to, not the world that we live in. A feel good movie for those of us in the LGBT community."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I expected more from this movie. The storyline could have been expanded on more and the music score was just prosaic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"The movie did not connect with me on any emotional level. I Kept fast forwarding to see if it got better - it did not. I got that the brothers were in love and found it difficult to be apart. I got that the parents identified that the bond between the boys was very strong - maybe more than brotherley love. I did not feel any emotional connections with parents, children, situation, NOTHING. To me it was a waste of money and I will not be sucked into believing the blurb on a cover, ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"no real plot","review":"Half brothers have a mutual attraction from an early age through adulthood, but there's no real plot, just a few gratuitous nude shots and a bad storyline.

There's something about the weighting that makes them more responsive than other sticks, and the tip shape seems to sound great no matter what you're playing. The 'shoulder' of the stick, right where it meets the head, is tapered less and also is more gradual coming into the head itself, meaning that there's a slightly higher percentage of the stick weight up toward the head of the stick.

I still haven't finished going thru the whole book mainly because of the the lack of nice names. The type is small and I found myself squinting to read some of the meanings to my wife. The biggest disappointment was the book was split into half. Meaning from page X to X the meaning where in Spanish and from page X to X they where in english not sure why use this approach and waste ink and paper instead the meaning should of been together first in one language and then in the other not print the name twice.

Nissanoff makes a strong case and I agree, they are great for the masses who don't want to sell on eBay, or don't know how, or are too busy or just get tired of storing boxes and shipping material at home.

The overall premise was a solid one, that if you can buy (say) a DVD for $12, watch it, then resell it on eBay for $5, it really only costy ou $7. The author goes into some of the history and theory of secondary markets, why they work, and why they are important.Unfortunately, I just gave you the whole book. He repeats the above 3-5 times a chapter for 10 chapters, and weaves in commercials for his own, drop-shipping company, claiming that only fools or hobbyists would consider selling things on eBay themselves.

I'm sorry folks... doesn't measure up!! What an incredible waste of effort on Ishiguro's part and of time and money on mine. I wouldn't give this book to my worst enemy...unless I wanted to bore him to death. I can appreciate the Kafka-esque quality about it but that's it.

How could it be possible to pull off such a feat?There is no prize.Do not listen to those who are afraid to sound ignorant or unenlightened, this book sucks. This book is so bad, it motivated me to write my first ever internet review of any product.

My thoughts specifically are, \\"WHAT??\\" Even though this book is frustrating to a degree where I would have liked to have chucked it out of a moving car, it was far and away one of the better and more memorable books I have ever read.I'm glad I didn't read the reviews prior to taking on this challenge, I may not have done so if I did. While I kept hoping that all of the issues presented would tidy themselves up in neat little packages, I then realized that this is not a Hollywood movie and I needed to relax and enjoy the very bizarre journey.There is a story to be told and, you may end up hating every one of the characters at some point, but it is well worth every minute of your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am unconsoled with this book!","review":"I read 300 pages of Ishiguro's \\"Unconsoled\\" and had to give up. The novel is set up like a dream or nightmare, depending on your point of view. Me I just wanted to wake-up! The dream state that Ishiguro had his main character Ryder in becomes a vehicle for any indulgence or mistake by the author. Kafka summed up the absurd in quite fewer pages and much better in The Trial. Kafka keeps your heart beating with K.'s breathless anxiety. The Unconsoled is a page turner, but dead-pan, emotionless, and lifeless. No doubt Ishiguro intended this since he is working with the dream state. I kind of felt like a zombie turning the pages after awhile. For me it had me wondering why I was making the trip and spending the time to read it, not a good sign. The only person unconsoled at the end of this novel is the reader. That being said, Ishiguro's \\"The Artist of the Floating World\\" was very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating, yes. Unique, yes. Like it, not so much.","review":"It's interesting to read the glowing reviews of this book. I almost feel like I missed something. I don't think I did.Mr. Ryder is a completely unsympathetic character. There is nothing to hold on to and no reason to care about him. If this were a character study alone, this might be enought to move you through it, but as the protaganist within in a maze of metaphor, I needed him to pull me through. Someone that I at least had some interest in or found at all redeming. I kept thinking \\"who cares what happens to you in your shallow self-centered world.\\" And that made it very difficult to \\"get\\" the book as a whole or even make it to the end.I found it wholely unsastisfying and much because I had the feeling that Mr. Ryder was nothing more than a terrible cad."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't get it","review":"Whatever you want to call this one--dream fiction, surrealism, or Kafkaesque--the twists and turns fail to inform the reader of anything significant except for the fact that the main character always manages to forget the most essential questions about life.

I found this book to be an empty exercise of prosaic tricks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Remains of the Day was one of the best books I ever read. This was one of the worst books I ever read. It seems like Ishiguro was trying to do something artsy and creative and instead crafted something annoying and frustrating.

I should have read Remains of the Day two more times instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ahead of his Time?","review":"Is it not the hallmark of a truly great author to have visions way ahead of his time? Or is it. Having enjoyed \\"The Remains of the Day\\" I started on \\"The Unconsoled\\". This was quite a struggle, until one day it struck me: I am not reading a book, I am surfing the net (very, very slowly). Is not the incomprehensible passing through a door into a different space/time frame a metaphor for clicking on a hyperlink? Or vice versa? Both allow you, in a few clicks to end up where you began, having forgotten in the meantime why you went away in the first place. For a book written this long ago it is a quite a feat to have previsioned the internet as we know it today; on the other hand, once you know this, or think this is the case, it's just a gimmick. And then I just could not continue reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"The novel seems to be a description of a nightmare. Reality and dream entwined in a very rare way.

It would be hard not to read the novel and not categorize it as Kafkaesque. Anything that demands the reader have a high threshold for ambiguity gets the Kafka tag. However, I enjoyed the novel immensely. Of course, for some people my idea of a good read might be the literary equivalent of being beaten with a sack of rotten blowfish.Rather than develop heartburn trying to figure out what was what, I just read it and enjoyed being led around on Ryder's strange trip. About 3/5 into the novel, I had my suspicions about what was going on, which were confirmed when I read an Ishiguro interview after completing the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A frustrating book","review":"I kept reading this book to the end, in spite of my frustration, trying to understand the author's point. I would simply say \\"I don't get it\\". Whatever way you look at this book, it does not make much sense. And there is more than 500 pages of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey, Mr Ishiguro, may I have three hours of my life back?","review":"Dreadful. A beautifully written piece of nothing. I suppose there was a story in there somewhere, but the layers of impression and nuance and deliberate disorientation thoroughly destroyed any plot there may have been to begin with.

I was wrong.I read for pleasure, but there was none here. The novel is like a nightmare you can't wake up from. The author constantly tricks you into reading more, even after you already realize the joke is on you. Around halfway through this torture, I \\"pinched\\" myself by picking up another book, and a couple of days later dumped The Unconsoled in the thrash.Do not punish yourself with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"Definitely not Ishiguro's best work.

Sure, you could say that it's an interesting character study of an eastern european community of indeterminate size, but I call it lazy--like the author who kills the main character at the end because he can't think of any other way to end the book. Ishiguro takes liberties with time, distance, and perspective that do little to reinforce elements of plot, and also make the reader question the protagonist's validity as a voice. Rather than being charming or interesting, they quickly become tiresome, and make one think that Ishiguro's editor must have been asleep at the wheel.

Our unions are awash in Corporatism and have become the purveyors of economic terrorism.

That confidence can be had in this book!Americans know that we need an economy that serves all our families and communities. If they read this book, they will see that Polish workers understood that as well and did something about it. They went about criss-crossing their country, meeting each other and forming a movement so powerful it brought down the Communists.This book is a road-map to proving to the Common Man and Woman that we can win the Solidarity Society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreamy Afternoon","review":"this reminds me of my favorite cocteau twins recording, the moon and the melodies. this is a great cd to meditate to, very relaxing and mind opening. the music is creamy, dreamy, and lulling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great album from Guthrie and Budd","review":"This album doesn't seem to cover any new territory that the two haven't done before either together or solo.

It creates a situation where you have to buy extra plugins in order to play dvd files and even popular audio files. If you're thinking you can just copy your dvd or mp3 over and all is good, think again. The plugins are quite expensive too. On top of it all, if you buy the travel kit, you can't record full rez video without an additional (very expensive) product! Very disappointing.It's a nice product for watching movies but it's pretty poor on the audio side. It won't play music by album and it can't see iTunes' images (probably some other plugin they will sell you).

As good as the first one was, Surprised by Truth 2 is simply a better book. It's richer, deeper, and it has better variety (not just stories about former Protestants this time). The first one was good, but Surprised by Truth 2 is GREAT -- I loved it. Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Same but Better","review":"I highly recommend both SBT1 and SBT2. They both read like a \\"Reader's Digest\\" of conversion stories. This format makes the SBT series an easier, more entertaining, read than most apologetics books. Both SBT1 and SBT2 make perfect gifts for friends and family, and are great to keep by your bedside. I preferred SBT2 only marginally over SBT1, and then only because it contained 15 stories instead of 11, including those of cradle Catholics who fell away and later returned to the Faith. Whether you are a Protestant who is interested in what Catholics believe, a marginal Catholic who wants to learn more about your faith, or a devout Catholic who loves conversion stories, try either or both books in the SBT series. God Bless!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful and entertaining","review":"I've always enjoyed true stories, and conversion stories are the best to read. They bring hope, and the greatly varied backgrounds of the converts make it easier for people struggling with their faith to relate in some way. I think the stories of Catholic reverts are the most poignant because they help those who are unaware of the immense gift they have already been given. Patrick Madrid seems tireless in his efforts to win souls, and this book is one of many, along with his Envoy Magazine, that accomplishes this goal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book!","review":"I had the immense pleasure of reading a pre-publication galley copy of this book that a friend gave me. If you're Catholic, then you need to pick it up and re-affirm your faith. If you're thinking about entering the Catholic church, this book will provide you with the Biblical and emotional nudge you need to dive in. If you're not Catholic, and the thought of becoming Catholic has never crossed your mind, you need to read it to understand what you're missing...Who knows? You may be Surprised By Truth 2!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jesus would have been appalled","review":"This book celebrates conversions to an organization that oppresses people every day, cutting them off from essential parts of their nature and advocating covert hatred of anyone not of the same beliefs--and all this in the name of quite probably the greatest, most accepting sage of all time. Not acceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Readable, but not entirely convincing-Vol 1 is MUCH better","review":"Okay, I admit it, I was taken in by the advertising hype on this one. They made it seem as though it was just like volume one.It is NOT anything like the first volume.The stories are not written (or edited) very well. But what is worse -- the reasons for converting to the Catholic Church are NOT presented in a convincing manner, except maybe for one or two chapters.If you purchase this book, PLEASE DO NOT SHARE IT WITH NON-CATHOLICS. Not only will it leave most of them unconvinced, even worse, it will make it easier for them (and anti-Catholics) to explain away conversions to Catholicism in purely psychological terms.The problem with any sequel is that it invites comparisons. In this case, unfortunately, that bodes ill for future volumes. Do us all a favor, Mr. Madrid, and cut your losses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Although I am a Catholic, I found this book to be a bit disappointing.

This book is the easiest to follow, without being too simplistic. The format is exceptional and key questions are clear, concise and still open-ended enough to prevent \\"leading\\" your patient. There are cross-references for each complaint, as well as home care measures for each ailment. The final points are the blank formatted pages for writing your own protocols, and tracking charts to complete QA. 5 stars hardly seem enough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"If the armed forces uses it and bases their clinical practice guidelines on it, it's got to be good, right? It is. I use this book in nurse telephone triage for a military pediatric clinic with 2700 patients. The book is spiral bound and easy to flip pages, and the pages stay open to the topic you are using. Topics are alphabetized which saves time when searching for a certain topic. There is a very useful table of contents at the front. The home care instructions are straight forward and acceptable to our parents.

Most of them taken by themselves can seem uncompelling, like pieces in a jig-saw puzzle. This film strings the events together in a way that clearly reveals a larger picture. I have read what seemed to me to be credible eyewitness accounts of all but two of the events portrayed here, like the nurse who knew nothing about anything except for a glimpse of something in the hospital. Again, taken by itself, at most an eyebrow raiser, but string a bunch of them together and what would seem to be incredible becomes undeniable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie about the \\"UFO Crash near Roswell, N.M\\"","review":"\\"Roswell - The U.F.O.

The Air Force at Roswell claimed that they had captured a \\"Flying Saucer\\" but then reversed itself and said it was only a weather balloon! Years later the Air Force said the event was the crash of a \\"Mogul Train of Spy balloons\\". ( Special balloons with listening microphones to detect Russian atomic bomb testing). Then later, Air Force claimed the \\"Crash\\" was a test where dummies were dropped from aircraft. The film was well acted with Kyle MacLachlan as Jesse Marcel. It showed how he was ordered to be photographed with the remains of a weather balloon and keep quiet about the material that was actually recovered from the crash site; miles from the city of Roswell.

Thank god WWE has the footage from the ECW library to include all of this, and RVD has made it known that he's not the biggest fan of WWE to begin with and its a crime that he's been held back and never even given a World or WWE title run yet.

The two WCW matches are certainly not cant-miss material, though they are somewhat entertaining. The extras are also fun if you haven't seen them before, or want to revisit those segments and promos.

I am so sick of chasing down the washers & screws on the floor, and tightening and re-tightening the screws. Merely by sitting on the chair, the screws slowly work themselves out and the cushions fall off. Maybe there was some human error on my part, when I assembled it. But it was working well for some time. I feel so ripped off when I recall how much I paid for it. Now it is just cluttering up my apartment. What a drag! Absolutely cannot recommend.

It's much more comfortable than any other chair to sit in for long periods of time. The fabric hasn't worn out at all and the foam barely has any wear. For the negatives, the bolts that hold the seat on needed to be tightened a few times in the first couple months I had it, but it's been a few years since the last time I had to do that. I also had a problem with one wheel falling out and the bolt getting stripped. I put a little gorilla glue on the bolt and that fixed it permanently. The chair costs enough that I would have hoped to not have those problems, but since they were pretty easily fixed and I like the chair enough, they don't count much against it.

I am looking forward on reading her other books.Happy Reading Lisa"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars Aren't Enough","review":"Women's fiction at its best with just enough romance to warm your heart. Barbara Bretton tells a compelling, deeply emotional story about an estranged mother and daughter who finally find the way to heal old wounds and discover that the bonds of family are strong and enduring. This is a novel about family, about secrets, about magic, and about love. And Aidan O'Malley is one of the best heroes I've come across in years -- a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"If you are looking for escapism, this is the book for you!

They can be the heartbreak and the elation. Throw in a Grand-Daughter and a Good Looking Man, with a Daughter, then all the relatives and you've got this book.It has much 'thinking' of characters and drags the book out, which I just 'skipped read' to get back what was going on. This is the only complaint I have though.It's 'G' rated, no sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"I have enjoyed reading Mrs. Bretton in the past. Her work can bring tears and smiles. BUT I have to say that SHORE LIGHTS was not her best work. I was expecting to read a story about Maddy and Aidan learning to find love again. Maddy and Her mother finding each other again (or maybe for the first time). Sadly I found the start of the book to be really slow and full of tons of information that in truth just took up space. Once the story starts to pick up and all the characters are dealing with all these new feels and learning to trust and love again the story takes a really weird twist. Maddy's daughter is some how connected to Aidans 101 yr.old grandmother and the connection is a Samvar.I will read Bretton again, but this one will be on my 'miss' list. If the idea of a 101 yr. old women speaking through a four year old by magic powers of the tea pot then you might want to hold out on this one as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh, Provocative, and Stimulating!","review":"A worthy contribution to a great debate that now runs back at least a century to Walter Bagehot. In Waltz's hands the subject is fresh, provocative, stimulating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most songs are not the original studio recordings","review":"I think this CD collection is a gross misrepresentation of the songs contained within. Nowhere is it made clearly obvious that the majority of the songs are RE-recordings. Only once I began playing the CDs did I realize something wasn't right, and upon looking at the list of tracks on the CD, I noticed a tiny footnote indicating that certain tracks (at least one third) are RE-recordings or LIVE recordings. When one buys a CD of \\"popular music\\", one expects to hear the same songs they were accustomed to hearing over the radio. To me, the few original tracks in this collection don't make it worth purchasing an entire 8-CD collection, so I ended up returning it for a refund. As a footnote, this could explain why the collection is relatively inexpensive, since most of the recordings are not the original versions...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great find, especially for confirmed fans","review":"Before buying this, you first should hear one of the compilations of Jimmie Rodgers' biggest hits. Next check out his skillful renditions of folk songs (his strongest format). Doing so will make you a confirmed fan, if you're not already familiar with his work. #1 BALLADS is a collection of beautiful, but slow-tempo melodies popular during the late 1950s. This selection of cover versions has been out of print since the early '60s. TV FAVORITES place Rodgers in a big band setting, typical of variety show orchestras of that era. Many thanks to Westside label for their commitment to reissue Rodgers' complete catalog of Roulette label recordings.

As the title says, I might be biased. I've seen Danny perform for years and he has broadened my musical interests tremendously. This is one of his earlier albums and focuses entirely on Irish folk songs. 'Star of the County Down' is one of my personal favorites from this collection as well as \`Little Beggarman'. He manages to capture the spirit of every song, yet put his own stamp on it as well.

Chapters are divided by Ornamental Grasses, Annual Vines, Small Shrubs, Small to Medium Shrubs, Medium to Large Shrubs, and Large Shrubs and Small Patio Trees. Each chapter profiles several plants that thrive in the hot and humid regions of the south. The plant profiles are very good and detailed and provide excellent descriptions as well as sound horiticultural advice. Each plant is illustrated with one or more color photos. Also very helpful is a chart covering the various sizes and characteristics of crepe mrytles. The last section of the book lists plants by various characteristics, such as light requirements, soil types, fragrance, color, etc. This is a good book for gardeners looking to experiment with unique and exciting plants and also very good for the transplanted gardener who has just moved to the southeast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok but not that great...","review":"Granted, there are less typos in the book than in the review given by the author himself you read above.

The book itself is a wonderful value, being hardcover, and containing so much of Parker's work. The poems and short stories are cunnignly written, with a sharp sense of humor and reality. A common theme in these stories is the battle of the sexes, where Dorothy Parker's unparalleled sarcasm brings lighthearted humor to the quarrels between men and women. Always she writes with quick wit and stunning realism. The poems are meant to be read again and again, which is why I reccomend buying the book instead of renting from a library.

This album especially is very special to me and I will enjoy having it on CD and adding it my music collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite \\"State Of The Art\\" As I Expected","review":"After sampling their \\"All Creation Sings\\" tune from the Numavox website, I thought that the AD album it came from would have more of the same kind of energetic rocking style that was put into that one song, but unfortunately it doesn't: the other songs sound painfully weak and don't really measure up to that one track which is the opener of this album. That's really sad, considering that in 1999 another former member of Kansas would have a Christian rock album that truly sounds like it belongs in the 1980s in a very good way, alongside acts such as Yes, Asia, Boston, and Pink Floyd to name a few popular rock bands of that era."},{"rating":"1","title":"Art of the State","review":"I bought this CD after reading the many glowing reviews on Amazon.

Boring composition, unimaginative playing, whining amateurish vocals...just stay from this stinker!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"my intro to Kerry...really!","review":"Unlike alot of long time Kansas fans, AD's Art of the State was my first introduction to the music of Kerry Livgren. To this very day it's one of my favorite Christian albums from the 80's. I actually have the LP of this album and I didn't dare part with it! Even after finding the CD, I still probably won't part with it since I'm still a fan of the cover art. I found the music to be a really smart, polished and creative alternative to a lot of 80's Christian rock which IMHO is saying quite a bit, since I feel Christian rock really began to come into it's own at the time. Out of 10 great songs, my favorite would have to be the dark and apocalyptic \\"The Fury\\" which I just learned is one of Kerry's favorites. Another favorite is \\"Up From the Wasteland\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"The second AD album is a classic, just as the first, Time Line, was. I personally put it slightly behind TL as I prefer the former album's harder edge. Still, this is an esential album to have in the collection of any Kery Livgren or Kansas fan, or even anyone in general. Not a bad tune on the disc in my opinion.

Suffice it to say, this person is wrong as wrong can be! This is one of the strongest debuts of the year, either from vocalists or guitarists. I've seen and heard Wamble with Wynton Marsalis, Norah Jones, Cassandra Wilson and Steven Bernstein. Surely this talented group isn't suffering from mass delusion by hiring this guy, Rafael?At any rate, the music on this CD is fresh and original. Doug will only get better as the years go by, but what a way to start! Highly recommended, only next time, he should lose the violin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suhwanging","review":"Hell yes.

Doug is one of those players that it will take a while for it to sink in as to how great a player he is, only because we had so much fun listening to him.I picked up the CD because I heared Doug was a wicked slide guitarist and I found out he is much more. Doug's leadership and songwriting brings together players, Roy Dunlap, Jeff Hanley, and Peter Miles (all players who stand on their own) and exploits his and thier strengths in an Ellinton-esque way.If Doug sticks to the original way he fuses (without being fusion) styles that emerges with a style of his own all good music fans will be blessed forever.Let it be, Doug strong debut is just the surface of a deep journey that jazz, country, gospel, blue and etc fans will have the pleasure to experience. So much invention, soul and passion in an accessible sound. Support great music, and buy his CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much","review":"I would say that if you like this cd, you should check out Leon Redbone.

As a singer, he's a dandy guitar player, and ought to stick to that. His vocal tone is whiny and wavering, and he frequently sings out of his natural range. The album is an odd blend of jazz, blues, and gospel that never quite gels into a solid whole. The sidemen play well, though I'm not enamored of violinist Charles Burnham's scratchy and restricted tone. All in all, this is a disappointment primarily due to the preponderance of sub-par vocals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"Hard to believe that Branford saw something worth sanctioning here. There is no real swing or blues here of any authenticity, and as much as we hear the various Marsalis family members ranting about such things it is a surprise to hear one of them foisting something this dry off on the public. The guitar playing is Berklee level at best, nowhere near professional jazz level harmonically or rhythmically and the singing, as described in other reviews here is the worst kind of white guy trying to sound soulful and failing. The general stiffness of the music here is what makes it so difficult to sit through. It may develop someday but there are so many others who deserve the chance more. One has to ask, Branford, why?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing kitsch about this album","review":"I was lucky to find this cd in Japan. I never knew of this band and probably would have avoided them due to the silly name if it were not for some really good reviews. HMK had the talent to write good catchy rock songs. As one reviewer said, the keyboard work of newcomer John Sinclair is very good. It is not quite Rainbow Rising but it compliments the music well. I don't think there are any duds on this album and I like it more than the previous two albums. Singer Gary Holton went on to TV fame and then died tragically in 1985. For fans of 70s rock, get it if you can find it at Amazon or Ebay. I give it 4 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"When I got this CD, I listened to it over and over. It was that enchanting. First of all, the orchestral playing and sound engineering are absolutely first rate, as they are on every John McLaughlin Williams CD on Naxos I have heard. Secondly, the pieces are vivid and interesting. From a Moonlit Ceremony very effectively weaves Native American themes with a Romantic sensibility. Harbor Narrative is filled with memorable tone painting. The Evocation Symphony is a big, brawny work that gets better each time I hear it. I would love to hear McKay's music in concert. The examples here are imaginatively orchestrated, taking full advantage of the resources of the symphony orchestra. I was reluctant at first to try this CD, perhaps because I thought of McKay as purely a regional composer. I'm happy to find out I was wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life after Quo","review":"I have listened to this album and i have to say that i was quite surprised by this album. The first song \\"Flash in Japan\\" is an excellent song and proberly in my opinion is the best on the album. the rest of the songs are very good although i disagree with Alan putting matchstick men and roadhouse Blues on the album as these songs are Quo songs and although he has now left the band he should of just put his own songs on the album. After all this is Life after Quo? But this album is worth checking out as it is Very Very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool mystery novel for the modern hipster","review":"Utilizing no character setup or internal dialouge whatsoever, Jason Little's book surpasses the mold of most detective stories.

As to everything else despite all the obvious care for inputs, the product misfires. Some odd material of a vanity nature as well as melodic innovations. Too shrill--unlike Blue Kentucky Girl of the same year or so. Accompianying singer on the left side had a broken microphone--or the entire remastering was done from flaky tape--making for annoying high pitched sandpapery grinding ruining duets and intruding throughout.

I was definitely very disappointed in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've loved this novel for years ...","review":"I read it at least once a year. I love the story, the atmosphere, and the characters--including Andrea, the main character. Many reviewers here have found her off-putting, and she certainly is at first. She's selfish, opinionated and abrasive, not to put too fine a point on it. But she evolves. The sharp tongue doesn't completely go away, but she softens--love for Martin softens her, and although she doesn't submit to it willingly, it happens all the same. There's a haunting incident at the end in which she recognizes and repudiates the way she's tried to control Jim (her brother), has tried to clip his wings, metaphorically speaking. It sickens her, and she draws back from it. Her personal growth is one of the reasons I like this book so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...","review":"I read this book a long time ago when I was just a teenager, and now again at age 32. I liked it a lot better when I was young, before age and experience honed my tastes for good novels. My latest read brought forth much that was lacking in this novel. For a woman who is running a haunted Bed & Breakfast, her attitude is horrible. Come to think of it, her attitude is horrible throughout the whole novel. Perpetually feeling sorry for herself, jealous of her brother's friends and against most of his ambitious undertakings, nasty to her most dependable customer (and most likeable character, I might add) who is there throughout the story, and finding most of her customers disagreeable to some extent (even the nice ones!). I agree you have to be tough in business, but I think she takes it to the extreme. I was disappointed in my second read - as I had, until now, fond memories of the book. Hopefully this won't deter me from reading other books from my past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective merchandise and customer service","review":"I purchased this item from Polstein Home and Beyond.

I only finished watching this film out of sheer morbid curiosity and was sorry I did so. This movie did not add to the series in any way, shape, or form. Yeah, I am aware that it is supposed to be funny, but they usually balance comedy with action, but this movie just stunk. Trunks and Goten are ok in small doses, but this was just too much. Fortunately there is a light at the end of the tunnel - Wrath of the Dragon is awsome (I have seen the Japanese version) and I look forward to them ending the US release of the series on a good note."},{"rating":"1","title":"Android 18 vs. Bio-Blob. Sorry I mean Bio-Broly.","review":"Broly is back again...sort of. He has been brought back to life through advanced technology. This time he's more like a big blob monster or something. If you've seen the Blob or Godzilla versus the Smog Monster you can pretty much get an idea what Broly is like this time around. Trunks, Goten and Android 18 team up to fight the resurrected Broly. He's finally defeated. That's about it. This movie is honestly a waste. The Broly movies got progressively worse and finally ended here. I can't in good conscious recommend this film to anyone. It's a waste of money and space on your shelf. There's nothing redeeming about it. You may as well keep on shopping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the trouble.","review":"I bought this hearing it was bad. Being a DBZ fan and having seen all the movies up to this one I thought hey how bad could it be. Well it made me regret the money I spent on it. If you must see it rent it or borrow it from someone they might just give it to you. Anyway the only reason I think someone should buy this is if they want to own all the DBZ movies or if you bought Triple Threat with all 3. The first 2 are a Godsend compared to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"DragonballZ:Bio Broly","review":"Thi is the worst DBZ movie I ever saw. I thought this might have been a good movie because I have seen Broly:The Legendery Super sayain. This movie has a very weak plot.One of the only reasons I bought this movie was because android 18 was in it.This movie also contains the origional japenese mono.I ckecked out the japenese version and it was even worse because it had horrible music,the characters voices were terrible etc. Stay away from this movie it is the worst DBZ movie EVER."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like Boring-Broly","review":"I am a fan of DBZ, I am a fan of Goten, I think Hercule is funny and I think #18 is hot. Yet this movie sucked! It was missing what makes DBZ so great: lots of action and a great plot. Broly is overused and this completely ruins him. Like most DBZ movies, it doesn't fit into the timeline. If we worked it in, then Goten and Trunks would only be a matter of hours away from using the Fusion technique. Had this movie taken place after then, the fight would be a lot more interesting.In short, if you want to see every DBZ movie, then rent it. If you insist on collecting the whole series, wait until Movie Collection #4 comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"well it was short","review":"okay umm what the hell broly movie part1 was the best i got this when it first came out i have all the dbz movies but this one was too short just like the second part. But why could'nt they put more action in it and the ending in this one sucked when i saw it i was like what thats it evan if the dbz movie is uncut its still a little to short like bio broly broly second coming lord slug and coolers revenge i have them uncut and they were great but a little to short but otherwise this was not really great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bio awful","review":"I found this movie rather weak. I was expecting alot more action from this movie especially with the Dragon Ball Z series. I strongly recommend to everyone and anyone interested in buying this DVD title to save their money and purchase something worth the cash. I honestly can't describe the depth of dissapointment with this movie. You'd think with the legendary super sayian there would be more intensity to the fight."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have seen better","review":"I got the dub version 2 weeks before amazon got it and was disapointed. I love the fact that someone other then Goku saves the day but it was not even Broly, just a rich man's clone. I did not even see the trademark Broly clothesline(lol).

I had a previous martingale from a pet store that my lab pup grew out of, so I replaced it with this one.

IS COOKIN'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting book - Mankind's is a little better","review":"I've just recently become a wrestling fan so I couldn't wait to read both Mick Foley and The Rock's book. I just finished \\"The Rock Says\\" and thought it was really good. If you are a fan of The Rock, then this is definitely a good read, you will learn a lot about Dwayne Johnson, the person and just how The Rock came to be. It's very interesting but I thought the book was a bit premature in being written. After all, he hasn't been in the business all that long. I found Mick Foley's book much more humorous and fun to read but The Rock Says was a quicker read."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG DISSAPPOINTMENT","review":"EVEN though I am a one of the millions and millions of the Rock's fanz, i truly did not like this book. It clearly shows that this book is not Rock's own words nor was it interesting. Unlike this book, Mankind's was a classic. I think that the Rock should have waited at least till he became a legend to \\"write\\" this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great One's Tome","review":"This is the most electrifying book that I have ever read, except for Mankind's book.

This book, despite being done by a ghostwriter, is truly entertaining. Very few people have the charisma that Duane Johnson does and it shows. The book is very well written and digs deep into his childhood and backstage happenings in the pro wrestling world. This is a must read for all Rock fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoever gave this book 5 stars, Is a Rocky Mark!","review":"No way is this book deserving of 5 stars. I am too a rocky fan. This book was ok at best. I felt it was way to short. He is writing his life's story and how old is he? 27. He just started life. He should have waited alittle longer. I gave foley's book 5 stars. I don't see how some of you people can give the rock's book 5 stars. It can't compared to foley's book at all. Buy the book if you are a Rocky mark, like some of you who gave it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone think's he's Mick Foley!","review":"I think that the Rock needs to stick to wrestling, because his book is boring. Just because it worked for Mick Foley, who is a good author, doesn't necessarily mean that Dwayne Johnson is a good writer--he didn't even write this book. Anyway, half the people from DELAWARE and CANADA who reviewed this book haven't even read it-- and admit it! The Rock is a hollow, friendless character whose only schtick is to talk in 3rd person and repeat the same catch-phrases incessantly. Rocky \\"Gimmick\\" Maivia. What a joke!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A realistic reveiw and the harsh truth about this book","review":"Let's compare this book to Foley's.Foley wrote his (which was about 1/3rd longer than the Rock's, all by himself. Rock used a ghostwriter.Foley's words were all his own, with nothing changed and very minimal editing. Rock had a writer from sports magazines practically writing his book for him, and it shows as every page is filled with hokey text that sounds like something from a Disney movie.Everything Foley said in his book was the truth, and most of it can be proven to BE the truth with just a bit of research. Whereas it has been publicaly documented that Rock lied about quite a few things in his book. Not surprising because the whole thing comes off as dishonest and fake.Horrid, horrible book."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad","review":"im a big fan of the great one but after reading the rock says it turns out to be not the great but the bad one . i'd hope that the rock says would be some what like mankinds have a nice day but it wasn't i think the rock should stick with wrestling and leave the books to people who could write"},{"rating":"1","title":"Know your role and shut this book","review":"Good god, where do I begin? This book is awful. Between reading about his boring college days, his being handed a wrestling contract because of his family, and his attempts at being funny I actually feel stupid for hanging with this travesty until the end. To make matters worse, he starts writing in character and to call it annoying would be like calling world war II a minor scuffle. If you value your time, money, and sanity, just move along."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"The Rock's book rocks! It is very amazing on how he uses those very kind words about Mick Foley . I am a big fan of the Rock and Sock Connection! I loved the book and the millions of fans proved their point about their reviews . But I am proving mine now , The Rock's book 'The Rock Says ',as I thought , was just fantastic ! Every Rock fan should read it !"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Rock Didn't Say...","review":"Unfortunately, the biggest problem with this book is that for some reason, the ghostwriter of this book decided to write this as The Rock, with his referring to himself in the third person. It makes the book incredibly difficult to read, and quite annoying, especially when it switches from third to first person references.The history portion of the book is great, with talk about what it was like growing up with Rocky Johnson and Peter Maivia as father and grandfather and having to defend pro wrestling growing up.Unfortunately, this book suffers from over-editing and political correctness, where he is very pro-WWF in every situation, which makes this book seem very contrived, with the WWF hype machine and PR machine guiding his opinions, and making it appear as if The Rock has no opinions of his own.Get it for historical purposes, but for entertainment, stick to Foley."},{"rating":"2","title":"He sayz it like a true WWF Champion.","review":"I loved IT!!!!!!! It was the greatest book in the world. I ead though 100's of times. It was much better than Have A Nice Day by Mankind.

I recomend EVERYBODY to get this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Great stuff, some so-so stuff","review":"Well..I took Foley's advice and went and read the Rock's damn book. The first part of The Rock Says, ghost written by Joe Layden, is extremely interesting, giving the reader a lot of information about the Rock's youth, his family, his start in wrestling and how he became the star he is today. This was all very well written and extremely interesting, and I really enjoyed it. Towards the end, however, in more or less the second half of the book, The Rock does the in-character rants that are both un-necessary and could of been more well-written Joe Layden stuff on the rock's career. I found myself skipping through the in character stuff, but the actual stories and information I couldent get enough of. It was extremely well written and interesting. It's a worthwhile read, especially if you're a rock fan, I just think the book could of done without the stuff in the second half."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I ever read!","review":"This book has got to be the greatest book I ever read. before reading this book I was stuck like a rock in a hard place in deciding what I want to do for a living. I've always kept wresling in the back of my mind because I always wanted it to be a possibility, but now my mind has decided. I want to be a wrestler like the Rock. I know it's a hard road to travel but I will have the dedication to make it. And it's all because I read this book. Vince Mcmahon, I hope you read this because your gonna have to get the WWF ready for me.

This book was written well, because it was not written by the rock. I was surprised when I started reading it that it had more than just the 5 or 6 catch phrases that the rock uses day in and day out....If you want to waste your money and some brain cells, be my guest and go get it, but otherwize, spend your money in a better way....This book deserves to be burned"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"This book was a huge letdown. My advice is to read something else instead of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This book was nothing compared to Mick Foley's. Johnson plays himself out to be Saint Rocky. I like the Rock alot as a wrestler, but he's only been in the business for 3 years. THREE! The purpose of these books is to tell about their wrestling career. Mick was in for 15 years; compare that to the Rock's 3.

Since reading it, I have found it hard to come to terms with the glaring differences between his character and his life. If you have a genuine interest in finding out all about your favorite wrestling superstar, great. Buy it. But if you want to keep looking at the Rock reverantly, clueless to what he is actually like, please don't read the book. I wish I hadn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Rock should have broke out of characther","review":"The Book was excellent but the most electrify man in sports entertainment didn't write it, unlike Mankind who wrote his every page, but like I said if the Rock would have broke out of characther like Mankind did it would have added a different perpestive of the book to give you a feel of what the Rock is really like.

The Rock goes on to explain how the business of wrestling really works, how is life had changed dramatically to face a new, demanding career and the fine line of traditional wrestling and sports entertainment.

An easy read, this book has three writers, Dwane Johnson, a ghostwriter, and The Rock. Most of the book is in Dwane's eyes, but a few chapters are write in the Rock's character. This book is very informative and actually fun to read. You can see how much he loved playing football, and also see his love for his wife and for wrestling.

I say, don't be a jumbroni, just buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"D.J. should stick to wrestling","review":"Sorry, this is a full-length magazine that's been expanded to a book with excessive photos. Can be read in about one day, unlike Foley's book, which takes a week to read. The sections written in the Rock's character are of no value. IMHO the author took advantage of his popularity. Wait for the paperback. I thought Foley's book, although hardly a contender for a Pulitzer Prize, gave more inside information about the wrestling business and more \\"scoops\\" about the people in it. Foley has also been in the business a lot longer and has a better story to tell - in substance and presentation. Foley's tribute to Owen Hart is more convincing too.

Seems he is walking that proverbial fence between what is the politically correct thing to say and what he really wants to say. Is he afraid he might anger the management and tarnish his image? The book is not as \\"hardcore\\" as Foley's. He does present the reader with some interesting behind the scenes look at pro-wrestling and I did enjoy the sections about his family, upbringing, and his meteoric rise to the top of his profession.I am however left with a void or empty spot.

Most of the book is the rock saying, Survivor Serries, I beat that rudy poo and won the belt. Who cares? The only reason The Rock is in wwf is because of his father.

I even missed most of the playoff games this passed Sunday to fully comprehend the Rock's personal struggle, starting from the absolute rock bottom to becoming the greatest name in sports entertainment. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for more self-motivation and insight into how to become more like the great one. This book has inspired me to take my workouts in the gym to the next level. I have also realized the importance of self-confidence. I feel that because The Rock had such great confidence at a young age, it gave him the fortitude he needed to become the phenom he is today. I would like to emulate these qualities!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rock says..whatever he feels","review":"This book was awesome. I haven't laughed so hard in a long time.

It was a great balance between Dwayne adn The Great One himself.

It is the best book I have ever read in my whole life. It is really funny and straight to the point. How the character jumps from Dwayne Johnson to The Rock is very interesting and gives his veiw of life on both of the people he is. If you are looking for a new book to read, read The Rock Says. This book won't dissapoint you at all. The Rock is the greatest man who ever lived.

Maybe if Mr. Johnson had written it himself, instead of letting someone else write his memoirs, it would have been better. In Mick's book, he talks about what it's like to fall off a cage, to wrestle for 200 dollars a week. In Duane's book, after the first couple chapters, he turns into The Rock, and wont break character.

The WWF prides itself on dishing the dirt, but the Rock had few revelations. The guy's not old enough to be very interesting, but I was hoping for some behind the scenes happenings. Some of the chapters ramble instead of rumble, and the writing style is more like a stream of consciousness. The sad thing is, I watch wrestling and the Rock's Dad was one of my favorites. Maybe if the Rock would have written more of his father and the olden days,there would have been something to read about. I prefer Hulk Hogan vs. Roddy Piper, but then, I am just a rambling accountant....."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love what The Rock says!","review":"This was one of the best reads of the year.

It's a good thing, too, as if it had been written at any greater length I may well have not bothered to finish it.Let me just explain: I'm not intending to put down Rocky, but this book is the most awfully written of the WWEs 'series'. It feels horribly superficial, and at the end of it I was left with the very unpleasant realisation that it had actually made me dislike him.It has the feel of a school essay that he was forced to write; there is no humor, no real insight, just a run down account of his life. The language is unemotive and bland. You don't much feel like you get to know him, or gain a greater understanding of him. You do, however, get confused and annoyed when he starts writing in character.I only recommend this book to die-hard Rock fans but I warn them that, if they're expecting a book on par with those by Mick Foley, they will be sorely dissappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"The Rock Says... is a terrific, humorous autobiography of the most electrifying man in sports entertainment.

WWF,and does not really goes deep as everybody thinks it does.I do not care about The Rock's wedding and I certainly do not care for the politically sinister Nation Of Domination storyline back in 1997.

He takes you on his own personal journey, and he really lets down his guard for all of his fans to see and experience the real person behind all the glitz & glamour that surrounds him. He talks about his father's struggle with alcohol,his own tragedy of surviving on basically pennies a day, and living without his tag team partner(his wife), all sacrifices he made to succeed in life, and to be the person he is today. He takes you into the life of a professional wrestler and shows you the sacrifices me makes daily. He also shows you that he is very sweet, sensitive, caring, and most of all very dedicated to his family.

All the rock talked about was beating up older kids, sleeping with older women, and how great he thinks he is. Then he goes on about collage football and again how great he thinks he is. And when he finaly started talking about wrestling he did it in charachter...how many times have we heard all those catch phrases. The thing I dont get is how anyone can give this book a good review its horrable. I think they just wanna swing on dwane's johnson. Just because the rock HELPED write this book does not mak it good.

I have read Mankind's book and I would give that a 6 STAR rating, but the Rock's book -well- really isn't THE ROCK'S BOOK! This book might be written well, but you can tell by the words, the phrases, and just in the writing that it's not the true Rocky words.

Don't really see any difference in it and most of the other ghostwritten sports autobiographies I've read--really, Johnson's too young and his experiences are too limited for him (or his ghostwriter) to be writing his memoirs. Also, the switch in character from Dwayne Johnson to The Rock makes things quite difficult for the reader. I wish I'd kept my $!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So the rock says","review":"Very Disappointing. Especially for those that have read Mr. Foley's fine tome. It is not that Dwayne Johnson doesn't have an interesting story to tell it is that he does not tell it well. Consider the great life he had growing up among all the wrestling legends, as evident with a picture with Andre The Giant, yet he rarely writes of those moments. His book is merely a good start at a rough draft up until his The Rock phase. Then the book is lost. Over a hundred pages ghostwritten in his brash, arrogant, vocal personna. Oh the humanity. Actually his story due to his youth would better fit a Rolling Stone type in depth interview. Don't buy another wrestler's (auto)biography unless they have been in the business for 15plus years or is written by Vince McMahon"},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"WHAT I THAUGHT OF THE BOOK WAS THAT I SAW THE BOOK TO BE A 5 STAR MATERIAL.I AM A BIG ROCK FAN AND THIS BOOK WOULD BE GREAT FOR MY COLLECTION ND ALSO I THAUGHT THAT OTHERS THAUGHT THAT THE BOOK WAS AWESOME TOO.I HOPE I CAN GET MYSELF A COPPIE OF IT TO ENJOY.THANKS"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"Excellent quality product and very durable.

Learning about Mobutu and his circumstances fills a gap in our understanding of contemporary Africa. In the Footsteps of Mr. Kurtz did leave me a little bit unsatisfied. I was looking for either a more dramatic narrative to keep me engaged or else a more broad and structured presentation of facts.

However, her editor must have been asleep when reviewing this book; there can't be any other explanation for publishing a work loaded with irritating typos and lacking flow . The book starts off with her arrival in Zaire, and suddenly it fast-forwards to the end of Mobutu's reign, then her looting of Mobutu's home with her colleagues. It then backtracks to his childhood, and so on. It is easily one of the most frustrating books I have ever read, and aside from the wealth of research Ms. Wrong undertook for this book, I found no cause to recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disorienting","review":"I am only half way through this book so I can't be sure it won't pick up some momentum, but I have to say that so far it has been disappointing. The author glosses over such vital information so casually that the reader not only misses her point but later on in the book when she refers back previously mentioned events and people, you're left entirely disoriented.

In any case, he had the backing of the powers that be.At the end of the day, Mobutu is a poster boy for bad leadership in that he failed to harness the immense resources of a vibrant country and succeded in depleting the country and sending her to the brink of collape."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for understanding modern African politics","review":"Michela Wrong gives a detailed account of Mobutu's kleptocracy, with vivid examples of life in the Belgian Congo/Zaire.The book is highly informative, easy to read and entertaining.Go for it, you won't regret it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Painful read","review":"Whew.

It does add a very slight bit of background noise to the output, but for my use (live performance), it isn't a factor at all. My only gripe on this box is the power cable input into the box. It's one of those hokey 4-pin things like an S-video cable. Lame! But that ain't enough to make me dog the rating on this thing.

This game board is a little too thick (or the cylinder too thin), making it impossible to put the bead bags back into the cylinder once the board is in. The only way to put the game away is to tightly wrap the game board around the 4 bead bags first, then you can slip the whole thing into the cylinder.

Let's not forget the excellent vocal interplay between Lesley and Paul, and great lyrics to boot. No slouchy band were The Au Pairs. I still remember seeing them at the Pep in NYC, it remains one of the best gigs from my youth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing..","review":"I wholly agree w/Deadhead's assessment. I've been a fan of LOS since I first saw them play the cramped Ballard Firehouse in Seattle in 94. I've gone to see them whenever they've come to Seattle since 94, and my enthusiasm for this uniquely talented band has slowly waned as they've continued to move away from the high-energy wholly unique jam music which had made them a must see. Each successive album is more bluegrass than the one before - no doubt the influence of Drew E. who is an obvious a fan of the pickin' and grinnin'. It is severely disappointing to see they've abandoned their roots as a jam band in favor of bluegrass obscurity.Nothing against bluegrass, but this is like having to listen to Jimmy Hendrix play country-western.I too believe it is time to wave bye-bye to the glorious LOS jam band of the past..Bluegrass'ers enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Careful!","review":"There is no music on my CD.

Beautifully written, but weird, with a screechingly abrupt ending","review":"I really enjoyed the writing in this book, and the characters. However, the story got strange halfway through, and ended abruptly, leaving nothing resolved at all, to my mind. I was left scratching my head.Maybe the book is just too \\"smart\\" for me, and I didn't \\"get it\\".Were it not for the fine writing and characterization, I'd have considered my time wasted.This was sort of like a David Lynch film, the way I see it, except the characters were more likable. It had the same bizarre, disconnected quality to it. (I hate David Lynch films, in case you didn't guess that already.)Finely honed characters and prose that are sadly wasted on a stunted, bizarre, truncated storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"What am I missing?","review":"This book wasn't very good. Based on the other comments, my guess is that it's a chick book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too, too . . .","review":"It's much too \\"post-metafictional\\" for me, this Elizabeth Costello character who knows everything about our main character. I waited for her appearance with bated breath, having read other reviewers here and hoping her arrival would give the narrative a much needed jolt of electricity. But no.I miss the South African nuances of the old Coetzee.The new Coetzee writes about -- a man who is losing his physical and emotional capacities and imagines he is in love with his caregiver? Hello? Have we not heard this plot 10 million times before? Or did it just start with Anna Nicole Smith? Endlessly ruminating about one's sad fate is also not a new thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"an unusual story that eventually hits the mark","review":"'Slow Man' is a decided unusual story about a lonely middle-aged man who loses a leg in a bicycling mishap and subsequently reflects deeply on his life as he interacts with his Croatian caregiver, her family, and a strange character (Elizabeth Costello) who shows up out of nowhere. The story is decidedly morose and slow moving. And why the author brings in this Elizabeth Costello character, who seems to have surreal knowledge of our main characters before actually meeting them. Clearly the author has special place in his heart for Elizabeth Costello since he had previously written a book all about her, which I found to be horribly dull. Thankfully the strength of the characterizations and the satisfying conclusion saves 'Slow Man' from a similar fate. But note to author: please dump this Elizabeth Costello fetish, okay?Bottom line: certainly not for everyone but it works overall. Mild recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Man - Annoying Novel","review":"I tend to agree with many of the individuals who rated this book with two stars. Like most, I found the first 20-30 pages of this book enthralling. However, as the Elizabeth Costello character was introduced, I lost interest and just wanted to finish the novel so I could move on to something else. Had this book been longer than 262 pages, I would have given up 1/2 way and moved on. I think what I found most irritating was when the Elizabeth Costello character would go off on these rants that would last for pages, which were generally covering the same topics as previous rants. I haven't read any other works by Coetzee and even though this book was painful I could definitely recognize the talent of the author. I trust the author, but this particular story just wasn't a win for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coetzee and the annoying Elizabeth Costello","review":"Coetzee is a really wonderful writer and every line reveals as much. He puts his protagonist in a situation that is bound to bring him trouble. Unfortunately, he does meet trouble as does the novel when Elizabeth Costello arrives. What was a bit depressing and contemplative turns at first intriguing then annoying. Costello has the ability to know things that she shouldn't, but very little is given to examining the cause of this, let alone the necessity. She fiddles around, pushing a course of action that neither the protagonist nor I want the whole thing to go. Again, it seems that a novelist has run into trouble and has thrown in some other complication to hopefully enliven the book. I'd have been happier if Coatzee had confined her to her own novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Man, Slow Read","review":"I think Coetzee has gone down hill since he migrated to Australia. I loved \\"Waiting for the Barbarians\\" and \\"Disgrace\\". But this, and the one before that introduced the character Elizabeth Costello were disappointing to say the least.Who IS this Costello woman. She is neither likeable or unlikeable. She is a bore.Don't get me wrong, I am an Australian and there are some wonderful Australian writers, but JMC will never be one.The storyline is simple. Sixty year old migrant loses leg in bicycle accident and gets depressed. Falls for his Croatian nurse. Is rejected.Into this scenario comes Elizabeth C who is supposedly a writer who has 'imagined' the hero (the amputee) and wants him to change in order to make her new novel interesting.She fails. He doesn't become interesting. Neither does the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful reading!","review":"I continued to read this book because I read good reviews about it. But once I finished reading the book, I was upset that I wasted my TIME on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad that it's over with","review":"I am a fan of Coetzee and have read many of his previous works and loved them. Disgrace is one of my all-time favourites but this one left me feeling cheated. The book began with promise and I loved his characterizations of Paul and Marijana but with the introduction of the mysteriour Elizabeth, the book began to spiral downward and didn't bounce back. I had to struggle to finish it and felt let down. I wouldn't recommend this for my book group, which is why I wanted to read it. We loved discussing his other works.Maybe I wasn't in the mood to delve into the inner psyches of the characters but this one left me cold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Close to the Truth for Comfort","review":"I am 65 years old. I find that Coetzee, like W.G. Sebald, always trespasses too closely to the truth for my comfort. He makes me even more uneasy than I already am. Yet knowing this is of no help. I know I'll die with the same unavoidable regrets and misconceptions that Coetzee has. The fact is that our existence is painful from almost every angle that you peer at it from. It is painful up close and from a distance. It is lonely. It is all about missed opportunities and loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"its not what i wanted","review":"this is not what i wanted. the pot is not nonstick so my rice stuck to the pot and was hard to clean. the thermostat doesnt work well so the rice didnt cook well. it is absolutely not good."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT non-stick","review":"I love the Panasonic rice cooker but this model is not non-stick and very hard to clean!

Zindel was extremely gorey when this fish attacked people and many things happended in this book that never would happen in real life ( coming back to life by being shocked by in electric eel? ) Some parts of this book just went on and on about nothing in particular, and I would say only the very beginning of this book gets the one star that I rate this book.

An example of horror is when the sea creature has killed Arnhen and is now ripping him to shreds. \\"It snapped at them as the girl saw Arnhem's torso float up to the surface, saw the white flash of spine and the circle of shredded, raw flesh.\\" An example of action would be when Dr.Ecenbarger put a guard in the torture chair.

I plan to buy extra copies to give as gifts and to donate to the school library. I see Ms. Knoll writes gothic romances (just like Marcy).

Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Help is on the Way!","review":"Once again, Fiona Whitney's book comes to the rescue. I am currently involved in a school search for my son, and her book is so helpful in helping me sort through the mountains of information about private schools in LA. It allows someone to zero in on a few schools and also helped me realize a few new possibilities of which I had been previously unaware. The book feels very much like a insider's view-- which I really appreciate right now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"LA Parents, Save Your Money!","review":"I found Whitney's coverage of LA private schools to be incomplete and biased. She left out Windward School in West LA, which has been around for over thirty years! Her preferences for certain schools (Marlborough, Archer, Harvard-Westlake, Center for Early Education, etc.) were clear in her gushing comments about those schools along with the cursory treatment of other schools lower on her favored list. Instead of relying on this expensive, inconsistent notebook of comments to whittle down their list, parents should talk with like-minded parents of older children who have gone through the process, check out websites, and visit open houses to get a truer sense of which school would be appropriate for their children. I returned this book immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"this does not cover the LA South Bay area","review":"I thought this would be a comprehensive overview of LA area private schools.

Not sure what expertise this author brings other than having a lot of time on her hands, clear bias about the types of schools she values, and a word processor. Of the schools we elected to visit, we found that some schools had actually moved years before, and yet she did not include this information. In addition, she would make foolish comments, such as noting the number of Range Rovers in the parking lot of one school and then lamenting that she herself cannot afford one - we don't care. This is a glorified, and out of date phonebook that leaves out some wonderful schools (e.g. Westchester Neighborhood School) and unfairly chastens those that don't ascribe to her preferences. Skip this - save the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I thought this book would save me some research by giving accurate, detailed and evenhanded descriptions of Los Angeles private schools. It doesn't come close. You can tell she didn't think certain schools were worth the effort to get more information by their omission or brief, superficial reviews. I also found the format and print job to be amateurish. Don't rely on this to guide such an important decision."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Los Angeles Private School Guide","review":"I am a single father looking to find the right school for my daughter.

If you are of Mexican decent or just love Mexican music I think you will love this but it just wasnt for me. The only song i liked is el burrito sabanero.

Still, 2 hours of entertainment was worth the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"Whether a fan of the series or open-minded enough to consider Christmas with SCTV, it would be a waste of your holiday to watch these episodes through.

According to the directions on the box you turn it on and it prompts the child to check the oil etc. The on on/off switch is a piece of moving plastic that does not activate anything. There are a few buttons on the top that make stupid noises for a whole 5 seconds then stops. Even the mowing noise last only about 10 seconds. I don't get it. Would not even consider this toy.

The women's lives are heartbreakingly intertwined. It's hard to think of anything that hasn't already been said, so I'll just contribute that you shouldn't be turned off by the prison setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Women in Prison Novel Ever!","review":"This novel is that notable exception--a literary nail-biter with a heart as big as the barren plains of Texas in which it is set. Ward's story of three women connected only by a murder is smart, ambitious, and just plain riveting. In Gatestown, Texas, twenty-nine year old Karen passes time on Death Row, counting the days til her execution. In New York, a young doctor named Franny receives an unexpected phone call while she tries to figure out how to escape the tragic loss of a patient and the clutching arms of the man soon to be her husband. In Austin, Texas, another young woman named Celia attempts to recover from her husband's untimely death.

Ward answers all these questions, and addresses all your curiosities about life on death row.

This novel is a gripping ride of laughter and tears and I can't wait for the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating!","review":"I fully agree with the reviewers who gave this wonderful book 5 stars. I began reading this book in the afternoon, read off and on the rest of the day, and couldn't go to sleep until I finished it. The way the author weaves together the three women and their places in the story is engrossing. If this is Ms. Ward's first novel, I can't wait for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Read One First Novel This Summer","review":"If you read one first novel this year, choose this one. Set aside a few hours to sit with Sleep Toward Heaven, because you won't want to put it down once you are drawn into the first page. Beautifully written, it resonates with me on several levels. I love the way the story integrates a lot of information obviously based in fact, as well as tying itself up at the end and leaving the reader utterly satisfied. You know it is meant to be. Just so.This one is better than The Lovely Bones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I read this as a selection by our book club. Having glanced at the reviews for this book already on Amazon I had high hopes and still think it's interesting subject matter and should elicit good discussion. However the book itself was far too shallow - you didn't get to know or care about any of the characters. All of them were glossed over in far too little detail. Karen read like the Charlise Theron character in 'Monster' and Franny came across as just weak. How did she ever leave Texas at 16 and get all the way through med. school? It just didn't mesh and gee, was anyone surprised that she and Rick end up looking like a couple? I'm sorry, good subject, serious issues but just not dealt with in any depth at all which is too bad. And what's with the type face? How much white space do you want on a page???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Compelling...","review":"I read this book in 2 days. If I didn't have to work in the middle of that (darn it!) would've been a few hours! What an amazing first novel. Ward brings 3 women together in a very believable set of circumstances. You feel each woman's pain so clearly you feel you know them. I actually teared up at the end! It leaves you wanting more: what happened next with Franny and Celia? Questions on the death penalty, forgiveness and life itself will haunt you. If you like books like Memory Keeper's Daughter and Time Traveler's Wife, you will become as totally engrossed in this book as I did. I'll definitely seek out Ms. Ward's next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stellar debut","review":"Sleep Toward Heaven gripped me from the first page and did not let go after I finished the book. Three women--a doctor struggling with the direction her life is taking, a convicted murderer on death row, and the widow of one of her victims--leave indelible impacts on eachother's lives one summer in Texas. Poignant and beautifully written, this haunting story will leave you with much to think about. A stellar debut, I look forward to more from this talented new author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Provocative and brilliant","review":"Three very different women --one who is on death row, one who is the wife of one of the victim's, and one who is coming to work at the prison--come to terms with each other--and themselves--during one long, hot, steamy summer in Ward's haunting novel. How do you forgive another? How do you forgive yourself for the choices you made? Beautifully written and just a spell-binding read."},{"rating":"2","title":"you won't sleep while reading this","review":"A long time ago, I promised myself that I would not read any more novels or see any more movies that touched on the subject of capital punishment; the topic was simply too important to me to see it as \\"entertainment.\\" But the reviews of Amanda Eyre Ward's book were so strong that I couldn't help myself and oh am I glad I read this book. It is an even-handed, thought-provoking look at an incredibly difficult subject. Her characters, coming at the issue from all different angles, pop off the page in stark relief. It is that most rare of books: not just a well-told story, but an important book as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"tales of loneliness and death","review":"I loved it! This story is heartbreaking and beautiful. Ward's excellent at capturing the voices of the three distinct woman. i ate up every word."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and Touching!","review":"Throw away your preconceptions about reading about death row inmates and pick up this book! Sleep Toward heaven is a funny and touching novel in which inmates with nicknames like \\"Satan Killer\\" and \\"The Hairdresser of Death\\" become real women with real names: Sharleen, Veronica, Samantha, Karen. The intersection of the lives and sorrows of the three main characters-- inmate Karen; Celia, the widowed wife of one of Karen's victims; and Dr. Franny, the prison doctor--will make you laugh and will make you cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU CAN'T PUT DOWN","review":"This book is so well written. It captivated me from the first few pages and just wouldn't let me stop. An easy read and a great one for a book club."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth your time","review":"Lost City Radio tells the story of a country, not unlike Peru, recovering from a long and divisive civil war between the government and a grass roots terrorist organization. Alarcon uses the structure of a family to narrate his story, not that the family is vaguely regular, consisting of lovers and children, unknowing wives and husbands leading more than one life. It is, in many ways, as much of a parable as anything, but Alarcon is a sharp, intelligent writer. You may well guess the secrets of the plot, but Alarcon isn't concerned as much with the secrets, but the banality behind them and the anguish that they cause. The novel is highly fragmented, jumping in location, time, narrator, but it's to Alarcon's credit that it's easy to follow, fluid. All in all, it's an impressive piece of work, welded together by a melancholy mixture of silence and memory. Definitely, worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertising! Not the same \\"Prince\\"","review":"This cd came up when I did a routine search for new music from \\"Prince\\". Amazon.com did not show a picture of the album but did show one of the other recommended albums being \\"Rainbow Children\\".When I got the order I was shocked to find a completely different artist on the cover! A big disapointment when you are expecting new music from the one true Prince."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't know what to expect; pleasantly surprised","review":"After reading some of The Brethren by Bob Woodword, I was interested in reading the actual legal opinions of the Supreme Court in 1973 RE Roe v Wade and Doe v Bolton. I these on the Internet and read the majority and dissenting opinions. I wanted to understand their reasoning a little better. I don't have a legal background but have studied some philosophy and psychology.As I recall, this book was more about what was happening in society that the author thought or discovered as contributing to Roe v. Wade. Although I have not finished it, I am pleasantly surprised. She is a good writer, doesn't get too technical in legal language, her research and conclusions really do help make sense of how things - and help me understand what was going on in society, in certain professions, etc. She does not seem to favor one side or the other but has written a book to help people understand either side, as far as I can tell. That's why I like it so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"still the best","review":"Luker understands the sub-texts underlying this debate they remain he sane as when the book was written--no possibility of conversation is offered because I suspect there is none but one thing is for sure the question if not a eight question it is a class (and race question)"},{"rating":"2","title":"cant stop listening","review":"Never listened to this type of music before and never even heard of Ry Cooder until I heard.

ITS AWESOME A TOTAL EARGASM! !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh so good...","review":"How did Ry Cooder escape my notice for so long? My wife noticed a song off this album playing on a jukebox and immediately took notice. When we arrived at home we ordered the cd hoping the album reflected the song we heard on the jukebox... and it did. That sexy, surf guitar sound blended with the latin rhythm made for a wonderful album. It reminds me of some the music in David Lynch's Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me movie. The kind of music you might hear at One Eyed Jacks. Well worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just pure enjoyment","review":"I don't know much about Cuban music. Like most others I know I got turned on to the Buena Vista Social Club by a friend - in my case someone that knew how much I love \\"Talking Timbuktu\\" which is Ry Cooder and Ali Farka Toure playing together. This disc was mentioned on National Public Radio recently and although none of it was played I bought it as a birthday present for someone I thought would enjoy it. He asked to play it immediately after opening it and everyone at the party fell in love with it. The music is so soothing and lively at the same time, so sultry but playful. Technical details..? Who cares? This is music that's just to be enjoyed, not analyzed."},{"rating":"1","title":"good i guess...","review":"ry cooder could have had a much more grandiose farewell from his investigations of afro cban music. this soundslike a forced goodbye...he tried too hard. the previous records were delightful. this is not quite up there"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly a diappointment, but ONE GIANT surprise","review":"I too am a fan of the Buena Vista Social Club phenomenon, and I too looked forward to hearing what Ry Cooder had found, again. Like a few other reviewers, I found the playing somewhat uninspired. For those familiar with the classic \\"Patricia\\", was this version anything but ordinary? Did you not anticipate one new riff, one new angle to this tune? Track 7, \\"Bodas de oro\\" is the best of the cuts. Now for the surprise: At the beginning of track 11, \\"Boleros sonambulo\\", I hear this incredible piano, so I go to the liner notes, and there is NO piano listed! Ry Cooder is given credit for electric piano on 2 tracks, but NO piano for Track 11. Listen carefully, it is, undoubtedly, yes, it is REUBEN GONZALEZ! Yes, it's him, and unmistakeable! What a find! Please, give us more before he's gone..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loungy Muzak","review":"Bummer! I was really looking forward to this CD, based on reviews & interviews with Ry Cooder, but it's really a letdown. Maybe the mambo has just been ruined for me by all of the imitators out there, but I didn't see much spark from this. The day I got it I threw it on during a dinner party thinking it would be really cool & after a while we all just looked at each other and said \\"what is this?\\"... in a bad way. Save your dollars... don't say you weren't warned!Enough with the embargo already!!!

Fans of indie surf and TV background music will worship the guitar sound here. Vaguely reminiscent of stuff like The Munsters, The Beverly Hillbillies, and Twin Peaks. Overall, this CD has a feel-good quotient that is off the charts. Me likey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Cooder experimenation...","review":"...in other words, like nothing you've heard before. Comparable to his previous collaborations with Ali Farka Toure, Gabby Pahinui and VM Bhatt -- but only in the sense that it crosses national boundaries to synthesize a unique new sound. A pure moood piece, more like \\"Paris, Texas\\" than \\"Bop Till You Drop,\\" but absolutely divine in its own way. (Also reminiscent of classic trans-national rhythmic-instrumental explorations by Mickey Hart, especially \\"Diga\\" and \\"D?fos\\".)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hawaiian slide guitar ???","review":"As a lover of Cuban music I find this CD difficult to listen to. Hawaiian slide guitars have no place in Latin or Cuban music and I fail to see why Cooder injects his own into an otherwise good CD. These renditions would be far better without the annoying slide sounds. The Buena Vista Social Club was a great CD marred only by the slide guitar. I give Mr. Cooder a tremendous amount of credit for \\"discovering\\" the Buena Vista but please leave the slide guitar for other genres."},{"rating":"1","title":"faulty product","review":"quality of cd is very bad, last 2 songs will not even read on cd player or my laptop. not at all happy and probably will no longer order form amazon.com if this is the quality of the product they carry."},{"rating":"1","title":"listen before you buy","review":"If you're a Ry Cooder fan, listen before you purchase this album.There's simply no depth, no emotion, no smiles when listening.

Lounge music of the worst kind. What a pity."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could rank it a 0.","review":"Let me start by saying that I don't get Latin music. So perhaps I am biased. On the other hand, I know Ry Cooder's talent. Where did it go? This is ... what? I want to say boring but it isn't that. It was annoying. It was trivial and trite and the guitar licks were non existent. I am not much of a musician myself but I have created more interesting music while playing with the pre-recorded rhythms on an electronic keyboard at the music store while my daughter was having a lesson. But then I'm also the guy who slept through the B.B. King/Eric Clapton collaborative album. I can't in conscience recommend this CD.

All the people who slaged it off before my review is just idiots!! Wes said from the beginning exactly what he was going for. The death metal mockery and chipmunk vocals are great and the funny ideas behind the lyrics is enough to make you rip your gut!! Wes specifically said that it was going to be a certain way so no one who buys it should be that dissapointed in the end. Rebel is just funny and very creative. If you like Mr. Bugle or Zappa as others have said, have an open mind.

I have my favorites, and yet it is impossible not to like them all. My only reservation from giving this album 5 stars is because the refrain from one of the tracks is used(although fleetingly)several other times in others and that degree of repetition is something I find irritating; other than that minor \\"complaint\\", however, this is a great album and I strongly recommend it.

Badly recorded. Uninspired playing. Generic punkesque songs. Lame, lame drums and Greggy simply can't sing. I was expecting more from the leader of Black Flag and mighty mogul of SST records, more than this boring collection of what sounds like bad demo recordings. Unfortunately Greg's best work seems long behind him. Maybe though he just needs a real band in which to play. In any case Getting Even is not worth the penny especially when you consider shipping is 3 bucks or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT FOR SMALL AMP","review":"I happen to like the sound of my Fender Champ cranked, and this stand does just the job. I attach a gooseneck and an sm-57, put it through the p.a., and I'm in business! Just be careful of the weight of your amp. 30-40 pounds should be max. I cracked one with my Super 112, which was about 60+ pounds. Nice and compact, folds right up into my gig bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Locking Mechanism","review":"This amplifier stand is a great concept and works fairly well, but the plastic locking mechanism (or bottom nut) that holds the three legs open and locked into position eventually wears out rendering the stand useless and unusable. It says it can hold up to 75 pounds, and it likely can, but my 45 pound amp eventually rendered the back leg useless (would no longer lock into position) and I had to trash the stand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks, Difficult to Fix, Weak Company Support","review":"This stand broke after a year. I used it for 40-50 gigs with smaller amps (18 w Fenders and a Victoria Regal II). But then it stopped working -- the back leg would no longer lock, so the stand couldn't support an amp. I emailed the company for help and someone called. She sounded familiar with the problem, and said that they could mail me the needed part, if I could drill-out a rivet, replace the part, and then use a rivet gun to put it together again. I don't have a rivet gun. The only alternative was to return the stand to the company on my dime -- about $13 -- so they could decide whether it was a \\"manufacturing error\\" such that it was \\"within warranty.\\" Even if it was, she said, they would not reimburse me the $13 shipping. The uncertainty, delay and cost is too much. I'm throwing the stand away and buying one from another company. This is not the \\"ultimate\\" amp stand. It's not even a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible sound.... avoid this one!","review":"I was very disappointed with the inferior quality of the recorded sound in this set. I was looking forward to hearing Gobbi's Don Giovanni, especially with Elisabeth Schwarzkopf as Donna Elvira and Ljuba Welitsch as Donna Anna. This recording was made from a live performance at Salzburg in 1950, with Furtwangler conducting. The overture begins with distortion that's impossible to eliminate, even by adjusting the treble, and things don't get much better as the opera continues. EMI has issued this same performance in the past, and perhaps their source material was better than whatever was used for this remastering, but unless you don't mind substandard sound, steer clear of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Curt Raffi","review":"John Stilgoe once again captures the imagination of the reader and encourages us to truly \\"see\\", not just \\"inhabit\\" the world that lies all around us.As in his other works, he teaches us that history and archaeology are not just a part of musty museums, but of the every day built environment. There is a history behind everything that we come across in our daily lives and he wants us to take a second as a child might and think about the environment in which we live.Having had the opportunity to take classes he taught at Harvard, this book enabled me to reenter his world of delicate insight and deep knowledge about what many in our society simply overlook or have forgotten.If you like pop culture, history, walking down forgotten railroad beds or simply enjoy driving down unknown roads, Stilgoe will capture you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a Start...","review":"Good introduction book on observing the world around us. It seems like there should be so much more written on this topic.I recommend this book although I admit also that the writer's style can get to you sometimes (however, I wouldn't go so far as to say the author is overly pretentious).Anyway, I also recommend \\"The Meadowlands\\" if you are interested in this type of book."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Age History","review":"I had heard Stilgoe on a recent NPR show, and was looking forward to reading his observations about our changing built environment. While there is a smattering of interesting information (i.e., the fact that AC and DC currents once vied with each other in homes), the majority of it is so much fluffy, new agey, and poorly written observations. For the same price, I recommend a much more complete and fascinating book about observing change, \\"How Buildings Learn\\" by Stewart Brand. It's spectacular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and Enervating","review":"Possibly the most fascinating book I have read since Carl Sagan's \\"The Dragons of Eden\\". How often do you read a book that makes you want to get up off your chair (perhaps taking the book with you if you haven't finished yet) and wander off for outside adventures with its tantalizing accounts of what you will find in your neighborhood and town, and their outlying areas?!Stilgoe draws us out into the \\"real world\\" page by page in this exploration of the modern world around us, its intriguing history of urban and rural constructions, and what it all means. A great book especially in that once you have read it, it continues giving to you as you take what you have learned from it and go further into the everyday world with it.Talking about this book practically makes me jump up and down with excitement over the possibilities. No, wait -- it's LITERAL! I am, in fact, jumping up and down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick, interesting read","review":"Got this book based on a friend's recommendation. Read it this morning.

It shows us that connection is still possible in this disconnected age. It shows us that America's history is not captive in printed pages and tv documentaries, but lives all around in the building and in the pulling down, in the shiny new and in the rusted.Stilgoe does not illuminate the unremarkable, instead he reflects the light that he sees emanating from it. A remarkable achievement. A remarkable book. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"pulling edges to the center","review":"Stilgoe makes us consider the ordinary in extraordinary ways.

I'm glad I read the librarycopyof this book instead of buying it as I had intended to do, based on a review in the New Yorker magazine."},{"rating":"1","title":"187 pages of romantic drudgery","review":"This book just seems to go on and on about all the little things we seem to miss in this electronic era that we live in, at face value this does have some truth to it, I myself was intrigued by the concept. But right from the very beginning you realize that these are things that are worth forgetting about. The book seems as if it was written for the specific interests of an autistic child.I don't care about the why the grass grows the way it does on the interstate freeway and fail to see why anyone else would either."},{"rating":"1","title":"In Love and War","review":"The first part of this film was simply an episode of the original TV series, but it is quite funny. The scene wherein Indy and a young Ernest Hemingway duel for the affections of a lovely Italian maid by simultaneously playing musical instruments with great gusto is hillarious. I agree with another reviewer that Jay Underwood is a pleasing Hemingway, but maybe less realistic than O'Donnell's haughty and more cynical Ernest. As for \\"the best swordfight ever\\", the viewer from USA should check out such dueling classics as Scaramouche (with Stewart Granger and Mel Ferrar) and the more recent Rob Roy (with Liam Neeson and Tim Roth) for truly first-class swordplay. If you like the Young Indy series, though, see Attack of the Hawkmen, the best of the bunch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paved The Way","review":"Big Drill Car is one of the most overlooked bands that i have ever come across. I purchased this album when it first came out in the early 90's and its easy to say that this band was way ahead of there time seeing that most of today's catchy punk bands have built themselves off the foundation of Big Drill Car weather they know it or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating blend of hemispheres","review":"I recently purchased this album over Christmas break and was not quite prepared for what I heared. The first song,Soar/Free/News From Nowhere, slowely builds up with haunting Celtic sounds, the tone of the CD, after a several minutes, the drums come in and you begin to hear what makes this group so impressive. Not only is this fusion of Africa and Ireland/Scotland fluidly executed but it is also varied, there are strands of techno at points and then it will sink back into the ancient Gaelic/African sounds. This Album is an excellent and innovative piece of art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like bad Deep Forest","review":"Major disappointment compared to Volume 2 - which is outstanding. Basically sounds like any old \\"World Music\\" without the enveloping overlayed drums, rhythms and sounds of Vol 2. This album is minimally \\"techno\\" for those who like a more organic sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Home","review":"I saw an ad for Vol. 1 Sound Magic in the magazine published by Tower Records. The name of the group looked interesting, so I bought the CD. After the first blast from the Uillean Pipes followed by the drums I realized that I had finally come home. Not to get too esoteric or philosophical, but for years something in me had been longing for just that sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, solid CD, 2nd album is great","review":"I purchased both Vol 1 and Vol 2. I like Vol 1 quite a bit, but it is more of a \\"background\\" album, it doesn't draw my attention like Vol 2. I recommend this CD if you like mystical mood music."},{"rating":"2","title":"good celtic rythyms","review":"i needed this for background music for my art room at school.. good sound, well recorded and though it says african and celtic rythyms it seems more like basic celtic variations"},{"rating":"2","title":"layered, exotic, sensual","review":"This beautifully crafted CD is a layered and sensual delight. The sound is an energetic hybrid of two seemingly disparate musical traditions. It has the muscle and bone of African rhythmns and the ethereal voice of Celtic pipes and strings. It succeeds beyond the sum of its parts. Images of the Mideast and India surface, reminiscent of the recent works of Loreena McKennitt. If you're an artist, listen to it while you create and see what happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shows well some commonalities of Celtic and African musics","review":"I only recently heard this CD; a couple of weeks before this Xmas ('98) I was at Johnny Foley's Irish House here in San Francisco to see a friend of mine play with her Celtic-folk-pop band (Robin Mackey - she's a multi-ethnic beauty herself - various Euro, Amerindian and African, and she sings some songs in Gaelic), and the guy running sound played this CD between sets. When I heard the uillean (sp.?) pipes and pennywhistles over the talking drum, I asked him what it was, commenting that it seemed an appropriate mix, since bagpipes were originally an African instrument.The only reason I don't give it 5 stars instead of 4 is that in a few places the musicians seem to still be finding their way to the commonality. If there's a Volume Two (haven't found it yet if there is) perhaps that'll display an even smoother meshing.All in all, a warm, compelling collaboration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD","review":"CD was very good.It is amazing that group came up with superb idea of mixing african and celtic music and it worked well.Amazon.com editorial is misleading as it refers to some sounds coming from Armenia??? Eastern sounds in some songs have Turk origins, not Armenian.Despite the poor editorial, buying this CD will be worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Album!","review":"I disagree with the comments about the average quality of this album. It is highly innovative and has many features that cause me to listen to it again and again. I think that it is much better than Volume 2,Release. Their use of dance rythyms coupled with traditional Irish instruments and the use of vocals sparingly makes this a highly likable album. I think that is as good as anything Deep Forest has released, probably better. If anybody is looking for an album that can make you move and chill out at different listens, this is it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Same old songs","review":"Sure, I love all of these songs. I love the Osmond family but what is here that hasn't been available before? I want the original albums or at least a compilation of songs from 1976-1979. This is great for newcomer fans but what about the people who really are interested in Osmond music! It's amazing that you can purchase original albums from one or two hit wonders but when it comes to a family who have an all-around entertainment background can't get the proper respect and recognition they deserve!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Short version of the boxed set","review":"This is the same old thing that has already been released on CD from the Osmond Family(they already have a boxed set!). I wish they would release the original albums(especially the Donny & Marie albums). Nothing from 1976 on is represented here. Every pop music fan needs an Osmond compilation CD and this may as well be it for now. They are extremely talented singers and entertainers and deserve more respect than they have been given by critics and so called music know-it-alls through the years. There is a variety of music styles represented here but Jimmy fans are out of luck because they didn't include anything from him. Alan Osmond has comments in the liner notes. Good price for all the top 40 songs that they included!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Osmonds of the '70's","review":"This CD contains almost all the Osmonds' big hits from the 1970's. It includes the group songs (which I like best,) teenage Donny's solo hits, a few solos by Marie, and some Donny&Marie; duets. Although youngest brother Jimmy is pictured on the CD cover, there is nothing by him on this collection. Too bad they left out \\"Long Haired Lover from Liverpool.\\" If you are looking for Osmond music from AFTER the '70's, it is not on this CD. The liner notes are interesting to read; they contain facts that I never knew before.If you are looking for some Osmond nostalgia, you'll enjoy this collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!!!","review":"If you love The Osmonds like I do and if you no longer have your old vinyls, this CD is perfect for you!!!!

It was a great gift for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new. An \\"F\\" for Originality.","review":"Being an Osmond fan can be very frustrating at times... This CD has nothing new to offer. There have been several Osmond compilation CDs in the past 10 years. What's so different about this one besides the photograph on the cover? Nothing. I agree with the reviewer who wishes the Osmonds would put some of their old albums on CD instead of putting out hit compilation CDs all the time. Been there. Done that.

Only few others have mentioned about the bad recording quality. Well ... I must have the bad one. This set is of the absolute worst quality in my whole collection. It replaces the Bach Cello suites by Casals from 1930's recording.The sound is muted. The sound stage is clumped in the middle. The strings are barely audible. I have a decent sound system and am very particular about the recording. I couldn't get through the 'Classical' sym, let alone the others.Gergiev, LSO, Barbican Center, Philips: in case anyone wonders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"This CD is not as advertised on the Internet. It is not a Lucky Strike Hit Parade CD. The picture on the CD is very much misleading and a lie. The actual CD that was sent to me is part of a decade of pop songs from 1954 put out by Time-Life. It has nothing to do with the radio or TV show of Lucky Strike presents your Hit Parade. Where in the world did they get that phony picture of a \\"Lucky Strike\\" wrap around to put on the cover of the CD? Bob"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Kinks histories I've read","review":"This must be the most complete history of the Kinks I've read. It looks to such sources as the autobiographies of Ray and Dave Davies and attempts to give a full picture of the group and its trials and travails and idiosyncrasies. (For instance, Ray and Dave do not discuss in their books how annoyingly cheap they are, but this book does.) The one irritating element of this book for a Kinks fan like myself is how critical it is of the post-1960s Kinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Read!","review":"The book is complete and if you aren't a die hard Kink fan you probably will become one. While I was reading the book, I had to buy a couple of CD's that had songs I hadn't heard. Boy was I pleased I did. The book hints at alot of errors made by them and their management. If you give their music a good hard listen you can see something was wrong with their machine. What a catalog of great music. Good book, great story, a historic and ground breaking band."},{"rating":"2","title":"A WELL RESPECTED READ. DETAILED KINKS IN DEPTH.","review":"This is a fantastic read and wonderful information on one of the greatest bands to emerge from the 60's. The book goes into depth on topics such as all the many groups projects and Ray's many video and film efforts. The band should be ranked as one of the best of all time. This book includes all the many members to including John Gosling, John Dalton, Bob Henrit and the whole cast. Ray should be regarded as the Bob Dylan of England and this book solidifies that as a fact. It also shows how little brother Dave comes into his own also as a fine composer in the later years. If you are a Kinks fan buy this book. You won't regreat it. It is a superb read full of amazing detailed information. Long live the Kinks. I am anxious to see their second edition that comes out in September."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Young Wan","review":"Brendan O'Carroll's The Young Wan shows the beginnings of the matricarch of the Browne Family.

If you have a home wireless network or newer cordless phones (which usually run on 2.4ghz) the 900 mhz monitors are really good and don't have much interference. However, the 900 mhz monitors don't have as much distance so these are good for going between 1 floor or a small to medium sized house. This also has a built in rechargeable battery which is handy for people who take their monitors around the house.However, I bought this for my newborn and it lasted about a year. First the volume dial caused a very static noise when you moved it, and then out of nowhere the battery completely died. It only works plugged in now. I think if you're the type to plug it in and never touch it again, this would work very well for you. ...we moved it around daily.

It worked great for our first; however, after about 16-18 months use, it started crackling horribly. We constantly have to play with the volume to avoid static. Now it's to the point where we have to have it on full volume to eliminate static. I'm sure that the rechargable battery simply needs replacing; however, I can't find a replacement anywhere. It's an odd battery.The range is awesome, but if I switch channels, then I pick up my neighbor's nursery across the street.

Sure, when my son starts to make noise it transmits but when he is sleeping quietly all we get is LOUD static!

Loud enough to wake the baby! Fisher Price has been accommodating - we've had to send them the defective one twice and each time they return us a $40 Fisher Price voucher.

BUZZZZZZZ!!!!!!!!","review":"We received this as a gift because we registered for it and cannot get the static and buzzing to stop! There is no where in our house that the static and buzzing to stop - no matter what channel or the volume level. I'm so hesitant to buy another one in case we have the same problem! But alas - I will return it to the store and try again! :-( Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much static and interference","review":"I selected this monitor BASED ON THE REVIEWS HERE and I was disappointed because obviously Fisher-Price has their employees come here and say good things about this product, when in fact it has considerable flaws.THe only thing I could say about this is that it still works after a year, but there is too much static and interference and that loud 'hum' when the the monitor and receiver get too close to each other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended at all","review":"I registered for this baby monitor and received it as a shower gift. I had another monitor given to me (Fisher Price) which has recently quit working (that one wasn't much to speak of either). I tried to use this monitor last night and all I got was this HORRIBLE feedback and the static is awful too. I am returning it to the store and hopefully finding one that I can turn the volume up and actually hear my daughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS MONITOR","review":"I registered for this monitor due the favorable reviews on it and it was given to me off of my registry in Feb 2003 for the birth of our 1st child. We initloved this monitor; HOWEVER, within the past month (just over a year after receiving the monitor), we couldn't use the monitor remotely as the batteries no longer held a charge. You can't buy batteries for this model at any store and Fisher Price has discontinued it. So, although I was very happy with this model for the past year, I wouldn't recommend it because down the road, you will probably have to buy a different one anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much static and poor battery quality","review":"This monitor started out fine, but after about 3 months we started getting a ton of static over the monitor making it sometimes difficult to sleep with it on. It also makes a horrible, loud static noise when we turn the volume up and down. The battery is fully charged as it is usually plugged in at all times...plugged in at all times as it usually only lasts for about 20 minutes if unplugged (I followed initial charging instructions to the 'T'). I am expecting another baby and will probably throw this monitor out and buy a new one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well for about a year and then dies...","review":"I had this monitor for about a year, and at that point it started to die out; I have read other reviews where this monitor died out for them at about the 10 month mark. I thought when I bought this monitor that it would last longer. I ended up purchasing the Sony monitor as a replacement, I have not had it for as long as I had the Fisher Price, so I can not accurately say how long that one will last, but so far it has been holding up very well, and has been well worth the money. If you want a monitor that will last you longer than a year DO NOT buy this Fisher Price monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk. Don't waste your money","review":"I bought this monitor because of the claims of no static, the range, and the rechargeable battery. What a bunch of hooey. It has put out static since day one. It acted weird right after we got it, but then started working again. We've had it for six months and now it is garbage. How disconcerting is it to find out that your child has been screaming for God knows how long, but the monitor didn't relay the sound? Terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love this monitor","review":"I am thinking maybe the monitor has been improved over the ones that are just a year or 2 old. We love that we can hear the baby breathe with out the volume on max. The vibrate works great when the dishwasher is running or I am doing another chore that is noisy. We live in a close neighborhood with apartments very close by and nothing has interfered with the monitor. This unit does not have the recharable batteries but the hearing portion does come with an adapter that could be plugged in. Really being able to plug the unit in, I have only changed the batteries once in 6 months. I like this unit and would purchase it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great at first but dies out with use!","review":"We have had this monitor for almost three years now. We used it for about 1 1/2 years and then put it away until our third child came along. The monitor doesn't hold its charge, and we cannot hear anything unless the volume dial is turned up high. It also emits crackling and static when the dial is touched. We probably will have to buy another monitor because it drives me crazy every time I try to adjust it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Clarity","review":"I am one of those people that will test every product until I am blue in the face, and the name brand doesn't matter. I have tried several monitors costing me from $9.99 - $160. This one being a promo at the time ($9.99), but still not expensive at normal cost by far has been my favorite. It was suppose to be my back up for traveling or for any other odd reason. It has become the one I favor and depend on. The sound is very clear, there isn't any second guessing if she is awake, fussing or sleeping, including the neighbors kids playing outside if you have the window open! I have the unit that requires (3) AA batteries, and it does have an attachment to plug in if you need to. I have returned my other monitors and would like to either purchase a second 900 Mhz Monitor or see what else Fisher has to offer. I was really surprised by how great this monitor turned out to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crackling after 10-12 months of use","review":"We used this monitor until our child turned 12 months but it suddenly produced a loud crackling noise at certain sound levels. Still, we liked it so much those first 12 months that we replaced it with an identical set. 10 months later and the crackling is back and I'm in search of a new monitor that will last more than 2 years without becoming a dud. I would not recommend this product if you expect to last longer than 10 months. I my mind a baby monitor is like any small appliance. I've had my can opener for 10 years and it still works great. My baby monitor is much more important and I expect to last for several kids, several naps and several years of sweet dreams. For us, this model does not measure up."},{"rating":"2","title":"No rechargeable batteries","review":"This monitor does not have rechargeable batteries as some of the other reviews suggest. I owned a previous version of this monitor which did come with rechargeable batteries. I liked it very much except that the batteries eventually lost the ability to hold a charge as other reviewers indicate. I ordered this monitor to replace it not realizing that this one does not have rechargeable batteries. I was going to return it, but after researching, realized that the rechargeable version is no longer available. (I found this out by looking at the website with updates for \\"Baby Bargains\\" by Denise and Alan Fields - great book by the way.) I decided to keep the monitor anyway because I have not been able to find another monitor that meets my needs with rechargeable batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"t he best one out there","review":"this monitor is the best one! i love the vibrate mode it helps out so much and it picks up the slightest noise, i love how it doesnt have a stupid atena on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returning item","review":"My husband and I purchased this monitor and tried it out last weekend and could get nothing but static. No matter what we did it would not work. I can't wait to return it tomorrow and get something different. I would not recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Devours Batteries","review":"I would not recommend this monitor because the batteries have to be changed every other day. Also, the battery compartment is very difficult to open and close."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this monitor","review":"I brought this monitor and i love it. we have a 4 bedroom house and have had no problems hearing the baby very clearly at all times with this monitor. It picks up every little sound she makes and is adjustable. And easy to move from room to room. We even take it into the yard. We also have no interference with any of our other household appliances (cordless phones, computers, tvs etc). I also have a television monitor which we use if we are downstairs and the baby is in bed, so we can actually see her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only static","review":"I recently moved my daughter to her own room and needed a monitor. I purchased this one because it was the only one at the store with a vibrate feature. When I tried to use it, I got nothing but static, even with the volume turned down, the static was so bad it made the monitor light up and vibrate. I could not sleep with all the noise and could not hear my daughter crying through the monitor over all that white noise. It's going back today in exchange for a video monitor or the Sony monitor. Maybe I got a defective one, but based on my experience I would not reccomend this model to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beaner","review":"Like another reviewer, I thought this was a great product for the first year or so. After that, we started getting incredible static & crackling on the receiver - to the point that we need to fidget with the unit for 5-10 minutes before we can actually hear our son. We also get a huge amount of feedback if the receiver gets anywhere near the base (i.e. walking past the nursery room or even directly beneath the nursery on the 1st floor). Other than that, it's really been a great product. Just beware that after a year, you may need to replace it to keep your sanity!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Static alert","review":"I really loved this monitor since I am hard of hearing. It vibrates when my baby makes any noise and I can hear really well with it. However, after about 6 months, it started to static whenever I touch the volume control/dial. Static was so loud. I called Fisher Price and I had to fight to get new one. They agreed to give me a new one but I got a used one in the mail! It was all stratched up. I called them and they immediately send me a check to get a new one. Now I had my 2nd monitor for 6 months and I am having the exact same problem again. I am disappointed about that. In addition, I don't like the fact I have to keep replacing the batteries every 3 days. So the only thing I like about this product that it vibrates and Fisher Price are the only company that makes this."},{"rating":"1","title":"good at first...then broken irrepairable","review":"We got this as a gift and used for about one year. It was very clear with no static...then the monitor just kept on dying for no reason. When it was plugged in, when it was using the rechargable batteries---fisher price did nothing to help stating that the monitor was out of warranty. One would think one could get more than a year's worth of use from a monitor. Don't buy it or one like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Junk!","review":"After reading several positive reviews of this monitor I registered for it as a shower gift. I was quite disappointed in the sound quality. There is a constant static in the back ground and depending on where you stand in my sons room, the receiver will send an ear piercing squelch through out the house. I would not reccommend this product to anyone. DON'T WASTE YOUR $$."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD MONITOR!","review":"I received this monitor as a gift with my second son & we love it. It does give a high pitched noise when the two units are on & you get them too close together. But, I can hear my baby's every move in his crib and the vibration feature is a plus. I'm currently pregnant with my third child and will put this monitor to good use again."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as I thought","review":"after reading some reviews I thought this would be a good monitor. but the problem is the static. the only way not to hear the static is if you lower the volume to the lowest. I'll be returning it and might try a cheaper model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good at first, disappointing later","review":"We have had this receiver for almost 10 months, and at about 9 months every time you tried to adjust the volume a loud fuzz noise was produced on BOTH ends of the unit. So, while your little one is sleeping it might wake them up! I just went out a bought a new one today, because I can't take it anymore. Also, the problem with the volume control also made it where it only worked at the higher volume levels. The static sound would not allow you to listen to at the lower volume. And we do not live in a cramped area, we are in a normal family suburban home. Hope this helps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last long","review":"This monitor worked really well for about six months. I could hear my daughter breathing, I could hear traffic go by outside her window, and I could hear the echo of my husband and I laughing from our living room! It was great because it made me feel really safe - but after about siz months, I was unable to unplug it. If I wanted to take it to another room with me, as soon as I would unplug it, it would stop working. if you slammed it with the palm of your hand, the sound would come in and out... Now it doesn't even do that. If I dont' have this thing plugged it, it does not work. So, I am not able to leave the room that I am plugged into. Which pretty much defeats the whole purpose of having a baby monitor with such a wide range and rechargeable batteries. This thing is pretty much worthless to me now. I'm shopping around for a new one that will allow me to actually walk around my house. I'm very disappointed because I can't get my money back on this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted 6 months","review":"I used this monitor for 6 months, liked the reception when far away from the nursery (but not when too close!), and then it stopped recharging. Thinking it was the battery, I searched 4 stores and finally had a battery store MAKE me a replacement battery.... Only to find out that it still would not keep its charge. Fisher Price no longer makes this unit, and will send me $40 in coupons for me to buy another one... in 6 weeks!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same problems as other posters","review":"We have had this monotor for 2 years. It worked great at first. After about a year, the battery degraded. It now will last for about 10 seconds on a charge unless it is plugged in.We also have the crackling issue. If you try to adjust the volume, you have to play with it so that it gets the right volume without the white noise. The only way to turn the unit off is with the volume control, so you will eventually wear this part out.I have read others purchasing a replacement battery for $11 to $15. That is nuts. You can buy a new monitor system for $35. Why put 50% of the cost into maintenance of the battery. You will probably havef to buy another one in a year anyway.Bottom line, this unit will not last much more than a year, so be prepared to spend more money later, or ween yourself off the monitor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Minimal static and no interference","review":"I've been impressed with this monitor so far. We've only had it a couple weeks, but we get minimal static and no interference from other 900 Mhz cordless phones etc that we have. The range really is great. I can go several hundred feet away in my backyard and still hear relatively soft sounds in the baby's room. This is the only monitor I've tried, but it seems well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only lasted a few days","review":"I received this item as a gift. It only worked when I left it plugged in. If I unplugged it it only worked about 10 minuets and then it went dead or buzzed alot. I called company and they had me send it back for a refund check. I would not recommed this monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think twice before buying/registering for this monitor!","review":"This monitor is terrible. All you hear is static! If you have a fan running in the baby room that is all you will hear and can barely hear the baby unless he or she is screaming. It will keep you up all night. To make matters worse, the battery does not hold a charge so you have to leave it plugged in all the time. So much for convenience. Please do not waste your money on this product! We just purchased an Evenflo monitor and love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a short while","review":"This monitor performed great the only problem was that it performed great for ~1 year.

Now every time we turn it on or turn the volume up or down it crackles really loudly, which is awful when my husband is sleeping and I have to turn it on and off to go to my baby. I expected it to last a lot longer, but now we have to buy another one. We tried cleaning the inside and nothing helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked great, then died","review":"I loved this monitor at first. I could even hear my baby breath at night (which helps any new mother sleep better) After about four months the lights quit working, then within a week it stopped working all together.

Good monitor if you plan on using it only a short time."},{"rating":"1","title":"No doubt about it...it had to be returned!","review":"We picked this monitor because we had heard several good things about it. However, after trying it, our minds changed. The static just wouldn't go away no matter what we tried to do. As a matter of fact, the monitor picked up several phone conversations from the area. We returned it and got the Sounds and Lights monitor instead, which we are much happier with!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't even bother with the others.","review":"I have had absolutely no problem with this monitor.

This model is small enough to clip on your shirt and vacuum (the vibrate feature works very well). The noise level adjusts for the noise in the room, so it won't vibrate if your ceiling fan is on...only when the baby stirs. The model I have has a rechargeable battery, there are some that do not have this feature...if you have the choice get the rechargeable one, it will save you money in the long run and time as well. Only flaw, don't put your cordless phone right next to it, they tend to interfere with each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"must must read","review":"This is an amazing read.

While this may not make immediate sense to a non-lawyer (and may turn you non-lawyers off about the book), the different methodologies, lenses, sensibilities and sometimes inflexible dogmas through which the art historians view this iconic and enigmatic painting find amazing parallels in the wildly divergent theories and perspectives in which legal philosophers, professors and judges view and interpret the complex combination of factors (cultural, societal, class-based, psychological, political, authoritarian, libertarian, scientific, agrarian, industrial, religious, racial, tribal, etc.) through which what we call \\"the law\\" develops."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flee this Book","review":"This is the sort of book that gives art history--especially the \\"new\\" art history--a black name.

Euan Lowson is an interesting singer to say the least. Crown of Thorns is a nice song but it rips off Genesis too blatantly. Pizza Pebozo often puts this band down- but these guys are really a good band and damn if they didn't capture the spirit of the 70s prog by revitalizing the prog scene in the 80s.

He starts from the most basic level of knowledge such as CMYK versus RGB, but does not avoid such complex issues as colour profiles. He speaks to the most recent developments in document formats including InDesign and PDFs for print.

Will Cley finally find the forgiveness he has so ardently sought through these books? Will he find his purpose and solve the mysteries of the Beyond? Will he survive?There aren't any easy answers for him or the readers. I find it impossible to reduce this book to a few paragraphs, but I will say that it needs to be read as the final chapter of the other two books.

The cable these guys sell is a REGULAR USB cable, not one for the phone.Obviously if it costs $3 and $3 for shipping most people (myself included) will not bother sending it back once they realize they bought an ordinary USB cable, and I'm assuming that's what these guys are banking on."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO HTC TD2 USB data cable!","review":"this is a USB to mini USB cable NOT equivalent to an original HTC TD2 USB data cable!HTC TD2 has a special plug - a mini USB does not really fit and is not recommended to use!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This worked for my Sprint HTC phone","review":"This USB cable worked for my Sprint HTC phone.

So, I opened my desk drawer, pulled out a regular USB cable, plugged it into my phone, and it synced! To think I was looking to buy something when I already had on right there in my drawer. Now the real question is why in the world would HTC make the connector different? Perhaps in other countries they use the special notch-on-one-side-only cable, so now it will work with both cables?

At the time I read all of McDonald's books, thoroughly enjoying them (I then moved on to John D. MacDonald, whose Travis McGee books are in a similar vein). I recommend the movie to friends as an adaptation of a book where they've captured the spirit of the story and updated it to modern times. Yes, it's lighter, the gritty reality of the plot surfaces only occasionally, but it translated to screenplay much better than I expected it to.For readers who enjoy mysteries or detective stories or just well-written novels, Gregory McDonald should be on your list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tons of foul language","review":"I bought this book because I love the Fletch movies, and I had heard that the book was much better than the movie.

He won top honors for mystery writers with the Edgar award twice. This book was the start of the Fletch series and by all means don't think the movie, with Chevy Chase, captured the spirit of the book. Chase is a great comic, but he is all wrong for the main character. All of the Fletch series has two plots going on at the same time and are resolved/solved within the last few pages of the book.Irwin Maurice Fletcher -- I.M. Fletcher - \\"Fletch\\" is an investigating reporter that is trying to solve how drugs are being brought into the beach community and has a wealthy man asks Fletch to murder him. Sound complicated and how do the two get solved? You got to read. A very fun and quick read. The entire series is a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing version of a great book","review":"I was disappointed in this purchase, because the of the frequent scanning/transcription errors that could have been easily caught and corrected. e.g. AUTOBIOCrLXPHY instead of AUTOBIOGRAPHY, as well as many that are indecipherable. A simple look through the text to correct the more obvious errors should have been done. A table of contents that is linked to the chapters would have been very helpful, as well.The content is great. I just wish I had known it had no linked index, and so many textual errors. I would have shopped around for a better version."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"This one is full of personal things that the others copy from. Here are Mr. Spurgeon's own accounts of the many trials and blessings that God gave this precious pastor. The access to his diary that Mrs. Spurgeon had and her own warm and loving memories of this greatly loved man, add a depth that the Biographies cannot match. For those of us who gain so much from the writings of C.H. Spurgeon, this is a treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what was presented","review":"while the history of Roger Bacon was interesting and the other historic figures(Aristotle, Soccrates, etal) I was expecting more about the actual manuscript and how it was deciphered and those around that quest. Instead the book spends over 2/3s relating stories of how various famous figures interacted, political climates and philosophies. This is nice background but it could have been shortened, in this reader's humble opinion.If you want to know more about the Manuscript, look to another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nicely written but doesn't deliver","review":"There are much better books out there covering these subjects. The biographies of Bacon and John Dee, for instance, are done much better in The First Scientist and The Queen's Conjurer. The authors clearly don't understand Bacon's science (totally misrepresenting his idea of species) and similarly know little about cryptography. Towards the end, in the surprisingly thin section on the Voynich manuscript, they comment that \\"no matter how brilliant the mind that fashioned a code, an equally brilliant mind might break it\\". This just isn't true - a one time pad may be a pain to use, but it is totally impossible to break, period. A real disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Interesting Read","review":"I was digging back into my family tree during the recent months and found that I am a direct descendant of Roger Bacon. This lead me to begin looking for books, articles and other things he wrote. Essentially, for his time he was and is considered on par with Isaac Newton.To find he seems to be intimately associated with the Voynich Manuscript, also known as the book that cannot be read, was fascinating. Even if Bacon is not on your family you will find this book a most interesting read, filled with mind-boggling facts, assumptions and proofs that Bacon may even have been the author of the manuscript. If he was not the owner he most certainly owned it at some point in time.If you like history and its unsolved mysteries you will probably like this well written and researched book. It reads like a good novel and is hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Resourse","review":"A detailed and well written history of the 13th century and its moving figures--Roger Bacon, UrbanIV, Acquinas wrapped around Roger Bacon's life and work. One of his books is described as the most important scientific work in 1000 years.You get a little study material too--Scholasticism and how Aristotle was translated and integrated in to the teaching of the time. If you were taught in a Jesuit College 50 years ago, as I was, it all starts coming back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roger Bacon and the Manuscript","review":"It is possible (and probably even quite likely) that the mysterious manuscript at the heart of the Goldstone's The Friar and the Cipher is not by Roger Bacon, but to fully believe that would be to lose the story of Bacon that fills more than half the book. Bacon is an interesting character and his story is quite fascinating and fairly well told but it is to the reader's benefit that the book is able to include, through its history of the manuscript, a host of other characters ranging from the court of Elizabeth to World War I cryptographers, and beyond. Francis Bacon is even wedged in there a bit. Sometimes the books feels a little padded but this padding, at least, keeps the reader's attention as the centuries are spanned. A pleasant read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I agree - \\"Great recordings, weak packaging\\"","review":"CD's come in a cardboard box - no problem - but all the CD's are encased in cheesey paper sleeves.

I wasn't that impressed by the examples from well known writers with bits added by Ms Whitcomb , then asked to improve, where we then read the piece in the original. What a cop out- can't she write herself? As for Ms Rittenberg, half the time I felt like I was being battered about the head by a disgruntled teacher, all the while hearing a subtext of \\"whatever you do,dont call me as your agent.\\" The book left me feeling depressed and when it passes I hope to be able to continue my writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest","review":"Honestly, I am the co-author's husband.

The introduction by Dennis Lehane was inspiring. I was moved to tears by his generosity, of his exposing his own struggles and dreams of writing. The rest of the book demonstrated what he had written. Laura Whitcomb not only inspires, she provides practical, easy to use methods for contacting and using your \\"muse\\"--creative powers. In the second half of the book, Ann Rittenberg is honest and straight forward in the advice she gives about the business aspect of the writing business. After the first read of the book, I felt more confident and motivated as a writer. The second read of the book was like a workshop for me. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening, encouraging, and practical advice for writers","review":"Reading this book is like having two wise and supportive friends take you aside and really dish about what it takes to successfully write and publish a novel.Laura Whitcomb offers inspiring and practical advice on the writing side: everything from how to prepare your right brain for the creative process, to how to end a chapter.Ann Rittenberg demystifies the entire publishing process and offers a rare look at what happens when (not if) you sell your novel. Her examples of bad query letters are hysterically funny and make you realize you really can do better than THAT.Both authors are generous with their references and honest in their suggestions.

Even when one ignores the fact that no film can ever live up to the book it may be based upon, and that the Prisoner of Azkaban is at least twice the length of the previous two novels; the movie just does not meet the standards set by the previous two movies. To begin, the movie is only about 135mins. in length. This may seem inconsequential at first but please note that each of the other two movies were at least 190mins. in length and ,as I said , the book is twice as long as the other two. This being the case a large amount of the plot was cut as well as crucial information for those in the audience who prefer not to read the books first.My only hope is that somehow they actually filmed many more scenes (or at least a few ) and that these scenes will be available on some sort of Extended Edition DVD a la LOtR because frankly, this movie just does not cut it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimate is edition not extended - avoid!","review":"A shame to see 1300+ reviews with almost all of them glowing when almost none of them reference the Ultimate edition.

I think the author did a great job of giving a true feel for New Orleans from an insider point of view. For me, it was like revisiting the city I love.I appreciated the substories as well. Skip's family and their social standing vs. her non social climbing tendencies and will to make it on her own is very interesting. The relationship between Skip and her new boyfriend only adds to the story rather than detracts.I am looking forward to reading more books by Julie Smith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok","review":"The first couple of chapters were hard to follow. I had to reread the characters a couple of times to figure out who was who. The book was free so it was okay. I wouldn't recommend it, if you have to pay for it.

The New Orleans history was fine but other than that it was a no go for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghastly","review":"Good Gawd, what a boor!

The New Orleans details are authentic. I enjoyed Skip's explanation of the subcultures of the city. My reading group read this and everyone, young and old, loved this Louisiana gal who was not the sterotypical beauty queen or little rich girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most ridiculous crime novel I have ever read!","review":"I read a lot of crime and mystery novels. As I turned page after page, I was sure the story had to get better, but I was wrong!! How in the world did this win the Edgar Allan Poe Award??? The author asks me to believe that, outsider cop or not, Skip would act so irrepsonsibly when investigating a murder -- failure to immediately report crucial evidence, failure to report an assault that could provide leads to the murderer, cleaning up potential evidence, and more -- not to mention wasting valuable time with her personal angst, pettiness, and involvements. Way too many characters and the ending no surprise. I love female protagonists, but she is an embarrassment, primarily the poor choices she makes. In order to make it through the book, I suspended disbelief and skimmed as much as I could to get to the very predictable ending. I'm not sure I'm willing to give the author another chance, award-winning(????) or not!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Convoluted, overhyped mess.","review":"Though Julie Smith does give an invaluable lesson in the minutae of New Orleans social structure, perhaps she should have written a guide book rather than this mess.Skip Langdon, as our intrepid protagonist is almost likable. One is intrigued by her stature, her outsider status both professionally and personally and her personal history. However, Smith's creation seems to make so many mistakes and have such poor judgement that at times her low esteem seems justified. Her constant jealousies are distracting and in the end prove to be extraneous.The multiple points of view add nothing to the plot nor the mood, and when the POV is not Skip's the story's momentum comes to a standstill. The story is full of sidelines and subplots which are then dropped and never brought to conclusion.The final nail in the coffin for me was the two dimensional, not to mention offensively stereotypical depiction of homosexuals.I'm trully surprised this book won any awards let alone the Edgar."},{"rating":"1","title":"New orleans mourning","review":"First book of Julie Smith I have tried to read.

It's breezy, fun, acoustic (!), nostalgic... what more could one want?! If you are not familiar with Paris Combo, they are a jazz quintet from France. Belle du Berry supplies the singing, while the guys back her with an acoustic ensemble that blends American jazz and even a little swing with French chansons and even some Algerian / Moroccan music. To give you a little further idea, some of the guitar playing is in reminiscent of Django Reinhart. The sum total is an energetic, eminently listenable sound that will have you accompanying them, even if you don't know what she is singing because it is in French. This debut release is outstanding; in fact, I liked it so much I bought a copy for my brother, who liked it so much he, in turn, shared it with some co-workers.

With the possible exception of the actress and the orderly, who do develop a relationship and show some concern and tenderness in their encounters, all of the sex in this book is just a roller coaster ride of graphic shocks and erotic-boardering-on-bizarre encounters. If that is what you are looking for, do buy this book, you'll enjoy it immensely. If you are looking for plot, however, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy, boring, ridiculous...","review":"I had neither the desire nor the inclination to finish up this book. The plot is cheesy, the story is boring and the sex scenes are cheap and useless. The story of a young doctor who discovers that the new private hospital she works for is also a place where people go to seek pleasure intrigued me at first. However, this book and its erotic scenes read like a tacky, low-budget porn film. The BDSM scenes are especially ridiculous. I like erotica that awakens my intellect as well as my senses. Deanna Ashford has disappointed me with this book. She did a great job with Wild Kingdom, but this one misses the mark in more ways than one. Black Lace has let me down again. I hope that the next Black Lace book I read will be something like Menage, Wild Kingdom, The Tutor or The Captivation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doctor's Orders","review":"I really enjoyed this novel.

They are as good as this one is hollow. First one must swallow the coincidence that a US pharmaceutical/chemical company hires a former SAS companion and enemy of our hero to do their dirty work. After that, when trouble erupts for Bro. Reeve, our hero, he gets on Interpol's list of wanted folk. But still he is able to fly back and forth from US to Heathrow at will, pass through immigration and customs, without as much trouble as a US tourist heading to Cancun. So much for Interpol. Under all this is the pasty treatment of our hero's wife and son. This novel is something like the computer games Bro. Reeve's son Allan plays continually. So please, don't judge Rankin by this one. He's really a good writer, who must have felt the need for some extra cash by churning out BLOOD HUNT."},{"rating":"1","title":"An early Rankin not worth the time","review":"Former soldier Gordon Reeve flies to California to claim the body of his brother Jim, an apparent suicide. But it soon becomes obvious that the facts aren't fitting together and that Jim's death was murder.In spite of three attempts, I just could not get into this book.

For me, this was a Rankin practice book until he started writing Rebus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slainte, Rankin! But This One Just Didn't Grab Me","review":"My first foray into non-Rebus Rankin (Jack Harvey, whatever) left me with an understanding of why authors might use alternate names for their earlier, less-stimulating projects. \\"Blood Hunt\\" has some elements that kept me entertained, but they seemed to wane as I worked my way through the 500 pages. The bad guy, Jay, seems to hold a kind of silly grudge from his SAS experience in the Falklands War while on an operation with main character Gordon Reeve. There is also the story of a highly provocative cover-up involving BSE (Mad Cow Disease) and a murdered journalist/brother that is never brought to a close. Too much, really. Reeve is definitely cool, but he doesn't come off as a sympathetic or fully drawn character. Note: I absolutely love the Rebus series, but I don't feel inclined to pick up the other remaining Jack Harvey-penned novels. Hope I'm not missing something, but \\"Blood Hunt\\" has done nothing but cool mine a little. Ouch. Sorry, Ian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written, but predictable.","review":"Well written, but not particularly distiguished.

I was interested in seeing how Rankin would approach a standalone novel. I had high hopes for 'Blood Hunt', but it got bogged down by too many 'conspiracy thriller' cliches. Even worse, most of what we're told throughout t he book is almost swept under the rug at the end.This book was a little too 'Andy McNab' for my taste.Presumably, the raction to this book is typical to that for other 'Jack Harvey' titles.

After Stephen Prutsman's fresh and lively performances of these concertos, Tanyel's came as a shock. The timings are about the same, but I see no special insights into these works. I really like her playing of the 2nd modern suite, however. There just needs to be more sparkle, and in the 1st concerto, more verve and forward motion. But even Prutsman and Tanyel cannot beat Van Cliburn in one of his most exciting performances. For a great sample of Tanyel's art, please listen to her Scharwenka concertos 2 and 3 plus his solo piano music.

I was hoping that it might have some useful sections of complex analysis, or Fourier transforms, vector calculus, ordinary and partial differential equations, or any of the other topics we covered. But the information presented here, if any, was hidden completely by Greenberg's random fluff. Even the worst teacher is enough to make this book completely superfluous. There are no insights to any deeper meaning behind the mathematics, and the simple examples are abysmal. I would only recommend this book if you are planning on learning the material completely on your own, and even then, you could probably do better locking yourself in a closet than buying this book.

It is clear, concise, and easy to follow. It flows increadibly well, and in an organized manner. You can tell that this book was planned out, and not just written by some professor in a few weeks just to meet his writting obligations. Also this book covers EVERYTHING, and I do mean everything. It is a pure pleasure to read. If you have trouble understanding math, because your using a (poor) book written by a (...) professor, then BUY this book. Its a little pricey, but trust me it is worth every cent. The price of the book is much less then the price to repeat a math course.

I, being a stay at home mom, had a lot of trouble cutting vegetables because the knives I had would not sharpen. Now, having purchased the Shun DM0716, I marvel at the blade. It cuts through the hardest vegetables with the ease of cutting a piece of butter. The blade is very sharp, so it should be held well away from the body.

I like the Shun knives for how well they work. They hold their edge well; but I do use a tool to keep the edge true. I like the handles too. They come in Left-handed and Right-handed handles which really work great to allow one to get a good grip on the handle and control the knife blade. The blades look very nice too.

I was very careful with it while using it, storing it, and washing it. While washing the knife tonight I noticed a HUGE chunk out of the blade...it must have bumped up against a piece of silverware in the sink or something. I'm sorry, I don't care how sharp the knife is or how good it looks--If it is too fragile for every day use, it should be hung on the wall for show and not relied on to actually deal with the stressors of real life.

They are physically functional, I guess. However, they are about as sexy-looking as a toilet brush. I have had one for about a year, and I've never used it.Also, they are bulky. Imagine your Hitachi, and how big it is, then look at the photo of this product and imagine that the cup on the end has to fit over the entire head of the Hitachi.

I have read Chicken Soup books in the past and they have always left me touched, inspired, and in tears. This one however did not and I found myself reading through the stories compiled rather quickly and in an almost skimming-through manner. The writing was lackluster and aside from a couple of stories, I felt dissatisfied throughout most of the book. There was no shortage of Christian-related mentionings and that left me rather uncomfortable as I do not share in the belief. Overall, this was a disappointment but not a total disaster. The large, faith-saturated portions may certainly satisfy most of the target audience but for a few mavericks, it drained whatever little emotional value each story had to begin with.

It's close enough to the KJV that I can read aloud during Bible study and people don't get lost, but it seems to flow better, and many of the words that I used to look up for better meaning in Strongs already have that better meaning.One of the things that really drew me to this particular Bible was the cover. The leather is really soft and I love the celtic cross design.The only complaint I have is that since it is a think Bible, books that take up more space in a thicker Bible only take up one or two pages in this one. This makes it harder to get to a passage I want quickly. It will take some getting used to, but I like the translation enough that I've been using it daily since I got it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Purchase","review":"This is a wonderful book.

I truly think it is an excellent translation. But I was and continue to be profoundly disappointed with the overall quality of this Bible. First, the leather, externally is nice, but the binding is poor with pages rippling in the spine. I keep thinking Crossway is going to finally publish a good-quality ESV. But thus far, all of them have disappointed me. I do like the ESV Study Bible. The only negative is the size and weight of the thing. It's a great \\"keep at your desk\\" study Bible, but not very practical for carrying on your person. If only Crossway would take some pride in the materials used and the construction of the ESV. This has been a complain every since the ESV came out. Is ANYONE at Crossway listening?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Indexed!","review":"This translation is highly regarded for its accuracy.

Before this I had two Bibles, neither of which really met my needs.

That would be perfect - thin, cross-references, concordance, thumb-indexed, genuine leather. Will stick with my NASB for the moment. Might get an ESV as well when they come out with such an edition.

I needed something new to listen to 70,000 times in a row in my car while shuttling about and am not disappointed. Despite the previous comparisons to the Bee Gees, I do not endorse that notion but find that even with the many tempting possibilities to compare, this band has achieved a unique sound. Yes, it's hook heavy but it's not a cheap thrill....I love it and simply cannot get \\"In the Clouds\\" and \\"Lay Me Down\\" out of my head. As I drive, my fellow motorists are treated to (or totally appalled by) the sight of a gray-haired mama rockin' out to some fantastic new music by a band from whom I expect great things. I've played it for my 17 and 21 year olds and they totally agree."},{"rating":"2","title":"And What an Entrance!!!","review":"I haven't been keeping up with a lot of the new music these days, mostly due to lack of time and partly due to the belief that music now isn't what it used to be at at least 10 years ago. There are solid bands - still going strong today - like the Wallflowers, Muse, Coldplay, Maroon 5 etc, so I tend to stick with the familiar.But I branched out.After someone introduced me to these guys, I was blown away by their hot fusion of soul, 70s disco-esque falsettos, and fantastic beats. Yes, if I could snog the music, I would. Better yet, every song is pretty different.Their kind of music hasn't appeared much on the market these days, I feel, which is what makes them so refreshing to listen to.So...that's basically why I decided to give these guys 5 stars - they bloody well deserve every one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 out of 11 isn't bad...","review":"\\"Mama's Room\\" and \\"In the Clouds\\" are great songs and the kind of hit singles most bands dream of writing. Unfortunately, the rest of UTIOG's major label debut doesn't live up to the promise - or the fun - of these two songs. Lyrically and musically the other 9 songs feel unfocused and lack the marriage of retro and modern that makes \\"Mama's Room\\" and \\"In the Clouds\\" so easy to like - and so catchy. But the band has obvious potential to be explosive - it's just a little premature yet.

He astutely divides his book into four parts: Betrayal, Terror, Loss and Loneliness and illustrates the doctor-patient relationship in a most enlightening manner.This is a must read in the tradition of Dr. Sherwin B.

It makes the experience of the patient very clear so the reader comes as close to the experience as possible, both intellectually and emotionally. However, I disagree with the author's conclusion that the 4 feelings on which he focuses constitute the definitive set. The constellation is more individual, and more robust.

If you actually take the time to look at what you believe, as well as looking up every verse, you may be surprised in what you find.A good piece of advice is to read this book as well as a very conservative version of inerrancy and uses them to help you further your understandings and beliefs. It is definitely the long way around the issue but in the end the most rewarding."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally useless","review":"This video is totally useless as far as helping you set-up and run neuro-feedback. It is an amateur production, with the video camera set on a stand behind the speaker's head. All you see is the back of a guy's head... and some lady working off to the side. You can't see the computer screen where the program is running; you can't see the device and how it's hooked up or plugged in. You don't see anything, and you don't learn anything.

Hooked it up to a water bladder above the level of the pump and turned it on to find a weak flow out of a 6' hose laying below the pump on the other end. Laying the hose on the ground and allowing it to siphon produced nearly the same flow. Good luck pumping uphill with it unless you have a lot of time. Also very noisy.If you are trying to pump water into your RV from a bladder or tank it will work but will take a much longer time than the advertised 350 GPH would lead you to believe. My old water pump, rated at 150 GPH produces a stronger flow. Really sorry I bought this and will be buying a high volume RV pump to replace it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This video is simply amazine.","review":"This is one of the best sports doccumentaries I have ever seen, and the best NBA video I have viewed. It seems that an hour is not enough to recap the great career of Larry Bird. Unfortunately this film was made in 1991, so his final season and Olympic experience was not covered in this video. I also feel that it could have gone in more detial over certain events in his career. However, it is an amazing film which makes you believe that Larry legend is truely a miracle worker. This film tells it like it is, and is a good pick for any Celtic, Bird or Magic fan. Watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Larry Legeng is the greatest of all time","review":"This video just goes to show that Larry Bird is indeed the greatest basketball player of all time. His uncanny ability to dominate a game without even shooting the ball, or scoring 50 points, or registering one of his many triple-doubles to help the Celtics win. He could raise the level of the players around him. He wasn't blessed with great athletic ability, but made the most with what he had by his sheer determination. His overcoming so many stikes against him to succeed should encourage anyone. Michael Jordan might have scored a lot of points, but Bird was the greatest all around player. He averaged 25 points, 10 rebounds, and 7 assists over his 13 year career. This video is a must have for any Celtics/Bird fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I was a big Dr. J fan growing up, so didn't care for Larry Bird much; or the Celtics!

It does a good job of explaining how Christianity and Goddess worship (both of which I believe are life-affirming) are not antithetical to one another.

In the early 80's, Chris Spedding's music was a staple on the local college radio station KFJC. When this German reissue was released, I was absolutely thrilled.Chris seemlessly meshes soulful vocals, hot guitars licks, with a punk undercurrent to this effort. The songs on this album range from good to great (including the bonus tracks). The liner notes nicely chronicle this remarkable artist's career.If you enjoy the music of Chris Spedding or want something akin to early sounding R.E.M., then you can't live without this album.

I have two knives that just begun to get rust spots on them this past year. I do not use the sharpening stick that came with it since it does not sharpen them worth a lick. I use a little hand held sharpening tool for that and they are deadly sharp. I did notice that they do dull a bit fast, especially the two knives that I use daily several times a day, but if you get one of those sharping tools then you will not be disappointed.

There was not one likeable character. The real movie stars' lives in Hollywood make these characters look like angels. The 3 women's stories in this horrific book seem too good to be true. Yes, I mean Hollywood Divorces. It was amusing to read......for a second. I was hoping Collins would come out with some new lines but they're all the way. Been there, done that.

It starts out really, really good (grabs your attention) but midway becomes a mindless read that eventually loses its \\"umph.\\" The climaxes for each character are little more than a footnote on the pages. Too much emphases on the ho-hum stuff, not enough attention to the \\"shockers\\" which kind of brings it to an abrupt ending.

Shelby, (who's wish-washyness got real old after a while) trying to deal with her husbands infidelities. And Cat, who once she started hanging around with Nick Logan REALLY got on my nerves...(You're so crazy!...No, you are...No, you're the craziest...aaaghh!)The only part in this book that was even mildly entertaining was wondering what would happen between Matt Seel (Lola's husband) and Tony Alveraz (Lola's lover and ex-boyfriend).

I know the woman can write and write good content, so why she felt compelled to include such vulgarity escapes me!

I found it fascintating, that while reading this work, I had to keep reminding myself that this guy, Sir Richard Burton, was a real person, and was not some figment of a writer's imagination. Richard Burton led a fascinating life during a fascinating time in our history. The author captures both the time and the man.

Sir Francis Burton is one of history's more interesting people but after reading this book I don't think he was someone that was easy to get along with.

Although you'd think it would be tough to make the man who introduced the Kama Sutra to the West boring, that's exactly what Edward Rice succeeds in doing. The writing itself is not bad, but the narrative of Burton's life seems to wander aimlessly, as if the complexity of the man overwhelmed the biographer.

The character's were not developed nearly as well and I had a really hard time knowing them and just left me flat. I gave it a shot and read the whole thing but the ending was NOT at all what I was expecting and I felt it was super rushed. I could not figure out if she ends up as his mistress again or if he marries her and I did not feel I even cared to go back and reread it to see what I missed or if I read it wrong.

It was the first I discovered, and have since purchased the rest of his catalog. For those of us who grew up with Elton's originals dominating the top 40, Kostia's interpretations will be at once haunting and reminiscent. All of Kostia's work evokes the sophistication and comfort of a palatial hotel lounge, nursing a fine cognac late into the evening, the warm glow of a fireplace at your feet and a soft piano in your ears. This man's eloquence in the language of the piano speaks directly to the heart. My only complaint is that he has published so little!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog loves them","review":"My dog really likes these treats. I use them for training and they are pretty small.

Ivory, Victoria, Lita, and Trish are the only true wrestling divas here; all the new contest winning (and losing) women are no different from the ho's the Godfather used to bring to the ring with him.Boring, slow paced, unimaginative content that just mimics the DVD from last year. Some ok scenes here and there, but very low quality content overall. Don't expect to see any good matches on the 'extras' menu; remember, they fired the good wrestling divas in order to hire the non-wrestling ho's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moist Jihad","review":"Really solid DVD, band is on a big stage pumping out the classics with raw energy, if you know the Moistboyz this is probably them at their height as Dickie Moist has left the band for awhile. I personally would have liked to see some early 90s shows because this concert was arranged to look like a dvd shoot. Meaning its in a nice venue, big stage, good lighting, great sound, all the camera angles covered, it doesn't really fit the Moistboyz for some reason. No stage ground level basement shows, the band brings the power, look up the video of OG Simpson on youtube from 1994 and see what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Morning, America","review":"I saw them at Slim's in San Francisco during this tour; against the barrier with Dickie's beer, sweat, and buttcrack attacking me and all.

Luckily, that set is available here: [...]If you want more of this music, go dig around for a set of cd's called \\"The Pathe 100\\".

The original tracks by Bai Guang, Zhou Xuan, etc., are wonderful old discs. And in the right hands they could be sampled and scratched into something jaw-dropping.But the remix is like bad 'seventies disco, like \\"Stars on 45\\" or those dreadful \\"Star Wars\\" dance singles. Cheesy synthasizers & tedious beat tracks. Forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent remixes of music most people have never heard of.","review":"I have read the rants agaisnt the remixes on this 2 disc set and must disagree. The remixes were great, very techno-lounge-meets-madame Wong. Some of the cuts will remind some listeners of The Yellow Magic Orchestra. The original recordings are something I would never have listened to unless I was in China somewhere, so it is good exposure to the old and exotic. But, it is in the freshness and newness that this compilation succeeds. I bought this CD in Chile without any prior knowledge and loved it immediately.

Her wheels were 4 inches wide. This product wheels are 4 inches in diameter and only 1 inch WIDE - too narrow to push on the 40 foot path to reach a Hilton Head beach.

Whether or not your walk to the beach is from the dock or the car, this cart makes the walk completely bearable, in most cases by one person! I used this cart for seven days straight last week and my only complaint would be that I think the wider wheeled version may have worked a little better on the walk to and from our house rental to the beach, which included a decent trek in the sand. I still give the cart five-stars, as I can probably attribute this to the fact that we had the cart completely over-loaded carrying four or five chairs, four umbrellas, four boogie boards and towels.

Since it is made to be pulled, not pushed, it was hard for me to get the hang of it at first. However, when we went to the waterpark, we put a cooler in the main compartment and that made it much easier to push. That extra weight in the main compartment counterbalanced the weight of my purse in the removable tote bag near the handle. The large main compartment is made of mesh and I don't expect it to be very durable, especially with heavy wear. So far it has accomplished what I bought it for, but I am not sure if I would purchase it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holds a lot","review":"We have put this together but have not been to the beach since receiving it. Did load it once to go and everything that we wanted to take fit. I was a little upset as I ordered the 2009 model with dual large wheels but received one with only one set of large wheels. Will definitely not fit in a small car. Will need a truck, van or full size car. It is what I expected otherwise. Just hope it holds up as well as others have said. Am very pleased with the size and design."},{"rating":"2","title":"not deluxe, but still pretty good","review":"This product is great for transporting your beach stuff, but I do have 2 complaints. The \\"cooler\\" is simply a pouch with no closure, so you still have to cover it with something. It doesn't keep your food cold, so you need lots of ice packs. Also, if you have a lot of beach chairs with those overhead shades attached, it can only hold 3 chairs max. If you have small beach chairs, you're in business. It has a very deep basket in the middle which is great for toys, towels etc. The big rear wheels are great on the sand, as long as you pull it behind you once you get to the beach.

To let you know how helpful it was, we aren't even taking it to the beach with us this year. Yes, it does hold a lot of stuff including 4 beach chairs at a time. However, once you get onto the sand you have to drag it, and as loaded down as we had it this task took 2 people.

To understand Makdisi is to understand what is most importantly going on in today's cultural-political discourse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romantic imp-pearls","review":"When you actually penetrate the rosy jargon, you find no real meaning, just empty pearls. The chapters spin by based on Wordsworth's concept of \\"spot of time\\" but the concept itself fails to justify all the time spent on showing Byronic theatrics with simplistic, hedonistic, flippant care. Time is the central theme of the book but no effort is made to actually deal with the timing of the verses themselves in the terms that the poets themselves used them. The author just glosses over time in its specificity and rests his argument on superficial observations based on the political context of the time. No mention is made of the religious and spiritual pathways that time is given in these verses despite the cover's religious imagery."},{"rating":"2","title":"HILARIOUS if you understand the language!","review":"I read this book forever ago in high school, and fell in love with it!

(We attend one of the schools included, and the information is over six years old (as well as incorrect)!).

These books are wonderfully detailed, beautifully illustrated, and worth every penny of the purchase price. I am a bird book fanatic and have enjoyed these books as much as any of the other books in my collection. One of the other reviewers mentioned these as field guides. In my opinion, they are definitely not field guides- way to massive. I imagine myself lugging these two babies through a lost corner of some rainforest in Brazil.

Save your money. The first problem with this product is that the area that is supposed to fit over the buckle part of the car seat carrier simply does not fit over it. In addition, there's no way to attach it to the carrier, stroller, or whatever. So when you try to put your child into wherever you wish to use it, all it does is slide around.

If there were slots for the straps it would, but then it wouldn't be protecting the seat. I just wanna cry because money was wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moves around too much","review":"I bought this before my first child arrived i.e. no experience. The piddle pad does not stay in place especially when the baby gets older and very restless. I have since bought another which has a hole for the buckle to go through, so that serves as a deterrent for it to move out of the seat. In general, I don't think piddle pads really work because the area of protection is too small. Someone should design one with fabric extending all the way, from the bum to just behind the knees. I think a waterproof overall child seat cover might be a better solution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for all kinds of spills and leaks","review":"We received this as a gift for the twins' first birthdays and are still using it 4.5 years later in their convertible carseats. First, it was great for diaper leaks, then potty training accidents, then catching crumbs and food spills and now it keeps the seats dry when they're in wet bathing suits. No, it doesn't catch all the leaks all the time and does need slight repositioning before each use but that only takes a second which is nothing compared to the amount of disassembling, washing, drying and reassembling it saves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waterproof seat","review":"This is exactly what we need.

Remember on vacations it is sometimes not easy to wash your childs car seat. Do you really want them sitting in a messy seat? It is perfect for car rides, airplane rides ( when its not that easy to change a diaper ), and in the stroller. I am pregnant with the second and already have them in the mail and on their way to me. I recommend them to everyone!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work in an infant car seat.","review":"This product is a good idea but it does not in any way fit in an infant car seat. The back comes up way too high--it was above the shoulder straps. And look at the picture on the package-where ARE the shoulder straps?? Unless you have an older baby in a large car seat, this thing is just too big. With the 5-point harness, the sides of the pad get in the way and have to be folded over your baby's legs. I've had to wash my infant car seat carrier twice already so I would love seat liner that worked but this wasn't it. They should make it in different sizes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not bother with this","review":"I bought two for my kids' seats. They constantly bunch up and slip around.

They not only will not stay afixed while attempting to get the garment on, but are very difficult to keep in place.I purchased the product on this site because I have been unable to find a comparable support, and was willing to pay the $65 because of the seeming unavailability of it elsewhere. I have several other bras which I have purchased from Nordstroms which are far superior in quality and performance when wearing my prosthetics, and were considerably less expensive.I have been unable to wear this new garment, and if I didn't think it would really be a hassle trying to return it, I would.

I am pretty sure that some of them have never been set off. I test them about 3-4 times a year (they state you should test them weekly).\\\\Other than the battery going out WAY too soon, I have really liked these. They have not had issues with false alarms, even in my kitchen. They are easy to instal and remove.The battery life just sucks.

I have sent a note to Kidde... we will see if they do the right thing.On the positive side, it is easy to install and the 'test' and 'hush' buttons work well.

Angle vs. Michaels stole the entire show. Cena vs JBL was a waste of time. Cena is probably one of the worst wrestlers ever and the whole rap thing sucks. He's a thug plain and simple and has no business in a wrestling ring. Batista vs HHH was good but not great. All the rest of the matches were on or below average. As for the ladder match, one of the worst of all time. But still, buy this DVD because in the end it was a good PPV and after all, every wrestling fan should own all Wrestlemania DVD's.

Ellison is to the modern short story what Vincent Van Gogh was to Impressionist visual art (disturbing, yet real).

In the end, these classifications are just to place the book somewhere to make the bookseller's life a bit easier. This is the book to get if you are new (what took you so damn long?) to Ellison.

At first the very idea of a reggae metal fusion sounds like it would NEVER work. However, Skindred pulls it off beautifully.The track that initally drew me in was \\"Nobody\\" (I heard it on the radio) because of the hard riffs coupled with the very uniique vocals. After hearing the song a couple times I had to get this CD. The rest of the CD is filled with the same level of energy and excitement. My other favorites are \\"Set It Off\\" and \\" Selector\\" because they seem to be more upbeat and more fun, if that makes the least bit of sense.The only reason I didn't give this CD 5 stars is because the whole CD just seemed a little too radio friendly and upbeat. But I just attribute this to the fact that I mostly listen to Slipknot, Rage Against the Machine, and The Polyphonic Spree (Think about that for a while!!!!). All in all, I HIGHLY recommend anyone getting this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is about time!","review":"I am so glad that Skindred is finally getting the recognition that they deserve! This CD, \\"Babylon\\", is simply a solid album. It incorporates so many different musical styles from hard dropping jungle beats to some sweet heavymetal bass and guitar. Furthermore, Benji, has got to be one of the most versatile vocalists around these days. Not only are the lyrics delivered perfectley, they are hard hitting and deal with some serious issues. I for one am thrilled that more and more people are having their eyes opened by Skindred, it's about time! Now all we have to do is get them to come to Canada on tour!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ska core all the way.","review":"So very good. The old school meets the new generation. Reminds me of Bad Brains. I heard \\"Nobody\\" on satellite radio and was hooked. Purchased the album, and they delivered that and more. Props- I have not been impressed with a group in a long time, and these guys brought it. They have a well deserved place in my collection right between Pegboy and The Mighty Mighty Bosstones."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF is this?!","review":"This garbage would make Bob Marley roll over in his grave. These guys can't decide whether they want to be nu-metal or poorly done reggae. So they mash them both together, creating this unholy mess. How the other version of this CD got a 5 star rating, I don't know. The vocals are grating to the ears, the lyrics are stupid, and the guitar is all power chords. And they spell in ebonics! How stupid is that? More importantly, who the hell thought they deserved a record deal?!If you want a good blend of metal and tribal themes, listen to Max Cavalera-era Sepultura."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been There Done That","review":"Skindred is just doing what The Bad Brains did in the eighties.

This is is an awsome CD! If you are looking for something \\"tradtional\\" in the metal genre, this album is not for you. If you have soul, like rhythm and loud guitar riffs, this is a good choice. They really don't sound like any oher band I know. Some may say (like they did about Dub War) that they sample too many different styles. That is part of their appeal to me. Reggae, funk, punk, ska, rap, and hardcore all get thrown into the mix here. That may make it unlistenable to some. To me, they do it in such a way that it is truly enjoyable because you don't know what's coming next. If you like music that assaults the ears and makes you think outside the box, this may be a fit for you. Don't listen to the haters. LOUD SHOUT OUT TO BENJIE AND THE BOYS FOR PUTTING THIS CACOPHONIC NIGHTMARE TOGETHER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely Awesome","review":"This is definitely not the same repetitive, average metal that i keep seeing get 5 stars and getting an \\"awesome rating\\", it makes me want to rip those reviewers up one side and down the other, because i wasted my money on a cd thinking it was good. This band is completely original, nothing like i've ever heard, and yet so sweet. Its like Bob Marley, mixed with System Of A Down, mixed with Slipknot. Sounds like it would be wierd, but it is definitely a good buy. I love it and plan on keeping it forever. I recommend this to someone who likes rock but is also open to other genres of music. I do not really recommend this to those metal heads that will only listen to this repetitive death metal crap that i've bought which i sold right away. GREAT CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Novelty Vs Substance.","review":"I dabble in reggae, ragga, ska and reggaeton and I am a die hard metal and hardcore fan so when I heard about a group that was delving into a genre that had only been hinted at by other artists (eg. Soulfy; who worked with Benji on their 1st album. As well as Molotov; \\"Rastamandita\\") , I jumped at the chance to check them out. I admit that the novelty value is high but after the 2nd and 3rd time you hear the album it reveals itself for what it trully is; overproduced, sickeningly melodic ear candy. This is just my opinion BUT if i had heard this album five or six years ago, when my taste was less advanced i would probably have rated it highly.This album proves why bands should not sacrifice artistry and durability for the sake of commercialism. Avoid it at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"This band KICKS FUKKIN ASS!!!!","review":"I LOVE Skindred!! And I get to see them live with Papa Roach this friday here in Duluth, Mn. ROKK THE FUKK OUT AND PIKK UP THIS CD ASAP!! WELL WORTH YOUR $$$$"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly original, but no good","review":"Skindred's album \\"Babylon\\" really fails to delivier. From the first track (and mostly throughout the entire album) you know that this group is no better then any other hard rock band like Linkin Park and Disturbed. They attempt to add some sort of originality by dubbing in some synths and some half-baked horn lines. But in spite of this, Skindred still just sounds like another generic 90's-00's hard rock band.This is no more evident in their lyrics (which seem to be written in some sort of \\"ebonics\\" language in the liner notes)like this tasteful little line:\\"Know this ones dedicated to the police dem you know LiarCause some of them is wicked and them good for nothingAnd dem love pick upon peopleAnd dem think der no rightAnd I man come to show you dat\\"that was taken straight out of the liner notes which begs the question: Did these guys even get out of 5th grade, cuz a 5th grader could write better lyrics about a more tasteful subject then these guys could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Stuff","review":"I heard this band on XM and couldn't believe how bad they sounded.

Having an idea of where the story is going is expected, but knowing what each reaction to a situation is another. It was way to predictable and Chase character was more along the lines of a stereotypical weak female, not of a strong, intelligent and dominant male. I forwarded through most of it cause I had already figured out what had happened and was right each time."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY Disappointing","review":"Having not read any of Carly Phillips' previous books, but hearing their praises from my friends, I was excited to find a pre-sale proof copy of this at my local used book store.Since I had a vacation upcoming, I thought it would be an enjoyable light read for my time off. Light, yes. Enjoyable, no.What a cliche ridden, horribly written book. Phillips' descriptions were repetitive everytime Chase and the girl (I can't even remember her name) went at it. The characters were shallow and poorly drawn, and the end was totally predictable. All in all, it was a very disappointing, but fortunately quick, read.I like \\"Chick-Lit\\" books, which I was led to belive this was, but it's not. It's a half-step from a Harlequin Romance and I gave those up in HIGH SCHOOL.I'm glad I didn't pay full price for a hardcover on this.This book is a bad soap opera and I certainly won't be reading any of the others in the series.There are many other books that I would recommend over this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst romance novels I've ever read","review":"First of all, this book was horribly written. All the lines coming out of the characters mouths were cheesy and predictable. This woman is not a writer. Next, the whole premise for the book is unrealistic. The big secret a presidential candidate had to hide was that he'd adopted a child... Wow, what a horrible thing to do. The idea that the politician's staff would then try and kill the biological father to erase the problem is stupid. After many books read, this is the first time I've felt compelled to write a review. This is how bad this book is."},{"rating":"1","title":"HARDBACK??? How sneaky!!","review":"I just came online to see when the latest book of the trilogy would be out. I was shocked to see this latest installment was released in hardback when the previous two were paperback. How sneaky of the publisher to suck is into the series just to get more bucks out of us on the third and final book by making us spend 10 bucks more on hardback. I almost want to not buy it since I'm so annoyed by this. I do want to see how it ends though. *SIGH* Okay, I feel better now."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Heartbreaker","review":"I really like Carly Phillips as a writer. She has nice flow from one book to another. Looking forward to getting some more of her series. The Bachelor, The Player, and The Heartbreaker, follow the three Chandler brothers, not looking for love, but ultimately finding it. Thanks in part to their mother. All three of these are fast and light reading. If you are looking for a laugh, go get this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Standard romance","review":"This is my third book to read of Carly Phillips and will be my last. The books that I have read are awful. Because of the ratings, at first I thought it was just I, but it's not. Everyone is beautiful and shallow, which is your typical, standard, safe romance novel. I doubt that this author will ever write beyond her safety net. Chase was okay, but the drooling over Sloan was overkill. Also, what is it with this author when comes to eyes. \\"His gaze keenly centered on hers, his intelligent eyes or his blue eyes met hers, deep and questioning.\\" I didn't know they still wrote things like that. Body language, yes, but I've never understood a person or their intent by gazing into another person's eyes. Facial expression - yes, eyes - no. I wish I would have known before I bought this book that this author is geared more toward teens and young adults..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was okay","review":"This read like a predictable love story I don't like it it when the characters it on right after they meet, it cheapens the characters and the story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"The great escape","review":"Some days are longer than others, but I always try to read at least a few pages of a book. It relaxes me - takes me somewhere else beside my problems. This book does just that. This is the third story about the Chandler brothers. I read the others and wanted to know how Chase found the woman he could not let slip away. Chase is a reporter asked to watch over the Senator's daughter Sloane. With the opening understanding that these two did not want a permanent relationship, their attraction is quite intense. His only problem is, he wants his chance at the story behind this, believing it could make his career. He also doe not want to hurt Sloane. I do not want to give the story away, but want to say like the other two brothers, Chase does not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for teaching a lesson","review":"Scaredy Bear has a problem. He really likes Pig, but he is too scared to even talk to her. The other people in the town think that Bear is a little stuck up, as he doesn't open up to anyone. Bear is great at playing his Banjo, but when invited to play with Pig he gets too scared and tells everyone that he cannot do it. This book doesn't really end happily... Bear cannot overcome his fear to play so he misses out on making new friends. It is a good lesson for parents to talk through with their kids who are either afraid of talking to someone, or even reasons that others are shy sometimes. My Daughter loves this book and loves to say scaredy Bear.

He had trouble sleeping & actually started crying in the middle of the day from the trauma of remembering this scene! He said, \\"Mom, I wish we'd never bought this one.\\" My son also said, \\"Mom, why did George Lucas let this one be unrated? That was bad!\\" Out of the mouths of babes!

I have located and contacted the hypnobirthing instructor in my area and I am very excited to start this exciting journey towards drug free childbirth. However, if you are a fan of drug assisted birth, I am afraid you might not care for the tone of this book. Happy Reading! Happy HypnoBirthing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't help much","review":"I used the hypnobirthing method with my daughter, and unfortunately it didn't work for me. I practiced with the CDs my entire pregnancy, and they did help me sleep better and to relax. I slept great almost my whole pregnancy, and I do give credit to the CDs for that. I even hired a doula, who got certified in Hypnobirthing in time for my delivery, but I didn't really feel that it was very helpful once my labor started. When my contractions started, they were painful. The book refers to \\"pressure\\" but I definitely felt pain. I tried listening to the CDs, getting on the birthing ball, and doing some meditation, but nothing made it more comfortable. For me, labor hurt! It went downhill from there. Severe pain in the hospital so I requested an epidural, ended up getting pitocin, and then finally delivered via C-section. Now with my second child, I am considering a VBAC and looking into Hypnobabies, which I hear prepares you much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a MUST READ!!!","review":"If you're pregnant, you MUST read this book! It will get you mentally, physically and emotionally ready to enjoy your labor... rather than fear it. The mind is a VERY powerful tool and the more we understand the natural physiological process of childbirth, the better we can work WITH our bodies and make the whole process easy and as painless as possible (literally!). I was skeptical when I picked up this book, but it really works! When you remove the element of fear (and the hormones that are produced by fear & stress) and replace them with endorphins, pain is literally, physically lessened! Because of having read this book, my labor was an amazing, totally natural, drug-free experience. I focused on staying completely relaxed and letting my body do what it needed to do, and I had a 6-hour labor with very minimal pain. It was amazing. Thank you Marie Mongan for giving me a wonderful childbirth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best birth prep","review":"This book has a lot of great relaxation techniques, even if you aren't big into self hypnosis. I struggled to fully immerse myself in some of the hypnosis, but the scripts and visualizations were still a HUGE help. I also bought the Bradley method book, and took a Lamaze class which came with a book. Of all of the methods, this one had the highest quantity and quality of relaxation techniques. If you're looking for birth education go elsewhere, but if your looking for good ideas and practice for the big day and coping with pain, I'd choose this over the other two programs in a heart beat.The only thing that would make this better would be to include a better cd. The cd included in the book isn't as helpful and relaxing as I hoped it would be. I expected it to be more like yoga music or something to guide your relaxation."},{"rating":"2","title":"This really works!","review":"I can't imagine laboring any other way! Hypnobirthing techniques really work to ease labor pains. I read the book and took the class at my hospital for my first pregnancy. Unfortunately, my son was breech and was a scheduled c-section. I did the techniques on my own during my second pregnancy and was able to deliver a healthy baby girl via VBAC. The doctor and nurses kept coming into the room shocked at how calmly things were progressing because they could tell on the monitor that my contractions were getting stronger. Whenever I came out of relaxation, I immediately felt nauseous. I would highly recommend trying this technique. Even if you can't use it during labor, it's great for quelling fears during pregnancy. I'm buying it again for my third pregnancy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed It","review":"This book is great to read. It gives you a positive outlook on how beautiful birth is.

I practiced and practiced, listened to the CD over and over, took the class, and when it came time, it all went out the window. Then I felt totally unprepared for birth because nothing was going as the book told me it would and I was left helpless and confused. I should have read other books that were more realistic and actually gave me real methods on how to deal with labor. Stupid-me for thinking that this was the end-all, be-all method for birthing my baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs more meat","review":"This book was a great introduction to the concept of hypnosis for childbirth pain control. It was my first exposure to the idea, and it sold me on it! This book made me believe I too could do a natural unmedicated childbirth. However, even though I listened to the CD and read the book, I felt I did not have enough tools to figure out how to make it happen. I yearned for a program to follow or a training method that this book did not offer.

I'm pregnant with my 3rd child and tried different methods with the first two. I got about halfway through and had to put it down. It's complete nonsense.

A lot of sections in this book refer to \\"when you go to the class\\" or \\"the items you will go over in class\\" or \\"the techniques you will learn in class.\\" This book assumes that the buyer is also going to take the class. I bought the book because I didn't want to pay $400 for the class.It is probably a better companion to the class than a stand-alone book. It's almost useless without the class."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful!","review":"When I read this book I was about 5.5 months along. I immediately switched over all my prenatal care at 6 months to a midwife and did a home birth. This book helped educate me on the process our bodies go through and how to labor, which most women neglect to research. They go in with the mindset to just \\"go with the flow\\"...which is hard if you don't know what to expect in that flow! I had an amazing birth experince, all at home, no complications. Bought the rainbow CD and had it on repeat the entire time. I can't wait to have another baby (and labor!) to experince that high again. I also wanted to say that this is the one of the first times I have ever written a review on anything...and am happy to do so to spread the word!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not sold....","review":"I think the flaw with this method is the idea that something \\"natural\\" (ie childbirth) can't be painful. Childbirth sure seems painful...I've delivered a handful of babies myself. While I am looking forward to my first baby this Christmas, I am not anticipating a pain-free experience. I think the Mongan method has some valuable things to say regarding meditation and focus. However, it did not sell me on the efficacy of it's method."},{"rating":"1","title":"The audio CD can be dangerous!","review":"I listened to the audio CD several times - it had a lot of breathing exercises. Each time I became dizzy and started to hyperventilate! I brought the CD into my midwife and she said to stop listening to it right away. She said that when the body is completely relaxed, it knows exactly how to breathe. My midwife said, \\"The techniques used in this CD are from the 60's and we don't do that kind of breathing anymore during pregnancy or labor.\\" She also said, \\"This author knows nothing about pregnancy or labor - she's just a hypnotist.\\" She recommended that I use another method and I did - it was WONDERFUL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HypnoBirthingThe Breakthrough Natural Approach","review":"No New material .

It really works. Mind power is the best. Now I have ordered it for my little sister who is expecting her first. I think every pregnant woman should read this.

Its terrible. What's sad is that I agree hospitals do get it wrong for most standard pregnancies. However I dislike the anti medical establishment that runs through the book and I greatly detest the implication that if you don't succeed at the methods in this book its your fault for not trying hard enough. She really glosses over anything that could go wrong and when she does confront it she blames the hospitals for everything. Or the mother. She seems to forget that in the good ol' days, a lot of women actually died in child birth. And in fact a lot of women still do. I really do think that the method was designed to simply sell the birthing classes.For an infinitely better book on natural birthing, read anything by Ina May."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great help during birthing!","review":"I read the book and practiced with the CD for three weeks prior to the birth of my third child. I wanted to try it all natural. When I got to the hospital, I was so far into my labor and was told the anesthesiologist probably wouldn't make it there in time for an epidural to work. So, I waived the epidural, put in the CD, and 20 minutes later had a beautiful and healthy daughter with very minimal pain! It was actually my best birthing experience out of all three of my children. My contractions seemd to last shorter, and my husband said at the height of my contraction I didn't seem to be bothered by them. I learned how to overcome the pain just by listening to a CD! I have told everyone I know who is having a baby of my experience, and encouraged them to buy the book and CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Book!!!!!","review":"This amazing book completely changed my perspective on childbirth and pregnancy. I wasn't sure about paying for the classes until I started reading this book and realized how excited I was about this experience. My first pregnancy was with an epidural and was great, but this pregnancy I wanted to take a more active role in the decisions that were made. I am very thankful for this book and the CD that I listened to every night."},{"rating":"1","title":"what's all the fuss about this book?","review":"maybe the classes are more helpful, but this book is pretty much too general to be useful at all - there are no real exercises (i guess if you could learn it all from the book then who would shell out a few hundred for the class??)it's also pretty ridiculous to give women the idea that a painless childbirth is a reachable goal through this method. i think it's much more realistic to think about how to use breathing and hypnosis to MANAGE the pain.this book makes a lot of promises but definitely doesn't teach you enough about how to actually DO the method!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the book, no dvd enclosed","review":"I really loved the book more than I thought I would. They really should re-name the method, I think hypnobirthing throws people off, but the concept of relaxation and visualizing is so simple. Every woman should be educated on what is happening to her body during childbirth so she can master her fears and look forward to a beautiful birth. my one and only complaint was that although my order was supposed to be in good condition, it didn't come with the dvd so I feel like I wasted the purchase since I want it and will have to buy a brand new one anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book","review":"After this book, just arrived at Oct, 8. i opened it, and the i read in 2,5 hours, and i almost finish to read it.

However, my experience was that of a turned baby (facing back instead of forward) and yes the techniques helped me cope through 8 hours of relentless back labor... but in the end, it was an epidural and an experienced midwife who turned the baby. I got the natural delivery I wanted, but definitely not without immense pain - even though I was controlling my breathing until the end. My husband and I put off the intervention for longer than necessary - mostly due to my belief in this technique. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone (mine has been thrown out)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat emptor","review":"Google the name \\"Marie Mongan\\" for a link to a judge's dismissal of a lawsuit brought by Marie Mongan against a nurse and childbirth educator.

That story serves as the punchline of the book, so if you're familiar with it the volume won't pack as much of a kick; but it's a great punchline regardless (though it probably read better in the late sixties).Ths book is not an expansion of a story in the same way that _Ender's Game_ or _World Out of Time_ are; it is more like Pohl's own _Years of the City_ , a series of linked short stories. Each story investigates the impact the discovery of life on Mars has on the everyday life of humans. Now, these are no ordinary Martians--they're much more pathetic, and the impact they have is consequently nothing like the impact of, say, Valentine Michael Smith.

I have read well over 150 Vietnam stories and I would put this at the top of the best of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tribute of honor to all American servicemen & women","review":"The Twins Platoon is an excellent book for anyone who wants to grasp a better understanding of how many American Vietnam Veterans experienced the trauma of war. Whether you are a veteran, an American for or against the war, the author Christy Sauro shares heart wrenching, heart warming stories of several unsung heroes. This book tells how many Vietnam Veterans not only suffered during the war but after from post trauma syndrome and how many were shabbily treated coming home.This book is about honor to all American Servicemen and women.Marie Meyer,Lake Elmo"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect solution for safely transporting knives!","review":"I'm very pleased with this purchase. I use this to carry my collection of Forschner (Victorinox) Fibrox knives when I'm cooking or carving meats away from home. My 10\\" chef's knife, 10\\" slicer, 8\\" chef's knife, 8\\" bread knife, carving fork, paring knives, etc. fit perfectly and are well protected. The net pouch even provided sufficient space for a couple of serving spoons/forks. The straps on the fastening clips are adjustable to allow for changes in overall case thickness as the number of knives increases or decreases. The protective flap (shown folded diagonally in the photo) provides extra assurance that the knives stay in position. I no longer worry about nicking the blades (or nicking myself!!!) when transporting my knives. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's in a class by itself...","review":"I never fully appreciated Shirley Maclaine's talent until I saw this performance. She will blow you away. Audrey Hepburn is a competent actress, but she could only play Audrey Hepburn - you seldom believe that she is anyone else. James Garner was cast for his looks, not his talent. Faye Bainter and Miriam Hopkins provide classic film acting at their finest. They are a treat to watch. The young girl was perfectly cast. You want to throttle her. William Wyler's direction is an art form. Lillian Helman's play is perfectly crafted with tension, suspense and human emotion. You will be moved.Many films are not worth your time. This is worth every minute. Rent it and you'll eventually own it. Own it and you'll never let it go.

If a movie doesn't keep my interest within the first 15 mins then I usually stop watching, but this on kept me captivated from the get go.

But,when a little girl is punished for telling lies all the time she tells her grandmother lie's about the teacher's. Soon everyone pulls their children from the school causing the school to close. You just want to jump through the screen and grab the little girl.

The film does offer a vivid view of the horror that it must have meant to be thought of as \\"bent\\" in the 1950's. The whispers and the looks following comments from a young student who assumes an illicit affair between two female teachers, tell the whole story rather eloquently. Sterling performances by a very young Hepburn and and a very innocent MacLaine redeem a tortuous script where too much is left unsaid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Children's hour","review":"Great film. Misconceptions arise from a cultures naivete and lack of progressive understanding towards diversity. And innocent people are subjected to social intolerance. Historically culturally informative; a must see for the current generation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb until the final 1/2 hour","review":"I found this to be one of the best movies I've seen -- until the final half hour. At that point, the characters' actions just don't make much sense and it gets a little boring. Hepburn and Maclaine do an outstanding job, and the girl who starts the whole mess is a character I'll remember for a long time. I'm a big fan of Audrey Hepburn but I'd say that this is easily the best film she's ever been in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stuffy presentation, ruined further by lousy ending","review":"I was suprised how melodramatic and stilted the direction and presentation of the story was--by the \\"great\\" William Wyler. Cinematography is good and Hepburn is undoubtedly a \\"movie star\\", who's persona is so verrry grand. However the ending underminds whatever credibility had been built during the course of the film, and so the whole experience ends up being a downer. Worth seeing, but does not live up to it's potential. I also feel James Garner's involvement somehow trivializes the proceedings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overblown Drama From Ready-Fire-Aim Playwright Lillian Hellman","review":"This Audrey Hepburn/James Garner/Shirley MacLaine film based on a play by Lillian Hellman is a dark, dour, cynical, not very interesting movie about two women who are persecuted for being lesbians. The story does not ring true (even for the time it was written) as the \\"evidence\\" on which the women are convicted would have been debunked by even a rudimentary examination of the facts by a few mature, humane adults.

Julie Smith has created perhaps the most credible yet fantastic protagonist in homicide in her powerful, vulnerable, fearless, and wonderfully tall female detective, Skip Langdon. In Axeman's Jazz Skip is battling a serial killer who resurrects the never-apprehended Axeman, a true criminal from New Orleans' history. Smith weaves her story around 12-step programs, where anonymity makes for good cover. She not only produces some serious suspense, but some deep psychological insights. Skip, who made her debut in Smith's Edgar Winning New Orleans Mourning, grows in her own psychological makeup, and we get more glimpses into her complex personality. Skip is a real original, and I am hooked on her and the series. Axeman's Jazz is mystery writing at its very best."},{"rating":"2","title":"12 Step Programs Featured in Great Mystery","review":"I always enjoy this series of Louisiana mysteries starring failed belle Skip Langdon, but I had to buy this one for my daughter because of the great portrayal, only sometimes satirical, of 12-step programs (especially ones addressing co-dependency)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty awful","review":"I don't know how this book was ever published.

Instead of being a resource of good example problems and concisely expressed formulas, we have a long book with too little content and too much talking to retain student interest. Perhaps less math oriented students would appreciate this book, but most students who choose to take intro-econometrics have some interest in economics itself, which, more often than not, requires more advanced study of econometrics, which, unlike this book, won't resist the math intrinsic to econometrics.

You get a real flavor for what it must be like to go on a dig, and how much work goes into figuring out what you have.

The African-American perspective on interaction rules is examined, many times. Previous studies and articles are quoted extensively.

Another example is Eragon...She's talented for her age (she's definitely better than me when I was thirteen) but, if this hadn't been written by a young author, it likely wouldn't have been published.

I have to say I really can't belive how many people give this book such high ratings. I thought it was tedious, pointless, and uninspired. I found a certain bits of it mildly interesting (very few and far between), but mostly I felt like I was being beaten over the head with the descriptions of his ineptitude, and mocked for being a productive member of society.

Why should I continue to care for that many pages?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't pay heed to the other reviews","review":"I bought this book based on the reviews I had read.

This is the second book Bukowski wrote, and its a really good place to start if you are looking to get into Bukowski. The book is filled with short chapters that involve the years Bukowski called his \\"ten year drunk.\\" The book chronicles his road trip around the United States, just at the time he was starting to become famous.Its a quick read that includes many of the offbeat and unique observations that this guy makes about the world. You'll laugh every page.Be careful, though. Reading Bukowski can completely change the way you look at things. The day after reading this book you'll have a little less regard for the little things that usually bother people, and a little more confidence in yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Good Too Good","review":"This is the one, folks. Read this book before you shave your privates with a box cutter. The rundown: Go out, get a job, get fired, get drunk, get with the town tramp, play the horses, go out, get a job, get fired, get with the town tramp, play the horses, etc. etc. \\"Factotum\\" is lots of fun for those who get a kick out of reading about bad behavior. Softies, go read something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chinaski's Work Blues","review":"This book brings to mind Post Office though Chinaski finds himself in less stable circumstances. The title refers indirectly to a worker who has had many occupations yet is a master of none. He seems to only stay with a job for about a month or two and then moves on to another one in another city without any aim other than drinking and womanizing. The menial jobs simply fund his habits. His sour outlook on living in gentle seem to touch on the very cords of drunken and sober reality. People move along like ants at some absurd tasks and very rarely do people question why this is so. Bukowski's books are generally in the vein of Factotum yet this particular novel seems to go well after reading Post Office."},{"rating":"2","title":"Factotum","review":"Bukowski has great images of the downtrodden and the lowlife but he offers little in the way of anecdotes for inhumanity except maybe drinking and bumming. After awhile one gets the feeling that being a victim is his excuse for affirming authenticity. Of course writing for him is a salvation though after awhile all these biographies of the down and out read the same. He gives some great graphic depictions of alcoholism but to me this doesn't equate with greatness in and of itself. I would add that full blown alcoholism is much worse for suffering than bukowski depicts. It is not some bohemian romance to see the end result of dependence as i do in healthcare. However, I think bukowski conveys quite chillingly the inhumanity that helps drive people to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terse, dispassionate, precise","review":"While this book supplied some material for both Barfly and the movie of the same name, one of the things that makes it unique to me is how it expresses a WWII America where so many men had gone to war that one man ends up taking on all jobs. Bukowski's style was at its best here, focused razor sharp. He does take some wish fulfillment liberties but it's possible it's intended as jab at good ol' Henry Miller. Lots of hilarious scenes, and a terse poignancy in the fate of an alienated wanderer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant. Buy this book and borrow it to you friends.","review":"This book, might turn people off in it's simplicity. But that's what Charles Bukowski novels are all about. A day in the life feel of a wandering man. Take it or leave. I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bukowski is a genius","review":"A classic book of the damned poet Bukowski. Not for people with a weak stomach or prudes. Chinaski (the alter-ego of Bukowski) hops from one job to another, one woman to another, and is steadily drunk.Some exceedingly realistic moments of the narration make you think that Bukowski has really been in that situation, or that he has a supreme imagination.Although a little repetitive at times, this book is a necessary read for people interested in the nature of the human soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but there are better Bukowski books out there","review":"I like this novel, but certain passages I felt like I read in other novels by Bukowski. It's a pleasure to read, but not as smooth as some of his other works. He basically goes from job to job, occasionally having a fling, getting drunk, or going to the track. If you're a Bukowski fan, buy this book only after you've read Post Office (dealing with a terrible job), Ham on Rye (childhood through adolescent), and Women (sex). Certain passages make this a must read - but other Bukowski books are better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Bukowski","review":"This is pretty typical Bukowski. As with most of what he wrote its supposed to be loosely based on his real life experiences. If you can get beyond his annoying habit of trying to convince you of how tough he is and exagerrating if not out and out lying about the frequency of his sexual encounters and the quality of the women involved then its a good quick read for a laugh. The best stuff in this is his humorous accounts of working various disposable menial jobs. Bukowski is very funny, a fact which seems to get lost in the shuffle by the lame hipsters who comprise the bulk of the fans of his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"HARD LIFE","review":"bukowski, one of the most interesting writers in the world , is my favorite writer.

I suppose they thought it would humanize the situation by including a REAL family with REAL problems.....meanwhile; the world is going up the big drain in the sky. I don't think petty little problems with smelly cars and ex-boyfriends rise to the same level as THE WORLD COMING TO AN END! This part of the movie didn't hold my interest for one minute.

Rated D+","review":"Well, they tried. If you could see the credits at the begining of the movie rather than at the end yould see that it was filmed in Lousiana by a small local production company. The result is less than mediocor. Peter Jurasic does do his usual excelent job of presenting a complex charicter for all three minutes he's on screen, but everyone else's performance is somewhere around the level of a highschool play. The idea of a quantum 'something' eating the earth and being saved at the last minute by a 'rain-man' with a nuclear missel which results in a time loop is interesting, but the sub plot of a highschool romance and a complete disregard of anything like real physics, coupled with a paint by numbers script leads me to give this movie only a D+, and that + only because it wasn't bad enough to make me angry that I watched it.

The title may throw some off track, but it's not potty humour from one of America's most beloved statesmen. The title instead alludes more to figurative reference regarding the social conditions of Dr. Franklin's day. In today's society where political correctness is reaching new, dizzying heights, it's refreshing to read such down to earth philosophy and witticism as pertinent now as it was then. This short, easy read I highly recommend to anyone. You'll find many hidden treasures in the 127 pages, and trust me, it's not what you think.....A tip of the cap to Carl Japikse, especially for the closing chapter \\"The Dream\\", told very much in the stylings of The Book of Revelations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well balanced, good sized handle, always sharp","review":"This is my 4th or 5th Shun.

They were a huge hit at first although she was a little nervous because they were so sharp. The problem is that it showed pitting in less than 1 month.

The message gets really bogged down though, with all this talk of \\"I did this...I did that....I'm Ben Franklin reincarnated...yadda yadda yadda\\". Hall ends up spending so much time off of the subject that it's easy to get lost and discouraged with reading this book. I'm glad if anyone finds something great in here, but I would have been happier with a shorter, leaner, and therefore, more effective version.

I thought I was buying an upper-end product and my contractor made me believe so. Not so. The one showerhead and tub faucet hold water (sometimes quite a bit) after being shut-off. They will then release the water in a few minutes to 1/2 hour. Frustrating when you squeegee the shower and it gets soaked again. The cartridges in both showers' handles have had to be replaced numerous times because of \\"banging/pounding\\" noise while using it. Now my plumber fixed them so that they are so tight and hard to turn that one of them actually squeaks as I attempt to turn the handle. It gets worse as time goes on.

My girls absolutely loved it and laughed out loud at Peter's adventures. They asked me to read it to their respective classes, and I did to my 4th grader's class. They got so attached to Peter that when I read his last story, they asked me if I could start over and read it to them again.

The boy is so silly, just like a idiot. The boy always daydreams and thinks something strange. Although I appreciate his creativity very much, he should dream something meaningful and useful.

Although it is impossible to describe everything that is happening in Mexico in just one movie, this film succeeds in that it touches the essential aspects of the war on drugs. What I like the most about his movie is the way it portrays how defenceless is the Mexican society (encarnated in Miss Bala) against the drug-lords' rampage. I really recommend this movie to any one who wants to have a glipse at the destructive war going on in Mexico because of the drugs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Film.","review":"This is a realistic, violent, and non-stop action film. The plot is also incredible, the actors make a very accurate portrayal of civilian life in Mexico's ongoing Narco wars. The film is in Spanish, but that should not deter anyone from watching it. As soon as the film's story begins to unfold, you'll find yourself ready to watch it the whole way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miss Bala","review":"Mexico's entry for this year's Best Foreign Language Film Oscar, Miss Bala is another one of those movies you probably haven't heard of, much less seen, unless you live in a major city. Loosely based on true events, the film follows a young Mexican beauty queen who becomes wrapped up with a gang of drug-runners as she competes for her crown. Though it received just a little buzz and opened for a short time in limited release, I found a lot to praise about the movie; it's a loaded film whose subject matter is already heavy, but is made even more powerful by some interesting directorial choices and an assured filmmaking style. Miss Bala is an unflinching, timely look at a side of Mexican culture much talked about but rarely explored in this fashion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie if you are interested in the Mexican Drug War","review":"This movie was very interesting. Using the lead character as a focal point, the movie brings in all the ingredients and players of the modern Mexican drug war.

How long did Charlie think he was going to have a hot time in the bed at night while he treated his new wife like dirt during the day? And the \\"I'm afraid to love\\" was a real turn-off. He never even seemed man enough to me to rate as a hero. At least the Cynster men could kick some serious a** so their struggles with love seemed macho. Charlie just seemed like a whining baby. Just because his father made bad decisions hadn't a thing to do with love in my book. He was just a weak man and left Althea to run the family. Sorry, Charlie, you just aren't grown up enough for me to lust after.And what was it with this book saying that Portia and Simon aren't married yet?

Considering all the dead political prisoners in Eastern Europe, however, there was a lot to be paranoid about. This book takes the view that the Soviets were all a bunch of fuzzy friendly folk, vilified by the nasty American. The author makes heros of spies who sold out this country. Its OK to poke fun at America, but, without us, this world would be a colder,more vicious place, and most authors who dared to make the least criticism of government in Communist countries are no longer breathing......"},{"rating":"1","title":"A good book to remain out of print.","review":"Even in 1992, there was considerable evidence that the CPUSA was an active arm of the Soviet state operating within the United States, and material almost simultaneously coming from Soviet archives has proven it. Red scare fears were frequently misdirected, but that is not the same as being imaginary. While it is true that this book is not meant to be history as such, its snidely ignorant tone destroys what fun there might have been in its content. Those actually interested in the period might start with the documentary works by John Earl Haynes et al, and leave Mr. Barson's in the dustbin of history where it belongs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap and cheerful","review":"These earbuds are cheap, nice looking and have reasonably good sound. I usually fall asleep to music which means that I go through a lot of earbuds. At the same time, I'm very demanding of sound quality. So I need buds that are cheap enough to be expendable, but not the lousy sound of typical cheap earbuds that are either boomy or deficient in bass and shrill or dull in the high end.

Just to warn you the smell off the bottle might give you the wrong impression but once you wear it, in about 5 min you'll start smelling like how its suppose to smell. It starts of very strong and becomes spicy and ends kinda sweet (not too fond of that thou). This would indubitably in my top 5 colognes to wear. You can wear this anywhere from work to parties.

These must be the pre-rehab years for Ringo, as \\"It Don't Come Easy\\" must mean remembering the lyrics. And Ravi Shankar, though a hit in India, was only liked by westerners if they had what Ringo was having. That said -Clapton gives a great performance, George Harrison shows emotion in his playing as well as having fun with his mates, and Bob Dylan's performance is as good as he gets. Leon Russell and Billy Preston show why they were every bit as good as showmen as they were sought after studio musicians (too bad John didn't make it, but he was SO full of himself).George was the unsung Beatle and I for one truly miss him."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book","review":"I'm a college student, and I ordered a bunch of these books for the men's small group that I attend, and all of us can agree that we're learning a lot.

The writing is superb. I found myself outraged at the indignities suffered by Jews in the 1970's Soviet Union; tormented within their own country but not permitted to leave. There is an historical thread woven throughout the trials of the main characters. This book is strongly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic dialogue and watercolors","review":"Little Cliff does not want to go to school; he enjoys being with his great-grandparents and living with them along the Mississippi delta. He also feels he will miss his playtime activities, including climbing trees. Upset, Cliff tries to hide, but his great-grandmother discovers him and takes him to school. When Cliff sees other children his age playing baseball at school, he realizes he can have fun and learn at the same time.Realistic dialogue and watercolors combine to form a picture of Cliff and his surroundings. Taulbert's text will require parents to read along with their children, as it is lengthy. Children, however, will identify immediately with Lewis' paintings. His use of shading and true-to-life proportions gives the illustrations a sense of purpose that children will recognize right away. While the story is good, it is ultimately Lewis' expressive and lifelike artwork that makes this book a recommendation for any library collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Color is very pink -- not a good fit","review":"Some sites show this bra (#4434) in body blush/pink as looking like nude or taupe.

The UML aspect of the book is very weak and Java is given only a cursory treatment.The (obviously) older material is well presented and well referenced as chapter end notes but newer topics such as Extreme Programming (Beck), Refactoring (Fowler), etc. are absent from discussion completely.If you're looking for a good UML book try \\"UML Distilled\\" (Fowler) which provides a succint overview of the topic in considerably fewer pages.

Yet, in the fast-moving world of computers, he has neglected much networking, any mention of open source software, any mention of bazaar-style development, any depth of databases, thoughts of providing services, recognition of abstraction layers beyond machine code--source code--operating-system, any development of design patterns, and much UML and Java.The code samples and anecdotes provide little insight to issues that modern computer engineers need to deal with. The writing is wordy without being precise or complete. The references are antiquated and unimportant. The questions demand only regurgitation, neither thinking nor reflection."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Java","review":"Do not be fooled by the title. No Java in this book.

I have no worries about the product shifting around. I do recommend being careful when placing the foam, I would imagine it would be very hard to remove and reposition.As far as performance it did seem to reduce the noise level coming from my dishwasher but not to a level that it doesn't disturb tv viewing or quiet conversation. It may take further steps such as a exterior wrapping to attain the level I desire.I was also planning on using the leftover amount to quiet a HTPC, but the foam was too thick for my case and I didn't want to impede any fans/airflow.I would recommend this product to others as it seems to be well made and may provide them with the results they desire depending on the application."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Color in Pic","review":"Picture depicts this as BLACK.

While I did not try it on any 1981+ Fords, I'd have to assume it'd work for them since that's the only other vehicle listed.Aside from them not working for my application, overall the product quality is not the best. Remember, it's plastic. Anyone who has done work with spring couplings will know that these won't last. If you're getting them for a one time fix (why I got these), they're good enough and cheap. Anything more than that, go with a better quality tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Poor Quality","review":"This product is of extremely poor quality.

It is very convenient and neat as well as easy to fill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made","review":"To pay over $40 for this product is ridiculous.

This product is the biggest disappointment i have experienced with Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks and works great. Wish the material was stronger","review":"I love the way this looks. I have little space in my apt. so its design was perfect to clear up some much needed space. It stores a pretty large amount (one full standard bottle you find in the supermarket) and the concept is really cool of being able to measure 1/4 tsps with a click. I don't like that in order to fill the container, you kind of have to rip off the top. The container is made of plastic and if I'm not careful I feel like I may be able to crack it. Also, if you load cinnamon in it, it leaks. I still like this product a lot since I rarely use cinnamon and I know how to be gentle loading it. I even bought a second one a few weeks later in order to stack it on top."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrific gift for a cook/chef!","review":"My friend was ecstatic when she opened up this present from me at the holidays.

It served it's purpose. U-Turn is a tour de force. \\"Everybody Smokes in Hell\\" is a novel. If James Ellroy had a sense of humor and forgot about his mother for a couple of hundred pages, he just might be able to write a book like this. Ridley wants to be a noir writer and he has succeeded. Los Angeles seems to affect people with an inordinate amount of hostility. I'm certainly glad that Ridley's is on paper and not with a gun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ridley Just Keeps Getting Better","review":"I've been a fan of John Ridley's work since I read his first book, \\"Stray Dogs.\\" His follow-up, \\"Love is a Racket\\" was even better. And now he tops himself with \\"Everybody Smokes in Hell.\\" Anyone who lives in L.A. can tell you how hilariously, horrifically, and ultimately tragically true this book is. This guy is the real thing, with a style to kill for and vision to match."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Writing -- Poor Story","review":"The critics are correct; Ridley IS a talented writer with a gift for certain character styles. The sad thing about this book is that the wonderful writing is overshadowed by an awful plot and characters you more than likely won't care about. Some writers make the mistake of having a good story and writing it poorly, expecting the plot to make up for it. Ridley has done the opposite, and expected his gifted writing to make up for a predictable, asinine, unengaging plot. There are no twists, exactly what you think is going to happen does, and the feeling you have after reading this book will be the same as binging on junk food. It tastes good at first, but as soon as you're done, you'll wonder why the hell you bothered."},{"rating":"1","title":"LAZY WRITING","review":"After a promising start, this book was pretty disappointing. I think he made it up as he went along. The only surprises or so-called twists are a few highly unlikely coincidences he needed to drive the story forward. No apparent effort to give depth to the characters or layers to the plot. He should stick to movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE DEVIL AT PLAY","review":"What if the devil ruled the world and you could watch him at play. That's what it's like reading this novel. I've never had so much fun reading about bad things happening to bad people. Frankly, I don't think I've ever had this much fun reading a noir novel before. The amazing thing is that Ridley takes the kinds of characters we've seen before and puts a whole new spin on them. The story keeps going and going right up until - AND THEN PAST - the end. Is there something wrong with me to love this kind of book so much?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Everybody Just Smokes","review":"This book serves as an interesting read and is well prosed, but Ridley flat out drops the ball with the plot. Predictable, amusing, cute, whatever you want to call it; you've sen one Tarnatino you've seen 'em all. Benjamin Franklin once said \\"The learned fool has the ability to express his nonsense to the unlearned, but in the end it is still nonsense.\\" I will give Ridley props on one thing, that Brice chick got me going."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not like I'm particularly picky...","review":"This book irritated me greatly.

When I first looked through them I noticed that they seemed really dark and narrow. When I found my other pair(8x20) I noticed that the Vivitar binoculars let less light in when they should have let more than double the light pass through. I also saw how narrow the field of view on these binoculars really was when I was able to compare them to my old pair. These binoculars are not worth anyones money. Buy used or save your money to get a good pair of binoculars.

I was surprised that a Vivitar product would perform so poorly."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible quality","review":"My 8 year old son got this product as a present from a friend for his birthday. While they look very impressive at a first glance, I have never seen and could not have imagined that binoculars can be as bad in both material quality and construction design. We've owned this for less than a day and the plastic frame has already got two small cracks in it - even though they have not been dropped and were handled VERY carefully. This is the worst quality plastic normally reserved for cheap chinese toys. Furthermore, both eyepieces are fixed via a loose screw in the middle and their wobble disrupts focus first and collinearity second. No adjustment of the screw helps since eyepieces are bigger diameter than the tubes they're fit on anyways. The focus adjustment is not smooth and when I try to adjust the single eyepiece focus, the eyepiece just unscrews and falls out.Bacically, DON'T EVER BUY THESE BINOCULARS!!! They're not a bargain but a waste of your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A piece of junk at ANY price!","review":"My assessment after only ten minutes:I was able to get a very clear, focussed image rather easily. However, it's VERY poorly constructed! The left eyepiece came loose and cannot be secured again, and the \\"eyecup\\" to which the manual refers is non-existent (eyeglass wearers are supposed to be able to roll them down for better field of view). All four lens covers were so loose as to fall off easily (thus could easily get lost), and the strap was thin, cheap, and already frayed. And a small cap was missing entirely - the one that covers the pivoting screw for the eyepieces.A piece of junk...."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I knew going into Walgreens that these were not going to be the best quality, so I don't feel to bad that I only spent $9.99 on them. Vivitar is not know for any great quality. They work fine for just general viewing during the day and evening. The quality is subpar. They are hard to focus since the focus adjustment seems to stick and they use plastic parts on them. The carry strap is so cheap that it was frayed on the ends and the strap keepers do not work. I like the pouch and the feel of the optics. These are fine to keep in your car, tool box, take to a ball game etc...If you dont care about price or if they get banged around, these are for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this........","review":"This \\"thing\\" it's not worth a single dollar.I got for US$ 9.99 but the price should've been .99 cents. and free shipping.If you can believe, EVEN the lint free cloth to clean the lens has a LOT of lint on it.At least to say something positive, THE PLASTIC/RUBBER IS BLACK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Junk","review":"Stay away from any of these rubber binoculars. I ordered the Vivitar, got Emerson instead, but they all look the same. These binoculars have coated lenses. That's the dumbest thing I ever heard of. You get 50 mm binoculars instead of 35 mm to get more light, for use in astronomy or low light conditions. Making dark glasses out of the lenses defeats that purpose. ALSO, I found I cannot focus these. Since shipping costs almost as the product, I am not returning them, but will put them in the recycle bin. First, and now last, thing I've bought from Amazon in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm almost speechless","review":"I bought this DVD at the recommendation of an opera-loving friend. I knew nothing about it, so I found a plot synopsis on the web (there are no notes at all, just a list of sections). Well, wow. This is a powerful work...the music reminds me of Wagner, except a human Wagner, with real people and emotions, instead of gods. In fact, and this will enrage Wagnerians I suppose, I think there is more honest emotion in Act II of this opera than in the entire ring cycle. The acting is believable and the singing is fine. Anja Silja as the mother is riveting. The only reason I don't give it five stars is that I think the sound recording is a bit tinny, and it's not a live performance.

The author may have a good sense of humor, but the book is not very funny. I can tell what the jokes are, but they're not laugh-out-loud kind of jokes. It gets pretty dull after a while. The characters are also too two-dimensional. Even after 90 pages, I couldn't figure out how the main character is really like. She seems mature for the most part but she occasionally says very childish things. I'm guessing that there's also some self-insert.Overally, not a very good book.

She develops the whole story around this obssession,and it makes for some great surprises. The main character was also very likable and different from the general main character-she's thoughtful and seems to value friendship.

It's called the Derby Owners Club World Edition. We were very interested in finding a game similar to that one and heard about this game. Although this game is ok it's just not what I expected. It's not to say that this isn't a great game it's just not exactly what I was hoping it would be. Its a bit more difficult than I imagined and it was just not what I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"I've had the itch to buy a good horse racing game ever since I re-installed the PC version of Final Stretch. As I am into the \\"empire building\\" of Sim-type games, and used to PC-type \\"empire building\\" games, I have to say that I find Gallop Racer lacking in that department.You don't really start from rags and work your way up...you just pick any horse you like. And that goes for racing as a jockey and breeding. Don't like that at all.My criticism may be a bit unfair, and predefined because I have never liked the \\"cartoonish\\", \\"anime-type\\" presentation of PS, PS2's, and Nintendo games. So for those of you who are used to playing PlayStation and Nintendo games, this game will have no affect on you.As for me, this game just reaffirms my love for PC Sims through and through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great graphics, fun game.","review":"I had a lot of fun playing this game. The graphics are a lot better than most other horse games I've played and the makers of the game did a good job. It's mostly about breeding a better horse but I really liked the fact that every horse has a different running style and the horses gain more speed etc when you ride them really good. The game gets kind of boring after you win the Dream Cup and Dream Series special races and unlock everything though but it takes a while to get there and there's still breeding for the elusive white horse. Racing over and over again can also get kind of boring and so does the fact that you can only race one horse at a time so I gave it a 4 for fun. The game itself though is definitely 5 stars. It gives you everything but training (in a way). You can breed your horses (you can own up to 100), race them, bet and you have a free mode you can customize horses in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stylish","review":"This is my second one. First one I bought 5 years ago. Between the sun in AZ and LA and the oil in my hands, it faded the Saints name and logo but the leather never was damaged. This one seems like a better leather to grip and the logo/name seem to be better with this leather. I assume I'll get another 5 years or even longer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice, but Kin nicer looking","review":"I have a Shun Santoku, and it is very nice -- a good, sharp cutting knive. However, I have found something even better for roughly the same cost -- a Kin. The Kin is more decorative, just as sharp, and offers that extra cache of owning a smaller brand (more exclusive). Try a Kin --[...]-- and get Amazon to carry them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blade chips easily","review":"This knife is very sharp and holds an edge reasonably well. Japanese-style blades really do cut more sharply than western-style ones; this one was a pleasure to work with. However, the steel used for this blade chips very easily. I've had this knife for about two years and at this point it's pretty much beyond saving. I've had it professionally re-sharpened several times, but it has chips up and down the edge of the blade. I baby my knives (a half dozen Henkels, a couple of Wusthofs, and one Global) and this is the only knife I've had this problem with.If you're on the market for this style knife look instead at Global."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharp!","review":"This knife has been used for everything and I find it invaluable! Right out of the box it was sharp, sharp and extremely sharp! I bought this knife kind of sight unseen. However, I have found it fits nicely in my hand and is easy to control! I have enjoyed using it so much that I have bought six more Shun knives as a Christmas present to myself! I don't think it can be overstated how important it is to have a good knife that fits your hand well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great knifes","review":"These knifes are amazing, we have 6 now, slowly building our set, worth the money! Everyone should own a good set of kitchen knifes."},{"rating":"2","title":"nana","review":"Excellent knife. Fits your hand for comfort and great size for lots of prep work! I have had other knives but have found that the Shun knives are the best. They remain sharp if properly maintained. They are easy to clean and maintain. Would highly recommend this knife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharp Kitchen knife","review":"This chef knife is sharp, very sharp. Not much to say, it is beautiful and will do what it's meant for, but I guess you could get a slightly better knife (MAC MTH-80 8\\" Chef's Knife w/ Dimples) for a bit less. Not as fancy but also very sharp and a better balance in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"no complaints","review":"received this knife as a gift a couple years back. so far i have no complaints. the edge is sharp and keeps its edge for a good period of time. the knife looks awesome and it has served me well over the years. the best thing about it is the free sharpening service that Shun provides. just send the knife back to the factory and they will return it to you freshly sharpened back to the original edge. overall a solid knife"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shun Classic 7-Inch Santoku Hollow Ground Knife","review":"great knife for any type of chef or cook. 7 in. blade is not to big, and doesn't feel small in your hands. comes with the best factory edge out there. razor sharp right out of the box! easy to maintain, great all round knife, feels great in any kitchen, at home or at work. recommend buying a cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"good knife","review":"as a chef I will say shun is the best knife in the world bought this knife for my friend and she loves it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Got rusty after using 3 month.

In fact I have read 90% of her books. Year after year I look forward to her upcoming published works. Mastering Lady Lucinda is vulgar and crude and not up to her usual standard. Surely there is more than one way to describe intercourse without using the \\"four letter\\" word over and over. This book lacks imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot, hot, hot hot!","review":"I look forward to reading Bertrice Small, Susan Johnson, Thea Devine, and Robin Schone's novels as I do no others. Their works are fresh, memorable, and most of all, HOT! Considering the last effort made by these authors in an anthology, Captivated, Fascinated is sure to be the cream of this month's crop of books! This book is worth five stars definitely!"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars for Schone's story alone","review":"4 novellas, 1 book. All good sex. But Robin Schone's is a true winner--both poignant and erotic, by far the most memorable. It made me immediately get online and look for more of her works. As for the other stories, although arousing and entertaining, none struck such a chord. Bertrice's is the kinkiest--wow! Susan's left me with unanswered questions--what was the hero's dark side all about? why did he have the need to sexually dominate? He proposed after one night of really hot (and sometimes angry, which makes me uncomfortable)sex with a stranger and I was turning the page looking for everything to blow up, and then get resolved--but the story was over! Thea's characters were not the most likeable, but otherwise it was fine. Oh, but Robin's story! It haunts me! I've ordered her \\"The Lover\\" and I can't wait to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Erotica or Nausea?","review":"Within the first story a character, a clergyman, admits to behaving sexually with his sisters. If that's not enough to turn you away from this book I don't know what is. There is erotica and then there is nausea."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"FASINATED\\" BY BERTRICE SMALL,SUSAN JOHNSON,THEA DEVINE, ROB","review":"OUT OF ALL THE STORIES I READ, \\"MASTERING LUCINDA\\" WAS THE BEST, WHILE \\"RISKING IT ALL \\" WAS THE SHORTEST OF THEM ALL. THESE FOUR WRITERS EACH HAVE WRITTEN THE BEST OF EROTIC NOVELS THAT I HAVE EVER READ. I JUST WISH I COULD GIVE EVERYONE OF THESE FINE WRITERS 10 STARS INSTEAD OF 5, JUST BECAUSE THEY DESERVE IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"More erotic than videos and the male can read to you-Wow!","review":"I have the entire collection of these books and this definitely puts you in the mood for 'bubble baths and champagne', hot oil massages, and just 'bed time reading' to each other. It's more romantic than porn and more sensual than looking at pictures from books. You get into the character and let your mind and body just go with the nuance the writer sets the stage for. It's not for just casual sex but relationships and it helps rekindle feelings you may have misplaced. You fall inlove all over again! I've loved everything I've ever read by Bertrice Small and when these books starting coming out, I bought to collect. They could be used by 'sex therapist' or for anyone who is having a difficult time in an intimate relationship. There's always the chance the other doesn't want to seek help or feel any is needed. That's when you get out of the relationship as it is dragging you down. This is just my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating steamy short stories","review":"B Small is not a fav. I state that up front. While the weakest of the 4 offered here lets be honest this is erotica ladies and Small delivers here . Not nearly as offensive with her feminine portrayals as she usually is. The other comment I have to offer is that R. Schones offering is my personal fav. I disagree with those who were put off by the ages of the couple involved, and the depressing aspect. I thought the story (which continues the story of a character offered in \\"The Ladys Tutor\\" quite different and at times beautiful. Remarkable for a short story. Particularly Erotic Romance"},{"rating":"1","title":"this book seems to be missing something","review":"Bertrice Small's and Robin Schone's stories were the only ones that were decent read's in this book. I think that it is very hard to develop the sense of being in the book when the stories are short. I feel like there is some plot and character development the ends up left out to make the story shorter; I will so that these stories are hot and if you like to turn up the AC and steam-up the bathroom then you will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your time or money","review":"This is absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen. The production quality was horrendous - much worse quality than any day time soap, far worse than that of any made for TV movie that I have ever seen. The writing and script were cheesy, at best. Even if it had been well acted, I doubt it could have made any improvement in the movie whatsoever. Don't even think about watching this movie. Certainly you have something better to do with your time and money. (I gave it one star only because it wouldn't take my review with no stars.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Textbook of Ve...ter...inar...y....Zzzz....Zzzz...Zzzz","review":"This text was a required book in my first year vet anatomy course. I must say, the pictures and diagrams are only adequate. Meanwhile, the actual text itself was laborious to read and so full of jargon and unnecessary detail that it literally gave me a splitting headache each time I attempted to read it. Please, please, if this is not a required textbook, don't buy it! There are much better anatomy texts out there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful read","review":"You will find it hard to put this book down. I'm considering reading it again and reviewing my highlighted paragraphs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat Disappointed","review":"I received the book, I was disappointed on how yellow the pages were. Is this book really that old or was it not taken care of? I have started reading, but have not finished, so far so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly Silly Silly Book","review":"I wasn't even going to write a review until I stopped and read some of the reviews for this book already online. This book is simplistic and silly. Joan Anderson comes off as a pretentious and giddy middle-aged person who I don't think learned a thing from her time with Joan Erikson other than to throw out some words of wisdom. I would like to know more about Erikson after reading this book, but I wish that Anderson would just get over herself and stop thinking that her words and experiences really matter - she herself questions her own authority often in the book and rightly so, she's an overdramatic, silly woman. If you have absolutely nothing better in the world to do for 20 minutes, read this book - but don't buy it - I'll send you mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed","review":"I'm sorry, but I thought that both women in the book, Joan Anderson and Joan Erikson, were not only uninteresting but also annoying. Joan Anderson struck me as totally self-centered, and Joan Erikson as too \\"cutesy\\" and even conceited. I find it hard to believe that weaving little pieces of cloth using colors to represent life stages would so suddenly unlock the mystery of Joan A's life. Reminds me of adult \\"Brownies\\" . . . Too cutesy for me. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring!","review":"I love this book! Once I started it, I could not put it down. Joan Anderson introduces us to a truly phenomenal woman in Joan Erickson. Both Joans have questions about life and purpose that reflects the different stages of life they are in. Joan A. asks questions that many women at midlife have, and Joan E is reflective on a life well lived. Joan Erickson is an amazing woman, someone we all want to be when we grow up. She proves that life is about living fully, playfully and with vibrant intent. I recommend this book to all the women I work with."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I enjoyed Joan's first two books, but this one was a disappointment. I don't see that Joan Erikson really helped Joan Anderson become her own person. Instead, Anderson often seemed childlike in her relationship with Erikson, allowing Erikson's voice to be more powerful than her own. Surely Anderson is mature enough to know whether she wants to cut her hair, and doesn't need Erikson to dictate what she should wear to a business meeting! Erikson may have had some valuable words of wisdom, but a true mentor honors who you are and encourages you to become your truest self without projecting their own preferences."},{"rating":"2","title":"FROM A FAN","review":"This author is one of my favorite women writers and I have read all of her books. I hope she writes many more. A wonderfully talented lady."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consistently Motivating","review":"Each book ~ although different in their own way ~ continues to be truly amazing. They are motivating, endearing and engaging. Joan feels like a dear old friend, yet I'm discovering about myself !"},{"rating":"2","title":"great !!","review":"The item I had ordered was exactly as described word for word and had arrived very quickly. Would buy from this seller again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Walk Worth Taking","review":"Anderson's latest literary work is one of her best to date. Full of imagery, humor, and wisdom, A Walk on the Beach will touch your senses and awaken your true self in ways you thought might not happen. As her mentor, Joan Erikson reminded the author, the importance of continuing to learn, grow, change and play as one ages, as well as to be surprised by life and where it leads are the keys to a fulfilling and enriching life. Not just for women, it is a book for all who struggle at times with thoughts and feelings of purpose and significance.Also recommended: Year by the Sea: Thoughts of an Unfinished Woman by Joan Anderson An Unfinished Marriage by Joan Anderson Wisdom and the Senses: The Way of Creativity by Joan M. Erikson"},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny, trite, and you've heard it all before","review":"Joan Erikson is the magical old lady who spouts platitudes and wears funny straw hats to help the poor Joan Anderson deal with the privilege of having a mid-life crisis in a lovely beach house. They weave tapestries that represent life stages with different colors and they bond with seals. Their first meeting involves bits of wisdom about fog, and growing old, and being carefree, and nowhere do either of these women speak like real human beings, at least not human beings you don't want to smack or run far away from. The book is cloying and tries way too hard to be fraught with deep meaning. Poorly written and insulting to the intelligence, the middle-aged, and the elderly. There's nothing real or revolutionary about any of them. Two stars because I did manage to get through the whole thing but that's probably due to more to my book club than the book itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-centered, whiney...","review":"This author came highly recommended. What a disappointment. I read several of her books and found them to be whiney and self-centered. Really enjoyed the stories about her mentor...the author should stick to writing children's books. Boring for adults..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Theology of Liberation","review":"Serious reading. An indepth look at a complex topic, well-written and documented. Seventy-five pages of notes on the text, most helpful. Pages of biblical references. You'll feel that you have a good understanding of the topic. The book was not light reading for me, but it is well worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the lesbian scenes?","review":"What the heck is going on here? When you make a film about a cloistered nun and the cover picture even shows a nun apparently putting the moves on a younger woman, you expect at least one good lesbian scene! But this film doesn't have any! How can that possibly be?The beautiful young woman in the photo is the newest nun in the convent, and several of the older nuns cast covetous gazes in her direction as she removes her stylish clothing to change into her nun's habit. One slightly older nun in particular shows an interest in her, and later even tries to seduce the girl, but nothing comes of it as the girl refuses to comply. We also see a brief glimpse into this older nun's room where she happens to be entertaining another (nude) younger woman, but again we don't really see anything but that brief glance.Again, why make a film about a beautiful young novice surrounded by older women and then not include a single good lesbian scene? I don't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"fooled again by the packaging...!","review":"Although the young female star of this film is extremely attractive...Capt. Freaky is very disappointed in this Italian 'farce'!There are no lesbian scenes, no hetero-sex either...this film barely makes it past PG-13. The fact that it was released on to DVD should have never occurred. What is the point of '70's Euro Sexplotation films if they don't exploit?I gave it two stars....one for each of the young actresses incredibly beautiful (natural) breasts.Otherwise...the story gets \\"0\\" stars from me. It lets you down on every level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vastly overrated","review":"I owned a pair of the smooth leather Rainbows and loved them for two years, until the leather began to rub away to the spongy center layer. I tried the premier leather version, but they felt like wearing cardboard. The straps aren't soft enough to stretch and mold to your feet. Stick with the smooth leather version, or buy Reefs. They tend to be cushier and easier to break in."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love these flip flops!","review":"These rainbows are my favorite flip flops!! They are so comfy and arn't over-priced!

My only complaint is, they are horrible to break in. I made the mistake of buying them in winter right before going on a cruise. They were the only sandals I brought and I was literally hobbling around the ship and ports. By the end of the week they were great but it took a lot of pain and a severely indented big toe to get there.Also, the color is a bit darker than the picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these!","review":"Ive been looking for a basic brown flip flop and I found these and love them!

However, the inside of the strap was sewn incorrectly and caused blisters, to the point I had to remove them and walk barefoot. Amazon's return policy was easy, but these were inferior quality and should never have been sold as new.

I have no problem with mine and neither does my partner or friends. matter of fact, my partner has been wearing the same pair since 2002 and they still are not torn in any way. I don't know what to do to resolve the issue I have with this seller. All I want is a replacement pair for my sister. How embarrassing it is for a pair of Rainbows given as a birthday gift to come apart in a month and the seller avoid you!

Thank you Epic, KLRU TV and Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD for the memories of SRV","review":"This DVD brings back the essential SRV. I first saw him on Austin City Limits, and after seeing it a second time on DVD, we forget how crafted a Blues guitar player he was. As for the review by \\"stratocaster4life\\", not everyone can play blues guitar. Maybe you are so gifted you can play better than BB King, SRV, Steve Vai or Satriani. My guess is you can't. I agree with some of your guitar gods such as Via and Satriani. I saw them both live. But Malmsteen? He is all technique and no feelings. Blues guitar comes from passion and heart. I play a little guitar...I'm really a keyboard player that has played with many guitar players. Anyone can be fast, flashy and bending the whamming bar. Blues style is can't be taught."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great footage of a true Blues master.","review":"Pay no attention to the 80's hairband moron who wrote the bad review.

The first three songs, pulled from early in his career shine the best and are classic stevie. Most of this compilation is from Stevie's last perfomance at Austin City limits, and the material is just as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"S.R.V and D.T rock Austin","review":"A very good video giving a snap shot of the man in action. The video shows Stevie in 1983 and you can see that he is nervous and still suffering from substance abuse - you can tell and even feel that he is nervous just by watching him stand in front of the mic, sweating with his eyes closed so as not to see the crowd watching him. He still gives a damn good performance. Then the video shows the band in 1989 when they are all sobered up, Stevie is a lot more confident as he looks at and talks to the crowd and his playing has improved a hell of a lot. One thing I do find very annoying is the voice over introduction for the 1983 and 89 performances I feel they should have canned that idea as would rather have just had a subtitle appear than have a voice over. All this aside BUY THIS VIDEO!!! it is well worth it even with these slight annoyances. END"},{"rating":"2","title":"SRV and Double Trouble at their best!","review":"This is the one video that will show you how talented and gifted SRV and Double Trouble were. The high quality in these two appearances on Austin City Limits makes it clear how much energy and life Stevie Ray Vaughn put in to playing the guitar and singing. From standard blues to awesome rock and roll electric guitar playing, you can feel the energy flowing out of these musicians. Listening to Double Trouble tear through their songs will inspire you to get your axe and head to the woodshed, or go out and buy your first guitar. Forget about the Grammys they won, the recordings with David Bowie, gold records, etc: this video will get you excited about the blues and music all over again! END"},{"rating":"2","title":"A New editing is needed","review":"Not too long ago, Austin City Limits played a show of all the SRV \\"outtakes\\" that were not originally aired, such as \\"Couldn't Stand The Weather\\", \\"Mary Had A Little Lamb\\" and \\"Superstition. Somewhere, somebody needs to get the original SRV release and mix it together with the outtakes for a complete DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great performance. Poor audio quality!","review":"I enjoy the music of Stevie Ray Vaughn but this DVD was a big disappointment. The preformance was very good but the audio quality was Very Poor!!In 2 previous reviews, one agreed with me about the poor audio quality and the next that said how good this sounds, particularly on his 5.1 dolby digital player. I wish I would have understood the tech notes. This is not recorded in dolby digital 5.1. It is recorded in dolby 2.0. There is a Big difference! We tried listening to it as 5.1 dolby, Pro Logic, and straight stereo. None sounded good.If a superior recording engineer can bring this baby back to life, I would absolutely want to own it. But until that time, it remains on the shelf gathering dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"When a god walked the earth","review":"I stumbled across SRV when I serendipitously tuned into the 1983 Austin City Limits concert featured on the first part of this video. Suffice it to say that the earth moved. I bought Double Trouble's albums (yeah, back then they were vinyl) and talked about them to anyone who would listen. Then I happened to catch the last Austin C.L. appearance, as well. Pure magic, and how happy Stevie looked, what rapport he had with the audience. God, he was great. I tell my kids: There were three guitar gods: Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Eric Clapton ... but the greatest of these was Stevie Ray. Just bought and watched this video, and it brought all the amazement back. There was nothing Stevie could not do with that guitar. I also hadn't realized how wonderful his voice was, too... husky and pleading and soulful. Why, oh why, did he have to leave us so young? RIP."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute must have for lovers of blues and rock guitar.","review":"The two concerts show the growth of a true guitar legend. The DVD will become a classic. Stevie Ray Vaughan is right up there with the likes of Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, etc. The DVD just blew me away. I would recommend it to all lovers of the guitar. The sound quality may not be technically perfect, as some say, but I didn't notice it at all. Stevie Ray's playing overcame all of that. If you can get your hands on a copy buy it and enjoy the late great master Stevie Ray Vaughan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A legend captured on video","review":"Excellent audio for a video format. Every SRV fan should see this....too bad that HDTV didn't exist when this was filmed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Produced by chimps?","review":"This is the most badly produced concert of any sort I have ever seen on any medium in my life. To say the sound is brutal is giving it too much credit. I give it 2 stars because it's SRV, and I am a big fan. However, if I had produced this I would be too embarassed to release it. It doesn't say much for those who take credit for the production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong songs!","review":"I watched the DVD and was immediately disappointed. I saw the original two performances in 1983 and 1989 (on TV of course). His second performance in 1989 was far more powerful. His rendition of Voodoo Chile was somewhat tame in the 1983 episode that you get on this DVD whereas the 1989 performance was his best ever. Even better than the El Macombo. This was not on the DVD of course. This DVD is a typical Sony ripoff. Until they give the entire 1989 performance on DVD, Live from the El Macombo is the best example of SRV's genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"The two times I met SRV....","review":"If you are in my age group, you may remember watching the 1983 airing of Austin city limits, In the pre 10,000 channel days of TV. I was in high school, and saw a guitar player for the first time, who took my breath away...nobody did VooDoo-Chile!...Voodoo was sacred ground. Stevie not only played it, he respected it. WHAT A THRILL! The 1989 show showed a refined, matured, and best of all clean Stevie, at the top of his game. His facial expressions that were part of his playing were there, but now mixed with alot of smiles. What an Impact SRV made on people, players, and music in America. This is one of the Best Vid's out there, for the music, the guitar player, or the inspiration to transform your life. If I had to have one SRV video, this is it! The video work, camera shots & editing are superb. Double Trouble needs recognition here too, ALL superb players and again at the top of their game. THANKS FOR THE MEMORIES!! RIP Stevie, \\"will see ya in the next one.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"SRV is worth the trip!","review":"The live from Austin concerts show how Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble changed over the years in their playing and in their music. The scorching \\"Voodoo Chile\\" in '83 and the slow ballad \\"Riviera Paradise\\" in '89 are highlights. If you love Stevie Ray Vaughan, or just like a good show, this video is definitely worth a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"An education in blues.","review":"I'm a jazz newbie but a long time \\"guitarist\\" fan. This disc \\"smoked\\" on my Yamaha receiver with 90 watt subwoofer using the Dolby digital mode. Thinking about the loss of this artist before I got to appreciate his work brought a tear. Another aircraft loss for the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"More lousy products!","review":"The audio on this disk is absolutely terrible! The worst I have heard yet on a DVD. It is also just part of two different performances. Why didn't they include both complete shows from Austin City Limits?"},{"rating":"1","title":"bla","review":"why are you praising this guy so much? he was just playing the blues! anyone can do that now-a-days! i thought the dvd was boring and was another blues artist. big freakin' deal!you want some real guitar master, search for steve vai, joe satriani, yngwie malmsteen, john petrucci, tony mcalpine, etc... these are the true guitar gods!lets be real here, the dvd was crap. don't waste your money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stevie Ray Vaughan live at Austin Texas","review":"This DVD is not as long as the one done from El Mocambo in Canada,but is does show what a great breadth he has. I think he takes \\"Vodoo Chile'\\" to a different level, and the entire DVD shows him doing what he does best, making realy good music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is true ART","review":"We will never see his likes again. His playing was as natural as breathing. He could play for a continuous hour and never hit the same lick twice. A perfect artist of improvisation. RIP Stevie."},{"rating":"2","title":"must have for SRV afficianados","review":"Too short overall, but every song on this DVD is a keeper. Wish they had a few more (how could they not put \\"Couldn't Stand the Weather\\" on there?). If you're looking to comp a few of his licks, it's a great tool (just remember to detune a half step if you want to play along). You can always hear his emotions on his recordings; on this DVD, you can see it too. I don't know how a guy can put that much vibrato on a guitar strung with .13s, but it's amazing to see up close. And how many guitarists can cover Hendrix and blow it away? See \\"Voodoo Chile\\" and \\"Little Wing\\"...."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],x={key:0},H={key:1};function R(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",B,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),b(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",H,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",x,"See more"))],8,M)):p("",!0)])}const W=d(O,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-33372366"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/46.md","filePath":"sponsor/46.md"}'),N={name:"sponsor/46.md"},P=Object.assign(N,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{j as __pageData,P as default};
