Both of the Clintons are a disgrace to this wonderful country that they care little or nothing about! God forbid if she ever achives her goal \\"The Plan\\", and actually becomes the first woman president! The many many references on how she squashes any oposition to her \\"enemies\\" are truly frighting.

When it mentioned a \\"Gallop poll\\" instead of \\"Gallup\\" as it is supposed to be spelled, I put it down.

These ratings obviously reflect the political attitudes of the reviewers. Yes, some of the book's narration reflects the author's philosophy about Hillary, but then again, these comments also reflect a summary of what the author has experienced over many years of watching HC. This book reminds us of the MANY scandals HC was involved in and the high-flying arrogance. We've heard most of these stories before, through the years, but to read an accumulation of her lies and manipulations is shocking. It's a book where you continually say, \\"Oh, my gosh, did she really do that?\\" Her control of people, even long-time Senators, is scarey."},{"rating":"1","title":"too biased!","review":"The author did no research but repackaged other works and added inflammatory and biased comments.The book had some interesting stories but mainly too much space was spent slamming Senator Clinton.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Waste of Time!","review":"I, too, was looking for an unbiased book about Hilary Clinton. I wanted to learn more about the first woman in US History who is a serious contender for the White House. Hilary's early years piqued my interest but as I got further into the book, it is so obvious that Christopher Anderson has serious issues with Hilary Clinton. I'm only on page 85 and the book is filled with snide side comments and childish observations. My favorite so far was his mention that Hilary did not wear deodorant in her younger years...fascinating! Who was your source for this interesting tidbit, Christopher Andersen?I'm just glad that I only spent $7.99 and not the full $25.95 retail price. Don't waste your time if you are looking for an intelligent unbiased, factual read. I wasted enough of my limited spare time on this piece of trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A retread of Bill and Hillary: The Marriage","review":"This book is full of juicy stories first seen in Andersen's earlier book, Bill and Hillary: The Marriage. There is very little new here and this appears to be an attempt by the author to make some extra cash this election year. Save your money and buy the earlier book used for a penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inflammatory, tabloidesque conjecture","review":"Someone gave me this book, probably trying to present me with an \\"other\\" view to Hillary Clinton, and after having it on my shelf for months, I finally decided to give it a shot.I was not familiar with the author's other works, but as a serious student of political science, I am embarassed to think that someone thought this was an appropriate gift for me.Few actual facts are buried underneath heaps of unsubstantiated guesswork - the whole thing reads like a tabloid. I felt dirty having it in my house. I'm sorry this book got published, and that it inevitably fell into the hands of some that will continue to hate Hillary because they think this is the true her.This is the first book I actually preferred to throw away rather than take to a book trader. Please, spare yourself. If you want to read a book that dogs Hillary Clinton, pick one that does it in a educated, substantiated manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Given the author's accolades, I had hoped for something better. What a disappointment. This is no more than another politically timed hatchet job on a viable candidate. Sad to say, predictable, and very tiresome.

The author essentially accuses Bill Clinton of being a rapist and Hillary of being an anti-Semite, including a story (with questionable sourcing) of her not entering someone's home because they were Jewish.If you are hater of Hillary, you will love this book. If you love Hillary, you will be even more convinced of a right-wing conspiracy. But if you are just looking for a well-researched biography, you'll be flat-out disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok Product","review":"I personally am not a classical music type of guy but I was told to buy this product for one of my college classes.

If you prefer Opera I would suggest the A to Z of Opera -- most of the tracks on A to Z Classical are orchestral. I was so impressed with this collection that I purchased the Discover the Classics Vol's 1-3 which will give you a more detailed look at the great classics.

It speaks of a child who had a father who left he and his mother and a mother who meets a new man and leaves the child behind. The mother tells the 7 year old boy that the man didn't want him (basically, fend for yourself son, I'm looking after me). Later his mother and new man come and take the boy's bed for themselves and leaves him to sleep on a rug. The plot very clearly depicts how insensitive and selfish people who are supposed to be protecting children can be.Do any of us really want our children to worry that if their single parent meets a spouse that they would be discarded like this?

Being on the verge of aquiring our third German Shepherd, my wife and I haven't raised a puppy in many years, so it was time to re-read the owner's manual. This book is a timeless and definitive tutorial for anyone raising a puppy and beyond. While the instructions and \\"how-to's\\" are certainly essential, I find that the philosophy and theory presented throughout is the most valuable part of the book.If you want to add a four legged friend to your family and wish to have a happy and well adjusted pet (and self) this book is a must. I wish I could afford to buy a dog from the monks of New Skete... but at least I can use their wisdom and guidance. God Bless their work!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For new owners","review":"Neither my husband nor I had ever owned a dog before, much less a puppy. We relied on the two books by the Monks of New Skete for our own training as new owners. I cannot recommend them highly enough. These books are for all dogs, not just Shepherds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old and outdated, let's move onto new and improved","review":"I remember reading this book years ago and thinking it was an awesome book. The section on the different growth periods of puppies is very good, however, much of the other information is outdated and incorrect. Many aspects such as the alpha roll and their concept of dominance theory has been proven not to work and there are better ways to get your point across to the puppy or dog. Many excellent dog behaviorists such as Ian Dunbar, Jean Donaldson, Patricia McConnel have more recent methods you can use with raising your dog and are highly respected among dog trainers across the country and internationally."},{"rating":"1","title":"This out-dated training info does more harm than good.","review":"The field of dog training has advanced greatly in the past 10 years and this book simply does not utilize all of the wonderful dog friendly methods avaialble to dog owners in this enlightened age. If trainers/educators of whales, bears and even children no longer rely on physical force to teach and motivate, why should dog trainers? Training should be informative and fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT PUPPY TRAINING GUIDE","review":"Great read if you are interested in more than just the basic steps to training a puppy. This book gives you insight into dogs. Some of the stories are a little long winded but the training suggestions are wonderful. This combined with internet research and a step by step training guide has really aided me in training my puppy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great insight, must have for puppy shoppers","review":"Here you have a group of people dedicated themselves on training one breed of dog. They tell you how you can do the same for your puppy. It is a standard that no one else can fulfill, but a good one so that you know what you will be doing wrong, as a choice but not as accidents.The book gives great insights on why dogs behave the way they do and a successful way to introduce the puppy into your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better ways...","review":"I prefer books that emphasize a postiive training approach, see Jean Donaldson, Ian Dunbar, etc. Using physical force, even mild, can be counterproductive. Before buying this book I would reccomend getting it and several others from the library and comparing them. Then follow your heart...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Helpful, but not 5 stars.","review":"This book has some helpful information, however it focuses on a celebration of their technique rather than the technique itself. Maybe the first book should be purchased as a companion (though its copyright is 1978 and may be dated).There is too much about their success stories. It just didn't feel right to me. Worth a look, but not to be relied upon as a sole source for training information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting a puppy? This is a \\"must read.\\" Lots of good info!","review":"If you are getting a puppy, or thinking of getting a puppy, you should read this book. While the first few chapeters are about one of thier dog's birthing process, the other information in the book is invaluable. Not sure how to pick a puppy from a litter...this book will help you do some tests to help determine a suitable one. Not sure what to look for in a breeder....they have good information here too. It covers how to reasonably deal with common puppy problems as well a house breaking and early basic obedience training (sit, come, stay, down). Great information to help you pick a wonderful companion."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"This book is excellent, it taught me things I never knew about raising a puppy, let alone a German shepard.

They were born all night long and the next morning on 10/12/10....This book referred to me by a friend is a must for anyone serious about raising working dogs. What a vast amount of good usefull information that has made our now twelve week old puppies the very best trained, socialized with both humans and other dogs, and the best behaving little puppies I've ever raised, or saw for that matter...they were all potty trained at ten weeks old!!!Excellent Book, worth every penny and then some."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't quite make it for me","review":"The Monks of New Skete were just about on the right track years ago, but their books rely on dominance theories (scruff shakes, and alpha rolls for example)rather than the reality and laws of applied animal behavior. For students of more modern and humane methods of training, I highly recommend Jean Donaldson's Culture Clash and Pam Reid's Excel-Erated Learning."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not art!!!","review":"Just so neigh to New Skete!Just so neigh to New Skete!I am ashamed to admit that 8 years ago I used to recommend this book. With all of the new positive dog training knowledge and techniques, I am astonished that it still sits in Amazon's best seller list. DO NOT buy this book! The monks' techniques are primitive and crude. The scruff shakes and alpha rolls are among the many things that are just not necessary for daily training and are not building blocks for a healthy relationship with your dog. Your dog will learn to fear you, not respect you...so I ask...what's the point in having a dog?

Why do dogs behave the way they do? Why are their instincts sometimes not in synch with how humans need them to behave, and how then can their instincts be influenced and molded gently to be compatible with a lifetime with humans?I read this book cover to cover when I got my new puppy, and bought it for my dad when he got his.My only challenge has been that the other people (teenage daughters and my boyfriend) who love my puppy have not read the book. I need to get it on tape and put it on their iPods!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love dogs, read this book!","review":"This book has been available for some time. I bought my copy more than twelve years ago. I found it fascinating, especially the chapter on the Puppy Aptitude Test (on how to evaluate a puppy for its likely adult behavioral characteristics). There is currently much disagreement with the monks' methodology on the part of some trainers today who believe that an owner should always reward and never punish. But there is much in this volume to inform and delight anyone who is about to purchase and raise a puppy -- whatever the breed. A classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Puppy \\"How To\\" Book for Intellectuals","review":"If you are past the point in your life where \\"Puppies for Dummies\\" is of any use to you, if you have had a dog and understand the basics, if you are ready for the more advanced tutorial in really understanding your relationship with your puppy from the first minute he/she is born, if you know that \\"picking a puppy\\" is more important than choosing \\"the cute one,\\" then this book is for you. It is not a training tool, and there are no chapters on teaching sit, stay or come. This will give you a critical understanding of the dog's mental development and what to expect at different stages of the dog's life from birth forward. Get this book AND READ IT before you decide on your next puppy. Also, there is an appendix with \\"exercises\\" to do with your puppy prospects to help you choose the puppy with the right personality for you or your family, and it REALLY works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for picking and training your puppy.","review":"This is a great guide especially if you pick it up before you get your new dog. It helps you to pick a puppy that is right for you and to test its temperement. It helps you with conditioning your small puppy for a smooth transition into formal obedience training and how to deal with common puppy problems.They use gentle corrections advising you the sooner you start trianing your puppy the less corrections you will need. It is a great book I learned a lot. It was also very easy to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I ordered this book upon the advice of our breeder when the puppies were about 2 weeks old. No one is really thinking about serious training when there is still another 6-8 weeks before you receive your newest family member. This book was wonderful. The authors used real dogs and puppies as examples to explain their training techniques. It was well written and easy to understand. Even though we had raised puppies in the past, it had been some time since we'd had a new pup. The content was extremely informative and insightful as to what a dog may be thinking or experiencing. Every time you think, oh-I know all about that, this book could prove you wrong! Even if you only learned a few new things from this book ,it would be worth it to review what goes on inside the mind of a puppy and what can I do to make him the best he can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Owners of Older Dogs, Too!","review":"This is a wonderful book that taught me a LOT about my dog, why she acts the way she does, and what I can do about unwanted behavior. I didn't buy this book right away because I adopted an older dog and the book's title has \\"puppy\\" in it, but after reading the Monk's classic book, How to Be Your Dog's Best Friend (also great) I had to read this one too. The Monks have a refreshing, loving, \\"spiritual\\" approach to dog ownership and training. My dog is very glad I've read their books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not deliver to sophisticated owners","review":"I have had dogs before, but since I was getting a Doberman I thought the monks might have an insight. I read the whole book and found no new info contained. If you have never had a dog before, then the info is very general and educational. The book's biggest issue is that it tells you about a subject, but does not tell you enough to act on it. Ex: they tell you a puppy has a fear period between 8-12 weeks old where you are not supposed to stress it out, but they don't tell you what things will stress a puppy out. You have to do a lot of guessing about what they really want you to do. They can get you to sit and stay, but they can't get you to understand what your dog is doing and why they are doing it.Here in Oregon, I had to go to a trainer to get anywhere because the training book was a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended reading","review":"The book is a must for new breeders and new puppy owners.

I've read the dog whisperer (not Cesar Milan), two of Cesar Milans book, The other side of the leash, ASPCA dog training, etc, etc you get the idea.This is the best book I've read thus far and if you only have the money for one puppy book get this one.Why I like it. I have a high strung lab. Sorry positive reinforcement and replacement just don't work for the jumping, nipping etc. This book taught me how to handle the nipping and in two days my puppies nipping was improved 98%. That's a big bravo in my book. Housetraining schedule, crate training, temperament testing for puppies, basic dog obedience. How to socialize your dog, collars for training. I give this book five stars and is a must have for puppy raising. I also like their other book by the way but this is the best for puppies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Basis when Read with Other Books","review":"This book provides a good basis for dog training and explaining why it is necessary both for your happiness and your dog's. It covers the basic training like crate training, leash training,etc.However, I found this book most useful for its exploration of the pack mentality and why dogs act a certain way. They also discuss develop (from birth to adulthood) and the different socializations needed throughout the various stages of development. The training tips are also enhanced by the plethora of anecdotes about behavior problems between dogs and their owners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its $199 on the ace website","review":"This item sold by acehardwareoutlet is $199 on their website but $249 on Amazon......That sucks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Find","review":"I saw a subcontractor with a similar item and he paid over $200 for it.

The author does not accept the Bible as anything more than an ancient book of myths and so I felt that some of his facts were obviously flawed. ( not necessarily true ) Twice in the book, he mentions that Jimmy Carter was the only president to be born in a hospital, and the fact about the female praying mantis killing the male after mating has since been shown to happen only if the female hasn't been fed well enough.I liked the book. I just felt that some things were entered in as facts without really investigating as to whether or not these things were so, or he added his own personal opinion to some facts which I didn't agree with.If you like trivia then you'll like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Superior Product","review":"I bought this along with the cd-projects brand. This caselogic product is superior by design. Enough slack was deliberately left between the zippers to allow for the expansion of the case when loaded with Cds. The Cd holders are stronger and are fixed onto a solid plastic rib, so unlike the cd-projects brand they don't fall out! Over-all this caselogic case is a handsome and tough little cookie. As a consultant I enjoy walking about with it as my main accessory - along with my 48 most often used CDs it holds my wallet, passport, some boot disks, and some small tools.The cd-projects product works but it is a poor substitute. Hurry and get the caselogic brand. I need another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great space-saver, but the sound can't compare.","review":"I love how this looks and fits in our super-tiny bedroom. I bought it to replace the giant mid-90s stereo+100CD player we were using. While I love the design and the ability to listen to the ipod while folding laundry, etc, the sound just can't compare to the bigger wood-box speakers we had before. So it's a compromise, but a good one. The alarm feature is great because you can set it to play on any song/podcast. The remote is really handy for snoozing too! Someday when we can afford it, I'd go for an upgrade, but the price, size , and operability made this a good product for us for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective","review":"I have been trying to get an RMA from the seller to return this item.They do not answer any messages.The item does not work at all.

There are charts and graphs and pictures that help clarify the text.I am sure that by the size of it and the way it reads this is a text book for a college class somewhere.

This series did not seem like it was for beginners at all. It moved way too fast for me and did not give me enough time to fully stretch into the parts I needed work on the most! The abs section is ok (you feel the burn) but not long enough.. I say rent it from Blockbuster 1st and see if you like it! I've really enjoyed Crunch's yoga video and Kathy Smith too.. they're easy to follow and a great workout!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a workout!!!","review":"I purchased this Yoga program shortly after delivering my second child. I had no idea how difficult Yoga could be! But it is in no way TOO difficult for a beginner, as some here have suggested. I started with the abs workout, in an attempt to work my way back to my pre-pregnancy shape. It is true that the instructor moves through the poses a bit quickly, but I personally could not have held the positions for even a second longer in some cases. (Perhaps this only illustrates how out-of-shape I was to begin with?) It did take a few workouts for me to really catch on, but I found this no different than any other workout video/DVD I have ever purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginers","review":"I got this video with the understanding that it will provide me with the basics of yoga, and that I will progressively become better at yoga and more comfortable practicing it. The video provides a series of on screen explanations of the basic yoga poses with a little graphic. It is very hard to read on the screen, the colot is too light, and helps very little. The video is very good for those who have been practicing yoga for a while, and have a good understanding of it. I tried all the programs contained in the video, with no success at being able to follow the motions, and very little knowledge of how to do it. I had to buy a basic yoga book to understand the yoga positions in detail. The DVD is now sitting on the shelf. I do not recommend thid DVD for beginners. This is a more advanced video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Workout","review":"Very helpful and good product for the price. Easy to navigate DVD. Music was relaxing, instructors were calming and knowledgeable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with others, NOT GOOD FOR BEGINNERS","review":"This is a lovely, visually beautiful DVD. But the reason I picked it up is because it said \\"For Beginners\\". It is way too fast paced, they act like you're suppose to know what each pose is and they keep gliding on to different poses even before you can catch your footing with the previous one.Also, there is a lot of talking/interviewing that was a bit long winded. As someone short on time, I just needed a 1-2 minute intro then on to the actual exercises, I found myself fast forwarding all their talking about how they became interested in Yoga etc.This would be a good dvd for someone intermediate and someone who enjoys the background interviews on the instructors and Yoga itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great variety!","review":"I've had this DVD for a long time, and I use it periodically when I need a good stretch, and can't go to the gym. I wouldn't call this a beginner workout, but its not difficult and easy to follow if you're familiar with the positions. I also like that's its easy to do if you don't have a lot of time with 3 different 20 minute workouts. I would recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout!","review":"This is a keeper! All 3 segments have different focal points, and all are very different workouts, so if you vary which you use, you won't get bored. Beginners can follow along pretty well if they watch the segment first, then listen carefully to the voice prompts. Keep in mind that you won't look like the instructors right away, it takes time to develop that level of fleibility! But in time and with repeated use of this DVD you will see improvements.The Upper Body workout wasn't as strenuous as I thoght it would be, I guess I was expecting more pushups or something. But there was a lot of stretching and reaching which helped unlock my stiff muscles.Overall, great DVD!*elissa"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be on your toes","review":"I took a Yoga class at my gym for about a year and a half. My mom bought this DVD for me for christmas. They change the positions to quickly, it was not relaxing at all. You are supposed to hold your position for a least a minute. You really need to be on your toes for this video so don't expect to be relaxed when it's over. I found it to be very annoying and haven't watched it since."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yoga for beginners?","review":"It may seem to some that I have rated this a little low; however, it is due to the fact that the dvd is presented as one for beginners. I am sure that these routines are a cakewalk for the more seasoned veteran, but they are certainly not for true beginners. I am a fairly flexible person, and I could not even get into a proper downward facing dog, much less the rest of the postures the lower body instructor zoomed through. I will stick with my beginner pilates routine for now and perhaps revisit this dvd in the future when I have gained more muscle tone and flexibility (I hope). Otherwise, I suggest it be retitled."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for beginners","review":"other than this DVD not being what it states it is (\\"for beginners\\") i have no other gripes about it. however if you do not know ANY yoga and ARE a \\"beginner\\" stay away from this one as they move through the poses so fast you will never be able to keep up.however, if you are not a beginner this may be the DVD for you.but a title should really tell the truth about the contents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I was very disappointed with this set after I washed it. We kept it because my son loved the pattern on the quilt but I will not buy this brand again. The sheets are very poorly constructed. The pillow case does not have straight/square seems (which I've actually never seen in a sheet set) and the hem on the flat sheet is sown so that it twists (and you can't get it flat even with an iron) when it comes out of the dryer. It just looks like a wadded mess on the bed topped off with a crooked pillowcase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Faded","review":"I was disappointed when we first opened this package, as the comforter looks kind of faded. I understand bedding will fade over time and with washing, but this appeared that way from the get-go.Other than that, it's comfortable, fits the toddler bed just fine and my son likes it a lot. I just expected it to be as brightly and boldly colored as the picture on Amazon.I would be totally satisfied with it if the price reflected the quality, but in this case, I would never again spend that amount of money on an inadequate product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent quality--just fine for a 2 year old bed","review":"When I was reading other reviews, I was nervous about the sheets.

So far, I still cant find a book that does not start by telling me \\"HITLER IS EVIL!\\" Once this idea is presented, then Hitler is judged from a one side prespective. Many books have basically said the same thing over and over. nothing really is unique. If you have read two or more books about Hitler already, then i say dont expect you will get something fresh from this one. Also,you must read Mein Kampf before you read any analized Hitler books to fully understand it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book on Hitler","review":"I read this book several years ago in Dr. Blakemore's History of Germany Class at Mary Washington College. I still often refer to the book. Short and to the point the book shows beyond a doubt how Hitler destroyed Germany. Not only is this a good look at Hitler and the Nazis but the book destroys the myth that Hitler did some good for Germany. This book shows the true Hitler and the terrible things he did. Again, there are many good books on Hitler: Toland's work, Study in Tyranny by Bullock, Explaining Hitler, etc. but for a quick read, and a informative one, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Two Really Aren't That Bad","review":"Everybody seems to want to put down Batman Forever and Batman and Robin, but to be honest I never liked Michael Keaton that much anyway does anybody honestly think Micheal Keaton could kick anybodys ass. He was too old and too fat to be batman and the first two movies were so dark you could hardly tell what was going on. The Third and Fourth movies to me were more like a mixture between the first two and the 60's batman tv show. I'm a DC fan but I have to admit The spiderman movies were made just right and i wish they would make a Batman movie more like that. Dont get me wrong I had problems with all four of these batman movies, but they were still very entertaining none the less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I mistakenly purchased it from someone who imports the blurays from the UK and sales them here on Amazon. The set I received was of very poor quality. The film looks as if it was just copied over from DVD and put on a blueray disk.

Having all four films for less than $10 is great, but upon watching the first disc, I find that the quality of the transfer is absolutely terrible. Lots and lots of pixelation artifacts, especially when there's black on the screen, and let's face it, BATMAN was not a brightly lit film. The quality is barely, BAREly above VHS. I feel like they hooked a VCR up to a DVD recorder and had at it. I'm not even talking about grain (which I would expect from an older film transfer), but rather poor resolution. There are no solid diagonal lines, everything is blocky. The video looks like an SVCD that was poorly upconverted to DVD.It's good value, if you're just looking for an affordable way to complete your collection, but if you're used to DVD-quality video, you will be disappointed..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst DVD set I ever bought","review":"I just got this set and was very dissapointed.this are cheap one layer double sided disks, the videos grainy.I tested on my 23\\" LCD monitor and they look \\"decent\\" and a bit clear...but when I tested on my 42\\" plasma it hurts my eyes to watch.I will NEVER buy a set like this.just like the old saying... \\"if it sounds to good to be true...\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY IT!","review":"Although all of these movies are extremely enjoyable (it can even be fun to laugh at \\"Batman and Robin\\"), buying this collection at this point in time would be a serious mistake and I wouldn't want you to waste your money. I see that the sales are this are quite strong right now, #300 out of all of the discs available on Amazon, probably because of the new Batman movie (which looks quite good).There are rumors going around that Tim Burton recently recorded audio commentary on the first two films and it has been confirmed that Joel Schumacher is working on a restored director's cut of the third film, with many of the darker elements of the story that were deleted put back in. Obviously, then, we can be pretty sure that these films will come out quite soon with better treatment on DVD. This will probably coincide with the DVD release of Batman Begins late this fall. I think it's worth the wait, personally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Batman/Batman Returns are worth the money alone!","review":"Already owning the 4 titles being released in this trilogy, I wish it came out earlier! Batman and Batman Returns are two of the greatest gothic movies of all time. Tim Burton always does a magnificent job with his movies, but I feel that he peaked during his stint as the director behind the bat. Michael Keaton will always be the real Batman, with Val Kilmer running a close second. Batman Forever dutifully carried on the Batman tradition, yet lacked the tremendous cinematography and gothic styles of the original 2. Batman and Robin, however, never needed to be made. George Clooney never quite settles in as Batman, and Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy deserve better treatment as villians. Overall, each DVD displays a perfect audio/video transfer, and while lacking in the extra features section, this set definately deserves a place in everyone's DVD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guarded with life","review":"We bought this set for Christmas for our daughter who is obsessed with anything Batman, Batgirl, Robin and Teen Titans.

I remember back in 1989 when I first saw Batman with Micheal Keaton... it was most probably one of the best Superhero movies ever ....It was followed by another movie which was almost as good known as Batman Returns, with a cast like Michelle Pfeiffer, Danny Devito and Micheal Keaton what more could we expect but pure perfection... ..:)The last two, ...Plain and simple they were like kids stories. Another loss was the fact that Tim Burton did not direct them. His dark loomy presence was not felt and they seem to be geared move towards children... the magic was lost..

The packaging is held together with gummy tape (or whatever it's called). This means that once you open it up, you can never get it closed again. This results in the inability to display the movies on a bookshelf in the original packaging.If the packaging was better, this would have gotten five stars instead of just four. Still an overall good buy if you're a fan of the Tim Burton Batman movies. I could take or leave the Joel Shumacher films, but for only a couple bucks more than if you bought the two Burtons separately, this was a good deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Batman FOREVER!","review":"i would rate this 8 out of 5 stars if i could. the picture quality is only that of a DVD but hey what can ya say it wasnt exactly filmed in high definition"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't have \\"Kiss From A Rose music video\\"","review":"I love Seal, so why no music video.

I'm sure it will only be more horrible in high definition.The first movie, with Michael Keaton as Batman and Jack Nicholson as The Joker, will always have a place in my heart as the first real Batman movie. It was a pretty good one, as well, even though it appears to be a low-budget film.The other three movies aren't worth watching, whether you've seen them or not. You will be better off spending your time waiting for another Christopher Nolan Batman movie (Director of \\"Batman Begins\\" and \\"The Dark Knight\\").Those two movies have been awesome to watch.

Michael Keaton's performance was so wooden.As for Joel Schmacher's two movies, I hated the Rick Baker designs of Two Face, Riddler, Posion Ivy, and Mr. Freeze.

The presenter is engaging, but wastes far too much of the course's time reiterating and emphasizing that terrorism is the acts of a few fanatics rather than the product of mainstream Islam. I was hoping for something informative regarding the various sects and schools of jurisprudence within Islam. Not here, other than a few mentions of the schism between Sunni and Shia. No mention of Alawites or Druze. No explanations of the doctrinal differences or backgrounds between twelvers, Ismailis, or Zaidis, for example. The only revelatory portions of these lectures for me were his discussions of varying customs/laws regarding the treatment of women in different Islamic countries.

There are no extras to speak of on the DVD, but there is a cameo by Steve Buscemi in one of his earliest uncredited works.The movie, as expected, never got good reviews by the critics at large, and never broke 2 million in sales at the box office, but for the fans of Jeff Goldblum, Peter Falk, and Cyndi Lauper, this is some of the best comedy work they ever did.

In saying that I mean I dont think this book is going to help someone with their husband if they are in a dangerous relationship where there isnt some level of respect for each other. But for alot of us it should help us to understand our husband or significant others better. Which in return will help us to respect each other and get along better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic, Basic","review":"For a 4 set DVD you would think that the programs would lead up to building a better and repeatable swing.

The songs are too disjointed and the production is too cluttered. Bit of navel-gazing at work too; some songs are staggering in their length. Videos of this band don't do them any favors, either, as they lack onstage in charisma, style, or visual appeal.

Also, I have encountered very few errors in this book, so if your solution doesn't agree with Ohanian's, it may be due to a mistake on your part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised that it's not popular--Such a great book","review":"This is one of the better textbooks for introductory Physics for science majors. Halliday, Resnick and Walker's emphasizes on problem solvings; Serway's makes great balance between concepts and applications; Giancoli's is more conceptual oriented; Young and Freedman's has a lot of excellent problems and explains concepts very well; Tipler's is quite boring and concise. It's always nice to read a newly published classical physics textbook to see how the same subject is presented differently by the different authors. But since this book emphasizes the practical aspects of physics, it's probably more welcome than the others for a college level cal based introductory physics course.

As a bonus, John Lucht has included a 'little novella' at the end that summarizes the job search from every perspective - the candidate's, recruiter's and employer's. The reference section itself has enough information that you won't find at any single source easily - names of retained search firms, where to find information on companies etc. Wether you are on a job search or not, I would recommend this book to any senior executive as an excellent book of learning in your moving up process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Richly Packed with All the Stuff You Need to Know","review":"This book is powerful, full of all the stuff you need to know to write a great resume and cover letter as well as how to get the best deal from your new employer.

I feel sorry for the author; it seems that she (?) was probably tasked by Rational to write a user's manual for Rational rose, and someone at Rational thought they could make some more money by publishing it as a separate book.

We later see the same pig in the background, minus the bite and with a knife stuck through its side. The text and pictures tell us also that the brothers are \\"worshipped in hell\\". The end is anti-climactic, and all three brothers are devoured (thankfully unseen) by something \\"bigger, hungrier, and harrier\\". The cover showes one G. B. biting the head off a fish, blood and guts and all, and another about ready to devour the third.

There are many other books available which have higher quality and content. When looking at a taoist book you must look at the author of the book and his/her credentials. As a general tip.

It is an account of The Church of God, by the dynamic leader chosen to take her on the final conflict. We are a better people and world for having this great man write from divine inspiration from the book of Psalms 132:6; and other references found in God's Holy Word. Praise His Name."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glorious MacDowell Piano Concerti Given Expert Performances","review":"Except for a misreading of a bass note in the cadenza in the first movement of the first concerto, Stephen Prutsman plays flawlessly. His virtosity is effortless, and never strained. He does not get in the way of the gratutious orchestral parts, so the balance between soloist and orchestra is exemplary. The first concerto especially sounds fresh and newly-minted. Even though the Wild and Cliburn recordings of the 2nd concerto resonate in the mind, this certainly stands as a fine alternative interpretation, and should be listed alongside them. The other short works are well done, too. Great sound and worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Performance","review":"The piano has great reverberation and really sticks out in this recording. The pianist in addition, gives an exceptional performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Tis true - the murderer is obvious very early; the heroine is not heroic at all and the characters were all unlikeable - except her mother of whom we saw too little. There was no there there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I love mysteries especially those set in quirky situations, so I picked up Permed To Death by Nancy Cohen with much anticipation.I found this book disappointing from the very beginning. The dialog was simplistic and predictable as was the \\"whodunit\\". The characters were underdeveloped and not used to their full potential within the story. A few characters showed up with no introduction or background until later in the book or not at all, leaving me wondering just who they were and what their significance was to the storyline.I purchased this book and Ms. Cohens next book in the series at the same time but after laboring through this one I think I'll pass on the second and cut my losses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get this Author An Editor!","review":"This book sounded absolutely adorable with its murder occurring in the beauty shop. Some days when our hair doesn't come out looking so hot, I'm sure murder is on the mind of some of the patrons. Marla (the principal character) sounded like someone we'd want to know. I know South Florida as my folks have lived there for quite some time. All the elements of a book I should like were in place.Let's start with the writing. The author describes a lot of stuff that doesn't move along the action at all. She hints at back stories for some of the characters but, doesn't give us the details then, plops them in at inappropriate spots. Why not tell us about the girls at the salon? The mystery is weak, too. It doesn't take much to figure this one out at all. Let's hope that Ms. Cohen either improves her writing skills or gets a better editor, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"I saw this mystery in the store and thought: \\"hey, this looks good\\". I thought it would be fun and interesting - neither which turned out to be true. The story was dark and depressing and the mystery annoying and convulted. Marla must be the stupidest so-called sleuth in the history of dumb sleuths if she didn't figure out the killer until the end. The clues were so obvious it was painful to watch her stumble around. I had to force myself to complete it.I had to feel sorry for Marla at one point where the detective ripped her to shreds for her past - I would have slapped him and hard! Too bad she forgave him when he smiled at her.Bogus! 2 stars is being too fair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The title and the artwork suckered me in. I'm always on the lookout for a new series with female leads in amateur roles. But this book was a bitter disappointment and I continued reading only it in hopes it would improve. It didn't. The mystery is badly constructed with the guilty party almost standing up and self-identifying in the earliest chapters. The characters all sound alike with awkwardly constructed and generally inane dialogue. The lead character has few redeeming features. I don't expect flawless people, but the lead isn't even likeable which is pretty much a necessity in cozies. If you're looking for a well-written beauty-parlour based mystery wait until mid March when \\"Bubbles Unbound\\" by Sarah Strohmeyer is released. I read the ARC and it's hysterical in a Janet Evanovich sort of way with full-bodied characters and a solid mystery. It's what PERMED TO DEATH ought to have been..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst mystery novel I have ever read","review":"I was so far into the book (which starts with some promise) when I grasped how awful it was and the rapidly descending path of the writing that I pushed myself to finish reading it. Awful. The WORST dialogue I have EVER seen -- worse than I could have imagined in a commercially published novel -- matched only by the vapid and wooden narrative and preposterous interactions with the police. I am incedulous that it was not only published, but now republished in a new edition. The upside is that a book this bad helps a reader (especially one who aspires to become a writer or editor) to grasp what makes a good novel, by way of the stark contrast. By the end, it is as though the editor gave up in dismay and just let the awfulness pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad Hair Day Never Felt So Good","review":"At last, a mystery with characters I can relate to! Ms. Cohen's salon-owner-turned-sleuth Marla Shore is both realistic and saavy as she pursues the clues after the murder of one of her own clients. Brooding Detective Vale thinks Marla's got something to hide, but the tension between them isn't just about homicide. I really enjoyed this novel, it's a perfect blend of fun and suspense, with a solid plot and great dialogue. I know I'll never look at my hairdresser the same way again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Escape!","review":"\\"Permed to Death\\" by Nancy J Cohen provided me with the perfect escape from daily doldrums.Marla Shore, the owner of the local beauty salon in South Florida, made a believable, nosey butt-inski!

The murderer was obvious very early on, the heroine just chose to ignore the very blatant clues. The cover art is adorable, but the book has no substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Potential with proffesionalism.","review":"I really enjoyed this book- it was really intriguing. Even though I felt like I knew who the murderer was pretty early on- it made the book even more irresistable to see if I was right. So saying, I must also say the book was a little too closely centered on sex. Romance peppered in is great, but I do hope that the future books in this series will have less explicit parts about sex. Other than this- I loved the book. I look forward to reading more. Oh yeah- I loved Detective Vail. I hope he continues to play a big part in this series, and also that we'll hear from his daughter. I hope to see new books in this series very soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"My 12 year old daughter could write a better novel than \\"Permed to Death\\". I was intrigued by the title & jacket summary so I invested in this book. I would have done better to put the money towards a perm for myself. No doubt it would have been more enjoyable. Cohen's writing style is juvenile at best and the dialogue was painful to read. Not knowing much Yiddish, I could have used a glossary at the back to define some of her expressions. I can't imagine how this book was published, not to mention the subsequent books in the same series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked For Me","review":"I used this book and scored a 100 on the postal exam. I used to keep a copy of it to lend people taking the test. Apparently the last person kept it. It has a great section that teaches a memorization technique. Some sort of system of memorization is VITAL for scoring well on the test. He also goes into great detail about little things such as having a supply of pencils ready with the points worn down to a certain angle, and dressing comfortably for testing in old government buildings. I strongly recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"No love for this glove","review":"My almost five year wanted to be a Power Ranger for Halloween and I thought these gloves would be a nice accessory that would also be a toy after Trick or Treat.The promised sound effects are muffled and can only be heard when the gloves are positioned just right.

It is an important book, but I wonder if they could have trimmed the evidence and overwhelming discussion, and still made their points. They seem to make the same points over and over again. In addition, there are a lot of mistakes - missing words, missing phrases, and misplaced words being the most common. They could have used a better copy editor. Furthermore, it was published in 2000. It would make sense to revise and update it for 2013. I recommend the book because they leave no stone unturned and say a lot of very important things backed up by exhaustive reserach, but be prepared for a difficult, slow read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Quality Control","review":"From what little we could see of the skating it was excellent and proves that there still is no ice dancing couple in Torvill and Deans class.Unfortunately the tape we received was of such awful quality that it was unwatchable (although we did suffer through it to see if it improved at any point). It constantly 'tracked' and was so full of static and snow that for much of the dancing we were left guessing what was going on.It is too bad that HBO Home Video can't produce a better quality tape. I guess we will look for a DVD next time.We hope to find a format where we can watch the performance and not have to suffer with the medium."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generic tv movie","review":"I rented this because of Diane Lane. I have to admit I didn't think it would be too good and I got what I excepted.Diane Lane plays a naive Texas girl who wins a national beauty contest. She realizes that it isn't all it's cracked up. She has to leave behind her loved ones and live up to the phony image. It doesn't take her long before she's disillusioned. It's like an after school special minus the cheese. Cloris Leachman is her mentor and she does her usual eccentric character well.Diane is pretty here and does the best job she can with a weak cliche script. There is one serious scene with a blue eyeliner that was unintentionally hilarious. For an example of a young Lane the charming A Little Romance is a better recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skeetervac. SV27","review":"My Skeetervac SV-27 worked well for the first year.

The tape caught more horse flys than mosquitos which was nice. The 2nd year it started up nicely. After a few day I went to empty the trap but the trap was empty and the machine was off. It started right up again. I checked it 30 min later and it was off. I finally determined that it would shut off after 5-10 minutes.

I put it in a spot in my back yard where I got bit the most often and sat right beside it with mosquitos eating me alive. I left the piece of junk in that very spot for a week and it caught 3 mosquitos, hardly worth the effort. Just while I was dismantling it alone I got bit more times than I can count, so believe me mosquitos were there in abundance. My advice is to buy some more citronela candles, they work better. I don't know how they get good reviews for this, they must be hiring them, if it don't catch mosquitos by accident in my back yard it is a peice of junk in my opinion.

The good thing is Blue Rhino honored the warrantee even though it expired a couple of weeks before that. They said that this model SV-27 had a flaw in the design of the combustion chamber which made it more likely to fail. They said the newer models (like SV3000 and SV5000) have a better design. They did send me a replacement engine (basically the entire top) which is one of the newer models. I am pleased with the support I got from them but if I was buying a new one I would not get a SV27. I would look for one of the new models."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maintenance, maintenance, maintenance","review":"I'll keep this short: READ the MANUAL. You need to keep this thing clean. I have to clean mine often (not a big deal) - we have TONS of mosquitos and they gum up the engine. We had our engine replaced once (bad ignition), it was at my door that week. I've also had the LED's go out - just needed a battery! You may also have to change the gas filter in the line. These are not difficult things to do, but with any motorized piece of equipment it needs routine maintenance.This product is worth it's cost if you ask me. I know people with other brands and feel I got a good deal.

Maybe not as bad as some of the other writers who live in swamps. Bad nonetheless to the point of getting 5 bites in an hour.The unit is definately high quality. The ignitor always works. About the only mechanical problem we had was when a rodent ate through the gas line.My wife swears that the unit works, but I rarely, if ever, saw a mosquito in the basket. I attribute the decrease more to the drought we experienced.After going through five propane refills and cleaning out at most 100 mosquitos I figured that going for a sixth is just wrong for the environment.

It entices and excites the reader on a multitude of levels. Romance, mysticism, spirtuality, adventure, action, and some gore thrown in for good measure, it's truly a novel of epic proportions. One can see why it is so revered in the eastern culture and spawned so many movies. This book has set me on a search for samurai swords on ebay and my first book on zen. Thanks Miyamoto!

I say this to emphasize that it is no small statement when I say that I recommend this book. It is without a doubt one of the best books I've ever read, and even merits re-reading.For sheer entertainment value, the characters are vibrant and alive. The reader comes to care for them and to understand their unique viewpoints. The settings and situations, too, are easy to visualize.The true value of the book, though, is in it's ability to transport us effortlessly into it's world, and to teach us lessons in life almost before we are aware of it. From a deeper perspective, the non-Japanese reader will come away with a better understanding of Japanese culture and values.In my opinion, this book truly deserves a five star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"An epic journey that is way too epic.","review":"Books this long need to be way more interesting or it turns into a slog, I don't care how fast you read.

One of the best scenes to me is that of most of the main characters meeting on a bridge on new years day...I highly recommend this to students of Musashi. Though I am loathe to admit it, it is better than the Samurai Trilogy only in that more stories and Side Stories are contained here-in. However the Samurail Trilogy is one of the best Trilogies out there, similar in scope to the Godfather. I totally recommend it!

I found it odd that the Deutsch version was actually translated from the English version. This book has a very good plot and convincing characters. Interestingly, it was not so martial arts centered as I had expected (I guess I am citing the English version at this point). I wouldn't exactly quote Reischauer and call it the 'Gone With the Wind of Japan' though. I'd say it is kind of between that and a coming of age story.

But I really like to hear him sing, and I enjoy his drumming style. And I think he's \\"cool.\\"The musicianship on this collection is phenomenal. Only when you get a good, clear recording of this, do you hear the orchestrations in \\"Photograph\\" in all their resplendent glory. And, \\"It Don\\"t Come Easy.\\" It's got that \\"something\\" that a lot of music lacks.

It does have some great songs like Photograph, It Don't Come Easy, and Back Off Boogaloo, but it is long past time for an update. Ringo has had some good stuff since this album was released.

It almost sounds like it was transcribed from a disc on a budget turntable.The audience noise is, as many others have said, a part of the performance, and contributes to the immediacy of what you hear. It makes me aware that it is 1969, a year when the Viet Nam war was consuming much of our consciousness and a performance of this piece would have been especially poignant.Wonderful, if flawed recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent photographs for the non-squeamish","review":"Gatewood's pictures are not for those with weak stomachs, but the subjects are fascinating.

The only reason i didnt give this 5 stars is becasue, when you are sending a message and the other person sends a message at the same time, you dont see either of the messages.

It is obvious that a lot of time and effort went into putting this cd together. I would have paid three times the price to own it - indeed,This CD does genuine justice to one of the most important 20th century composers for the guitar. For those of you not familiar with the guitar music of Villa-Lobos, I would highly recommend that you purchase this CD and experience the delightful coupling of classical and Brazilian traditions that he managed to accomplish. If you are a fan of classical guitar, this CD will likely become a favorite!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a god's gift for every classical guitar student","review":"As mentioned in the other reviews, the naxos series are low priced, and often of a reliable quality. This cd is no exception, Norbert Kraft is indeed a great preformer.It's also not that common that one can find all of Villa Lobos' works for solo guitar on one cd, wich is of course a blessing for all classical guitar students (taking into acount the avarage student's budget).The only remark I have is that some of the etudes are played to fast (for example n12 and n2), this way, the music looses a bit of it's content.Conclusion: the overall preformance is very good (Kraft has a good sonority and an unbelievable technique), I actually wanted to rate it 4.5*, but that's not possible within Amazon's rating system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heitor Villa-Lobos solo works for guitar","review":"Crisp, real space recording. good dynamic range without dropouts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tepid and tiresome...","review":"Kraft does not grasp the nuance, vigor, zest, passion, or bite of Villa-Lobos's music. As a classical guitarist who has played V.L.'s Etudes almost every day for over five years--and who has listened to dozens of recordings--I find many flaws in Kraft's recording; though he gives a technically-sound rendition, he does not penetrate the music's vitality at all. Julian Bream's V.L. records are immensely superior. Do yourself a favor and find his recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant interpretations","review":"Norbert Kraft's performance is equisite. The tone of his instrument is dark, rich and deep, communicating acutely the pianistic timbres of Villa-Lobos' music. As a classical guitarist I can assure you the Kraft is considered one of the premiere instrumentalists of his generation. Villa-Lobos is a rare composer who's music still sounds modern today. His attention to timbral detail and harmonic inventiveness is highly unique. On this recording, Villa-Lobos' ability to coax new colors and dimensions out of the guitar has been rendered in it's most just and unique form, through the fine playing of Norbert Kraft"},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely gorgeous guitar work!","review":"Nothing like bastardized-pop Spanish guitar from The Gypsy Kings...this is the real thing.It might make you want to invest in a good sound system though, or at least some high quality headphones starting around $80."},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality pictures plus the touch-and-feel.

See if you can find that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Swingin' Good Time","review":"I really love this CD. I'm sure there are those you who don't consider this particular compilation as one of Frank's best, but I just think this is such a fun CD. While your typical love songs are generally a slow melody, I tend to prefer songs like the ones here, that are a little more upbeat. They are romantic in their own way. I like to put this on when the hubby and I are just sitting around the house relaxing, or cooking, and even when we're driving. It's got a good combination of slow dance and swing dance tunes--the title says it all! Definitely one of my favs of Frank's."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Greatest Albums of all times","review":"This is one of the greatest albums ever.If you want some upbeat romantic songs, this is it.If you want a great 2nd marriage song for your 1st dance , new kinda love is or you.enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly the Greatest!","review":"Easily, the greatest LP ever made. Forget about the Beatles. Obviously, they were great, but \\"Swingin\\" and \\"Wee Small Hours\\" blow them away. Of course, the 1998 remastering was poorly done, and I wish Capitol would re-release the 1987 version. I have the 1956 LP, but it's horribly scratched. Listen to this immediately after \\"In the Wee Small Hours,\\" while sippin' some Jack, Frankie's favorite. Did you know he was buried with a half pint of it? This recording of \\"I've Got You Under My Skin\\" is the finest record ever made; it's hard to imagine any other singer ever sounding as good. But the whole LP flows so perfectly, we can only be grateful that Frank & Nelson Riddle found each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF MY FAVORITE SINATRA ALBUMS","review":"WHAT MORE CAN YOU SAY?

It also sounds like snot. My Shortwave radio sounds better than this remastering job! I don't know if they were asleep at the mastering studios, or what, but it really is awful. Everything sounds like it's under a fog - Frank may as well have a gag in, it's so muffled. Besides that, there's too much bass. I kept thinking I had the treble on my reciever down or something.Case and point : BUY THIS ALBUM, BUT BUY THE OLDER COPY. Easy way to spot it : the newer, often-bad remasters have \\"Voice Of the Century\\" printed on the clear side of the jewel case. The first issues from back in the late 80's do not. The Songs For Young Lovers/Swing Easy reissue suffers from the same problem. Sheesh, what a mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful mastering muddies up a truly great album","review":"You'll see other postings here that discuss the details of what Capitol's engineer did on this 1998 release to reduce hiss, etc. Believe it. Compared to the 1991 version of the disc or the better Mobile Fidelity gold disc (1990) this version is awful. It's like a bucket of mud was dumped over his vocals. There are a bunch of threads on this topic on the forums of Steve Hoffman, one of the best sound engineers in the business. But the bottom line is most people who care about this music would like to see Capitol go back to the original master tapes and treat Frank right. The mastering issues apply to a lot of the 1998 Sinatra discs labeled \\"Entertainer of the Century\\" on the side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good songs, bad recording and mastering","review":"I'm a big fan on Sinatra and other swing music. This album has a great collection of his favorites, no doubt about that.My problem with this album is that it sounds REALLY bad. Distortion of all sounds throughout the album is the norm. There's an air of stuffiness throughout the album. Imagine taking a digital master and encoding it down to 11 khz stereo. Or think of a 24k MPG recording - it's no better.As another reviewer commented - don't buy this album. Capitol in no way should be compensated for releasing such a poor quality disc and actually get a cent for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHAME ON YOU CAPITOL RECORDS!","review":"How could this record company ruin the sound of one of the greatest recordings of the 20th century in the digital remastering! You do not have to be a sound engineer to hear the fluctuating treble in the horns and Sinatra's voice. It's like some jerk keeps turning the treble up then the bass up and vice versa sporadicaly throughout the recording. Argh! What a mess! Capitol records should fix this immediatly...it's the least they could do for the greatest pop singer who ever lived. Because this is one of Sinatra's best, I still must give it five stars even though Capitol does not really deserve Sinatra."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come What May","review":"Although this lighthearted version of Sinatra doesn't appeal to me as much as his darker side does, there's no denying Riddle knows how to make anything swing, and the Voice delivered a tune--virtually any tune--better than jsut about anyone, save Ella Fitzgerald.And, while some of these tunes are a tad too cutesy for me, \\"I've Got You Under My Skin\\" is perfection, \\"It Happened In Monterey\\" shimmys seductively, and Sinatra's quiet approach to \\"Anything Goes\\" is charming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not buy another BJs DVD","review":"The animation was poor (and a bit odd and scary), and this video did NOT keep my son's attention.

However, upon recieving it and playing it, I was very dissappointed. For being fairly new, the programmers should have randomly dealt the cards. I had the same hands repeatedly in all of the games.

I mean, I'm like one of those people who thinks, this could never happen to me. But after reading this, I realize how easily it could happen. I'm glad I read this, and I recommend it to other people my age (13-14). I also read \\"It Happened to Nancy\\" and liked that too. P.S. For whoever said it's not realistic because she apologizes for cussing--I do that sometimes too...because I also pretend my diary is a real person, just like Annie refers to hers as \\"Daisy.\\"...and also, Annie, as someone else mentioned, is Catholic and may feel the need to apologize."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good at some parts but Mostly Pathetic.","review":"I read 'Annie's Baby' about a year ago. I was expecting something powerful, maybe even touching. But instead what I got was a load of junk! This Character 'Annie' starts out seeming like your average teen. When she discovers herself as pregnant it all turns downhill. The Author seems to excuse her responsibility by making her a victim of rape and creates a whiny bratty girl. Annie is nothing but selfish through most parts and also very foolish. She wants an abusive boyfriend even after everything he's ever done to her. The ending was sappy and perhaps unrealistic and it frightens me that the Author has this character fight with her 'Diary'. My advice: if your looking for some that's sad and a bit on the unreal side go ahead. Don't expect an award winning book though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book, but I didn't like the ending!!","review":"This book is really interesting. As you probably noticed, it is about a teen who becomes pregnant after her boyfriend rapes her. At the beginning, I thought ANNIE and I were alike, wanting to be in love and loving somebody. I loved how \\"Dr. B\\", the editor, put in a part about how most readers think ANNIE'S problems are not like theirs, \\"..., that there is no way you would allow a boy to control your life...your entire future! But...whoa...wasn't that exactly the way \\"ANONYMOUS ANNIE\\"...felt before she met Danny.\\" I never have been, nor do I hope to be, in the same situation as ANNIE. But the book did make me think about how I let guys treat me. I haven't really ever had a boyfriend, but now I have this informations in my head, for when I start to think with my heart. This book makes you reflect on your life!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"I though that this book contained a fairly accurate sterotypical summary of a pregnant teen, however I feel like the 50 year old pyscologist are going a bit overboard with the whole pretend diary thing.

This book is good if your just reading it for kicks, but if your reading it to get someones first hand expierance, I dont recomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"easy read, but tends on the unbelievable side","review":"When I saw that my younger sister was reading this book, I was very intrigued and asked to read it after she had finished...The whole thing took just about 2 hours to read, with nothing much to reccomend it in the end. 'Annie' is an unbelivably 2 dimensional character, the dialogue was laughable and the overall tone from the introduction to the final page was preachy. The one thing that this book has to reccomend it is the quizzes included along with the journal, which may help adolecent girls (and women of any age) to reciognize an abusive relationship when they see one. Otherwise, give this one a miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fifth of March","review":"The Fifth of March is a wonderful book that explains the Boston Massacre in living color.

As things become complicated between Rachel, Matthew, and the civilians of Boston, thoughts are tangled in the web of Rachel's mind. When citizens meet in front of the Commons House, Matthew leads the soldiers in firing upon the crowd. The images in the book are clear and vivid in any reader's mind. Intriguing, interesting, and thought-provoking."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not realistic","review":"This book is not realistic even the least bit. I myself use to be a counselor for pregnant teens and many pregnant teens are not as naive as this girl is here. I don't believe this is the diary of a young girl if it is. I apologize.

Total waste of time of paper and ink."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I have ever read","review":"With shows like \\"teen mom\\" on air now, maybe this book was a diary of some stupid teenage girl. A 14 year-old girl gets knocked up by her abusive-soccer-playing boyfriend and has a hard time accepting reality in front of her. Any woman or girl who is willing to put their kid in the arms of an abusive maniac deserves to have her kid taken away. This book was dumb, I actually think I threw it away it was that horrid.

I recommend it for anyone in their early to late teens. However, I think \\"Annie's\\" attitude toward her 'boyfriend' after what he did to her was idiotic to say the least...apologizing for making him angry?! Excuse me; I don't think so!!!

They are meant as \\"warnings\\" to children. In fact, they are not based on real diaries and the only one that actually was, she used about 10% of the journal entries and added a Satanic theme which horrified the family.Now I am aware that children should be taught such things as drugs are bad, teenage pregnancy is not preferable, don't kill yourself etc. However, I take offense when presented in this manner. Children learn best from the truth not extreme propaganda. I also take offense that many libraries (especially school libraries) list this book as non-fiction, when in fact it is a work of fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly helpful...","review":"I bought this book because I am a pregnant teen trying to inform myself.

Not only that it paints a really bad picture of teen moms, and it teen moms like \\" Annie,\\" that make all teen moms look bad. Teen parents are great parents and they do just a good of a job as a 35 yr old parent. But the book focuesed on the point that all teen parents are bad which I know isn't true because many of them love there children and finish school and so on. The ending was terrible! I didn't like it at all, so basically the whole book just bashed teen moms and dads. So our society will never learn that until we help teen paretns become succesful the cycle will never stop, and our society will be just as bitter. Teen parents can do it!

As much as it disturbed me that this girl would become pregnant at fourteen, even though she didn't plan on it, I couldn't put this book down. Every teen thinking about having sex with her boyfriend should read this book. If it doesn't change your mind, it would at least encourage you to use protection, and it would show you the consequences if you didn't. This book also shows you that protection isn't 100% guarenteed. Another reason I loved this book was because Annie battled with the idea of abortion and decided not to go with it. She ended up keeping her baby, and I think that was a very honorable thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could have been better...","review":"This book was great, but the ending wasn't good.

I rented this and beat it in a few hours, picking up a few hundred achievement points in the process, but never found it to be challenging or fun. Rent it if you must, but don't expect to spend more than 5 hours playing it.Overall - this is a huge letdown, just like most games that are tied into movies.

Along the way he makes up some ridiculous terminology in an attempt to legitimize these vague and poorly-thought out concepts. The exercises he suggests are a joke!

If one were to write a play the way this author suggests, the end result would be unendurable and inscrutable.(As a side note: almost none of the techniques he covers are \\"new\\".

It even looks like some may have come from movies, as you can see a shell explode about ten feet from a man who appears not to notice it. The history of the time and the strategies of the combatants seem to be pretty well conveyed, in compressed form. From that point of view, it is informative. But what detracted so much, for me, was the narration. So many words are idiotically mispronounced: quay, Kriegsmarine, and place names like Liege, Aachen, Verdun, not to mention the ubiquitous German preposition \\"von\\" and names like \\"Wilhelm.\\" I found myself laughing, and wondering if they set out to make the thing sound like a high school production!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Narration !","review":"OMG...

The narrator sounds like the robot who calls you from the drug store to tell you your prescription is filled, and he mispronounces words so that their meaning is distorted. So bad it's funny. The sound is terrible---sounds like they recorded it with a toy mike. The footage keeps repeating itself. I honestly can't understand why anyone would put the work into producing a 7.5-hour documentary and think that this is acceptable. High school students could do better.

Many good stories, and many honest assessments of peoples in the music business. I have to say one big disapointment for me was that Burdon is more interested in telling readers about his life outside of music than his life within music. I asked for this book mostly because he recorded 2 of my favorite double LPs ever - Black Man's Burdon, with the band War, and Love Is, with the Animals after he moved to California. He doesn't even mention these albums. It seems almost impossible. How could this be? They were huge, famous music projects, but he doesn't talk about them. This is what disapointed me.

The style is somewhat pedantic and staid, but easy to read. It's certainly not a zen classic and the story never really gets off the ground or totally convinces. The historical backdrops are paper thin and obvious cut-and-pastes from history textbooks. I must admit I am somewhat baffled by all the rave reviews here. I can only conclude that a lot of people who don't really have much experience of Japan, think they've stumbled upon some sort of motherlode of bushido spirit in this conveniantly Westernized piece of writing by a Japanesese Christian. Remember, not every Japanese woman is a geisha, and not every Japanese writer can wield his pen like a samurai's sword."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"Great novel. Not as powerful as Silence but still a classic! Endo does an excellent job of showcasing the power of christianity without force feeding it the way a western writer would tend to. This story is very subdued and theres never that huge climax that some may expect, instead Endo carries strong points throughout the entire book. I dont quite understand the reviewer who said you cant learn everything about Japan in this book, was I supposed to?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Samauri - Life's Long Journey of faith","review":"This is a profoundly comforting book. Set in seventeenth century Japan, the novel tells a story about fidelity and courage. The hero of the book is a Samauri warrior sent on a fool's mission to Mexico and Europe. He is the pawn of larger, cynical forces whom he wisely distrusts. Despite this, however, he finds a faith that keeps him going and a courage that doesn't desert him - even at the point of death.Christianity has few adherents in modern Japan but there are some four thousand martyrs in the church's troubled history in the islands. In an unsentimantal way, this story celebrates the courage and decency of the indigenous church. It is a story that makes one proud to be a human being, not ashamed of it. Few novels can make that claim."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling narrarive","review":"Shusaku Endo is a great writer. The way he recreates with painstaking details both physical surroundings and state of mind of main characters leaves you feeling like you experienced it yourself. At the same time the main focus of this novel is religion, particularly christianity. The other stuff, such as description of travel by japanese envoys to Europe that took place in seventeenth century, although extremelly vivid and interesting, serves mostly as a background to more deeply embedded line of deliberation on the meaning of christianity. The book also helps to better understand the modern Japanese society through the prysm of the first experience between japanese and european societies. I gave it only four stars because I found the novel to be sometimes too slow, even repetitive, But it could me just my perception."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"this microwave which was advertised as being an aid for the blind was nothing more than a touchpad microwave which was modified with hard to read and totally useless buttons on the side of the touchpad.

This book was the 2003 edition, and seemed to be an improvement above what I could have found searching similar names on the \\"Internet\\" on my own. Since the book was organized into maps, descriptive notes, and photographs, the 300 pages, in large coffee table format, and with beautiful color pictures, it seemed to be just what I needed. Its drawback was that it did not talk about what gear was needed, how the dive would take place, nor did it talk about the dive PLAN, be it from the shore or from a boat, etc. So, the next step for the reader can be: \\"What kind of dive packages are available\\", and so on.\\" (Hence, the book was not good for somebody who already had an idea of where to dive.)

Another book I'd recommend is the McFredies book 'Idiot's Guide...Web page & Blog': it is also a high caliber basic manual.

I had the very rare privelege of missing out on the Band during the 60s & 70s. I was quite aware of their albums but never got round to listening to them. This meant that when I came to listening to their albums seriously for the first time last year (at age 51!)I had no bias of measuring Cahoots up to anything that had preceded it. After listening to snippets I walked out with all three albums that the store had in stock, viz. Cahoots, Stage Fright and Jericho. I love all three albums, and especially Cahoots. Subsequently I acquired Big Pink & the brown album. They are indeed superb, but I somehow think that many listeners are missing something about Cahoots: if one listens to the radio ad included on the remastered version, The Band state that they have moved on, like we all have. Well they did move on, and, to my taste, without diminution. In fact - dare I say it? - I prefer Cahoots to te 1st two albums!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most bands would give their left arm for an album as good as this","review":"This 4th Band album has gotten a bad rap over the years. Only because the first 3 were so legendary. I tell you what, do yourself a favor and listen to this album again, I was amazed how good it really is. With songs like The River Hymm, Life Is A Carnival, Moon Struck One, Shoot Out in Chinatown an dthe underrated Volcano, it's an album most bands would die for to make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apt cover art","review":"It is eery listening to this record in light of their better work--the voices are the same, the instrumental virtuosity evident if not on full display. It starts off well (Carnival, Masterpiece), then doesn't go anywhere. I guess the problem is the pretentious songwriting, which seems to have dampened everyone's enthusiasm for the project. The bonus tracks just highlight this: the Motown chestnut \\"Don't Do It\\", despite inferior sound quality, is now one of the best tracks. The cover painting says it all--5 wizened men standing somberly behind a crypt. Perfect depiction of the dreary music inside. Back photo is also on track, the five with their eyes closed--Levon's furrowed brow the tipoff. Is it only a rumor that one of the outtakes from the photo session has them holding their noses? Tip: their second lp, The Band, is a must have. Their first, Big Pink, plus one of the many best ofs, is all you need to round it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what you ordered","review":"Be aware that many copies of the Cahoots cd are filled with \\"Stage Fright\\" and not Cahoots.

I've been a fan of The Band since \\"Music from Big Pink\\" came out. When \\"Cahoots\\" arrived, I could not understand the lack of critical acclaim and still don't. No, it is not as good as their first two. That's like saying \\"Nashville Skyline\\" wasn't as good as \\"Blonde on Blonde.\\" You just can't compare all of an artist's works to their masterpieces. This is a solid Band album, and some of the songs match any they ever wrote. \\"While the Moon Struck One\\" is a brilliant evocation of childhood, and the duet with Van Morrison on \\"4% Pantomime\\" is just great. \\"Life is a Carnival\\" and \\"When I Paint My Masterpiece\\" rank with anything on \\"Big Pink\\", and \\"The River Hymn\\" could have fit right in with \\"Unfaithful Servant\\". Many people and critics preferred \\"Stage Fright\\", but Cahoots is just as well performed, better written, and shows more maturity."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a good record","review":"I bouught this thinking it would be a load of crap, based on the reviews. Cahoots is very good, if not a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't skip this one","review":"Don't pass this album up. It has gotten a bad rap because as a whole it's defenitely not as good as the first three. With that said, \\"Last of the Blacksmiths\\" belongs right up there with \\"King Harvest\\" and \\"Old Dixie.\\" That song is worth the price of the album itself, a well written song with an amazing vocal performance by Richard Manuel. \\"Endless Highway\\" is also one of The Band's very best(however the live version on \\"Before the Flood\\" is even better). The rest of the album is very listenable, much better than just about anything being released by bands today. If you're a fan of The Band, this album is just as essential as every one of their albums, don't pass it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"I am disappointed by this book; primarily because the home featured on the cover (the reason I boughtthe book) is NOT featured in the book itself.

The texture is also slightly on the chewy side, although this could easily reflect my own poor baking skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"TASTES LIKE BEANS","review":"Like all bob's red mill mixes this tastes strongly of beans.The cake looked great and unlike most GF mixes this bag made a two layer cake, lovely, but the smell of the batter and the taste of the finished cake was AWFUL.

I am going to make my own gluten-free cake with rice flour and whatever else I can find. This is okay if you plan to slather it with sweet toppings, like a big scoop of ice cream per slice, but as a plain piece of cake, not so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most disgusting cake I've ever tasted!","review":"I made this cake as directed and it was absolutely disgusting.

After one bite everyone said similar things like gross..or what is wrong with this cupcake. Again I made it as directed and it was gross. I am really surprised since I liked the last gluten free cake mix I bought at the grocery store. If you really want to try this brand I suggest buying a single package instead of the 4 pack at amazon since you will likely have to throw out 3 bags.

Then I made Cherrybrook Kitchen Chocolate Frosting Mix (which is also Gluten Free) and mixed it together. Let it chill in the freezer and shaped with a melon-baller into small balls. Chilled again in the freezer. Then I put a toothpick in each ball and dipped the balls into Wax Orchards Classic Fudge (Fat Free, Fruit-Sweetened Dark Chocolate Sauce...also gluten free). Then I froze overnite. I served with fresh strawberries and pecans. It was awesome, so delicious, and everyone loved. No one would think this was gluten free. It could be dairy free too but I'm allergic to soy and didn't find a dairy free butter or margarine that didn't have soy so I used goat butter in the cake, butter and ghee in the frosting and rice milk in both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst gluten-free cake I've ever tasted","review":"This brand usually has excellent products, but my experience with this cake mix was a disaster. I carefully followed the recipe, and ended up with something that was hardly edible at all - a very weird, metallic/burnt rubber taste (I also gave a try to their gluten-free baking mix, and the same thing happened. I had to throw everything away, no one could eat it).I wonder if the garbanzo flour could be what makes it taste so odd. In any case, I would strongly recommend to have a back-up cake if you are baking this one for a party."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Gluten free masterpiece from Bob's!","review":"So chocolaty and moist, makes wonderful cupcakes.

The movie as a whole is unappealing and boring, but it is memorable for David Lynch's performance. He plays the romantic interest for Isabella Rosselini. He plays a butler. He plays a man acting out a lie to curry favor with a woman. Did you know that David Lynch was this versatile an actor? His performance is sweetly sympathetic, a description that is not often attributed to Lynch, whose directorial efforts are notoriously off-kilter (though I personally find them hilariously in-tune with real life). If you enjoy Lynch, rent this movie just to see him in front of the camera. It is a joy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic, gut-wrenching pornography","review":"Full of non-consensual sex, racist humor, and poor imitation German accents, this movie reaches for the bottom of the barrel.

If your a godzilla fan, your gonna like this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly Bland, Garden Variety Soundtrack","review":"When I first saw Final Wars one of the things that bothered me most was the music. Though it fitted the style of the movie by being fast paced and modern, it seemed very average, like a score written for some direct-to-video sci-fi flick. It is definate that fans will automatically compare this soundtrack to the work of Akira Ifukube, and that it is all around weaker than Akira's scores (only few of which appear in the film). Even people who have not seen other Godzilla movies and have nothing to compare the music to will find it fairly generic. Of course, there will be many who disagree with me, and if you are one of the many Final Wars fanboys then you will probably want to pick up this soundtrack. For the rest of you, it's not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Big Flaw","review":"It's very good if you plan on storing CDs only.

But unfortunately, this was merely a demonstration of artist Gerald Brommer applying paint (doesn't even say if paper is wet) and then using a tissue to remove a portion or what he applied....Not even brilliant color, just more and more earth tones and more earth tones!! Holy cow, how dull can it get?! And on top of it all, he doesn't do anything except a few finishing little strokes IN THE STUDIO...There's very little on this tape, for the beginner to intermediate watercolorist-absolutely nothing here for experienced painters.....Save your money and purchase an insightful Robert Wade tape!!

The results are gorgeous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for girls","review":"I got this book when I was 10 it helped me learn what girls my age are about go through as the teen years were approaching. This book helps you understand a lot of things from periods to boys. It gives you a lot of answers to the questions you have. I am 18 now and still have my book, it really does help."},{"rating":"2","title":"just what we needed","review":"I ordered this for my 10-year old daughter and we are very pleased. It is just as described - a good introduction to the topics of puberty without getting into sexual matters more appropriate for older children. It is written in a pleasant and reassuring tone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect start for my 10 year old.","review":"I bought this book for my soon to be 11 year old. She's not immature but she gets embarassed easily when you try to have a serious discussion with her about the facts of life. When the book arrived I thumbed through it real quick to look at the illustrations and the topic points each chapter touched on. I found it was the perfect place to start. She got about half way through with the personal care section when I began to seriously read the rest of the chapters. The book has good information and great pictures for girls in the 9 to 12 year old range. My personal opinion is that older girls may need a different book that touches on deeper issues that come with growing up."},{"rating":"2","title":"10th B-day","review":"We bought this for our daughters 10th birthday.

We will keep it going , recomending to friends that have daughters ,nieces or granddaughters!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I recommend this book","review":"I really liked this book because it told me about a lot of things I've been wondering about. I'm the youngest in my fourth grade class and some of the other girls have been talking about periods and I didn't know what it was all about exactly. Mom and I read the whole book together and now I understand and won't be scared or confused when my time comes. I think every girl should get this book - it's great. The pictures help to understand the things written in each chapter."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is the best book I have read for girls growing up!","review":"The care and keeping of You book, covers areas that I would not have ever thought I needed to discuss with my 10 year old daughter. It is done in a way that girls can relate to. I wish I had a book like this growing up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has been wonderful for my daughter","review":"This book is wonderful for my eight-year-old daughter. She and her friends sit around and read it. I am going to buy one for all my neices for Christmas. It really opens them up to talking about the changes a girl faces growing up - and if they are afraid to talk about anything, atleast they have a place to find their answers. It is written in language a pre-teen can understand. I wish this book was around when I was a kid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Be Afraid!","review":"I really liked this book because it lets you know all about puburty and explains that there may be times where you want to run and hide in a closet but there is nothing to be afraid of."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great resource for girls & parents!","review":"My daughter is nine years old and growing up fast! My husband and I read this first and then shared it with our daughter. She really enjoys learning about herself and her physcial changes. We also like how it talks about so many important elements of being healthy overall. This is by far the best book I've seen for girls on these topics. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Must have for Pre Teens","review":"My daughter received this book from my mom (after asking if it was ok). It is REALLY great.

I wish they had this when I was my daughter's age."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Conversation Starter","review":"As the Mom of 3 girls, I was looking for a book that wouldn't become outdated and was a basic introduction to puberty. This was a great choice. My 9 yr. old daughter really enjoyed it. We read it together and then I left it in her room for her to review on her own. I think it was a great resource and was very helpful in opening the lines of communication."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross","review":"I thought it was nasty.Don't read it!Because I'm a boy!I looked at my sisters!So your business is now discovered!Ha!Ha!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A word of warning","review":"I bought it when I was 9, lead by the low age recommendation.For awhile I wanted such things as in this book to happen to me, but that quickly subsided, and I became terrified of such things, convinced they would happen to me THAT day.I don't worry about such things any more; wanting to be an actress saved meBut to parents - do you want your daughter's childhood to be spoiled with such?My advice; ignore this book; its horribly forward, does just what they claim not to - pushes you to grow up too fast. But if you must give it, wait untill she's at least 13."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I bought this for my 9 year old. It's perfect for her to read and she enjoys all the information. When she has a question about something, she'll ask me. The book makes it easier for me as a mom to bring up certain topics and we can easily talk about things. Where was this book when I was growing up?"},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER AWESOME BOOK!!!","review":"I'm 12 so I have been going through ALOT of changes and this has been a great help!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I hoping for","review":"I read several reviews on this book \\"The care & keeping of you\\" and finally decided to purchase it for my daughter that will soon be nine. I was apprehensive and opened immediately when it arrived and started reading. It is very imformative and I think ideal for the pre-teen to early teen. Even though I'm a nurse, I didn't know how I was going to dive in to some of these topics (periods, body hair, breast development etc). I think this will be the perfect read, together with my daughter. It also has pictures that get the point across without being too graphic in nature or too childish. It also touches base on other topics...teasing, name calling, feelings of being different etc. Overall, I think it is a very good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good place to start","review":"This is a great book to start with when your young girl knows nothing. It is a gentle, positive, and simple book about what girls need to know about their bodies changing in puberty, and also addresses things about personal grooming and self-esteem. It does not address anything about boys or sexuality, which is fine for us for now. We will need more a little later, when she's ready for the next step of knowledge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for single fathers","review":"Being a single father and having 2 pre teen girls, somethings scare the bejezus otta me, esp what is coming up in their lives.

It gradaually moves along from the easy stuff to the uncomfortable stuff. It reads easily and is great to answer most of the FAQ's. The pictures are drawn so its not to dramatizing for the sensitive. My daughter was afraid to shave and had many questions that she didn't know how to ask. The assitance of this book was able to help her put those questions into words. Highly recommend it for the pre-tween years. I started at 9 years old with this book, but I probably could have started 6 months earlier. This book provided me and my daughter with some great one on one time as well. I read it while she listened and looked, which is something we don't do often since she can read on her own now. Its been a nice addition to our family and I will use it with the other 3 daughters I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is factual, reassuring, and empowering.","review":"Are you nervous about talking to your child about puberty? Feel like you're not sure what to say? I purchased this years ago for my daughter, and purchased it again recently for a friend's daughter. It was wonderful for her. If you have a daughter who 8 or older (or a precocious or curious slightly younger girl, perhaps), please buy her this book! It's one thing to learn in school about the changes your body will go through, it's even better to have a mom or older sister who will tell you about the facts, but it's even better to be able to have this book to read and re-read at your leisure. Having the book at home means the information is available whenever they get curious, and whenever something else changes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transitional time","review":"This is a great book to aid your daughter thru her transition to middle school and puberty. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love love love","review":"Cant say enough great things about this book. It is a wonderful way to teach/show preteens about their bodies and what will happen. Nothing sexual about it. Was a little unsure about the tampon inserting pages but my 10 year old thought nothing of it. She keeps it under her bed and I see her looking at it often. I especially like the way it talks about being moody and it healthily says to get some exercise or take a walk. Such a great option,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent first time book for pre-teens","review":"I bought this book for my 10 year old daughter after reviewing and agreeing on the tampon pictures being a little to graphic. But other than that its a wonderful book, she has read it at least 10 times and ask me tons of questions which makes me feel good that she can communicate with me and feels that she can ask questions. I would recommend this to any parent with a pre-teen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the right amount of information","review":"The best thing about this book is that it provides a stepping off point for many discussions to come. My daughter will be turning 9 the week after she receives this book for Christmas, but is already beginning to develop physically. We have discussed things in the past but this will explain it ALL, and without drawing boys into the discussion. She is ready for, and NEEDS, more in depth discussions regarding what is going on with her body, but is still too young to discuss actual sex and sexuality in my opinion. This book is *perfect* for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loved it","review":"My daughter loved the book! The format and the information was great! Every was explained very simply with the appropriate amount of information. Every night we discussed what she had read that evening and it gave us time to discuss topics that we had not broached as of yet and it gave her insight into different things. It was good to set the stage for her to be able to come to me with any questions she might have and I know in the future she will be comfortable doing so. It is a good reference book and it was good the way it brought up some \\"untruths\\" some kids believe, or at least pass along, and I was able to nip those in the bud before she heard them from her friends. Now she will know when someone is telling her something that is not true. We enjoyed the book and I would highly recommend it for your daughters or nieces, granddaughters, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addresses Body Image Issues Too!","review":"I was so happy to see that The Care & Keeping of You has some great, age-appropriate messaging regarding body image issues too. My 8 year old has a more athletic build -- not overweight by any means -- than her very thin friends, and she's started comparing herself to other girls. It breaks my heart that this unhealthy comparision has started so early, but I remember doing the same thing myself when I was her age. As much as I try to reassure her, I don't think it really sunk in. This book has been a great help. Just what I was looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for young girls","review":"I bought this book for my 11 year old granddaughter. I was surprised when I first flipped through the book. Never thought it would be so graphic. Very well written and a must have for any young girl. I wish something like this was around when I was young."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very informative","review":"I am 11 about to be 12 soon and I bought the book to learn a little bit more than about my body. The book was TERRIBLE. It talked about brushing your teeth and had cheesy lines like, \\"Compare!,No fair!\\" and quite a few other cheesy lines. I felt like an 8 year old reading it. If you are 11 or even 10 don't buy the book. It won't tell you anything besides things you already knew."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too little info on female anatomy","review":"I skimmed this book and was not very impressed. It lacks information (review the statements by actual kids that were negative) It seems many people are afraid to give the basic facts, and so they buy a book like this that doesnt explain why their bodies get periods. When I was 9 and far from interest in sexual activity, my mother gave me the basics of how my female body works and the very basic mechanics of how babies are made...which if one is not made, a period comes about. A basic female anatomy book and some products in a nice green box which I kept under my bed for my reference. She didnt go into boyfriends, std's, oral or alternative life styles...none of that has to do with girls getting their periods. It has been difficult to find just the basic facts book...but this isnt it...still researching."},{"rating":"1","title":"For very young girls only","review":"This is an okay book for 7 & 8 years olds. It has very little real information about puberty and provides only a broad overview. If you want your girl to have detailed information about the changes her body will undergo, or information about changes in boys and social dangers (std's, unintended pregnancy, etc.), this book provides no information. It is a primary, introductory book at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the BEST book of its kind for pre-teen girls!","review":"This book is truly on-target with its holistic approach to a girls understanding of her whole body, the changes she is undergoing, and good health and grooming. Topics are delighfully illustrated and cover head to toe care includng everything a girl needs to know about teeth and braces,facial care and zit tips, breast development, periods and feminine hygene, exercise, nutrition, and even taking care of \\"the girl inside.\\"It's upbeat, wholesome, candid, and very readable.

A great jumping off place for your own conversations about life with your special girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was looking for","review":"This book is exactly what we needed! My 8-year-old daughter and I just finished reading it together and it was a perfect way to introduce her to puberty and all it entails. It is written for young girls in a way that doesn't talk down to them but is also completely appropriate for girls 8 and up. I appreciated the discussions about the emotions and difficulties girls face during puberty, beyond just the \\"facts.\\" My thanks to the authors! I will be recommending this to all of my mom friends who have girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Care & Keeping of You: The Body Book for Girls (American Girl Library)","review":"The first time I bought this book for my nine year old niece. The second time for my nine year old daughter. Both times a wonderful gift. This book addresses all the questions that young girls have concerning growing up.

She is a 4th grader and had to watch the puberty movie and she was so excited when she got home because she knew everything that was on the movie. She said that she even knew more. It was great because she isn't confused about what she is going through and if she isn't comfortable talking about it with me she reads her book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful for little girls.

GREAT BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I would have loved to have had this book when I was young...","review":"It's extremely matter-of-fact, great illustrations, easy to understand, and most of all, points out that we all go through this difficult time but each of us is unique in our experience. It would have saved me a lot of embarrassment as a pre-teen, and maybe soothed some of that angst. It's definitely great for any young lady in your life, or as a means of getting \\"the talk\\" rolling. A far cry from the nurses' books I learned from!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pre-teen and early teen girls love reading it!","review":"I purchased a large number of these for a group of 5th grade girls in a non-profit school.

I had (3) brothers myself and no clue how to approach my daughter's approaching puberty.BUT! This book gave me the courage to talk about these things with my little girl. She read it in ONE SITTING and immediately felt comfortable about talking to me about these things.I highly recommend it to any dad who doesn't have a female role model in his little girls life. Your going to need all the help you can get. A good church and American Girl are a great start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I pre-read this book before reading it to/with my 11 year old. It has good information, even for girls slightly younger than mine. I found that I had already told her a lot of the same stuff in my own words, but information is always taken more seriously or as more official/trustworthy when it's from a book, at least in our house anyway! So I'm glad I got it and we read it together. I'm happy she has this resource for the coming years.The only con I see is that it goes into great detail about how to use tampons. While my daughter will eventually need to know this, I don't think it's important in the very beginning when she is collecting information about what's happening to her body and hasn't even started menstruating yet. We haven't gotten to that page yet, and I might just try to skip it for now.

Things are discussed in such a good and honest way. She enjoys reading it and it has been very positive.

The way the book is written has made her comfortable approaching me with new questions. Yea!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I really like it","review":"but now that I'm 12 I had to find another book and ask my mom for more stuff, because this book doesn't address sex AT ALL. It's okay for eight-year-olds, or younger if you develop earlier. It could have more info on stuff like anorexia, because I was sort of interested in that. It never said anything about boys, or lesbians, or how babies are made. Otherwise, it was good. They should make an older girls' one.I'm only 12 and at my school I've already kissed boys and my friend got drunk one time and they could have said more about this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too graphic","review":"I looked at several pages of this book online as far as it would let me. I was very disappointed at how graphic parts of the book were when I actually received and reviewed it. It's no wonder that as a potential buyer I wasn't allowed to see some of the content!

Buyer Beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book triggered Anorexia Nervosa","review":"I know two families where reading this book was the trigger for their own daughters' onset of anorexia nervosa.Books for children should not encourage dieting or have information on eating disorders.

I was around 9 at the time, and I didn't think it was particularly amazing or evil. But now, at age 12, I look back at it and realize that the book is badly proportioned, for lack of a better word. The information given is extremely basic (don't we all know how to brush our hair?), yet some of the sections are what I would consider pretty graphic. Cartoonic nudity?

Awesome read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to introduce young girls to body changes.","review":"Finally! I was looking for a book my 10 year old could read without the sexual details. This book is great for girls who are just starting to think about shaving, the shape of their bodies, wether or not to wear a bra, or what a period is. It is a basic guide to taking care of their bodies. I ordered other books I had to return because there were chapters on sexual intercourse, masturbation and birth control. This book has none of that. I can now give my daughter this book to read without having to cut out any pages!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A GOOD Book","review":"My friend had this book and I asked to borrow it. I read it back to front about ten times or more. I really liked the book the first two times I read it but after a while it got kind of boring. It tells you to brush your teeth and how to comb your hair. It told me things I already knew. I wanted it to go more in depth about menstruation, instread of just three pages worth. This book gave me a taste of growing up, but I would buy a book like The Period Book, or Period. if you are eleven or older. Though I have to give this book credit for what it is, and for what it is, it's a great book. I would recommend it for girls 8-10 and their mothers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Puberty Book!","review":"My daughter was barely 8 1/2 when she started developing (well ahead of her peers). This book was perfect! Well written and thorough, it talks about all things related to development and taking care of your body for girls without getting into any sex talk - which was an important thing for me at her age. It even covers the basics like hair and skin care, and dental hygiene. I read through it before she did so I knew what questions to expect, it has been great for encouraging dialogue and making her more comfortable with the entire process. I also sent it over to her dad's house in hopes he'd read it and be at least a little familiar with where she is. I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It depends...overall great book!","review":"Hi,My grandmother bought this book for me when I was around 10 or 11, the book then was very exciting to me, even though the topics about brushing your teeth, and your hair, we already know. But Anyone from ages 9-12 should read this book, yeah it has some cheesy sayings but if you are just looking for a book about periods, emotions, feelings, your body this is a great book, I am 12 year old now and me and my friend that is three years older than me find this book helpful, but it depends on you and your child I suppose, if it is really mature for it's age I would consider a book that has more advanced topics, but this book is great! It teaches about knowing you are, and not buying in to those spam weight lose programs, lots of girls face this, after seeing hundreds of models they think only \\"real\\" people look like that, but really everybody is beautiful! I would recommend this book any day!!!!BUY IT"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful","review":"I bought this for my 9 year old.

I was so excited to have some one on one time with my daughter and go through this book with her, but I'm so disappointed. It just puts a damper on the whole experience.

So if it takes place at the Beatty's circus, who else should play Clyde Beatty but Beatty him.Character actor Pat O'Brien and Sean McClory eat up the action and keep Beatty and Spillane from acting too much (thank Gawd).

Amazing, especially considering that the nominal director, James Edward Grant, once also directed an utterly charming film for Wayne, \\"Angel and The Badman.\\" Actually, William A.

This is a very strange film. With Mickey Spillane showing up to find the who's been sabotaging circus acts and Pat O'Brian literally walking in and out of frame through each of his scenes you just wonder what the producers were thinking. The one saving grace is Sean McClory's demented performance, which seems to mirror the filmmaker's interpretation of the widescreen format.

Sean Penn is a poet who wears suits on a boat that leaks and that floats in the middle of nowhere. He also mumbles philosophical mumbo-jumbo every other scene and drinks wine. Why are they on a boat trying to solve a murder that happened centuries ago on a New England island?

I don't like thick globs, but this even with trying to put on 2-3 coats of it still looks like you are wearing no mascara. Not to mention that it does not even look navy blue in the sun. The only thing this product is good for is to put on TOP of the bright blue mascaras that I have bought thinking they were going to be navy!

I did not have the feeling in the last 100 pages that there was no way the story could wrap up w/in that page timing and the urge to shut out my household so I could finish. I did find myself hunting through my bookshelves wondering what I could read next that would blow me away. I dreaded having to finish this book because I felt it was taking my time away from a better read.On the flip side I did learn a lot about Orthodox Jews.I am curious about here early works; being that this is the second book she's written alone.

This is a great subject for Mr. Davies to expound upon. He does what he does best here, makes you think, gives ideas and the tools to come up with your own philosophies on life and the Universe. Many people say this is a doom and gloom book but I found it quite refreshing to know the Universe may actually continue to exist forever and Humankind may find a way to exist along with it. This is not just a cut and dry here's what'll happen book. It begins like a great Novel that ties you up in suspense and not just another physics textbook. Great EASY reading for anybody curious about our possible future. Some understanding from his previous books is helpful, but NOT a prerequisite. KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK MR. DAVIES."},{"rating":"2","title":"Escape from Yourself and Join the Stars","review":"An elegant book on the ultimate fate of the universe - cosmological speculations based upon well known hard physics - and all very exciting stuff extremely well written, and easily grasped if one remembers any high school science at all.All the subject matter concerns a physical scale (large and small), a time scale (long and short), and a temperature scale (hot and cold) of such stupendously extreme parameters that reading becomes a terrific brain stretching exercise that delightfully removes one from the tiny doings of one's own overly personalized and petty mind circus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read- Too bad it's out of date already","review":"I found Davies' \\"The Last Three Minutes\\" a fascinating read. I meant only to read the preface while I was waiting in the store, but I became immediately engrossed and realised that I had to buy it so that I could finish it. His descriptions about the 2 options of the ultimate fate of the universe (whether it will collapse on itself, or expand forever) are made incredibly clear. Unfortunately, the book was published merely a year before scientists discovered that the universe will indeed expand forever (Deemed \\"the breakthrough of the Year\\" for 1998 by the journal Science). This makes all discussion of \\"the Big Crunch\\" (and about half of the book) purely conjectural. My only problem with the book was his attempts to discuss the ultimate fate of humans and their descendants. I thought that it was a little irrelevant and ought to be left to philosophers rather than cosmologists.All in all, an informative read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are we doomed? :-)","review":"I've known Paul Davies as an exceptional writer of easy-reading scientific books, and this one didn't let me down either. Talking about how the Universe might \\"end\\", we learn first how it begun, and then several ways it could just \\"die\\"! Davies is extremely full of detail about everything he describes, and all that while not using any technical or hard-to-grasp scientific jargon! However, some of the descriptions do get a little off-hand. Those few were a little too much detail than what I'd expect. Overall though, it's another one of Davies's classics, one that after reading it, you'll be searching for ways to spend your 100 trillion billion years left, before the Cosmos dies in a spectacular (or not!) way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Davies does not lives up to his promise.","review":"Davies promises that the last 3 minutes are as important as the first 3 minutes, a la Hawking et alia.

All of the Pooh gang must convince Rabbit to stop worrying about keeping the leaves in a tidy pile and start having fun in them instead. What's especially nice is that Christopher Robbin has the whole gang do a series of little craft projects with the leaves, all of which are easy for little ones to do and require only things you tend to have in the house (e.g. paper, crayons, glue and paint).

Maybe its because I am not an introspective person and do not enjoy meditating on past problems. From the first chapter I found myself getting very annoyed with the main character who seemed to spend her life worrying about her daughter's problems, looking out of the window at a field of wheat or making light conversation with a local farmer. This went on and on. Sure my family have problems too but I don't live with them or have them on my doorstep. She should not have invited them to spend the summer with her and then get overly concerned in their affairs.The book went on and on in this manner and I felt the writer did not know how to finish it until the final chapter.

Durbin does a lackluster job at clearly explaining the concept of coding theory. There are also many errors in the answer key which definitely lead to confusion especially for newcomers.On a positive note, I found the section on frieze and crystallographic groups an icebreaker in the seemingly endless blurb of unclear information."},{"rating":"2","title":"A comprehensive and concise introduction to Algebra.","review":"As a first year student studying maths at Trinity College Dublin I have found this book very helpful. Our lecturer in Algebra sticks closely to the format of the book and almost uses it as his lecture notes. The book is very student friendly and gives a lot of good examples along the way.

The author views two main male characters to be found. Solomon is the secondary person and a \\"dark force in the drama\\" (page 246). The woman is a member of Solomon's harem but is in love with someone else.A major issue to be addressed is the allegorical vs. literal interpretation.

It took me more than a decade to \\"discover\\" it, but I look at that as just another case of \\"better late than never.\\" Many examples of The Outlaws trademark guitar jamming can be found on here, but there are also some real songwriting gems such as \\"Steam on the Blacktop,\\" which ranks as one of my very favorite Outlaws songs of all time. It's one of those \\"sticks in your head and hum it all day\\" types of songs. All in all, this is another quality album from a band that has always deserved more acclaim than they have received."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good and some bad","review":"I found some passages quite good but others seem harsh and critical.

It adds the spiritual dimension to making daily choices that are healthy and honorable with a scripture reference, short application, and a clincher statement that makes you laugh or dig deeper. Great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and self-absorbed","review":"This review refers to the unbridged audio CD version of this book. I listened to the first two discs but couldn't continue further. Diane's voice makes me very uncomfortable. This book is about THEIR marriage. It is not for everybody else. All the time they are talking about their life together, which is just a small portion of the typical lives of marriage. And they talked sooooo many details, which bored me. It's like you lived their frustrating life again. Unless you and your partner are exactly like them - highly uncompatible at the beginning, this book cannot provide much useful advice. Actually, I was wondering what motivates them to write such a book and if anybody else except them will ever enjoy reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreary!","review":"Oh my gosh.

It had a brief introduction to Evolution that was informative but basic to what you would learn in the first few weeks of a college level biology class. All around a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor reading - at best!","review":"And here I was hoping to find a solid foundation to fight of the creationsists. The book is more philosophical than scientific, and it is very very DRY reading. He does have some points that are good, but you have to be awake to notice them. Not for the casual non-scientific reader!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Evolutionistic Myths Masquerading as Facts","review":"As a typical dogmatic evolutionist, imagines that trivial changes in populations of living organisms add up to evidence for molecules-to-man evolution. They do no such thing! For a comprehensive refutation of this book, see the chapter \\"Kitcher Abuses Science\\" in Duane Gish' book, Creation Scientists Answer Their Critics. Not everything the author says is myth. To his credit, author Kitcher acknowledges that the only alternative to organic evolution is special creation (horror of horrors). Very few of his fellow evolutionists are this honest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the case it claims to be","review":"Kitcher's book continues the unfair diatribes against any scientist who questions the sacred cow of evolutionary theory. His so-called case against the creationist model fails to establish its case because the plain fact is, as more and more evolutionary scientists are privately admitting, the case for evolutionary theory continues to crumble in the face of ever increasing legitimate scientific knowledge. As is the case with all anti-creationist books, Kitcher attempts to settle the question by defining science only within the framework of naturalistic philosophy. Evolutionists hate it when this fact is pointed out; nevertheless, it has been sufficiently documented by such writers as Phillip Johnson. If Kitcher feels so strongly that creationism \\"abuses\\" science, he should debate a top-notch creationist such as Kent Hovind, Duane Gish, or Johnson."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Other Side","review":"I admit having not read this book. However, I believe if someone is going to read a book attacking Creationism that person should also see the argument from the other side. I understand the author has talked about Creationism in this book. I'm sure he gave it from an evolutionists point-of-view. You should see Creationism from the Creationists point-of-view. A good suggestion of the Creation Science Evangelism Seminar by Dr. Kent Hovind. You can find it at chick.com or drdino.com. It's seven video seminars. He also has a bet going on. A large sum of money to anyone with any scientific evidence supporting evolution.

If you want the entire self-titled album by the band, you need to get the album titled Classic Collection; it is the complete first album with selections from their second, Subway Serenade.

This helmet is designed for people with 55-61 CM heads. My head is 59.25 cm, so I was a bit worried about fit because I'm on the high end of the scale. But the helmet fits perfectly and is very comfortable. I don't even notice that I'm wearing it. It's also extremely solid and feels very durable compared to the other helmets I've worn.On the downside, I look pretty goofy when I'm wearing it. That's not a big deal to me -- if my head is safe, I'm happy. But if style is important to you, I'd at least consider a racing helmet instead of this commuter helmet. Imagine yourself wearing a doubly-thick baseball helmet that's had the ear protection removed. That's how this looks."},{"rating":"2","title":"so far so good","review":"I have only worn this helmet a few times, but it fits well and is pretty comfortable. It was a great bargain and I got the silver which looks great. It's definitely not a swoopy looking helmet, but I think all of them look goofy so I am not bothered by the way it looks. the only complaint is that when I try to pull the strap in the back down to make it more comfortable, I hit the adjusting wheel and have to tighten it again. However, I think that's because I'm still used to my old helmet that had a different mechanism in the back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good helmet","review":"This helmet comes with very good instructions that show you how to correctly adjust it so that it can protect your head properly.

I'm very pleased with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good helmet if your head is normal size","review":"The Bell Citi Helmet is one that can accommodate the Bell Flip Mirror. That was my main criteria for selecting bike helmets as I love that mirror. This helmet is conservatively shaped and fits most people well. I think it would give good protection, is light weight as any bike helmet and has plenty of vents for cooling. The Bell Citi Helmet comes in only one shell size. With my large head, I can just barely get it on. It would be too tight if I should decide to wear ski mask type head covering for cold weather riding or if my short hair is allowed to grow. I think the price for a good serviceable bike helmet should be under $50 and this one was on sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great helmet!

It didn't have much action, and it was kind of dull. I liked to story, and I liked how we got to know the characters, but this is not one of my favorites. I am glad I read it, because it was intersting, but I don't think people, like me, who are not to hot on history, would enjoy is as much as some other of Kathyrn Laskey's books.

Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"True North","review":"When I started reading the book True North, I really thought it was a very good book. The novel was about two girls who meet and were both headed North to freedom together. My favorite part of the book is when the two girls meet and traveled North to freedom with courage. I really liked the ending of the book because life changed for both of the girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abominable Book","review":"True North is possibly the most abominable novel in the entire cosmos. The two plots (plot 1 being the dillapidated Lucy and her disgusting grandfather, plot 2 is about the slave Afrika escaping from the slave catchers) are underdeveloped pieces of horrible atrocities. The two main characters, Lucy and Afrika, only exacerbated the horror of the vile book. The plots were so simple, I guessed the ending within 20 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"True North = True Boredom","review":"As my school's academic pentathalon's required reading, I began to read this book believing that this would be an intriguing, insightful book, but I soon learned that I was wrong. As I followed the main character, Afrika, on her journey through the Underground Railroad, my mind quickly began to follow sleep cycles as the plot dragged on and on about an escaping slave and a spoiled Massachusetts girl. As an insult to literature and an irksome task to read, this book is even too small to serve as a functioning doorstop. After building up the Massachusetts girl's character through the entire book, her character only is relevant to the main plot near the end of the book. If it is at all within your power or if you value yourself, refrain from reading this book; but if you believe in self-torture, this is the book for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If I Took Even One Sniff It Would Bore Me Terriff...ically","review":"The Voice at it's purest.

This is American popular Jazz at it's very best.SWING EASY, as the name implies, is even more swingin', though the tunes are not as well known as those on SONGS FOR YOUNG LOVERS.

The games for infants suggested are very obvious, common sense ideas, like picking your baby up and flying her in airplane style.

My child is only 3 months old, and I didn't find much for her here at all. Lots of the text is devoted to nursery rhymes and songs. The rhymes you can get from other sources.

I love to watch his stand-up routines, his comedy specials, and his movies. HOWEVER, there's one big thing you need to consider before purchasing this album, something I did not consider. Listening to Robin Williams' stand-up comedy without accompanying video is like watching other stand-up comedians without sound. Half of his jokes end with silent actions, as he does his spastic convulsions, facial contortions, and other spontaneous slapstick. It is utterly frustrating and confounding to listen to an audience roar with laughter, while you're sitting there wondering what Robin Williams was doing, and why this stupid album wasn't recorded with a camera.With audio only, this is just not very funny, or fun. You will spend a lot of time frowning, and only occasionally laugh when a joke comes along that didn't involve actions.

Sure, Death From Above does not match up to these classic bands, but they do rock hard - harder than most bands out today, besides corny nu-metal. The two instrument combo thing does get a bit tedious, which is why I could never give these guys a 5-star review, but still, they do it better than most have. This album is full of energy. It's like musical coffee - it just makes you want to move, and not in that Franz Ferdinand way, if you know what I mean.

Most of the songs such as the title \\"Your a Woman, I'm a machine\\" are pure hard edge, gripping the seats punk, but the last song on the album has funk written all over it.

With each piece we make the noise of the animal, (many of which coincide with her favorite book - Moo Baa La La La by Sandra Boynton) and she loves it. The stickers seem pretty sensitive to moisture and the edges have faded a bit where she has sucked on them (or where I have maybe cleaned them a bit too much), but beyond that, I highly recommend this toy for every little one out there.

Who knows what adhesives my child could have ingested?!? Terrible.I'm currently trying to return the item directly to Melissa & Doug and will not be ordering from them again. We contacted the company and they claim to have never heard of this problem before. That's when I got on Amazon and saw several other reviews about the shoddy quality and false product statements.It's tough to find a well made SOLID wooden puzzle anywhere. Maybe I should just make my own. I'm glad my wife and I caught this before our 10 month old began putting it in her mouth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Starter Puzzle","review":"I bought this for my daughter when she was 7mos old. She loves it...the large knobs make it easy for young babies to pick up and manipulate the shapes. She hasn't quite figured out how to put the pieces back, she has however, learned to use the pieces as musical, banging instruments!I love the quality of this product and plan to purchase more of Melissa and Doug products."},{"rating":"2","title":"very simple","review":"It is ok for the very young and the knobs are fine. The cutout shapes are very simplistic. However, it is colorful."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kis love this puzzle","review":"My kids really played a lot with this puzzle while they were toddlers.And now that they are 5 and 7 sometimes they still play with it. Highly recommended!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great puzzle","review":"Great puzzle! Stands up to my rough and tumble eighteen month old. She love to make the sounds of the animals as she plays with them! Would recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, sturdy puzzle","review":"I bought this for my 9 month old daughter for Christmas. The recommended age is 12 months and up. The pieces are big enough I am not afraid of her choking on them, but once she mouthed them for a little while, the edges of the pictures started dissolving... Not what I wanted to happen to such an expensive puzzle. I bought it on sale, so I am pleased with the value for the sale price, but I do think I will wait a little while before she gets to play with it unsupervised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute as can be","review":"My toddler loves this. It is very cute and the quality is great. Keep water away from it though. I accidentally got a couple drops on it and the edges started peeling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contains LEAD- Potentially toxic for your child!","review":"I bought two of the Melissa and Doug puzzles and decided to test them for lead before letting my 9 month old chew on the pieces. This type of puzzle came up POSITIVE FOR LEAD using Lead Check swabs! I would rethink buying one of these as lead exposure has been linked to numerous health problems. This company claims to offer safe, non-toxic toys that they rigorously test for the presence of chemicals. I was initially glad to find toys made from \\"wood\\" rather than the usual plastic. After finding lead in this puzzle meant for toddlers, I am appalled at how little we actually know as consumers in this country. Please do not give this puzzle to any child! Who knows how many other Melissa and Doug products contain the same materials... they have certainly lost a customer in me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Puzzle is not solid wood","review":"The description of this puzzle says, \\"solid wood\\" It's not! It's 2 layers of composite board glued to plywood. The fibers easily scrape off along the edges and can be ingested by your child. The pictures are a laminate overlay that can easily be peeled off. Not a great puzzle if you child is still putting toys in his or her mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wood back almost instantly peeled","review":"My daughter (13 months) received this toy as a present and really loved playing with it. It's very educational and I loved the wood structure of it. But in just a couple of days the back of the main wood frame started peeling leaving raw edges on the surface and sides. Just what you would need to get a splinter. So now we don't use the board any more. But my daughter still continues to play with the removable pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made toy.","review":"The idea of this puzzle is wonderful. However it is made incredibly poorly. The edges of the animals and farmer are rough and shed endless wood debris. I have tried wiping the pieces down with a damp cloth, but the edges keep shedding.I would love to find a puzzle made out of solid wood and not the thousand layers of plywood that composes this product. It's simply annoying and messy, do not spend any money on this toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"The puzzle is very cute and made from durable ply wood. I really wanted to like this product, BUT the animals are not painted, but stickers were used. My daughter chewed on the pieces and I saw that after a few minutes, the sticker came of at the sides and she probably swallowed parts of it. Can only recommend it if your kid is not putting anything in its mouth anymore. But at that point, it will probably have more fun with more complex wooden puzzle than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great toy, but NOT handpainted","review":"This puzzle is cute and a great size for little hands. However, it is NOT handpainted. The pictures are stickers. If your little one is still mouthing things it will quickly disintegrate in their mouth. I also can't imagine that they will last as long as the originally handpainted puzzles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par.","review":"I had an older Melissa and Doug puzzle Knob farm puzzle. It was great! Solid wood, nicely cut out. My son loved it. We lost a couple pieces so I ordered a new one. I was very disappointed. The workmanship was shoddy, the pieces were poorly cut out. NOT solid wood, when my 11 month old son chewed on the piece it was like cardboard and puffed up. The old puzzle was painted. This new one has a cheap looking sticker on it that peels off. He has more fun playing with the pieces of the old one, than the new one."},{"rating":"2","title":"puzzle","review":"Bright, fun, colorful, thick, extremely Sturdy! Worth the cost. I would recommend this item to kids 18 months and up"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great puzzle for little hands","review":"We love the Melissa and Doug Large Knob puzzles. They are very easy for a one year old to play with. She loved this puzzle as soon as we look it out of the box. The fun thing about this puzzle is we can talk about animals while she is also working on fine motor skills. If you have found other puzzles hard for your child - try one of the large knob puzzles. They are great starter puzzles and much less frustrating for little hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoyed","review":"1st I don't understand why when searching for this product on Amazon I was directed to this vender where it is 3 dollars more expensive then one from Amazon and a pain to return. 2nd The puzzle I received has wood splits all over it that are not depicted in any picture I've seen of it. Not Happy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reflective & Provoking","review":"I like many others have eagerly anticipated the release of this album. It was well worth the wait! I have been able to listen to a majority of the songs prior to the release. Each song has its own signature, but all of them seem to flow seamless straight through to the end.He seems to have this great passion & understanding of what makes you sit down and think each and every day. Every time I listen to this album, I am moved to reflect on the lyrics and the melodies. It provokes a lot of thoughts and expressions that I wasn't aware of.It is a very good album to have on in the background at a small gathering of your closest friends. It doesn't shout, it doesn't scream, as most music is apt to do nowadays. I am eagerly anticipating Tony's follow-up and will remain a loyal fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing new artist","review":"Tony Lucca is definitely one of the most amazing new artists out..

I was hooked from then on. I was lucky enough to catch him last December when he was in Boston with JC. He's absolutely WONDERFUL in concert. He totally rocked the house.Great album, amazing voice, beautiful lyrics. My favorite tracks: Catch Me, Bad Guy, She's True, Happily Ever After, and Los Angeleno."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!!!","review":"THIS ALBUM IS GREAT... anyone and everyone should get a copy!A note for the guys: the girls go crazy over this artist"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST NEW ARTIST","review":"Tony is a true artist. Any musician who can put his soul into his lyrics and express that to all his fans is absolutely amazing and worthy of owning his cd.

Tony Lucca is the real deal. When I listen to \\"Shotgun,\\" I feel the lyrics and the emotion that went into writing the songs. That in itself is rare. Coupled with his smooth vocals and killer guitar and piano skills, Lucca has delivered a perfect first label release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great new talent!","review":"Tony Lucca's newest album, Shotgun, is very refreshing sound in a stale industry, something everyone is sure to love. With catchy upbeat songs like Rollercoaster, Shotgun, and the new single Catch Me and moving ballads like Happily Ever After and She's True the disc has something different to offer each listener. Tony's been around for awhile, but the world is about to experience what some of us have known and cherished for years. The sounds of the album is great, it doesn't sound overly produced like some other \\"guy and a guitar\\" acts out there. If you love music, check out Tony Lucca!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For lovers of singer-songwriters everywhere!","review":"All I can say about this album is that it is inspirationalamazingbeautifultimelessinspiringmindblowing!!! I love it and I can listen to it for hours and find something else I love about it. Not only is Tony an amazing guitarist, but his lyrics are universal and allow all of his listeners to relate in some way. Also, if you love his CD, seeing him live will have you hooked forever because he has developed a way to come across on stage even more powerfully than he does on the CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album of 2004","review":"I am a long time Tony fan. I was looking forward to this album for months and was expecting it to be good. It exceeded my expectations. This album is GREAT. Perfect for cruising in your car listening to. Easy to sing along to. Go buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"He's young and talented","review":"The first time that I saw Tony Lucca perform was at the \\"Spreckles\\" theater in San Diego. He was opening up for JC Chasez and I never heard any of his songs before; so this was going to be all new to me. When I was listening to him sing I was really amazed by how strong his voice is. He definitely is passionate about his music and you can see that on stage. I also met him after the show and he is a nice and sweet guy! Just listening to him that night on stage I told myself that I would buy the c.d when it came out. When I got the c.d I was NOT disappointed and I highly recommend it. It's definitely a different kind of cd that no one would expect a 27 year old to make. I wish him all the success because he deserves it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Support Talent - Buy This Album!","review":"Tony Lucca is an extremely talented singer-songwriter and this, his third album, proves it yet again. Top songs include \\"Someone To Love You,\\" \\"Bad Guy,\\" and \\"Roller Coaster.\\" You'll love his sincere lyrics and wonderful melodies. Give his album a listen - and check out his website www.tonylucca.com. Good music deserves to be heard - spread the word!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you need a \\"happy album\\"?","review":"I've been listening to too many of Frank's moody concept albums lately -- this is a welcome relief from \\"Only the Lonely\\" and \\"Where Are You.\\" \\"Come Dance with Me\\" is a fun, happy collection, and the orchestra is fabulous (I agree with the reviewer who said the horns leap out of the speakers). This is music that you can listen to frequently and not really get tired of it. As someone else posted, this album is exuberant. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Put on your Basie boots: tonight will swing!","review":"Yeah! This is vintage Frank, with many swinging tunes. We know from his films with Gene Kelly that he could hold his own on the dance floor, which makes his invitation that much more irresistible. He sways, he swoons and he croons, all so effortlessly. His voice and the accompaniment, courtesy Billy May and gang, are flawless. Two highlights for me are the duets with Keely Smith, \\"Nothing in Common\\" and \\"How Are Ya Fixed For Love,\\" though \\"Cheek to Cheek,\\" \\"Something's Gotta Give\\" and \\"The Last Dance\\" are also tops. This CD is one to lift your mood and get you to dance and sing along. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"yowza!","review":"Frank is Frank. Always a pleaser. And this version of Cheek to Cheek is a crazy swingin' upbeat ditty that you won't be able to get out of your head. On top of that - the band on this disc is SMOKIN'!! They are clear, sharp and spot on awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one is a gasser","review":"If as Ellington said \\"It don't mean a thing if it aint got that swing\\" this CD is an encyclopedia of meaning! It is Sinatra and Billy May at their very best. If only albums made today could be filled to the rim with such great stuff. He ditches the urbanity of Swingin Lovers and Swingin Affair and gets into the thick of things here in what is truly SUPERSWING."},{"rating":"1","title":"They ruined my favorite!!!!!!","review":"This used to be the best upbeat Sinatra record. It was a perfect concept album: a collection of swinging tunes about dancing that ends up with the ballad \\"The Last Dance\\". Perfect closure.Not anymore. Now the damned thing - Energizer Bunny like - just keeps on going! Four more tracks, some from a different session! Just cause some corporate jerk wanted to charge a few bucks extra.At least they didn't add those infernal \\"alternate takes\\" that plague CD reissues these days.If I were you I'd hunt down the old CD or even the LP release. They are much more satisfying records."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was hoping for","review":"I guess I don't dig old blue eyes enough.. Oh well. I thought I would enjoy the big band sound but on this cd it came off as annoying and harsh. Plus I know how conceited this guy was and it takes away from me being able to enjoy his talent sometimes."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Put On Your Basie Boots!\\"","review":"Even considering his albums with Basie and Ellington, Sinatra's \\"Come Dance With Me\\" album remains his most sustained set of hard driven, relentless swing.Billy May's charts (he doesn't give a soloist an even break on this one) are sensational and Sinatra sings with the pulse of a great drummer...listen, for example, to his second rendering of the bridge on \\"Just In Time\\" or the way he and May practically rewrite \\"I Could Have Danced All Night.\\"The remastered CD is top notch with bonus tracks that include two duets with the great Keely Smith and the tremendously underrated \\"Same Old Song and Dance\\"..This is pop singing and arranging at its zenith!Note \\"Come Dance With Me\\" won Sinatra and May Grammy awards (best arrangement and male vocal performance--sort of making up for the Academy moronically passing over Sinatra and Riddle's 'Only the Lonely' album the year before) and stayed on the charts for more than 2 years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A hard driving classic!","review":"This is fun album! You can literally cut up a rug by dancing to this album. Two very minor drawbacks: Some of the songs would have been nice with some strings and the LAST DANCE is a bit too slow.....But this is one of Frank's best. Billy lets his typical humor in arranging shine through. He was a superb arranger and more versatile than some people know. Just listen to COME FLY ME WITH ME and/or TRILOGY.ONE LAST NOTE: I own the non-20/24 bit remastered CD which came out around 1991. Both of them are remastered from the original 3 track masters; the earlier one was done on 16 bit and is much more faithful to the original master tapes. My advice, STAY AWAY from the Bob Norberg 20/24 bit remasters on CAPITOL."},{"rating":"2","title":"More over-the-top than the Nelson Riddle albums.","review":"I agree with the raves. The first ten songs on this album are all great (the tacked-on ones are execrable), both the compositions and the performances. Billy May's arrangements may initially jar the ear of the listener used to Nelson Riddle's lushness, but the deliriously up-tempo, brassy, and even a little endearingly dated sound really enthrall. I live in Miami Beach and I would consider this album a kind of anthem for the place with its opulence, whimsy and elegant vulgarity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something's Gotta Get !","review":"The one song that does it for me on this CD is \\"Something's Gotta Give\\". Listen, and you'll be snapping your fingers, tapping your toes, and smling large.

The book does make good points, however, about the Lincoln-Douglas debates and Lincoln's failures in life up to that point. Serious students of Lincoln and the Civil War should read it.

The bed is no problem to put together. It's not super sturdy, so once it's all set up it, it's best to leave it alone. The cushion is very thin, but I just put an extra blanket down. At first my dog was really dubious about the whole thing - she's afraid of everything, so it wasn't totally surprising that she'd be freaked out by a bed. I put the cushion on the floor for a few days. Once my dog got used to sleeping on the cushion, I moved it up onto the dog bed frame. Now she sleeps in it all the time. It's absolutely adorable. My husband thinks I'm crazy for spending so much on a bed for a dog, but I think it's worth it for such a cute product. My dog is 12.5 pounds and just fits.

(On-line help tends to be a great reference tool but it's always hard to learn from.) I then purchased the Delphi Developer&#65533;s Guide, which seems to be regarded as the best book on the subject. Although a superb book in its own right, its not aimed at beginners. I have now completed the Sam&#65533;s Delphi 4 in 21 days, and let me say, it&#65533;s a terrific book for beginners, which teaches in a lesson format, which is actually surprisingly easy and fun to follow.

Instead of making you gothrough 5 chapters just to learn about 2 or 3 topics, he hits you with it at a pretty quick pace. This book includes almost everything in Delphi, except for some advanced topics, etc. I'm overall very impressed. The only reason I gave the book 4 stars is because it is somewhat misleading about who the book is for. It says it assumes no prior programming experience but, in my opinion you'd have much more of an advantage in reading this book by knowing some basic programming concepts & terminology.

I have been unpleasantly surprised at many omisions and some things missing which are just plain common sense. For example the book doesn't highlight, scripts or differentiate in any matter many things such as when telling the user \\"change the name property\\". It would help if \\"name\\" was in a different typeset. This also applies to other properties.Chapter 3, Classes, is not intuitive for an absolute beginner and could be left for a much later date in the 21 days plan.If you, or the person you are planning to buy the book' already knows programming and just want to learn Delphi this is ok, however for absolute beginner I find this book to be very poor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only for a happy few","review":"I'll be up front about this: director Allan Mindel is a very good friend of mine and I have witnessed in awe the making of his first feature. Allan's struggle and tenacity paid off. This is not a movie that only requires a one-time viewing. I have seen it projected now 6 times - and it gets better. And better. And better. Only true film watchers will appreciate this splendid work. On the surface it is a simple story but there are so many subtle layers that watching it on DVD is the perfect medium. I recommend watching it at least once a month. It will improve your quality of life.Enjoy, you lucky few!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised","review":"I bought the Dvd as the title was intriguing. Knowing it was an indie film, I didn't expect much. I was so pleasantly surprised. The acting is very heartfelt and I loved the storyline. Having someone in my family who is mentally challenged, the behavior toward Albert seemed very real to me. A story of redemption, a story of hope. I really enjoyed this little film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncompelling and lackluster","review":"This is the kind of film which the director and screenwriter thought would be really quirky and deep, but ends up being a boring, predictable train wreck.

If you are up for that challenge, if you are wanting more out of your christian walk, if you are a WARRIOR, this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very different view of SonShip","review":"I've had this book for over 10 years and from time to time I have tried to understand what Russell's view of SonShip really means. I'm 65 and have been in the Latter Rain, SonShip and reconciliation movements since 1968. I cannot find a confirmation in the Spiritthat this book is 100% truth! I see about 40% that lines up with the scripture in it's spiritual interpretation. Most of the concepts are Russell's imagination. The book is way to repetitive and sometimes contradicts itself. All in all it will challenge your ideas of God and orthodoxy. Russell's view of our Father is not correct. What happened in the Garden is up for interpretation in many lines of thought. We just have what we need to come into the fullness of Christ. Redundancy is this books true title. It could have been at least 1/2 the contents and needs editing badly!

The story helps us see the birth of Jesus by illustrating its true message - that consumerism and materialism should not be the main reason we celebrate, but that God's gift was given freely and without fanfare or cost. That's what made it perfect.A good old-fashioned family movie with none of the negative qualities we so often see in films today. The actor who plays Jesus did an excellent job portraying Him as a simple human being - someone to whom we could easily relate. A strong buy recommendation, and a must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Christian DVD's","review":"Third of the \\"perfect stranger\\" movies.

It really touches home and make you realize you believe in him but put the question in - Do you believe he can be a true person in your life?

He Lives Folks - whats so hard to beleive in that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Christmas Movie","review":"This is a great movie to show to people to show how in the name of tolerance the true meaning of Christmas is getting lost in the mix.

The Perfect Gift is a story that reminds us of the true meaning of Christmas. The story is modern, and focuses on love at the core. It is suitable for both kids and adults and is family friendly.I really enjoyed the Perfect Stranger and the same actor plays Jesus in this one. Both of these movies have great meaning and especially at Christmas, the Perfect Gift is perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Gift","review":"This was a very touching film on how the world discounts what Christmas is all about! That the world doesn't look at Christmas being the birth of Christ but Santa Claus, shopping, recieving gifts, parties, etc. As the slogan says, \\"Jesus is the reason for the Season!\\" I also love this film as Jefferson Moore has continued to play the part of Jesus in a modern day(as in his other films Stranger, Perfect Stranger & Another Perfect Stranger) setting to help encourage and show people God's love in their daily lives and to lead them to trust in Jesus with their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Gift IS the perfect gift for Christmas","review":"An awesome parable with a timeless meaning.

Hmmm. That could have been an interesting book, had the author taken the trouble to research it. I could really have gotten into a substantive book with a modicum of research tracing the changes the author alludes to and proving his allegations. Instead we get a somewhat haphazard memoir laced with unsubstantiated complaints about his ill-usage by the publishing world. Pity.

Only right wing books are being sold! The government must intervene! Then, in passing, he admits that 70,000 books a year are published in the U.S. He tells us that in the good old days (before he drove his house into financial difficulty) the Elite (him) with noble New Deal ideals (his words) were able to educate us. Of course, the independent booksellers are also being destroyed by this right wing conspiracy.

With such a huge talent, it seems that he is trying always for something new, and sometimes it's better to stick with proven success. Perhaps he is better in person than on CD.

Case Logic is a brand name you can trust from water and all that. My friend puked all over his room and his case is still in tip top shape (although I don't touch it anymore).

I knew a set of front brakes on my Camry was going to run upwards of $250 at the dealership. But after reviewing the step by step instructions with illustrations, I knew I could do this one myself. Great way to get to know your car better. My only complaint - the book 'construction' isn't great. The paper is a step up from newsprint, and I'm not impressed. All in all, worth the investment; this one paid for itself the first time I used it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not useful for 97 Camry","review":"I have a 1997 Toyota Camry, and I hoped this book would be as useful as Chilton manuals I used many years ago. Unfortunately, it is not. I was hoping it would help me to work on a rear door panel, but it only discusses front doors. And those front doors are definitely NOT for a 1997 Camry, as claimed. Near the beginning of the book, there is an under-the-hood picture of the motor layout. But it's not the same as the layout in my '97 Camry. Since I needed to replace some interior lights (like on the shifter), I looked for information on that as well. There is nothing in the book. What I did find was general descriptions of how to recognize a worn tire, a hose with a hole in it, or a worn drive belt. This book seems to be filled with generic information and detailed pictures that don't apply to the vehicle it's supposed to cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what they used to be","review":"Must admit that it has been sometime since I last looked at a Chilton - but this book was nothing like I remember.

Fraser throws in some ingredients entirely her own, as a talented multi-instrumentalist and possessor of a wide and versatile vocal range. Parts of \\"Parasiticide\\" soar and others almost violently ground the listener. There are classically-informed touches mixed in with the grind and dissonance of indie rock.May I coin a term? \\"Indie rock\\" has been put to death by corporately owned \\"college\\" radio...Fraser very well maybe ushering in \\"post-indie\\" rock: full of detail but every bit as visceral and accusatory as punk and utterly trouncing the hushed confessionals and overwrought eyeliner-rock that is choking up airwaves these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A NEW AUTHOR ON THE BLOCK\\"","review":"ITS TIME FOR A NEW AUTHOR ON THE BLOCK.HIS NAMEIS John Reed. if you like espionage,and the spygame at its best, then your book is, THE KINGFISHER'S CALL.I read this book in just one sitting.I could not putit down.You will be hooked on the very first page.REED knowswhat he is writing about.Its a high octanged pace,with greatcharacters,and an ending that will knock you out.Do yourselfa favor and buy this book ,you will not be disapointed.the only problem is how long till his next book???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed just past the 30 day return","review":"This light worked perfectly fine in my Discovery Wonderwall projector for a month.

Big ideas, big feeling, big hearted, big funny, big truths. Big. Just like me.The author doesn't just pick one argument about being fat. She comes at it from all angles.

I think a book about places to eat in jersey is an intersting concept but at least let people know thats the subject matter. This book is NOT about day trips IMHO.

One of the experiments didn't work, and the candle making was OK but kids started to get bored. The only worthwhile experiment was the vinegar/baking soda one, but the only thing supplied by the kit was balloons. The kit comes with almost none of the supplies that you need for the experiments; I had to buy water bottles, baking soda vinegar, crayons and 4 tin cans, and the kit provided wax and balloons. It's a good thing I had planned a number of other experiments for the party, since the ones provided only took 30-40 minutes rather than the 90 minutes that is claimed on the box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lenox 90\\" Cranberry Table Runner","review":"This product is elegant and is made of quality fabric. It looks beautiful on a dining room table and adds warmth to the room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocky punch","review":"first of all let me just say the Rocky music is awesome such as eye of the Tiger by Survivor. Anyway let me get to my review. This is where the series enters the 80's and gets pretty wild. Rocky is so big and famous now that he has a statue of him,has a pinball machine, and he is taking part in charitie events where he gets to fight the greatest fake wrestler ever, Hulk Hogan. But fame has made him soft. Once he loses a brutual fight to Mr.T and Mickey dies of a heart attack Apollo Creed must help him train for the final match. This movie had the best and most training scenes. Rocky of course beats Mr.T in the end but it was not easy. It was a good idea to make Rocky famous in this one. Buy it. God bless you and have a great day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocky III (1982)","review":"A fairly decent sequel for the franchise. The movie picks up where the last Rocky movie left off with Rocky Balboa living his life as the heavy weight champion, but gets challenged by a pist off heavy weight contender Clubber Lang (Mr. T). The story is a bit cliched driven and the film doesn't have as much story content as the first two films, but the acting, directing, and the deeper character development give this movie a high praise. The soundtrack to this film is probably one of the best in movie history, so its no wonder why this film is a classic. Overall, I think fans of the Rocky series will enjoy this sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye of the Tiger","review":"Another great Rocky movie which shows that Sylvester can act as well as direct. The movie is chock full of drama, humor and very fast paced action in the ring.Rocky III was also a stepping stone I believe for the acting career of Mr. T (I think A-team came later), and introduced much of America to Hulk Hogan. My being in the midwest, I saw Rocky III well before I started watching Wrestling, and knew Hogan as the guy from Rocky III.Rocky III also provides a very heart pounding \\"Eye of the Tiger\\"which still rocks today. It's the in your face reality of Rocky being on top of the world to see the rug pulled from under his feet, pretty much give up, then raise his fists to fight the good fight and learn resolve which is a grand inspiration for the viewer. Don't miss the Rocky movies, they're all great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Rocky!!","review":"This is a fine movie. Now Rocky is a heavy weight champ but a black man with spiked hair is stong.

I wanted to write reviews for the individual films. This review is for the film and the older release DVD.The first of the action fueled Rocky sequels packs a wallop! How can you resist a film that has Rocky fighting Thunder Lips (Hulk Hogan) in the first 15 minutes and then battling Clubber Lang (Mr. T) twice in the second and third acts! Sure it's formula, but it's so entertaining you won't care!The DVD transfer on my edition is OK, but there is room for improvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"None fo the Rocky movies can even compare 2 this one. The first two were amazing and this one defied the odds! It starts with Rocky beating opponent after opponent. When a new challenger reveals himself from the shadows (Mr T.) Rocky shows he has finally gone soft. As his training routine suffers so does his manager from a sickness that is not actually revealed. On the night of the big fight the unthinkable happens and Rocky folds in 2 rounds. The movie progresses and Rocky takes on a new manager, none other then Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) himself! The movie progresses but I won't reveal the ending but the movie by far is the best Rocky ever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily the worst of the series--including \\"Rocky V.\\"","review":"The sheer level of stunt casting, preposterous dialogue and the hideousness of Clubber Lang as a character make this my least favorite \\"Rocky\\" film to watch--and there's really nothing to suggest to me that it's cinematically superior enough to make up for these faults. It's like a bad, early-'80s comic book where in order to make the hero seem larger than life, the villain has to be a ridiculous charicature of a human being. Mr. T is alright in the role--doing his best with what he has to work with--but the moments of forced sentiment set into motion by killing off Mick are done better in the fourth film, and Lang falls short in one of the important categories of being a villain: The best villains are guys you love to hate. With Clubber Lang, I just wanted him off the screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. T - a hit or miss?","review":"Rocky III starring Sylvester Stallone is a good sequel but I have mixed feelings about Mr.T appearing in this film. Mr. T is a funny guy but he kinda ruins this film with his over-the-top acting. Stallone looks so afraid of him even though he wrote this sequel. This movie is sad because this is the last Rocky film to feature Burgess Meredith, who plays Rocky's heart of gold trainer Mickey. Good sports flick but Rocky IV is the real treat for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How to ruin a francise in 5 steps","review":"This film should never have been made.

Could it be that there is nothing to say? This is where Stallone spends more time getting other people (Hulk Hogan, Mr. T) noticed for their own futures. This movie lacks any real passion and the fight sequences are bad. the whole \\"eye of the tiger\\" thing is very funny indeed. Sure, Mr. T, hit me with all you've got. I have the eye of the tiger and feel no pain now. Laughable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who thought up this boxing strategy?","review":"Let some monster pound the living hell out of you until he gets tired? Then when he's tired from beating on you, you knock him out? I tried it once it didn't work. I thought I could beat up a guy by continuously banging my face against his fist. I figured when his hand got tired, I could wear out his foot and leg by slamming my stomach against it. Never made it.The first Rocky was a classic a GREAT FLICK that deserved every award it got. He should have left it at that. This was an embarrassment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocky 3","review":"This is my favourite of all the Rocky films. Mr T is great as the opposing boxer Clubber Lang while this was the film that introduced wrestler Hulk Hogan to the world. The film starts off with Rocky living the good life successful relaxed only to see a new challenger from the streets hungry and determined like Rocky was in the first film to be successful. After losing the first fight to Clubber Rocky accepts help from Apollo Creed(Carl Weathers in fine form) to train for the rematch against Clubber. The song Eye of The Tiger is great too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Worthy Sequel","review":"I've only seen the first 3 Rocky movies so far, but I would have to say out of all three this one was the most entertaining to me. More than any other of the films, this one is all about ups and downs. That's maybe what makes it so great, by the time it's over, you feel drained and your thinking, \\"wow, they're still great!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sequel","review":"This is probably the best sequel, well it is the most entertaining one, that is. This time Rocky, who is living in a mansion and rich is being challenged by a tough boxer Clubber Lang (MR.T, fool) who beats the sh-t out of Rocky and takes his title, so Apollo Creed steps in and trains Rocky to beat Lang, who also killed Mickey (Rocky's former manager). It also stars Hulk Kogan as a wrestler named thunderlips who fights Rocky in a Boxer vs. Wrestler charity match.

This is an 8 CD set. There are two lessons on each. They are tagged so no need to name tracks when importing to iTunes etc.If you have 2-3 weeks this 8 CD set is the way to go. If you have longer ...go for the next set which is 16 CD's. There is no written material and this is \\"spoken\\" turkish only.Bottomline....this set is for those who can listen to 30 minutes of material daily.If you commute daily...dont think twice and just buy it. I would recommend listening to each lesson 2-3 times before proceeding to the next ( hence the 2-3 weeks). Also , I found it very helpful to supplement the learning process by spending a little time on learning the alphabet and phontics ( it is straight forward and I used youtube videos!) along with using a phrase book"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Way to Learn Turkish - But not for the faint of heart","review":"Having lived in Turkey, the Pimsleur Language Program offered a good start for first-timers delving into Turkish, and a good review for those of us who once knew how to speak some of the language. The course requires the listener to repeat - and repeat - and repeat. And, if you're going to learn to speak a language, this is the best way. However, there is, in my opinion, too much repetition of certain phrases or words, such as \\"Nezaman?\\" (When?) If you cannot repeat this word and understand it and use it after five times, maybe Turkish is not for you. Also, I though each lesson could have give more vocabulary and grammar. I seem to recall that in one lesson I learn only three new words, and more repetition. The bottom line is: Would I recommend this product? Yes. Would I purchase the next volume (hopefully more advanced)? Yes"},{"rating":"2","title":"SIMPLE, EFFECTIVE.","review":"I am completely satisfied with the Pimsleur teaching method.

I have read through many books and articles on motors and transformers and this one rates with the best of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very sad...but ultimately, silly","review":"As an African-American woman, I found parts of this book absolutely painful to read. I was alternately in tears and furiously angry at Gregory's unflinching portrayal of the horrors of the slave trade and the racist attitudes of those who profited from it. I knew there could be no \\"happy ending\\" in which the slave trade did not continue, and I was sad to note that some racist attitudes are still prevalent today. As a result, I almost did not finish the book.However, the book quickly segued into a regular old Harlequin romance - improbable at best, and as one previous reviewer noted, with far too many loose ends. I finished it, and learned from it, but I was only entertained by it in the most eye-rolling of ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't finish the book...","review":"I got through half of the book before I became so bored that I read the last chapter to find out what happens to the characters. The whole premise of European brutality towards African slaves becomes mundane repitition and nothing new or insightful is brought to light through the experiences of either Francis or Mehuru. It comes as no surprise that they fall in love nor is it the least bit interesting to read in light that the whole black man/woman smart, insightful slave and uncaring, raping, brutal white slaver stereotype is definitely overplayed."},{"rating":"1","title":"snore...zzzzz...snore","review":"Ok, I'm a true Gregory fan. I always have been since \\"Wideacre\\" but I mean...come on!Her other books were exciting and made me want to keep reading! This one...it fell very, very short. I just couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters. Yes, reading about how all the slaves were treated was heart-wrenching, but I get it. I would like to have some sort of plot to go along with that.When I did get a plot, it was a slow moving and dull one. I knew what was going to happen before it did and that just made it even more boring. Gregory used to have such flare! What happened here?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a favorite","review":"I am a very big fan of Gregory's, but cannot recommend this book. I found it uninteresting and hugely predictable. I honestly had to force myself to finish it. If you're looking for entertainment, don't stop here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Characters","review":"One of my favorite things about Gregory's books are the personalities of the characters. For me, I could not make an emotional connection with anyone in this book. I could feel sorrow for characters and definitely for the slavery subject matter. I just feel that there was no life in the characters themselves. This book was by far the worst Philippa Gregory book that I have ever read. I never thought that it was possible to say that about one of her books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time...","review":"I really enjoyed 'The Other Boleyn Sister' and was anxious to read more from the author. This book was a waste of time! I was more than half-way through the book when I realized I didn't care what happened to any of the characters and that most of the book wasn't even logical. For instance, the lead slave seemed to learn to speak English AND write in two chapters, the love affair between the lead slave and Frances was not even a little bit believable, not to mention the 'secret'pregnancy. I can't believe this is the same author. I will try to read other books from Ms. Gregory, but I would not recommend this one to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Having read The Other Boylen Girl, Queens Fool and the Virgin's Lover, and enjoyed them greatly, I was expecting more of the same.

I found the story both compelling and heartbreaking, and not at all unbelievable. I did not like it as much as some of her other novels, but I liked it nonetheless. If you are a Gregory fan don't listen to the naysayers...this was a good read overall and I was not disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting","review":"The beginning of the book was so vivid and real that it made me angry. In fact it made me so angry, because of the painful truth, that I ended up picking a fight with my boyfriend. Few books can make you that mad. The last quarter of the book was purely a fictional romance. At that point it lost its zeal from the first part of the book. Overall it was a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cleverly put together","review":"This book was written so well that it was possible to get inside the head of both the slaves, and the slave owners. The character of Frances was particularly interesting, as you were able to see how even a 'good' person found it difficult to know what was right and what was wrong. She had been told for so long that the slaves were lesser people that she was shocked when she came to realize that they weren't.I have never read a romance story with such a difficult and unusual theme and I think Gregory did a marvellous job of portraying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Troubling","review":"As a black woman, I too found this difficult to read. On a practical level I felt that Ms. Gregory pushed too hard to make this story plausible. I found no link for this romance, no real spark. I found the 'love at first sight' a bit of rubbish for this day and time. Mehuru seemed to good, a little too \\"Kunta Kente-ish\\". And Frances was vapid and skittish, hardly the type of love match one is used to. I loved all her other books, but I had to make myself finish this."},{"rating":"2","title":"UFO still at its peak","review":"This great CD was produced/engineered by George Martin/Geoff Emerick of Beatles fame.

Much on the contrary, the MECHANIX album was the first UFO album I ever heard and it got me going into this great band.But to say that this NO PLACE TO RUN is as good as anything before it's sheer... madness! This is a pedestrian hard rock effort, there's even one amazing Paul Chapman solo (thing that he would do in later albums). The songs are lifeless, terribly bearing a pop feel. In the liner notes the badn says they were going through great presure from the record company to realease hit songs and this, combined with George Martin producing, maybe was crucial.Anyway, this album was a great dissapointment for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why so expensive?","review":"How do they expect anyone to buy some of these UFO albums when they are so god damd expensive?

As it turns out I didn't know what I was missing. The Col. Conk's produces a much thicker lather than ordinary soap and the shave is much more comfortable. The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is the price, $5 seems like a lot for a small bar of soap.

Maybe I will seek the recommendation of others first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Col Conk soap bay rum","review":"For me this bay rum shave puck was very, very dry. I hydrated with water very well. Soaked the razor in hot water and always run the razor under water when it gets full with cream. I put the soap on and by the time I got the razor on my skin, the razor did not glide like it should. It a very tacky, dry feeling like putting the razor on my bare skin with no soap or water. I won't purchase this again. I also didn't notice much of the bay rum smell when shaving. I did finish up with Clubman Bay Rum aftershave though for the full bay rum experience! Giving 2 stars for this product. If no other product was available - that's the only time I'd buy this again. For all the good stuff I read about this soap prior to ordering -- I was really dissappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great smell","review":"Makes a good lather and smells very good.

Scent would be a solid 4 stars as I like the scent of the soap puck but once lathered the scent changes to something less than impressive. Shave quality is where this product fails. First, it is VERY hard to get a good lather from this soap. Takes a while to load your brush and then you have to be very careful about how much water you use. Too much and the lather is runny, too little and it dries on your face. When you finally get the water in the lather just right, the lather is very slick but still very thin and does not provide a good cushion.That said, this is a cheap enough product to test whether you like a bay rum scent or to help introduce someone to wet shaving. Be sure that they do not have hard water or this product will be completely useless unless they shave with distilled water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great soap","review":"This soap lathers well, shaves great, and does not dry out my face.

I didn't mind the focus on Christian philosophy (its from a religious publisher) but I do object to the frequently dismissive and insulting tone the author took toward those who disagree with his philosophy. In addition to the off-putting lack of open-mindedness I feel the author bit off way more than he could chew. He attempted to cover 50 philosophical questions in 225 pages. Basically this left him enough time to briefly explain the question, provide one quote each from Tolkien and C.S. Lewis, then move on. I would have preferred a much deeper exploration of perhaps five or ten questions rather than the shotgun approach the author took."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insulting book reflecting a narrow Christian bias.","review":"I have greatly enjoyed Tolkien's LOTR since reading it and rereading it in the 1970's.I had hoped that this book would, as advertised, enlighten me concerning philosophy using Tolkien fiction as a background.

Most annoying is Kreeft's insistance in stating his opinions as if they are hard wired facts. No argument possible. Why? Because he says so. From a simplistic (and wrong) statement about Buddhism to a laughable restatement of the scientific method this book is little more than a long ego statement. Look elsewhere for real insight on Tolkien's philosophy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Communicating for Productivity","review":"As a professional communicator I found this book particularly relevant in its description of the relationship between communications and management, and the often misunderstood role of the communications within the organizational hierarchy. I laughed as I read the various scenarios painted by the author, because they articulated so well what I see every day in my own work. Its only downfall is spending too much time in theoretical examples to convey the various points, it seems like double-coverage. However, I strongly recommend the book-especially to others in the Communications field-not for its accuracy in capturing this role and relationship, but for its suggestions for graduating beyond those confines into a healthier management-organization communication model and practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Quality","review":"This product arrived broken.

It is interesting reading how this friendship developed, which I will not reveal here because it is an intregal part of the book. The story of this friendship gives the reader great insights into the real Louis L'Amour that you will find in no other source. Unlike a biography this book was written by a man who had a true friendship with Mr. L'Amour, because of this we get a special look at Mr. L'Amour was as a regular person, and not what a publicist would manufacture.The author continues to advocate honors for Louis L'Amour in his hometown to this day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dungeons Review","review":"This is set best for oriental game settings and will have little situation on other realms in the Forgotten realms setting.

Note to author: a modern southern woman would probably not say \\"I shan't...\\" In the US, those little rubber things on the ends of baby bottles are called \\"nipples\\" not \\"teats.\\" A woman suffers from post-partum depression,not \\"post-natal depression.\\" Aside from the cross-cultural gaffes, this book bounced all over from character to (barely tangential) character like silly putty. A sad attempt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Trollope","review":"I have loved all of Joanna Trollope's previous books, but this one was disappointing. She was trying to change writing styles in each section of the book; \\"southern\\" when in Charleston, SC, and then back to \\"British\\" when in London. She should stick to what she does so well, that is, writing good, thoughful women's novels based in her own UK. She did not ring true in the American parts of the book, and sounded almost chiche'd at times. Her other books are so much better than this latest."},{"rating":"1","title":"TELL GRANDMA'S STORY","review":"While the book was well-written, I found myself interested in the stories that were largely untold. Henry was a jerk and Gillon too self-absorbed and shallow. What about Ashley's story? What about Grandma Sarah's story? There was much more to tell that we were given a glimpse of before Trollope jutted off into the main plot line (that I wasn't much interested in, anyway).I enjoyed her style of writing. The dialogue was great. Just felt it could have been a better book. I am definitely going to try some of Trollope's other books before \\"writing\\" her off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Characters lacked depth","review":"The premise and setting of this book had so much potential that the characters did not live up to. Once the storyline moved back to the U.S., the story died. There was dialogue between characters that was hard to follow because it assumed we knew so much more about the characters' psyche than we actually did. I felt like NOTHING happened in the latter half of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hodgepodge","review":"Too many characters, too little cohesiveness. I wish Trollope had focused on only three or four of the characters and developed their story in a way that made sense. Among the things that make no sense: why does Henry take a room at a bed and breakfast for $50 a night when he tells Gillon's brother that he can't afford to pay $120 a month towards a mortgage? I also agree with the reader who faulted Trollope on her tenuous grasp of American (let alone Southern) dialect. What American would say \\"Has Mama been?\\" (for \\"Has Mama stopped by?\\"), \\"don't let's\\" (for \\"let's not\\"), or \\"gone 3\\" (for \\"past 3\\")? Trollope's other books are far superior; read any one of them rather then this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very silly book","review":"As a longtime reader of Joanna Trollope's chick-fiction, I was initially surprised to find that this one had flown into the US under my radar screen. But all became clear as I labored through the hand-wringing (excessive, even for one of Ms Trollope's works) and the too-prominently displayed paragons of her feminine ideal. Honestly, if you've followed --hard to avoid if you read any UK lifestyle magazines -- any of the details of the writer's personal life and her pronouncements on it in recent years, simply transpose the most contrived events or statements to the American South, and you've got it.The book suffers miserably from the absence of a good fact checker. Throughout, the character cast as a psychiatrist is plainly meant to be a psychologist, i.e. not a medical doctor. The author's attempt to \\"write American\\" was a failed experiment not meant to be repeated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whine, whine, whine . . .","review":"If you like a lot of whiny, introspective characters, then this book is for you; there's not a happy one in the bunch. Ms. Trollope is a skilled writer, no fault there, but nothing could compensate for this depressing storyline. I was almost to the end when I realized I had better things to do with my time; I put it down and didn't finish it. I so disliked these characters, I just didn't care what happened to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tepid","review":"I've been a Joanna Trollope fan for years but this book simply doesn't work. Nearly every character, and certainly all the main ones, are so hesitant, so held-in-check by their fears, that I just got impatient with them. I see NO spark of love between Gillon and Henry, we're never let into their attraction for each other, so I'm never terribly concerned with what happens to them. Seriously, Henry seems much more in love with Charleston than with Gillon.I found it reassuring to see that so many other readers had the same reaction. Ms. Trollope's writing is usually so good that I thought I'd missed something, but I think there's just not really a lot of something there. She seems to have written the book while wrapped in cotton wool.I hope for better next time. I know she is very capable of better. \\"Marrying the Mistress\\" just about drove me crazy at times, but it was real and alive in a way that \\"Girl From the South\\" is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"For a story set in 2001, the Charlestonians seemed to be 50 ish caricatures. The novel starts off well, but falls apart at the end when there is no actual resolution for any of the characters. There is so much more to Charleston than the Battery, and the names \\"Ashley\\", \\"Cooper\\" (rivers) and \\"Boone\\" (plantation) were very corny choices for one family. Was Martha a psychiatrist or a psychologist? She's described as both, but must have completed her formal training in mere months to be the mother of a 30 something. She is oddly indifferent to her daughter's post-partum depression. No american says \\"straight away\\". To be such a boor in London, Henry effortlessly charms the socks off all the southerners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreary.........","review":"I wanted to like this book. I have loved books set in England as well as so many set in the south. This dark little tale captured the charm of neither.The charachters- especially the \\"heroine\\" Gillon are all shallow and nasty individuals. Gillon is cold and mean to friends and family alike! The dialogue seemed to consist of people saying \\"what\\" or \\"pardon\\" to each other. There was no epiphany or growth- simply whining....There are so many great novels set in England- reread Bridget Jones if you cannot find something else! As for South Carolina- try D.B. Frank's Sullivan's ISland. And SKIP Girl from the South"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"This novel has none of the depth of previous Trollope novels. This story is more suited to the \\"Caroline Harvey\\" romance line. The characters are shallow, the writing stilted, and the plot thin.

This set is a great way to introduce yourself to his music and will serve as a strong base to start a complete collection. The audio quality is very good and the packaging is well designed, handsome and easily stored, unlike most cumbersome and bland box sets. The Hank Williams Complete Collection is not really complete, but it's a good start."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Complete Collection","review":"This 3 CD set was well worth what I paid for it. I would say most all of Hank's best tunes are here on these 3 CD's. I would strongly recommend this to an avid Hank fan who is a collector of having most of his music, but not as a first time Hank listener as most of the songs are live or different versions of his major tunes. A whole disc of live songs mostly recorded at The Grand Ole Opry is included here and one disc has a lot of acoustic guitar solo work.

This book was published in 1994 and the biographical data and recommended recordings are badly out of date. And the recommendations are mainly orchestral music. On the plus side the book is extremely easy to read and use and the significance and background of the composer is laid out in alphabetical order by name. The famous musical pieces are described without jargon or technicality and are clear to the point. The young generation of talent, however, such as Lang Lang, Hilary Hahn and Vasily Petrenko are missing. Great performances and recordings in the last 17 years are also missing.Many books on this subject today are more entertaining in terms of illustrations and text and more informative, such as John Burrow's Complete Book of Classical Music (Dorling Kindersley publication)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not balanced","review":"This book was a real disappointment.

I found it inspiring and thought provoking. It took me a couple of days to read through it because I kept putting it down and contemplating the passage I had read before moving onto the next page. The illustrations through out were fun. Some of them I hadn't seen before. I did learn a few things about Jim Henson the man I hadn't known before.

I wasn't disappointed. I did see how Henson got his start in the business, and that was good.

It links humans with a watery world in an intelligent way to give a fascinating overview of the whole subject of water, looking at traditional sacred views of water through conventional scientific analysis into esoteric or less well-known ones. And it gives lots of up to the minute information about helaing with water, both through healthy drinking practices and bathing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good background Material.","review":"This author uses a holistic approach towards the analysis of water and its impact on health. She tones down the more fantastic claims while advancing the preponderance of global ritualistic historical practices and their logical connection to certain scientific knowledge based on the understanding that the human body is mainly liquid and that liquids communicate.

Although I am aware of the huge personal loss to the author, the book is hard to follow and jumps around so much it really isn't understandable. This tragedy is huge and fasnatating all in the same breath. But it you want to read the story of the Empress of Ireland, or the story of the large loss of life, find another book like the one written by Herbert P. Wood (Till We Meet Again), or David Zeni (Forgotten Empress) or even the vast amount of information found online. Do not waste your money on this particular take on the story.

The album is actually a compilation of Fanx Ta-ra, Misplaced Ideals and Facades. The lyrics feel a little stilted these days (\\"looked out of the window what did I see?

Get this album, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow i love this book!","review":"I laughed, I was held in suspence I was surprised I related to this book compleatley.

Her friend, Randy, is starting to give her more attention and that makes her feel really special. But then Drake comes into the scene and her feelings start to change. Her feelings are all tangled inside her and the only one she knows she can turn to is God. This a great story of friedship and forgivness. I really enjoyed reading it and I'm sure you will too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but....","review":"This is a good purchase for $4.99, especially if you like the more unusual films to come out of the silent era, or any of the Oz books. It's a fun romp through Oz, and has some decent special effects.The film itself has deteriorated substantially, and it appears no effort was made to restore it. That's understandable, especially for such a cheap movie. The bad part of this disc is the audio. The music is a mix of ragtime and various other types. It has some relevance, as the mood does change with the film, but that's about all. The voice-over for the title cards, on the other hand, is just wrong.My conclusion: Buy the movie, but turn the audio off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected from other reviews...","review":"I don't know alot about old movies, especially not silent film, or anything before the 40's, so maybe my opinion is that of a dummy. Most of the shots were very long, repetitive, and boring. It was rare for a scene to have much editing at all, it was mostly a single shot showing frantic action that doesn't tell much of a story at all. The woman who reads the text screens is obnoxious. In my opinion, I'd rather read it myself than have it read to me. I don't like that voice there. As some of the other reviewers have said, some of the effects and costuming worked very well. Very impressive for the time. The direction, action, and pacing/storytelling just didn't seem to work well at all for me. Very slow. I fell asleep several times and had to rewind. If you want a good silent film, check out Steamboat Bill, Jr. Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Costumbres","review":"I listen all the song in this CD and was cool.

The lyrics are nothing special, but the delivery is nice. I used to listen to the \\"Hell Hath No Fury\\" album every day back in junior high.

The drum work is absolutely perfect.Ignore the name; buy the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"great value for the money","review":"Got 2 of these for my boys (8 & 3) and so far they have held up well to my 3yo jumping on it.

Not too thrilled with the drawers, but then i can't expect too much. Putting it together took some time, all pieces are tagged so there's no confusion.One thing the picture does not show are the plastic buttons to be put on top of the screws that blend with the color, but on closer inspections feels cheap.There are 2 planks that support the mattress and if one were to sit on the edge, you hear a crank from the other end, i wish they had a mechanism to clamp these as well - it might have given a more solid feel. The drawers base is too light and will not be able to handle anything other other than 1 pillow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceeded my expectations","review":"I ordered this bed for my 4-year old as he was outgrowing his toddler bed. I had my sights on this bed for awhile; however, I was hesitant based on some poor reviews and the fact it was made from particle board. I decided to take a chance and ordered the bed using Amazon's free shipping and it still arrived ahead of the schedule delivery. It arrived intact with no cracks or other signs of defects as others had experienced. Assembly was easy; those claiming difficulty were either incapable of operating a phillips screw driver or looking at directions. Even with the drawers installed, there is still plenty of usable storage space behind the drawers for items such as seasonal clothing. To access this additional space, simply move the mattress and lift the included bunkie board which consists of two half pieces - not that hard.

He was one-of-a-kind, a grown-up kid who, constantly looking for adventure, sailed through life on his good looks and innate charm.He was really a \\"flake\\". He avoided responsibility, usually letting his \\"little head\\" dictate to the one on top of his neck.No woman could hold him for very long.You'd be a fool to loan Errol money, as his creditors back in his native Tasmania would be quick to tell you. He spent that green stuff like there was no tomorrow.But, tomorrow did come and his last days were plagued with health and financial problems. He died at age 50.What remains for us to savor is his dashing, heroic on-screen image that will be forever young.I understand that this autobiography was ghost written, but Flynn certainly had a strong hand in writing it.

This man has scene some things. Errol is also a excellent writer. He comes up with some really well written sentences along the way. His true spirit comes through. He comes across as a honest man about who he is, good or bad. His adventure's in the islands north of Australia were the highlight for me. Picture a different time period where white man was the king. Cruel, yes, but a part of history. Let's just say, Errol was no angel. But a product of his times I guess. Very well written book, and I would definitely recommend it. Minus the way he treated the natives, I found Errol to be a good soul who was honest with himself about his short comings. If the words in this book are mostly true, I like the man. The world needs more deep thinkers.

Yes, I think 90% of what he said was true, and the embellishments are easily forgiven.Flynn was the real deal, regardless of what anyone says.People who criticize him for recounting his exploits overseas say less about Flynn and say more about their own, sheltered, inexperience of the real world.If I had to make a judgment call, I would say that this is a book for men. If you are a young man in your 20's or 30's, still lusting for adventure on the inside, but forced to conform to the corporate world on the outside, you will discover a kindred spirit in dear Brother Errol."},{"rating":"2","title":"autobiography","review":"Most of this book is accurate, but some of it still leaves you wondering how much was fabricated to enhance the stars notoriety. Errol Flynn's private life was as glamorized as on the screen.

For the group itself and their performing talent, I would rate them 5 stars, out of 5.But, the entire second half of the DVD I received was so incredibly bad it could not be watched or even listened to. I used the same dvd player I have used for a long time and never had a problem with it UNTIL when playing this dvd. My player also worked fine with other dvds after taking this inferior quality one out.

Although a fan of Celtic Thunder since the beginning, I am taken aback by the group's departure from who they purport to be: celtic. The show looked like an amateur high school performance. Why in the world do they cover old american hits when they promised a celtic experience with a modern twist? Very disappointing. After 5 concerts, I'm out until they they bring back the excitement of songs like Caledonia, Ireland, Come By the Hills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not \\"My\\" Celtic Thunder","review":"Let me first say that I am a true Celtic Thunder fan.

I can understand the group wanting to try new things, but whoever picked out much of this music did not do right by them this time. This wonderful group of men deserve better. There are a couple of really nice pieces, but much of this CD to me at least, sounds like they are trying to sound like \\"polyester lounge lizards\\", and music like that you can get anywhere.

It is neither Celtic nor \\"thunderous\\". The only song I truely enjoyed was \\"Ireland\\". The set was poorly conceived and the addition of the male dancers with Ryan was like something from a high school musical review. That said, I think the most demeaning performance was Paul (with the voice of an angel) singing Do-wacka-do. I don't hold CT responsible for this fiasco. I think they need to loose Sharon Browne and find a producer that wants them to be Celtic, not some Lawrence Welk review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Celtic Thunder show I've seen","review":"I love the Celtic Thunder group and all work done by Phil Coulter and Sharon Browne but this show on DVD is terrible not at all like the last two shows which were great.

It could have grabbed potential readers by making them wonder if the duo survives or not. Anyway, a father and son dive to their deaths.First, the author did not make the father and son seem particularly likeable. I thought their constant fighting and bickering was more of a turn off. Second, you wonder if the deaths could have been averted; what could be interpreted by some as courage looks to others like foolhardiness. Third, you wonder at times whether it is the author's primary intent to write about the father and son or about himself. It's almost like he's thinking, \\"I'd like to tell people my story and the perfect vehicle to hook them with is the death of this father and son.\\"I'll admit, the writing is fine and I did keep reading, but the book left me with a bit of a sour feeling in my stomach."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fascinating Look at Diving","review":"I am a newly certified SCUBA Diver.

Unless you're a diver, you'll be bored to tears. If you *are* a diver, be prepared to trudge through uninteresting crap looking for the treasure.The story of the Rouse deaths is merely a hook--their story only takes up a small portion of the book. Essentially, what Chowdhury is pedaling is a history of tech diving. The outline is brilliant, and in the hands of a skilled writer, this could have been a real gem. The prose is mediochre at best. Hard to believe anyone could make so fascinating a topic into a dull read."},{"rating":"2","title":"My husband would not put the book down","review":"From a slightly different point of view...the wife of the reader.

Chowdhury would have been well advised to simply tell the story and not try to animate it with guessed-at dialogue. I came away disliking the \\"cowboy-like\\" father and son diving team and their tragic demise came as no surprise. Chowdhury's techincal explanations and descrption of the history of the sport are very good. Unfortunately his fictionalizing of the varous conversations is more cartoon than clever."},{"rating":"1","title":"What not to do in diving.","review":"This books greatest value is that it shows what NOT do to in diving, and why some people should not be allowed to dive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoroughly disappointed....","review":"Perhaps because I knew how it was going to end, I found this book an incredibly slow read. Normally I would put it down after a couple of weeks, but it did get such rave reviews. I felt this book would have been better as a magazine article rather than a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Dive","review":"The liner notes say \\"Like \`A Perfect Storm,'\\" and that's not a bad comparison. It has a similar feel to it, although the author(s) aren't quite as gifted writers as Junger, they tell the story well. Stories probably is a more accurate description, since the father-son tragedy may be the centerpiece of the book, but there are many tales related about the (crazy) pioneers of technical diving. If you read \\"The Right Stuff,\\" you might recall the constant refrain about test pilots crashing and \\"being burned beyond recognition.\\" In The Last Dive, it's divers constantly getting bent, drowning and other awful tragedies. It's a very personal story for Chowdhury, a friend of many of the victims, and one himself. His exploration on what drives people--including himself--to risk their lives diving for artifacts on wrecks 200 feet and below is fascinating. All in all, an excellent book for anyone who pushes the envelope, especially divers. After reading this, I think I'll stick to rec diving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Duffy","review":"Maybe I shouldn't write my review, because I didn't finish the book, but it just isn't good. This is supposed to be a tragic story of a father and son that lose their life to a sport they thoroughly enjoy, yet all I get from the writing is a couple of guys who are arrogant and immature. Chowdhury goes between writing technical diving information to dialogue between characters, that reads hollow and adolescent. Not a good read for me. If you're into diving and wrecks, ready Kevin McMurray.

It was written horribly, which made it very annoying to keep reading. The information was presented in a very confusing manner, and was often repeated through out the book. In other key areas of the book, not enough informatiuon was given. All the main characters, most particularly the father and son, were extremely dysfunctional. The author chose to romanticize them, which was ridiculous. They were irresponsible cowboys, who, unfortunately, were the victims of their own carelessness. If this book even remotely captures the events as they occurred, nearly all of these people were idiots. I wouldn't disagree that they need psychological help. The author needs help as well with basic grammar and composition. While the events were truly tragic, so was the telling of the story.

As someone new to diving I thought I would read something on the subject. I imagined it would be the simple documentation of a tragic event. Instead I found an amazing story about not only the Rouse family and their journey into the world of diving and the subsequent tragedy but also the authors own story and his insights into this world. The Last Dive is one of those books you can't put down and it's also incredibly educational on the sport of diving. If you have an interest in diving this is a fantastic book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, painful to read as a result","review":"The author attempts to romanticize the lives of the Rouse family, who came across as an extremely dysfunctional group. My take is that they were, at best, irrational cowboys, taking ill advised risks and were completely irresponsible, in all aspects of their lives. They were, in the end, tragically victims of their own poor judgement and behavior (as where many of the people talked about in the book). The author should have titled this book after himself, as this seems to be his favorite topic, to the detriment of the story. From his poor writing style, composition, leaving out information which would have made the story much more interesting, and to his repeating the same information over and over again, this book was difficult to enjoy. The author took a compelling event, and ruined the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last Dive?.....Gee, I wonder why?","review":"A better title for the book would have been \\"How to break every safety rule in the book, and pay the price!\\" While I admit the book has interesting parts, it's basically the story of a scuba diving train wreck. With every decision the main character makes, you're just waiting to see how long it takes before something tragic happens. And then, of course, it does. I wasn't exactly sitting on the edge of my seat....the ending is predictable. This is simply a story of a bad diver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Respect the ocean - it shows no mercy","review":"About a group of friends who dive to the Andria Dora, \\"The Mount Everest of Diving\\", at 230 feet below the Massachusetts coast.

The goddam thing traps the guy in the U-Boat, pinning him to the floor!It tells a history of how people throughout the ages have gotten the bends - including the people who worked underwater in caissons building the Brooklyn Bridge, a history of diving, the pain of decompression chambers after being rescued by a Coast Guard helicopter off of a dive charter boat, breathiing mixed gases like helium and guys decompressing for 3 hours on an anchor line after a 30 minute bottom time deep dive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Well Written","review":"While the contents are interesting, the writing is not.

I agree with other reviewers that he also discusses himself far too much.The plot is also in a non-linear fashion. While some people can pull this off, Chowdhury doesn't do a very good job of it.To find someone that is as literarily adept as Joyce and be a technical diver at the same time is to expect too much. But it would be nice if there was such a person..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book was boring to me. The author went on and on with detailed descriptions of the principles of diving, repeating himself many times. It was very hard to read the story through all this extra detail.

I do not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Old Which-a -roo!","review":"Be prepared for the old which-a-roo with this book.

Coming from someone (me), who has an attention span long enough to read a postcard, I could not put down \\"Shadow Divers\\", having cut my teeth on New Jersey wreck diving a long time ago, although not to the extreme of deep wreck diving. It only seemed natural to follow it up and read \\"The Last Dive\\", which I have trouble keeping interested in when the author keeps writing mostly about himself.

I had a bit of a tough time because the tools broke a bit while using them, and made it hard to continue working with them, but after I had opened the case the rest was straightforward and easy.My main complaint is that I don't think that the battery is really 550mAh. I use RockBox, configured for this battery's larger capacity, and the battery life indicator does not accurately represent the actual amount of battery remaining, it always overstates it. If the battery really performed like it was stated, it'd get a 5/5 rating.

There is a soft gummy like material along the edge of the battery where the wire connects. By compacting the area, I am able to get 1-5 days of good use out of it. Unfortunately it still becomes disconnected at random times. I have not taken the battery apart, opened up that area, but I may do so soon. Returning the product seems like a waste of energy if I can get it to work consistently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get it to work","review":"It's probably my fault as much as the battery's, but I couldn't get it to work. I carefully opened up the iPod, took out the old battery and tried installing this new one. Two problems I had were: (1) the ribbon/cable that is supposed to plug into the iPod seems to be either too short or comes off the battery in an awkward spot, so that it doesn't easily reach the receptacle it needs to be plugged into; and (2) the clip/plug itself doesn't readily plug into the iPod. The plug end of the ribbon/cable seems to be just a bit too wide, and it is not stiff enough to snap cleanly into place. It was literally like trying to push on a piece of string.At any rate, I was frustrated that I couldn't get it to work for me. It was still worth trying, to hopefully save the cost of buying a new iPod, but that's what I'm looking at having to do now."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless tools, battery would not charge","review":"This is a complete hoax, the soft plastic tools were utterly ineffective, the battery never accepted any charging, and was a poor fit once I was able to open my iPod using my own tools.

Installation is not difficult if you are the least bit handy. As others have said, spend a few minutes on youtube first to see how its done. Directions that are include are ok but not great. Tools that are included are ok. Only advice is to be careful with the wires once you get it apart since they are a bit fragile. Once you get it open however, you basically pull the old one out and replace it with the new one and snap it back together.

Literally, the lettering is 1/32\\" high. The most important part of the instructions should have been how to detach the old ribbon lead and reattach the new one. The little \\"socket\\" the lead goes into requires removal of a clamp piece, then insertion of the wire, then replacement of the clamp piece. The instructions are very short, and insufficient. It says, \\"insert the connector into the socket.\\" Well, you can't do it without taking the clamp off first.The plastic tools for opening the iPod case are too soft, and wouldn't do the job. I ended up using a stiff knife blade to open the case.To make matters worse, the new battery will not fully charge. It will hold a half charge, but never gets up to full.In my opinion, this purchase was a big mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's a battery","review":"I can get through three days on my device and still have >50% I listen to about 4hrs of podcasts/day I previously could not get through a day"},{"rating":"2","title":"iPod is brought back to life","review":"What can I say?

Bodio instinctively understands the people, the culture, and the animals without the sanitized pap that is all too prevalent in adventure books. The similarities between present-day Mongolian Eagle Hunters and the Plains Indians of the l800s are remarkable. In both cultures, the Eagle has an important spiritual significance.Jack Kerouac wrote \\"Sometimes it is necessary to put up with dust and rattlesnakes for the sake of pure freedom.\\" Bodio's book oozes freedom. \\"Eagle Dreams\\" should be required reading for all undergraduate anthropology majors.

Once you entice a fish to bite, The mechanism for hooking the fish sucks. The music is just plain annoying. The lure doesn't track realistically in the water. There was no way to pre-set the drag on the reel before fishing, which resulted in more lost fish. There was no under water view like in a lot of fishing games.

I use it for stir fry and my oriental salads. It will take me decades to use it all at this rate, but it still cost less than 4 of the small containers at the store, so I'm happy. I know they're good for you and am trying to find other uses for them.

I don't know how the arms broke off.. as per the other review I read.

The only confusion are the bonus tracks, which are an earlier (rejected by apple) version of the album. Was apple out of their minds?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A look at conflicting producers","review":"Depending on the source, Todd Rundgren either brough efficient professionalism to this album, or was an overbearing egotist who didn't care for the opinions of the band involved. Originally to be produced by engineeer Geoff Emerick, things went astray when Apple bigwig George Harrison decided HE wanted to do it instead. Called away by the Bangla Desh project after only 4 songs, Rundgren stepped in to finish things out. Along the way, we got one of Badfinger's greatest songs in the epic-sounding romantic ballad \\"Day After Day\\". But all of Emerick's was brushed aside, and being able to compare versions of the same songs by him and Rundgren side-by-side is revealing. I find the original (and previously-unreleased) \\"Name Of the Game\\" FAR better than Rundgren's remake. WHAT were Apple (and Harrison) thinking?? My only wish is that Emerick's album could have been issued in its entirety, instead of the tunes getting split up as bonus tracks over several CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beatles farm team","review":"This is a solid English pop-rock album from the early seventies with stellar production by Todd Rundgren and George Harrison. The songs are solid, as are the vocals and guitar work. The drumming is a bit wooden and the bass playing unexceptional. Overall, it works well and stands as Badfingers finest recording. Still, they could never escape sounding like the Beatles minor league team, one that got frequent call ups to assist in solo Beatle projects. Another, solid Badfinger record is ASS, which continues to be, mysteriously, unavailable.

The wood is fine. The gliding parts are fine. Still silent when we glide. The back did break but I replaced the nuts (with some studier ones from the hardware store) and now it's fine. I weighed about 180 lbs just to give you something to compare.The biggest warning I have is don't let your kids play in it! Since their legs don't extend over the front, their center of gravity is further back in the chair. My son tipped it backwards and he only weighs 24 lbs! They are strong enough to do this already. Good thing I was there to catch him! Make sure you watch them carefully or put the glider near a wall so that it can't fall backwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good chair at the right price","review":"This chair is a good chair for the right price. I wanted to buy one of those expensive reclining gliders but I just didn't have the budget for it since I have a baby on the way. This chair is nice looking and glides with very minimal effort. I read all of the reviews and some of the things people complained about it states in the warning label not to do those things. For example don't leave your child unattened in the chair because it could tip over if they are playing on it.

Not to mention the cushions are horribly uncomfortable that we ended up putting a bed pillow on it to sit down. The ottoman is also falling apart.It is truly worth spending more on a better rocker! This one is getting tossed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok.... for a short period of time!","review":"I recieved this chair and ottoman combo as a baby shower gift. I loved it, that is until it fell apart. I'm only 5'2\\" and 140lbs. I used it when I fed my now 6 month old son and to rock him to sleep. It started to make this rubbing noise and then the chair just fell apart. As I was rocking the metal parts that make it glide started to shave themselves smooth and they just slid out of their gooves. When that happened, thank god I wasn't holding my son at the time, the chair basically collapsed inward on me.

Thats what I did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"When shopping around for a glider during my first pregnancy I didn't want to spend the price for one of those expensive gliders.

And I think it does a decent job. So does the companion volume for Perl. I only wish there were a Python edition in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple, but just too simple.","review":"As the title of the book says, \\"Programming for Linguistis\\". The author assumes that most linguists don't have any programming experience and may not have to write a complicate program, the content is therefore very simple. However, it is just somehow too simple. Sometimes we still have to use a complex function in a easy program, whose explanation is skipped. For example, the author never explains why \\"-1\\" in \\"line.indexOF(word) > -1\\" means a word in anywhere in a line . Examples like this make people confused and cause more and more problems as learners go deeper and deeper. I believe as a linguist, we may only have write a small program sometimes, but we don't have to be an expert of Java doesn't mean that we don't have to understand it clearly. I still suggest that if you are a linguist and want to learn Java, you have to choose other Java books which is written in a clear way and then find useful examples for linguists such as searching in a text in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow business","review":"I would love to write a review, but I the CD is still due.

The difference was, I was only a few feet away from her and the stage. What makes a great singer is her ability to make songs flow effortlessly. It's the reason us mere non-singers/fans think we can do it in the mirror utilizing a comb, brush or pencil as a microphone. Lalah's approaches to these songs is done with such authority, confidence and sophistication; but not so out of reach that her sound is too haughty. It's honest, hungry, deep, seductive and lush. I don't have her newest cd, but this one is one I can vouch for and it has a dear place in my must have music list. She evokes a similiar tone and approach to her father, yet she remains true to her own voice. The production is tight and almost every cut is perfect! \\"Your Smile\\" is my favorite cut.

It's based on the battle arena Battle Droid mold and has 5 points of articulation, very nice details, and a blaster that fits snugly in its hands. Despite what most people say its head DOES NOT come off. The Battle Droid's head fits nice and tight and turns 360 degrees. This figure is a great buy if you are looking to build a droid army. However if you are looking for a better droid that is new and cooler buy two of General Greavious bodyguards(and the 'though not a droid' Clone Commander)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool figure!","review":"this figure is cool. It is a remake of the ATOC Arena Battle Droid but since battle droids all look alike in all 3 prequels, that's alright. It has the blaster and the blast effect you put on the tip of the blaster. However, the head keeps falling off and it is hard to get the head to stay on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trouble standing up...","review":"This version of the Battle Droid has very weak legs. As mentioned in other reviews, prop this dude up against something if you take it out of the package to play with it as the plastic legs are so thin they have a difficult time supporting the weight of the figure and the legs will bend sideways (at the knees). Unfortunately, the Episode III (Revenge of the Sith) Super Battle Droid figure suffers from the same design problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality, low detail","review":"Head comes off easily. Droid sits on my desk but if it falls over the head will come off. I'll be using super glue soon.Doesn't hold it's gun properly. It doesn't \\"click\\" in place or anything like that. On top of that, the arms/hands are not rotated correctly to hold the gun (as shown on picture). So when the plastic starts rotating back in its original place, the gun pops out. Again, I'll get out the super glue to fix that.Detail is very low, cheap product. Not sure on durability, but I would think not too good for kids to play with."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a nice toy.","review":"My guys head fell off right when I opened the box.

I bought this figure for my son and before I could get it out of the package the head came off. It's easy to snap back on but the way it was designed it's also easy to come off so I ended up super glueing the head on. Then the gun or \\"laser\\" as we call them here at home keeps falling out of it's hands because the \\"fingers\\" don't grasp very well. So when ever he plays with it I hear \\"daddy can you fix this\\" until he gets tired of asking me. Spend the ca$h on a different figure like the Revenge of the Sith Clone Trooper.

She was mean and Rainbow was crying. Yeah, there is a lesson here as Strawberry tries to explain that if we were all the same how boring the world would be, but this is probably lost on my daughter as she's sitting there starting to get a bit bored by the slow story that comes off way too negative for the typical movies that are so upbeat and fun. There is a contrived ending where Peppermint realizes she was wrong, but I still recommend the new Moonlight Mysteries way over this one-- that's my daughter's favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!!","review":"We got about 5 minutes into the video when my 4 year old started crying, it had frozen, wouldn't work at all. We returned one, got a new one, it freezes too! We have almost all the Strawberry Shortcake DVD's, and this is the ONLY one we have had a problem with, and the story looks so cute.

My toddler is in love w/ her Strawberry Shortcake books and I rented this from the library becasue I thought she'd love it. Well, she does, but I HATED it!I can't stand the almost anime look, but mostly was horrified by the substance. In one early scene, Orange Blossom and Gingersnap are arguing over a dress to wear to the ball. They're the wicked step-sisters in this \\"Cinderella\\" episode. They are obnoxious and bratty and there is no positive or correcting counterbalance to their nastiness. Lo-and-behold, I overheard my daughter re-enacting the scene w/ her dollhouse people about an hour later.That DVD is going back to the library tomorrow!

They use instruments like the didgeridoo to create a musical atmosphere that is completely unique. Their Christmas album is unlike anything else in my collection and one of my favorites. It is atmospheric and relaxing, and they \\"dance\\" around traditional songs giving them a unique spin without comprising the original song.

Very nice touch is the back of the book, containing removable swatches and a pocket for swatches you collect.But, six pages for wallpaper and nary a Bradbury & Bradbury design in sight? Bathrooms - one picture in the entire book? Two sections on home offices - including one with a fireplace and a warming oven (I thought this was a decorating workbook based in the real world?) Where in heck are you supposed to incorporate the computer equipment?Not enough content for the person just getting familiar with Arts & Crafts. Not emough content for the person (like me) planning a renovation of my 1920's bungalow. I'm not sure who this book is aimed at. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing book, however brilliant.","review":"Often, I've sat reading this book in bookstores across Boston, hoping for it to change its ways. It's brilliantly organized and the pictures are great, but the knowledge behind the framework and fandango is either absolutely lacking or off for a lunchbreak. The author totally ignores the differences between the English and American A&C aesthetics, which, if you are already familiar with the differences, might not make much difference, but if you are a newbie to the A&C Renaissance, will be hugely misleading. The architectural poetics espoused by Morris and Voysey are quite different from those of Stickley, Wright, and the Roycroft community. I would have expected much better from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book On A&C","review":"This book is really a travesty.

As a previous reviewer alluded to, this book would have been much better had Dr. Atkins been able to finish himself. However, what we are left with is a co-author MD who's personality is as cold as ice; not to mention condescending and disrespectful. This shines through in the tone of the writing. Furthermore, how can we take diet advice from someone who is obese herself? There are plenty of other well-written low-carb diet books.

Guess what - as a 50-year-old woman, there are things I can't do as well now as I could when I was younger. That's what happens. There are other things that I am better at now - experience counts.Since I am in that \\"middle-age\\" group, I really wanted this book to be interesting and insightful, from a slightly sci-fi standpoint, of course. Instead, I got one long boring whine about getting older. Yawn. If you're a positive-minded or matter-of-fact person, don't bother.

(Even better if he recruited some more of the mind-readers he said were out there to give more credibility.) Surely this use of his/their powers would benefit humanity enormously? So come on all you mind-readers out there... :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"literature at its peak","review":"Well, what can I say? After I finish reading this book, when I was in North Carolina, I kept staring at it for two minutes, pleasantly surprised. A marvelous book by any standard. I enjoyed how the author goes very deep in Selig's soul and, through him, in the inner beings of other characters. I was in delight to see a telepath depicted without the glamour so common in sci-fi products on television and cinema. I liked very much how a loser, in the American terminology, can be nonetheless highly interesting, speaking about his malaise. And I felt yet stronger to deny the affirmations that science fiction is bad in character-building. Dying Inside, along other masterpieces, proves this assertion to be completely false.Read it!

Even in the much anticipated \\"finals\\" , after spending 70 minutes watching a couple of kids say one or two cute things and learn some steps, they basically end up stumbling around on an open air stage, and then wait very excitedly to hear who will win the \\"revered\\" CUP. I see others here mention the movie \\"Spellbound\\" - now THAT is a great docu to watch, because the kids are phenominal, their background stories diverse and fascinating, and the prize they compete for has clout. This is a home movie intended for the participants, NOT the rest of the world. Imagine watching a home video of your baby brother singing a song badly. Everyone in the family goes :\\"aaaahhhh\\" and enjoys it, but as soon as you have to show it to strangers it becomes embarrassing. Ditto this movie. It's really \\"much ado about nothing\\". Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame documentary, politically correct, bad filming...","review":"With bad camera and light work, this felt like a high school film project.

Some of the students go on to dance in a city-wide competition. This documantary focuses on the children of three schools as they prepare for the showdown. As many other reviewers have noted, the film would have benefitted from a finer focus on a smaller number of kids. This would have allowed us to see more of their personal lives and place the program in its context. Nervertheless, there are many joyful sequences in this film, and the children are charming. Those qualities go a long way."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Story For Kids","review":"Two years ago, children in fifth grade living in New York competed in a Ballroom Dance competition. It is a fun movie to watch especially when you are a ballroom dancer yourself. The teams, which are colors of the rainbow, all compete to win with latin dances, ballroom dances and swing.As a ballroom dancer, myself, I can say that from experience, it is a hard and challenging sport to do, but to see these fifth graders, most of which do not have anything running for them, competiting, excelling and loving the new sport of dancing.

The evolution of the fifth grade students into proficient ballroom dancers is fun to watch, and their personalities and perspectives on life are both entertaining and sobering. The ballroom competition is exciting, and you'll find yourself rooting for the schools that are profiled in the documentary. What is most impressive about the ballroom dancing program is its effects on the young people; the hope and aspirations for more promising futures that it brings to some of the students is the best part of the film. It will leave you grinning from ear to ear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mad Hot Ballroom","review":"A heart-warming documentary about post 911 NYC children and the fantastic school system and teachers who introduced them to the art of ballroom dancing.

Aside from seeing these youths develop into fancy, sophisticated hoofers, one great charm of the film is hearing the budding dancers talk about their lives, aspirations, and (of course!) the opposite sex.

The kids featured are fantastic. We adults can learn from them. They undertake something new to them and fly with it. Seeing the kids develop from the beginning stage to city champs is amazing.

I have two of the earlier editions. My only real complaint about the coverage in the new volume is that it's too bad that more details on the new Rolls-Royce Phantom could not have been included. This is a very handy book for the Rolls-Royce enthusiast.My other complaint about the book is the printing quality. A number of the pages were printed on damaged paper which had streaks and other imperfections, pg 76 in my copy as an example. Since this was a personal gift to myself, I really didn't want to go through the aggrivation and wait for a new copy. I don't know if the steep discount on the book was due to the copies purchased by Amazon were irregular or not.Anyhow enough said, the coverage maintians the level of RR history set down by Tony Bird."},{"rating":"2","title":"The must have on Rolls-Royce and post 1931 Bentley","review":"If limited to one definitive book on Rolls-Royce and post 1931 Bentley this would be it.

It is also annoying the way the author is complimenting himself and his brilliance throughout the book, when a little more detail about the topic would be more usefull to those who really need as much information as they can get *like me*. This book is probably intended for those that have had a networking related job, but for me as a newbie it has left me with lots of questions after reading the definition. This is a great book if you don't need serious information, and it is great for finding out what abbreviations stand for.

I keep thinking that the next edition will be better, but it is just the same exact definitions reprinted in a different font size or style. Sometimes I am really needing to find a REAL definition that will help me, but, I find a joke instead, or something written a long time ago. I never know what to expect, since some things are loosley defined and some definitions are so technical that they defeat the whole purpose. I end up looking up several other terms. I once found this book fun to read, but now it is so full of old stuff that it is hard to find the current info, and harder to learn from.

Also, information on the schools is no longer entirely accurate. As a current staff member for the Australian Outward Bound School, I noticed that the photos and text show activities we no longer run and areas in which we no longer operate. But fear not OB fans - rumour has it from a source at the Canadian Outward Bound Wilderness School I recently visited that another book is on the agenda for the author.

The feeling reading this is that there is less of a translation being presented than the author's interpretation of the work. After being told several times what God thinks, or must have thought, or what God really meant but was misstated as the stories were passed along and re-written, the entire basis for a \\"new translation\\" seemed suspect. Most people will be better served by reading mainstream translations (with study notes for in-depth analysis).

They were born in 1974 in Leaford, a small town in Canada during a rare tornado. Their birth mother abandoned them but a nurse named Lovey Darlen rescued them. She convinced her husband Stash to adopt the girls. Fast forward to the present, Rose has been diagnosed with a brain aneurysm that will soon kill them. Rose is determined to write her autobiography with her sister's help. Rose and Ruby share their feelings on what it is like to be them, important events, and the people who impacted their lives. Since they are writing their own individual chapters for the book, there is an intermingled timeline of events, zigzagging between the past and present. Their unique personalities become clearer as their story unfolds. Extraordinary prose allows you to feel what they feel trying to live normal lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I bought this book based on the high reviews, and was highly disappointed.

One problem: the story of Lori & Reba is infinitely more uplifting and interesting than any novel that tackles this subject, this one included.The whole book didn't seem to have a direction. The two seperate voices were disjointed from each other, and while I know I shouldn't be expecting a life-affirming message from the doomed twins, it would have been nice to have something to take away from reading \\"The Girls\\" other than thinking \\"That rather sucked. What should I read next?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The best book ever? Are you serious? BORING","review":"While I agree that a book about conjoined twins would be interesting, this is not that book. I was bored, the book was slow and tedius.

What a wonderful story, what interesting characters, what a unique writer's vision. Don't miss this amazing adventure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking","review":"A very unusual concept for a book, this book contains the fictional autobiographies of twins conjoined at the head. Ruby is more practical and down-to-earth and Rose is the creative, somewhat dreamy writer. The girls are raised on a farm in Canada by the nurse who helped their long-gone mother through labor and birth. They are raised with \\"normal\\" lives, going to public school and eventually holding jobs at the town library. Only the unnecessary trip to Slovakia with their foster parents marred an otherwise great story. The last few chapters are understandably sentimental and melancholy. All in all, a very satisfying and fast read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Girls","review":"Interesting and unusual topic for a novel, one that appealed to my own personal \\"twin\\" sensibilities. However, the book got a bit repetitive; and, definitely somewhat far-fetched as for each twin's ability to function as independently of the other as they purportedly did. Not a bad read...but, I would have trouble recommending it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Picked to read this book based on the interesting subject/storyline and all the great reviews. This was one of the most boring stories I have ever read. It started out good enough, but as we learned more and more about the sisters, I started to care about them less and less. A shame, because it's such an interesting premise. The sisters may have well been two separate people (two uninteresting, boring people specifically).I usually harp on people that write reviews without finishing a book. I'm about 70% done and I can't read anymore. I wouldn't even bother writing a review, but feel that I should try and combat some of the 5 star reviews to get a more accurate overall rating.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of a Snooze.","review":"I was excited to buy this book because the topic was unique and interesting. An interesting topic is about all this book has to offer. I usually like first person but I still didn't feel drawn in to the experience of the characters. The two voices would be great if they were not so repetitive. They didn't sound like two different people at all. It would have been nice if they at least had there own distinct personalities but they didn't. Somehow it just didn't work. I didn't even finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was okay","review":"We read this book as a selection for our monthly book club. Based on reviews of the book, I really thought I was going to love it. The beginning was great and I really enjoyed the book until about half way through.

It just got real slow and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting topic but poorly written","review":"Learning about the twin's life is very interesting, but the book lacks a clear direction, and is a bit sloppy at points. So much of the books is good, but is organized and told in such a confussing way it becamee more annoying than enjoyable. What editor would allow for so many parenthesis is baffling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Girls not that great","review":"Novel, fiction, some untruths in this book. Yes it is fiction butsome parts unbelievable."},{"rating":"2","title":"When I feel sorry for myself...","review":"I think of The Girls. Who, despite extremely difficult circumstances, really live their lives with passion and gratitude for all good things that come their way. I agree that the book moves slowly - but I think that's the point...to experience the ordinary lifes of these extraordinary women...to let the reader really sink into their experience and try to comprehend what it must be like. The book is full of love - and acceptance, and I finished it feeling uplifted and full of gratitude."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book you will feel the need to pass on to friends","review":"I felt compelled to give a copy of this unique and warm insight to my mother, daughter and best friend. I will read it again in a few years to remind myself about the lessons I learned about love, compassion and tolerance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written","review":"A really interesting story concept and a situation that I had never considered. The progression of the story through the two narrators' eyes is engaging and moves the story quickly. I loved all the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"the ultimate connection","review":"Imagine being joined physically with someone whose eyes you could never look into except in a mirror! In fact, figuratively and physically these 2 girls saw life through different eyes; their temperaments, their interests and their talents were of 2 separate individuals. No love was greater than that for each other but they could only do things that both agreed upon because they both had to be present.I thought the symbolism throughout was beautifully done, the overwhelming love and common sense of Aunt Lovey and Uncle Stash was so well described that you felt you knew them, and the 'Girls' were amazing.Well done, Lori Lansen!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books I've ever read","review":"I consider myself a big reader. I read this book probably almost three years ago now, and I can attest to the comment on the book cover- this book is \\"haunting\\"! I still think about it despite that it's been a few years now since reading it. It's one of my all-time favorites. I can't recommend it enough. I've passed it along to friends and the women in my family. You'll absolutely love it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it from the first word","review":"This is a wonderful novel about what it means to be a sister, what it means to be a family, what it means to be human. I wept in places and I laughed out loud in others. Lansens writes beautifully. I am truly puzzled by the reviewers who found this story \\"boring\\". While it may not be a page-turner in the traditional sense, it touched my heart in so many ways that it may just remain there forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a beautiful book!","review":"I loved it! It was just terrific... though there were more questions that were left unanswered than I can normally be satisfied with.. But, at the same time, I wouldn't change a thing! This story of conjoined twins (I am such a sucker for any twin story, thanks to growing up on Sweet Valley!) felt so utterly real. The way the separate narration blended together wove together a beautiful, and ultimately very heartbreaking, story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Asics Gel DS Trainer--a fast but safe shoe","review":"I've had two pairs of these shoes and they are by far my favorites. I didn't realize when I bought the first pair that they are actually \\"lightweight\\" trainers, which means you're not really supposed to use them for long runs and high mileage.

The book has a table of contents each for Episodes and Recipes which made it easy to find whatever I was looking for. I am pleased that the recipes are simple and easy.

However, the smart insights and 30-day plan contained in Zero Debt have the potential to curb negative spending habits for life.I appreciate the way Khalfani breaks down the process of debt reduction into smaller chunks that anyone can manage. Even if you follow half of her advice, you'll make a positive impact on spending and saving habits.Aside from the book's adult target, it also has merit for college students, as colleges rarely bring a speaker such as me on campus to provide them with lessons on debt management before problems start.Khafani surprised me by suggesting that readers pay for their credit report, especially because it can be obtained free of charge once a year.

This book contains similar information you'll find for free on the internet, but she did the research.

For the average middle class consumer though - who is maxed out on their credit cards - I find no relief in this book.

What's more, a Russian general is portrayed as a hero to his country, both past (his refusal to butcher Chechneyans) and in present (he orders the troops not to fire on the demonstrators). Also there were two morally ambiguous to downright evil Americans involved in the plot as well. As for Patrick Swayze being 50, get over it - he handled his action scenes quite well. All in all an enjoyable mini-series from Hallmark/Forsythe."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a great movie","review":"This is a movie with Patrick Swayze, but he was obviously sick during the filming, which makes it all too creepy for me.

Do these bands really give a piss about each other? I didn't believe it for even 1/2 a second. The film rambled on and on in a lukewarm fashion about two so-so bands without supplying any emotional content what so ever. The fact that it was 7 years in the making just drove home the point that there really wasn't any point of view going on from the director. Skip it, unless you love the music of Warhols or the BJM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best rockumentary EVER!","review":"I bought this immediately after watching it on DVD. It's a got- to- have item for music lovers, even if yu don't know who the Hell the bands are. It's like watching a train wreck in slo-mo as Anton drives both fellow band members and the Dandy Warhols away from him with his crazy behavior. I've now watched it several times and still get a kick out it, as have everyone that I've loaned it to. I even bought the Tepid Peppermint Wonderland collection by BJTM for myself to have more of their music. I gave them both to my mate in Scotland for Xmas, too and he was blown away by the film. The director worked on this for about 7 years and won several awards for it. A hell of alot better than the We Rock Econo crap on the Minutemen! At least try to rent a copy of it to watch and have a few friends over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anton is crazy, and the music industry is delusional","review":"Dig is a very entertaining and enlightening documentary about two pretty poor music groups. Both the Dandy Warhols and Brian Jonestown Massacre lack any real depth or musical value. The two things that are most interesting about the documentary are: 1. The totally crazy Anton. He alone makes the video worth buying. He lives in his own world, populated with his own illusions of stardom and notoriety. ; and 2. A portrayal of the clueless record industry. From this video you get an idea of why music that is put out by record companys sucks so much. They employ people who are only interested in money and/or think they actually know something about music and have never played an instrument in their life. No wonder about 98% of records fail. Music is controlled by and large by people who nothing about music.This DVD is definitely worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"An essay in bad music","review":"I don't understand how the Brian Jonestown Massacre and Dandy Warhols were trying to start a \\"musical revolution\\" by copying and aping 60's garage rock with a few late 70's knods(Television). Then again, Spin magazine and NME have a large audience so who am I to question?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing earth shattering.","review":"I quite enjoyed watching this movie but really learned nothing new from it. That this movie follows the lives of two bands of minimal talent who display hardly anything resembling originality (both in their music and their behaviour) means that anyone looking for any artistry here will be disappointed.The story of these two bands sounds promising but the outcome is so inevitable that there is no tension or surprises - one band milks it's 15 minutes of fame for all it's worth and the other self destructs.There is no genuine humour or wit here - just drug inflated delusional egos congratulating each other, declaring each other geniuses when the world at large really doesn't care.Ok so this documentary captures it all and captures it well but to me it just felt like I'd seen it all before and with much more interesting characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dug Dig! more than I dig the \\"Diggers\\"","review":"It's hard to be in a band. It's rare to be friends with another band and cheer lead one another as it often erupts into petty jealousies and this movie proves that time and again. I was only marginally familiar with The Afghan Whigs and The Brian Jonestown Massacre as artists and what I saw didn't really endear either group to me. Sure... both groups make good music, but it is not nearly as revolutionary as they want to pretend it is in their minds and their pretense makes what other wise would be just good rock (without knowing the performers so intimately) a little less palatable.As a film though... it's damn good piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edgy Movie","review":"I liked this movie, never even heard of these bands or knew the stories behind them until I stumbled across this movie. Even downloaded some of the songs from both bands on my ipod and they are still sounding great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass On This One","review":"Trying so hard to be different only makes you the same. There's no musical genius here just typical young people spouting tired cliches about \\"revolution\\" and \\"selling out\\".One hopes they'll grow out of it. Charting their progress into adulthood would make a far better documentary. As it is, pass on this one if you value your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow. Over-priveledge at it's finest...","review":"It's a shame that none of Anton's band-mates have the spine to properly put him in his place. Instead they allow him to continually destroy everything they work for because he believes that he is such a scary genius. This guy could use a few doses of humbleness as well as a good punch in the face. I'm available to give him both. Would Robert Plant act this way? Not a chance. Would any other human who has actual talent (and a brain) dare to act this way? Not a chance. This is a grown-spoiled-brat-baby-man that made me want to puke in his stupid mouth whenever he opened it. Great film making, but I feel very sorry for anyone who had to be subjected to this loser-man-child's actions while they practiced their craft. Anton, there is a pool of your own vomit somewhere waiting for you to drown in it. Drink up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Commentary....","review":"If your a music lover then I highly recommend this commentary. Metallica's \\"Some kind of monster\\" although a different type of music documentary, does not hold a candle to this. I liked it because it came off as real life experience and not cheesing for the camera(Like metallica in the reality show addled world of the present.). Anton Newcombe is truly a self destructive genius that still deserves critical acclaim, so what if BJM comes across as self destructive drug addled 14 year olds, their music is not only excellent, but they are also funny to watch on this dvd. I will be viewing this dvd again..."},{"rating":"2","title":"DiG!","review":"Seven years in the making, Ondi Timoner's absorbing, eye-opening two-band portrait pillories the excesses of record-industry imagemaking and greed, but it achieves real fascination in its intimate glimpses of unhinged BJM frontman Anton--a megalomaniacal head case, but also a prodigiously talented musician. Next to the polished, even-keeled Taylor--a friend and supporter--Newcombe seems like an unhinged, tortured genius set to self-destruct. His fistfight with his own band members on-stage at an industry showcase is just the beginning of a long, slow ride to hell. You'll \\"Dig!\\" this sad, outrageous, engrossing portrait of dysfunction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Rockumentary","review":"This is quite possibly one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. Anton is hilarious and it gives a really interesting perspective on the music industry and the lives of pseudo rock stars. It is crazy to see what these bands have to go through, and it was filmed over seven years, so it covers a lot. I definitely recommend it if you are into either the Dandys or the Masacre...or if you are just a music fan in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"ignore these reviews","review":"the preservation of some semblance of intellectual integrity compels me to note for readers of these reviews that the lengthy and glowing review of bodansky's book by greg copley is a serious disservice to amazon's system for rating books. copley and bodansky are very close friends and work together. bodansky writes regularly for copley's publication, and his review scarcely qualifies as impartial. the personal relationship between the two makes copley's review the equivalent of bodansky reviewing himself. caveat emptor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter nonsense disguised as \\"fact\\"","review":"One word: bollocks.Remember: this is the guy who coined the phrase \\"axis of evil\\".

But leave aside his bickering with another reviewer and assess the book on its merits (or lack thereof): the book is overly long, insufficiently or vaguely sourced, a mix of rumor and innuendo with fact (and it's nearly impossible to tell which is which because of Bodansky's vague sourcing). Bodansky obviously knows a lot about these issues, but his willing opaqueness--and his poor writing--make this book practically worthless. Don't waste your time. You won't learn anything from this doorstop of a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only one star","review":"because thats the lowest grade Amazon allows me to give for this book. The book is has a strong conspiracy background, its sometimes fun to read, but the many mistakes and factual errors are really annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Asinine","review":"I was attracted to this book by the dust jacket cover, knowing nothing about Mr. Bodansky starting out. Like many other reviewers I was at first annoyed and then flabbergasted by the lack of reliable citation or follow up on incredible stories (some guy in a Muq'ha told me so it must be true).

For example, past editions marked the actor and director indices clearly ON EVERY PAGE. Now if you want to find a director or actor you have to thumb around the back of the book with no way of knowing whether you're in the director or actor section. It's very frustrating.

And there are other examples. Zorro...many inane versions were listed, but not the classic version with Tyrone Powers where he fights Basil Rathbone and marries Linda Darnell.

I understand that this movie comes from a book series but I haven't read them. As a movie, standing alone, it did very well. I think if you enjoy FRIGHT NIGHT you'll enjoy this.4 out of 5 stars.

But instead it turned out to be the funnest, quirkiest vampire movie I've ever seen. Crepsley is just so *not* what you expect from a vampire, and yet he's so perfectly believable as a realistic vampire--no sparkles, no gothiness, just practicality and good-natured cynicism and a multitude of wonderful, funny lines. The pressures and conflicts the two teenage boys go through are remarkably reflective of real-world teen realities, in spite of the supernatural forces that are driving them. And the bad guys are just dangerous and creepy enough to give the movie a dark edge. And yet it never takes itself too seriously.

However, unlike a book series, you would have to either go out and read the series to see if this goes anywhere, or wait however long it takes for the next movie to come out (if they're making a new one...). Overall, I thought the plot was lame and the ending a disappointment. I would say more but it might be a spoiler if you're about to watch the movie. My opinion?

The books are entertaining and action-packed, but this movie adds multi-dimensional characters and stronger plot line.The movie is about Darren Shan who becomes a half vampire to save his friend's life. After that, Darren joins a circus of freaks where his mentor, a full vampire, resides. John C. Reilly is perfectly cast as Darren's mentor and hopefully will be in any of the sequels that follow. The rest of the cast is equally good. The addition of the monkey girl as Darren's potential love interest and the extra array of freaks made the story more colorful and fun. This movie combines light humor, dark fantasy, colorful circus freaks, and action.We've watched the movie three times, love the action, the freaks, the Little People, and the additions not found in the books.

Serious Ellington fans will certainly want to obtain the Musicraft recordings as they come from a period where the Duke was otherwise unrecorded in the studio and he and Strayhorn were engaged in serious efforts at stretching the accepted conventions of their art form.

And without giving anything away the late night conversation in the kitchen has to be one of the funniest scenes in a movie ever. I highly recommend this. It does have a more \\"artsy\\" feel to it than big Hollywood movies and premiered at the Sundance festival. Anyway, I loved this movie and both my husband and I laughed through the entire movie.

This novel may appeal to some readers because of its fast-paced plot and humor, but I thought it was uninspired and boring.

It takes place in a thinly disguised McDonald's, where so many teenagers get their first exposure to real world employment; Anderson has a wonderful comic gift for language; two of his most brilliant characters are the fast food manager who talks entirely in corporatespeak, and young Shunt, who embraces an equally artificial language of anti-corporate militance.

These would occur if I was only standing 2 feet away from the base. The person on the other end could not ever hear the static so it is a transmittal problem between the base and handset. It is even worse if any appliances are working, especially the microwave. I purchased a 2.4GHz because I thought that a different transmittal range would give great clarity.

Also, wish there was a redial button and everyone who uses it pushes the intercom button to end the call which makes a loud beeping noise. So obviously pushing the talk button to hang up the phone is not the normal procedure nor is it very popular with my friends who can not seem to get the hang of it, pardon the pun.I will give the phone a thumbs up for clarity and distance as well as battery talk time.

Yes, it is witty in some places, but this is nothing more than some light weight humor that depicts an awfully bad light on being a gay man.

In a book about finding \\"Mr. Right,\\" I'd expect something about relationships.

It's a good way to start since the selection of songs is representative of the wide range of the artist's repertoire... Libertad sings boleros, caribbean rhythms, Latin folklore and everything else with the same brillance as the tangos that made her famous. Here you will find her dramatic rendition of \\"Historia de un Amor\\", the curious blending of Puerto Rican-Argentinian feeling in \\"En Mi Viejo San Juan\\", the deliciously funny \\"O\\"...the immortal \\"Cuando Vuelva A Tu Lado\\"; every song on this CD is a gem and the digital transfer is pretty decent for BMG Latin.

All the standard cliches are here in the lyrics, and the music sounds totally like they just wish they were Belle and Sebastian. Just think Belle and Sebastian but more boring. Artistically, this CD has nothing to say, it just rehashes cliches. The title alone \\"La Camera Obscura\\" is annoying, its a good tip-off for what's inside. Like a high-schooler's notion of writing a poem's title in Spanish to make it more poetic and, \\"like, so deep.\\" And obscure.

The band makes pleasantly dull \\"chamber pop\\" in the vein of Belle & Sebastian and all those other similar bands to emerge over the last few years. Even their name is ripped off of Nico's last studio album, Camera Obscura. But, as I said before, Camera Obscura is much worse than Nico.

The sound is much better and louder than the stock horn, and really gives a nice warning to inattentive commuters floating into your lane while eating breakfast, putting on makeup and talking on their cellphone on the highway.I'm planning on buying a new car, and I'm planning on getting another set of aftermarket FIAMMs to give it a really nice and loud horn it deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice sound","review":"This horn set made a nice replacement for the weak meep-meep beeper that came stock in my Nissan Leaf. Now it has a clear authoritative sound like a large American car. Current draw for the pair is 10 amps, the same as the stock horn fuse, so I didn't have to install a relay.

However, he made one severe (and common) error: He juxtaposed later Jewish cultural and religious traditions onto the first century disciples of Jesus. Fortunately (or unfortunately depending on your perspective), these sort of mistakes are all too common, so he has done no worse than many other authors on the same and similar subjects.

When it came i was seriously dissapointed, but that makes sense since i fell for the easily accessible hook of a radio hit. Every song is so repetitive and they're not even repeating anything particularly interesting or original. If you've heard a song once, it feels like you've actually heard it ten times. The lyrics also seemed quite lame as well. I love new music but this was just a bunch of sampled garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most underrated band of 2005","review":"This CD and band have to be one of the most underrated of 2005. Fortunately NPR and other public radio is pushing Goldspot. When everyone was going gaga (me included) over Brighteyes, The Decemberists, and The New Pornographers, Goldspot delivered an album that is just as good. Melodic, truthful, depressing, beautiful are all words to describe Tally of the Yes Men.

This set of tools has conquered a small set of gunsmithing tasks and I can attest that these stood up quite well to milled aluminum and other metals. For the price I expected these to die under their work load but they've become part of the tool set. They might not last forever but I already got my money's worth, and they still have maybe another few projects in them, the rest is just icing on the cake!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect file set","review":"I love this set!

It also requires you to blow a little harder to get any sound out of it. But the label says it can be heard from farther away than the coaching whistle. The card it came on lists a number of armies that depend on this whistle. The sound and function is similar to the Micro safety whistle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Loud whistle","review":"Unlike what other retailers claim the Fox40 whistle is the USCG whistle. I've seen other companies claim theirs is used, but only the fox 40 has a national stock number (nsn 8465-21-912-7031)and is required for your survival vest. this whistle is loud at 115 db and easily works when submerged or partially submerged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Too Schematic, compared to \\"Room for Love\\"","review":"I guess Room for Love shows how far this author has come.

A funny, light story about two women coming of age and changing each others' lives. Start with CJ Riley, the only daughter of a wealthy father and a girl who won't grow up. She won't take responsibility for herself and lives recklessly. She meets stern cop Lois Franklin one night while speeding down the highway and decides Lois is just the challenge she's seeking. Of course, Lois is less than impressed with CJ and that's when the fun begins.CJ has a wake-up call when her father has a heart attack and she's needed to take over the family business. The only question is, will taking on this responsibility make her more attractive to Lois or will it tear them apart?Like most books by Jones, this one is enjoyable. The book is fairly short, but the characters are broadly developed and likable."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun story if you need a quickie","review":"This was a perfect read at the beach novel.

His stuff is just silly pictures containing ideas and statements that never cross the line to associative humor. Humor without a twist from a reference point. It' a hard thing to pull off. James Thurber pulled it off. Poor Jerry just doesn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"A kind review for the kind wolf","review":"I have to disagree with the last review. I have read this book to hundreds of first graders and to my own son, and there was nary a complaint of nightmares. It does portray the food chain and the bitter winter in a dramatic, naturalistic way, but frankly, a fox is likely to eat a mouse and winter is hard on many animals. The point of the story is that we should look beyond appearances, and that a leopard...and a wolf...can change his stripes; we should give folks a chance to improve themselves. Even the fox is a vegetarian by the end!Quirky story with a European style that may not to be everybody's taste, but definitely a winner in my neck of the woods!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Offbeat story, wonderfully evocative illustrations","review":"I must disagree with the Customer Reviewer who gave this book such a low rating. There is nothing nightmare-inducing here. Yes, a fox catches and eats a mouse, but the incident is treated matter-of-factly. Beatrix Potter herself would approve of the tone -- remember Tom Kitten in the Roly-Poly Pudding, about to be consumed by giant rats? Now THAT'S scary.The story shows how we can either transcend or embrace the stereotypes attached to us. We have a choice. Here, the wolf decides he doesn't want to kill, but actually prefers to heal the sick and injured. He meets with resistance from the forest denizens at first, but eventually he proves to be a good doctor.The pastel illustrations are wonderfully evocative. You feel the bitter cold of the winter, the fright of the poor little rabbit, and the wolf's sense of concern as he rescues the creature."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Story of the Kind Wolf","review":"As a grandparent of 3, I purchase all kinds of wonderful books for my grandchildren. This is not one of them. The story has page after page of animals killing and 'gobbling' each other up. Great illustration of a fox with a mouse in it's mouth. The wolf takes the advise of an owl and goes from the forest to find a new way of life. While he's away, the story tells of a bitterly cold winter and animals becoming desperate with the cold and hunger. The wolf turns into a vegetarian and turns all the little animals in the forest to fruit and vegetables instead of meat. Who do you think is behind this book? I gave it 1 star becaus -10 was not available. Thank goodness I read this book before reading it to my grandchildren, they would have had nightmares for weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Requirement for a long lasting love relationship","review":"This is an important book for all those who want to be in love forwever.

I enjoyed it for the most part though some times it did get a little slow. There was some question about if their relationship was really romantic or sibling-ish love. I would say that it was romantic, if its not too gross for some people. Hazuki does look a little young for Kouhei and there is a hope that if there is a relationship it would wait till she a little more grown-up. My only problem is with the last episode, it wasn't really necessary and can be skipped.

I don't think u should give away any musical CD, book or whatever just b/c it's not helping u or helping u out or probably b/c u just wanted to let it go and move on with other stuff. This book means all the contradictions, trials and tribulations u face in life incl. depression, dying, suicide, pain, envy, divorce, friendship, broken relationships (saved or unsaved), u know all those things. People need to understand what it's coming from the heart. I think I should pick this up ASAP until I have currently read The Autobiography of Malcolm X, Primary Colors and Divided Soul: The Life of Marvin Gaye which I reading at this moment.

That's impressive reliability considering the heavy use I subject my computers to. This power supply has more cables than most computers could possibly use, you will need a place to cram the unused cables into to keep the computer's hardware easy to access.Only bad thing I can think of is that there is no way to turn the LEDs off without either turning the computer off or placing into stand-by. They give off a lot of blue light!If I had to buy another power supply, I would buy from the same brand, but bump up the wattage. 500 watts is now on the lower side of computer power."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked For about 2 months","review":"This power supply came with the Aspire alien case I bought. This box had everything and was fairly easy to hookup... After about 2 months of using this for maybe 20 hours a week My PC would not power up anymore. Upon pressing the power button, all the fans would turn for a split second and then lose all power. The LED on the motherboard showed that there was power coming to it so I figured maybe it just had too much hooked up to it. I removed all power to all devices except the motherboard and it still did the same thing. Then I threw in a 300Watt power supply and it powered right up. For the amount of money I paid for this case and the so called 500 watt power supply I expected it to last longer than 200 hours. Now I gotta find a replacement. Thanks for a P.O.S. and many hours wasted diagnosing the problem Aspire. Never again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great power suppply","review":"I've had one of these on my homebuilt desktop for 3 years and it works fantastic.

We have never been able to play this episode because we use Linux in this household and the video player is not supported on that operating system. We also have an android tablet that is unable to play it also. So basically we just threw away $1.99 and I hate wasting money!

In other words, there's nothing here on the level of Gundam or Transformer type designs, but on the other hand it does give insight into components parts like hands, joints, weapons, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for any project","review":"While it is designed for the three-hole horn lenses in a 3 5/16\\" bolt pattern, you can, with some know-how and a little drilling, be able to attach this adapter to any bolt on horn lens or to any other horn-related project, so you can use any of the 1 3/8\\" spin on horn drivers with a 18 threads per inch thread out there. They're made of a durable plastic which makes it even better. I'm using the pair I bought on the baskets of 6X9\\" speakers and forming my own lenses in the baskets to make a pair of 6X9\\" horns.

There are MANY gems on the first disc. But this disc should be subtitled \\"The Latin Remixes\\". Latin rhythms are great-- but EVERY mix here is latin-flavored, and it gets boring fast. I made the mistake of not reviewing the album first online. I was eager to purchase because I really liked the first album, and i figured, 'how bad can it be.' So, listen to a few tracks first before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"If a 3rd remix CD is released, I WILL preview it before purchasing","review":"Even though I just got the CD and only listen to it once, I think I'll burn my two favorites and shelf it. I liked CD 1, and just picked up 2 assuming it would be better but didn't. The only cut that I really liked and ended up cleaning to was the Marvin Gaye remix. It's housey enough to build up a sweat and get a few chores done. I would love if they did another CD making it a truly club/house with no breaks. Can you image 80+ minutes mixed together with echoes, bass and beats? Man.... Oh yeah, if anyone from Motown is reading this, please don't repeat songs on the next CD that were featured on the two previous. Choose another song by the group/artist or release a EP with 5+ versions if you really feel the need. I'm hopeful, and may even grow to like # 2 more -but still won't buy the next remix on impulse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful entertainment","review":"My 6 months old son listened intently to the rymes of the text. His eyes became big when I pointed out individual characters or objects of the colourful illustrations in this book.

God bless them and their families.I never compared Great White to total glam bands like Poison or Warrant. These guys wore jeans and leather jackets too. GWs sound was more mature if you ask me, more piano and extended guitar riffs with arrangements that were more consistent with 70's style than the all out glam sound.This CD is worth buying. I would compare Great White more with Tesla than Poison or Warrant. No, its not as good as the first album \\"once bitten\\". Crank \\"House of Broken Love\\" one time and you'll be captured \\"if you don't wanna lose your lovin' use it constantly, if theres gonna be lies, suspicious eyes, then baby, baby set me free!\\" This CD stands on its own no problem.Buy it for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst hair bands...","review":"I'm sorry, but I just have never really liked Great White.

Besides the cover of Ian Hunter's \\"Once Bitten Twice Shy\\", which is great, this album just doesn't work for me. \\"The Angel Song\\" is a prime example of why so many critics hated the power ballad back in the 80's.

The book shelves are so clever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great toy box!","review":"My 13 month old son loves this toy box.

What it is though, is a great toy chest for toddlers. I got this for my son when he turned one and we've put just about everything in it (including him). It's big enough to keep all the toys he currently plays with and not too big that we end up keeping everything. It's very easy to open and close -- he's been able to do it himself since 1 1/2. We love the bookshelf -- we keep all of his books on it and he likes that he can pick them out himself whenever he wants. We've found this (accessability) to be a big plus in encouraging him to read books. It is extremely durable and washes easy. He also likes to sit on the edge when the chest is open, and has often fallen in, but he generally ends up laughing. Not a safety hazard. I don't think you can find a better toy chest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!!!","review":"i bough this set of golf clubs, and they scratch very easily.the top part of the header on my driver flew off one day when i was hitting the ball. plus the shaft is not good at all either.not worth, the money, used clubs would work better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The story of a Belgian WWI fighter pilot","review":"Willy Coppens was the Belgian Flying Corp's highest scoring ace of the First World War, having received credit for 37 kills, all but two of which were against balloons. This biography tells it all, from the very beginning when he had to go to England to receive less-than-suitable private flying instruction, through two years of varied and unfruitful service, until finally in the spring of 1918 he began to register kills. The book is an insightful portrayal of the mindset of a First World War pilot, as well as the advent and growth of the small Belgian contribution to the air war. Days on the Wing was subsequently revised and re-issued in paperback in 1971 with the title Flying in Flanders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wildcrafters","review":"I had a very difficult time with this book.

It deals with the plight of a Bolivian man who is forced to leave his country, and family, in search of work in Argentina, a society that is suffering from its own economic depression. Most of the movie takes place in the caf�� where the Bolivian immigrant has found work as a cook. The frequenters of this establishment are suffering from their own economic hardships and resent the immigrant who is willing to work for less than them.The film is in black and white and focuses on the daily interactions that take place in the caf��. While there is not a lot of action, you watch the tension build as the life of one of the characters begins to fall apart and he increasingly makes the Bolivian cook the focus of his anger. The movie also touches on the issue of racism.

Add in the plodding pace, the tired and worn cliches (working class people hate foreigners who come to their country and \\"take their jobs\\").This has all been done before and far better.

The seasoning was uneven with some chips fairly well covered while others were barely seasoned. They are HARD and thick and without the seasoning, virtually flavorless -- taste a thick plain baked tortilla shell. I have no idea how I will finally get rid of them without wasting my money.

As I dug deeper, I have discovered the author writes as eloquently as she paints. Her explanations are clear and concise and the illustations are very helpful. But more importantly, perhaps, woven throughout the book is an underlying sense of encouragement. This author doesn't just want to show you \\"how-to,\\" she wants to inspire you.

The key to all oriental painting is the power of the strokes. Nan Rae's strokes are weak and lack courage. It is saddening when students are misled by a glossy 'how-to' book. Several of Nan Rae's illustrations are poor copies from books such as the Mustard Seed Garden Manual of Chinese Brush Painting, a classical 'how-to' book that has endured for centuries. One of the problems with all 'how-to' books is that students try to imitate the finished result, not understanding that the correct performance and rhythm of the strokes are necessary to achieve their goal. Nan Rae's explanations and encouraging style are well-written; it is a pity that her painting technique does not equal her writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wiring harness holder","review":"works like it should.

In my opinion they could have cut the fat and made this a short 30 min. T.V. show. One plus is that it&#65533;s a little freaky which makes it scary to a degree.

That was my initial reaction upon first viewing this film. And remains so. Conceived , written by, and starring Anna Devere Smith, this one woman show of the events surrounding the Rodney King verdict, and the riots that followed, is a must see. It is not only an artistic achievement, but an incredibly moving and effective social commentary. She creates brilliant portrayals of different characters, with varying observations of the destruction around them. The fact that Anna Deavere Smith not only wrote this , but acts it out, is a revelation. I have seen Miss Smith in several supporting roles, and thought she had a commanding presence, but this truly shows what a wonderfully talented artist she is.

The form of the book creates a new genre in literary representation by capturing the essence of each character's idiosyncratic voice. This video is a condensed version of the dramatic play. The first time that you see it, you will realize the sheer brillance of Smith's ability; not only has she written a great drama but she has the skill of a virtuosa on the stage, bringing the voices within the play to vivid life. I cannot stress how important this play/ book is in terms of our American identities. It is complex and intense; it provides us with the opportunity of seeing ourselves from the outside without ever reducing the multiplicity of us all."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You haven't seen it: You Must!","review":"This video is fantastic.

Made in the latter half of the seventies, this Rock Opera style album is almost a FUNK opera album. The heavy beats, funky guitar, and sci-fi sound effects, combined with a sort of innocent fascination about space and aliens reminds listeners a GREAT DEAL of the sort of themes and sounds you'd hear in a Parliament album. Compare themes to Parliament's \\"Unfunky UFO\\". Before this album, i didn't even know there was a middle ground between Pink Floyd and Parliament.There are a couple of slow areas in the album, but they aren't too excruciating, as when stuff slows down, it becomes a kind of creepy, wacky ambient noise (The Red Weed).The actor/singers are all excellent. Many people since have tried to accomplish what Richard Burton (the journalist) did in this, but VERY few have succeed.Highly recommended to anyone who liked music in the seventies, unless you only liked country."},{"rating":"2","title":"my personal opinion its the best soundtrack ever","review":"as a big justin hayward and moody blues fan i find war of the worlds just as emotional and satisfying as all the moodies music.I originally purchased this recording years back on the basis of one song \\"forever autumn\\".To my surprise the rest of the recording was just as brilliant!

I was a fan of UK progressive rock and the person who bestowed this gift upon me thought that this would be right up my alley. Don't get me wrong, some of the music is good, but that disco beat HAS TO GO!!!!. The unfortunate thing about the album is that despite some decent music, the whole concept is utterly stupid!!! HG Wells \\"War of the Worlds\\" as a rock opera concept album??? I think that calls for a: what the hell were you thinking Jeff Wayne??? When critics look back on the UK prog scene of the 70's and mock it as self indulgent egotistical nonsense, this is the kind of album they are referring to. This is an interesting album to own, and definitley an enigmatic piece of progressive rock history, but the disco beat and the \\"ooooo laaaas\\" just make me laugh when I hear it now. If Joey Ramone was a spy, and he was captured by the KGB, this is the album they would use to get him to talk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite Possibly THE Worst Thing I Have Ever Heard In My Life","review":"This album is unutterably horrible. Cheesy 70's sound effects and chicken wakka-wakka guitars, horrible narration, and some of the cheesiest lyrics I have ever heard in my life make this one embarassing listen. I give it no stars. Phil Lynott is the only saving grace for this album, but even he's not enough to make it worth spending any more than $0.30 on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stereo setup BEWARE","review":"This product does not support stereo SACD OR CD playback even though it says it does. There are instruments missing in the stereo mix in both CD and SACD stereo mode. I believe others have commented that the cd audio quality is lacking. That is because you need surround mode to hear all the instruments. I know because I have the original stereo CD set and there are BIG HOLES in the music where background instruments are missing. Unless you have a 5.1 system, you will not hear the full score. Avoid this product if you have a stereo system.VERY DISAPPOINTED. product returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"You never get tired of this album!","review":"The War of the Worlds remains one of my favorites after 21 years. I bought this as an LP when I was 14, and I still have it, including the booklet, in excellent condition. I spent so much time listening to this LP, that I had to tape it several times to keep from wearing it out. This is a true MASTERPIECE. Buy it, you'll wonder how your music collection could have ever been complete without it! I have also purchased the CD, to give my tired LPs a rest after 21 years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They're Coming To Take Me Away. Hah! Hah!","review":"Okay, this album is not quite like Napoleon XIV's 1966 one hit wonder. The good news: it is SO much better. A stellar group of musicians, and actor legend Richard Burton narrating this remarkable double album makes the Martian invasion of earth so realistic, you really do feel the Martians may be coming for you next!! I initally purchased this double LP years ago only because Moody Blues frontman Justin Hayward had a large part in this project, and his guitar work is immediately recognizable throughout this double album, along with his soaring vocals on two songs. But ALL parties involved here make this work a true classic. This is an incredible recording from 1978 that will have you sitting on the edge of your seat time and time again. My thanks to Jeff Wayne for spearheading this wonderful project!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Martian Takeover Successful","review":"The Martians Came aided by Thier Martian Overlord Jeff Wayne and Succesfully Rocked the Planet Earth.

I had been trying to order an imported version of the War of the Worlds for about a year from a local record store -to no avail.

I always loved this album, and think it's a MUST OWN for anyone who enjoys MUSIC! Yes, it's a little dated, and yes it's a bit \\"campy\\" at times, but man, Sir Richard Burton narrating the story of The War Of The Worlds over Moody Blues member Justin Hayward's singing and playing; I mean, how could you go wrong??? It's a trippy clasic of the original version with all the 1970's glam. Kind a think it would of been even cooler if released some 10 years prior in the \\"height of psychedelia.\\" Man, talk about out there!!! It's still a \\"ONE OF A KIND\\" original masterpiece! Would make a great addition to any music collection, be it \\"hippie\\" or \\"gen x\\" alike. The amount of time and energy put into this project truly shows, they don't make albums like this anymore. A+Grab a copy! Take a drive one stormy night on a dark road and \\"crank it up!\\" It's a true experience!!!Even cooler, get a copy on vinyl.

As a young-un I used to go down to the local library, put on the headphones and listen to the libraries vinyl record. And in those early days, before walkmans or cd's, let alone mp3's and iTunes, I was a common figure sitting in the library, bobbing my head to Jeff Waynes enduring classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Winner of A musical Story","review":"If you are familiar with the musical Rick Wakeman's \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" and like it, then this double cd will come as a pleasant surprise. Similar in vein and sound to JTTCOTE, it brings the Martian invasion envisioned by HG Wells to you thru your audio system. A remixed offering with triple layer this CD has Stereo, SACD Stereo and SACD Surround and it sounds awesome. It also has a certain period sound that will take you back to the time of the recording. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Musical Talent - Jeff, MORE MORE MORE!","review":"I first bought this album (yes album) when it came out in the 70s. It was amazing then, and just as amazing now.I find myself singing \\"Spirit of Man\\" in the shower (apologies to anyone within hearing distance)... and Forever Autumn will be one of my favorite love songs of all time... :)Recently, I booked a trip to England, and (on a lark) wondered if someone had decided to pick this up as a stage musical (as far as I can tell, no one has). DAMN! What a missed opportunity.However, there IS a 30th anniversary tour of WotW with Jeff Wayne and Company. Tour dates are here: http://www.thewaroftheworlds.com/.I'd already booked a trip to London in the Fall, but I am trying to get my tickets changed so I don't have to miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!By the way, if you want some sneak peaks... have a look out on YouTube. There are some clips of the live show there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb adaptation","review":"This is more than just the single greatest adaptation of H.G.

I'll be the first to acknowledge that not everyone shares the same tastes in art, literature and music, but I will say that if you don't like this album then there is something wrong with you (and I mean MEDICALLY wrong with you).Get it now if you don't already have it. You've got two versions to choose from, so no excuses."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best CD you'll ever buy","review":"I was a small boy when my father put this on in his International Scout (it was an 8 track player by the way) and we were on a road trip to the mountains and even better it was at night... and this is the absolute best time to listen to this CD. I recently bought this CD and am still amazed at the way the story is told through music and narration. I don't own a better album."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums of all time","review":"The original concept album itself is a stunner, and this box set is a wonderful toy for the serious fan. The alternate version of songs and outtakes, in addition to the beautiful coffee table book, make a second (or third or fourth...) purchase worth it. The musicianship, the composition, and the performances are all first rate. I have loved this album for 25 years, and this new version only makes me love it more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to this at night, under the stars with no distraction","review":"What an emotionally draining piece. I've listened to the vinyl version for 25 odd years, now the CD just cleans up the experience and makes it more intense. The music and lyrics are powerful dragging my emotions all over the map. Burton's naration is wonderful, he was a true master of storytelling and the english language.I can't listen to Forever Autumn any longer. After my Mom died last fall my 8 year-old daughter told me how much Forever Autumn describes her feelings for her Grandma. I just can't listen to the piece anymore without thinking of that. If you've ever lost someone you may have the same reaction..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow - SACD","review":"Wow. I have listened to Jeff Wayne's War of the World hundreds of times since I bought the original albums in the 70s. I waited for months for this set to come available and even bought an SACD player so that I could hear it in full surround sound. I love it when the cap unscrews how the sound goes around you.The making DVD is very interesting and I learned a lot. I found the remix CD a mixed bag.The package is beautiful and the reprints of the art work nice. Lots of lyrics and notes.I am very happy with my set."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful retelling of the classic story","review":"- This is amazing.

Richard Burton's narrative, Justin Hayward's music, and Jeff Wayne's technical expertise is a masterpiece. I remember the first time when I heard the first musical notes that followed Richard Burton's opening introduction I said to myself, \\"This is going to be good.\\" And I was right.

I have enjoyed some superb nights in clubs where he was DJ-ing and i have some serious classic tunes of his in my collection... Forbidden Fruit, Perfect Day, How Much Can You Take, Avenue etc.I don't wish to offend anyone who likes this tune but it is simply rubbish. The vocal is cheesy but the tune itself is very poor also. The Out There and Back album was disappointing compared to Seven Ways but still contained some great moments ( The Love from Above, Avenue, Travelling, Another Way, The Riddle) but i can't fathom what PVD with his underground roots was thinking when he produced this.

The consequense is a loose-fitting chrome front panel that does not hug the wall as it should...spend more, get more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Item sent","review":"This is the article I ordered but received a old green Brewers shirt, I am in the process of sending it back.

The author demonstrates differences between right and wrong techniques, using pictures of each technique to show exactly what the effects of the techniques are. His writing style is relaxed, but not sloppy. The overall effect is a comfortable but precise learning experience. When you finish a section or chapter, you feel that you've had a meaningful learning experience, and captured some essential aspect of either Web graphics in general or the PSP program in particular."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you have a web page, BUY THIS BOOK!","review":"I have a web page on the Internet with graphics I (illegally) stole out of other people's web pages.

Hasbro tried to incorporate \\"action features\\" such as having Mace swing his arms and twist his waist, but I find these features almost always never work or destroy the integrity of the figure. His arms are a bit looser than they would otherwise be. As for the paint and sculpt, all I can say is that the Vintage version blows this one out of the water.

I thought, well, this is one nice camera. Well, when I got it, it must have ben broke. I used it for ten minutes inside, and there were all these grainy red pixels floating around the LCD. To make things worse, they also transferred to the video, so nothing you filmed could be watched. It was absolutely horrible.

It is awesome how you can select the clips that you want placed on a dvd and then burn all selected onto a disk. The only complaint I have is that there is no flash on the camera. The still photos are very clear during the day, but at night there is no light.

I was excited to have the hard drive/DVD combo capability, but I guess the technology was too good to be true. The features were easy to use, but the video and sound quality was just awful. You absolutely cannot film indoors in ANY lighting. I tried full and dim light, and the picture was too grainy to even make out a face. Outdoors it performed better, but who takes all their video outdoors? Also, with active kids, it didn't catch a good stable image of them in either natural or indoor lighting. I was really disappointed as I wanted this type of video camera for a long time. I'm hoping they can improve the technology in the future. I had read other reviews about the poor performance of this camera after I returned it...

I thought it a fluke, perhaps not, as the replacement did the identical thing.

Even the most simplistic of subject matter when filtered through Syd's perspective is invested with a sense of almost child-like wonder that no other artist can come close to capturing. \\"Milky Way\\" and \\"Dolly Rocker\\" are indespensible, and many of the alternate takes provide a less embellished setting for some of the songs, which tends to serve them well. If you haven't heard any of Syd's post-Floyd works, they are much more stripped down than Piper at The Gates of Dawn and consequently more personal. The takes could have been better, but in Syd's state this is the best he was able or willing to give. Though I think this only makes the songs seem more delicate and compelling. Definitely and overlooked Genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"faery tales to music","review":"There would have been no Pink Floyd without Syd Barrett.

The authors should have not have lingered on what the stars are naming their babies and concentrated more on a variety of names and derivations. My wife and I expected a lot more from these authors as parenting magazines make them out to be the end-all-be-all in names. Needless to say we will never buy a book from either of these authors again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this book!","review":"If you are looking for a book that gives meanings behind the names don't buy this book. It only gives the author's opinion on the name or a list of famous people who share the name. I also find that is does not have a good selection of names. For example, it lists the name Torquil(which I have never heard of) but does not have the name Travis, and the book even mentions the name Travis in an opinion on another name. I find it opinionated and poorly written."},{"rating":"2","title":"MERITS MUCH MORE THAN A GLANCE!","review":"I bought this new book from these authors when I named my last baby and I found lots of new and updated material in it. Every parent needs both this one and Beyond Jennifer & Jason, Madison & Montana! Not every word in the updated editions is new but name trends and cultural references change so fast that I was glad I bought the updates for naming each new baby (I have three, spread out over ten years.)And by the way, Jaden is NOT a biblical name and Alexandria IS the correct name of Keith Richards daughter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's cool","review":"I wish it had more history on the names, it's more of a basic overview and more about who is famous with the name"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little flavor","review":"I suggest choosing another brand of candied orange peel.

It read like a conversation with a friend, unfortunately its content seemed only about that reliable. While the author starts out talking about sleep functions, etc., she then moves on to give gobs of tangentally-related parenting advice...my point being that this \\"info\\" was merely opinion, and an unprofessional-sounding one at that. She didn't back up what she said in a substantial way, and I found that in fact, she didn't offer any real solutions to people in dire need of a sleeping child. At best this book offers guidelines that would be good to keep in mind before a baby is born, and a bit of info on infant sleep patterns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for us","review":"I didn't like this book for two reasons: First, the premise didn't work for us. My child put himself to sleep at night just fine, and then proceeded to get up every two hours during the night. Second, I felt the book was not well written. As a sleep deprived mom, I have to make the most of the time I have available to read. This book is so disorganized it took quite a while to figure out what Ms. Mindell's technique was. Most of the book didn't apply to us, but I felt I had to read the whole thing anyway just to figure out the sleep training. It is not clearly written or well organized."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed my life for the better","review":"I am a pediatrician and had read many sleep guides in order to help guide my patients related to sleep issues for their children. It wasn't until I suffered many sleepless nights with my first son that I buckled down and focused on sleep habits as a priority. Dr. Mindell's book is a sensitive, practical, well researched book and approach. (I vehemently disagree with the reviewer who states that this goes against what the AAP recommends. As a MEMBER of the AAP- this book is EXACTLY what the AAP believes in! Please educate yourself before making blanket statements!) My children are now much better sleepers! I now recommend this book exclusively to my families, and have gotten rave reviews. If you are strong enough to follow this advice, you will be well rewarded."},{"rating":"1","title":"you don't need to pay money to hear your child scream","review":"The gist of this book is \\"just let them cry\\". My husband and I have followed the advice of this book to the letter but my son does not and has not responded the way the book says he will. Sometimes he falls asleep after screaming only five minutes and sometimes he falls asleep after screaming for hours, there's no pattern that I can tell. He does eventually fall asleep though, but he did that before we used this method."},{"rating":"2","title":"The importance of sleep","review":"Good friends recommended this book to us 2 years ago. It worked so well for our son starting at 8 weeks old, that we have in turn recommended it to many other couples who have also been successful in establishing good sleep patterns for their children (of a variety of ages). Most improtantly, this book helps you to understand your childs sleep NEEDS. So many parents fool themselves into thinking that if their child doesn't look sleepy, they mustn't need to go to sleep, or that their child had different needs. The proper amount of sleep has kept our child healthy and alert and us parents sane. We have enjoyed parenthood without losing touch with still being a couple; our child is in bed at a proper hour leaving US couple time in the evening. Our only suggestion is that ALL the people involved with your child's care must agree to follow the guidelines of the book otherwise you are sending confusing messages to your child. Be as consistant as gravity!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked wonders for us","review":"Our 7 month old daughter has always had a difficult time falling asleep and staying asleep.

I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good facts - bad approach","review":"This book has lots of information about sleep, but the approach for correction is a variation of the Ferber cry to sleep method. If you can stomach many nights of crying to get to your goal this may be a book to read. If you want a more gentle approach that works just as fast I'd recommend The No Cry Sleep Solution. Both of these books are written by mothers which make them (in my opinion) better than those by professionals without children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I used this book for my first 2 children and it worked wonderfully, both kids are continuously sleeping through the night. My third child is 4 months old now and I am ready to start on it again, my only problem -- I've lent it to so many people I am not sure where it is and may have to buy a new copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"vomiting is fun???","review":"I've read this book twice, and nowhere do I see the \\"vomiting is fun\\" quote. This book is VERY compassionate toward both babies and their caretakers. There are numerous studies showing that babies who soothe themselves to sleep are more independent and less fussy later in their development. My sister never read this book but used these methods from her own common sense and had healthy sleepers and happy, well-behaved children. This book repeatedly advises not to leave your baby cry for an extended period. I am due in November and am set to use these methods with confidence, knowing I'm doing the best thing for my child."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book helped us a lot!","review":"I have read 5 books on sleep in an attempt to get my toddler and infant to sleep. I was really committed to finding a peaceful, loving solution for helping our babies sleep and this book really helped. My sensitive, intense son slept with us for 15 months and thanks to this book, we worked with him very gradually and gently to help him sleep by himself and through the night. We did end up having to let our baby cry to get herself to sleep but only after we were convinced that she was not able to be soothed other ways and really needed (for her own sake, not only ours) to sleep by herself. This book was a tremendous resource for us and my family is grateful and rested!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disorganized information; us against baby attitude.","review":"This book was not helpful at all. I learned nothing that I haven't already read in every parenting magazine's generalized article on the subject. I expected a book to be more specific. Instead the author tends to deliver her advice in such a disorganized way that half way through each chapter I found myself checking back to the beginning to make sure I hadn't accidently skipped to another chapter. Finding information that applied to my five month old was hit and miss. Plus the more I read the more uncomfortable I felt taking any of her advice since every chapter seems to have an \\"parent against baby\\" attitude. Often refering to a child's way of dealing with the world around her as \\"pulling stunts.\\" I don't care to relate to my precious baby as if she were a juvinile delinquent."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a miracle!","review":"This book is wonderful. It first explains a child's sleep pattern and why some children don't sleep through the night then gives you ways to help your child learn to put herself back to sleep. It worked wonders for us. I am finally getting some sleep after only 1 week of using these techniques."},{"rating":"2","title":"I felt that this book was extremely useful.","review":"Parents of young children and infants should read this book. It offers advice about getting children to sleep and developing bedtime routines, and it also offers a primer about child rearing in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleep book","review":"This book was recommended by our baby's pediatrician. Its really a \\"cry it out\\" book. So it depends on if that's a method you're willing to inflict on your child. We're looking for a new pediatrician."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work for everyone","review":"I have followed this book to the letter and - 6 weeks later and many many tears - my son still cries and cries at bedtime and does not sleep through the night. Not even close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Toddlers in a Bed","review":"My husband and I have spent the last two weeks walking our daughter to her bed for 2 to 2 1/2 hours every night. The ideas in this book are good if your child is in a crib and cannot get out. This theory became a game that kept our daughter awake instead of sleeping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blatant attempt to cash in on sleep deprived parents","review":"This book is written in a meandering style that tells a lot of random stories but offers few solutions. The solution described is actually the Feberizing method which lets the child cry themselves to sleep, but I haven't seen the name mentioned .... copyright infringment? At any rate this book is not only a waste of time and money the advice it gives you is in my estimation very hard to even gleen and even then it is third rate at best. A much better book which offers ten times the information in one chapter is \\"Secrets of the Baby Whisperer\\" by Tracy Hogg."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well rested!","review":"This book is great! My husband and I have taken all of Dr. Mindells advice and have a 16 month old daughter that sleeps from 8pm - 7:30 am daily! We started following Dr. Mindell'a advice when she was 10 weeks old and we weren't getting much sleep. It immediately changed our lives for the better. We continue to refer to the book for on-going issues that come up that sometimes disrupt her sleep. I recommend it to everyone I know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound advice from a true sleep specialist!","review":"My son didn't start sleeping through the night until he was 19 months old. That was when we started seeing Dr. Mindell. She and her book were wonderful for our family. She is compassionate and offers no-nonsense advice for helping your entire family get to sleep!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Common-Sense Solution to Sleep Problems","review":"I love this book. It's perfect for parents who can tolerate some crying. It's highly effective, highly practical and allows you to comfort your child when you feel it's necessary...this book rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best baby & toddler handbook","review":"I bought this book 13 years ago when I was having trouble getting my first son to go to sleep and stay asleep. It worked such great wonders, and we really got on a good schedule because of this book. Now I consider this a great baby shower gift!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jodi Mindell, where are you when I need you???","review":"I loved reading this book. Mindell's approach seemed so sensible! I loved the idea that you only had to let your baby cry ONE time per night, at bedtime (as opposed to every time he woke all night). One time a night didn't seem too awful. And she promised that babies would cry 45 minutes the first night, 1 hour the second and 20 minutes the third.Well, it's night TEN, and my baby is still crying for an HOUR every night. I have followed her \\"basic bedtime method\\" TO THE LETTER, I am totally consistent every night, and I am just about to give up. She has no website, no place where I can go to ask questions or try to get some advice. I'm just adrift out at sea with nothing but the book to refer back to.I will say again that I love the idea of this book, but it hasn't worked at all for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Upsetting Book","review":"If you do not believe in letting your baby cry herself to sleep, do not buy this book. I have read everything from Dr. Sears to this woman, Mindell, and she is the worst. She devotes an entire page to vomiting and explains how the baby does this to manipulate the parents. She even goes on to say that some enjoy vomiting! What kind of helpful information is that? It seems like child abuse to me and hopefully to other parents too. These are babies we are talking about, not dogs, although I wouldn't treat my pets this way either. This book completely pushed me over to attachment parenting. (...) My baby will never have to experience any of this wacky stuff that Mindell pushes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New Here . . .","review":"Yawn. The only one this book helped sleep better was me! I couldn't stay awake when I tried to read it. Dr. Mindell's attempt to put scientific research and behavioral theory into layman's terms comes off as condescending. This book does not have anything new to offer. The promised \\"practical tips on bedtime\\" are the same ones I bet you've read on some parenting website. The author's \\"tried and true method\\" is nothing more or less than making your children cry themselves to sleep. If you are already familiar with the \\"cry-it-out\\" method and understand sleep associations and the importance of bedtime routines, don't bother buying this book. There is nothing new here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new","review":"This book did not include any information that I wasn't already aware of. There was nothing insightful and I returned it immediately. I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"better books for sleep","review":"I got this book because I thought this was the title of a recommended book, I read about half and it didn't really help with what I need right now. My baby is 7 weeks and I needed something that would help now; this book is more geared towards toddlers and up.I would recommend Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child. It is a great book and also recommended to me by several people. It speaks specifically to the age of your child starting from newborn."},{"rating":"1","title":"At ease with my daughter","review":"My daughter is two years old and this book helped me normalize my child's behavior. My daughter is my only child so i had nothing to compare her sleeping patterns. However, after reading this book, i understand that i am doing the right thing and that she is a unique and special child. I related to several of the stories in the book and it helped me be more patient and understanding of my daughter. Thanks Dr. Jodi MIndell for writing this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Child Abuse","review":"The methods prescribed in this book are CHILD ABUSE - plain and simple. If you are desparate and tired - try reading a book that will help you UNDERSTAND infant developmental appropriateness - Dr. Sears and Elizabeth Pantley are good.If you have to harden your heart to let your baby cry until they vomit - you are ignoring nature's gift to you \\"Mother's Instinct\\".Ask yourself how YOU would want to be treated? Humanely and with respect.All the posters who say it \\"worked like a charm\\" are fooling themselves about the long-term effects of this type of program. Parenting is a long road - a quick solution may not be the answer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have a Phd, you probably sell a lot of books...","review":"Dr. Jodi Mindell's complete lack of real practical awareness in this subject is pretty apparent. This is typical of many other 'expert' advisors, a brief look around at parenting forums yield an obvious fact; there is NO reliable sleep pattern from child to child. Most parents are of course, desperate to get some kind of normal sleep from a baby, and most parents will use ANY tecnique to feel as though they are able to do something about it. Take this book as a fifty-fifty prospect that it will HAPPEN to work. Consider yourself blessed if you have a child that sleeps through the night, it's partly what you do in a routine, but it's also the child. My son's pediatrician calls it right every time we have a question about his sleep; she says unwaveringly that beyond a fixed routine of ANY kind, and obviously an environent condusive to sleep, it's up to your child how much sleep they get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good but not excellent","review":"This book is great at describing what to do to get your child to sleep if he or she is not sleeping. It offers many situations and various methods that have worked for some but not for others. It even offers adice for how parents can get a good night sleep. Although it does discuss many common pitfalls that create a sleepless child, I wish it would go beyond and actually give you an action plan of what to do to not let these bad patterns develop in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleeping through the night","review":"I was very happy with the book and the speedy arrival of the shipping. Thank you.It was also in very good condition. Hopefully my baby will be sleeping through soon!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazinly wonderful book!","review":"I love this book. My son is 8 months old and has never slept more than an hour and a half. Today is the third day. The first day he cried 1 hour and then he slept 5 hours and woke up to eat and then had some trouble beig comfortable the rest of the night. The second night he cried for 20 minutes and slept 7 hours then woke up to eat and slept another 4 hours. It was absolute heaven! His naps are going much better too.

You just have to commit yourself","review":"Amazingly, this worked for my 6 month old son. The book provides a good explanation of why babies don't sleep through the night. After 3 nights of crying, my son goes was able to calm himself down and now goes down happy and smiling. We still haven't gotten him to sleep all the way through but we're working on it. I can tell he actually understands \\"the rules\\" and knows that after his bath and a story, he will go to sleep. You have to be consistent, though. Change the routine and you will pay!"},{"rating":"2","title":"it really works","review":"Great comprehesive book that really works. It took three night for my son to sleep 12 hours in a row. Before, he had never even slept 4 hours in a row. Well written and easy to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK!! A MUST READ FOR NEW PARENTS","review":"This book was excellent. It is well-written and full of practical ideas on how to get a child/baby to sleep through the night. My 14 month-old is finally sleeping through the night. I wish I had read this book when he was first born. A great baby present for new parents"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book and ideas","review":"My daughter was 13 months, still sleeping in our bed and woke up every night 3 or 4 times a night. I purchased this book and then was watching Super Nanny. I use the method from this book of putting my daughter in her crib and staying in the room and not saying a word to her until she felt safe and fell asleep. Katharine has been sleeping through the night for 3 months, and if she wakes up, she falls back to sleep. She has learned to fall asleep on her own and now has a scheduled bedtime. This book help me and my family out a lot. I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not baby friendly advice!","review":"I was so offended when I read this book. The author kept referring to infants who don't sleep through the night as having \\"sleep problems\\", and to eliminate night-time nursings at 3 months! She also advocates letting your child cry, even if they vomit from being so upset, and even then she says you should refrain from picking them up or comforting them. How can that be considered baby-friendly advice? I thought it was disgusting and appalling. She referrs to infants as being pathetic and using it to their advantage to get what they want. There are so many other great books out there if you are frustrated about night waking. \\"Nighttime Parenting\\" by Dr. William Sears is a much better book that not only helps you find solutions, but has much more accurate information about the needs of infants, toddlers and older children."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Babies Worst Nightmare!","review":"As a very tired parent, I was looking for insight and advise on how to help our whole family get a good nights sleep. I read feverishly until I got to the sentence that states that children \\"enjoy\\" vomitting! Are you kidding? I cringed at the thought of me following this woman's dvise and my sweet, trusting, and loving 4 month old son vomitting because he had cried so hard and this woman stating that he was enjoying himself! Shame on her. This \\"Ph.d\\" lost any bit a credit she ever thought about having in my eyes. This book is a baby's worst nightmare. If you love you child please do not buy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done film; characters just not all that bright","review":"The actors are quite good in this, and the storyline is harrowing to say the least. Suffice to say that one should never have everyone in the water all at once, the ropes and ladders must be lowered, and if you find yourself in a bad situation, think of everything possible instead of waiting a whole day and night until you are exhausted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been much better","review":"I enjoyed the \\"Open Water\\", but this sequel fell flat. It's really a shame, because the film makers had all the right elements in place to create a really good film. The title should have been, \\"Open Water 2: Wasted Potential\\".The characters were interesting until their IQs were reduced during the film. The concept of the film was great: 6 people may die in spite of being able to touch their muli-million dollar yacht. Safety is inches away, yet they cannot reach it. Wow, that really had my interest.Some reviewers said it was a good movie if you can just overlook the stupidity of the characters. That is probably very true. Unfortunately, I just couldn't do that. Every time they had a chance, they did something stupid. Often, all 6 let something stupid happen without even one speaking up. I watched 100% of the film, just to see what happened, but I was completely disappointed with the film.It wasn't terrible, just very weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie sucked","review":"I hate to even give this one star but amazon insists.

If you want to watch a movie about stupid people drowning simply because they're stupid (and I'm not talking about forgetting the ladder), then have at it. I wish I had my 2 hours back."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was entertaining...","review":"But had one of the worst endings ever...what happened anyway? My husband and I had to rewind the movie 3xs and still could not decide if the two people on board were alive or ghosts? For example, the sailor on the boat looking at the yacht didn't see the woman, who was clearly standing up looking around. And her baby was crying miserably...the movie depicted her as a doting mother whom runs when her baby cries yet, she wasn't interested at all in comforting the child, instead, she was looking at the man whom she supposedly saved, which didn't make any sort of sense? These types of questions CHEAT the viewers, because we end up walking away from the movie disappointed because there was no clear understanding of what happened in the end...its like ordering a piece of cake, and not being allowed to eat it...which sucks! Ohh, by the way, four out of the six actors should find new careers."},{"rating":"1","title":"BE FOREWARNED: THERE ARE NO SHARKS IN THIS MOVIE","review":"This movie is mildly diverting at best... And shameful for insinuating there might be sharks by posing as a sequel to OPEN WATER. Be forewarned: There's not one shark in the entire movie. Sure, the premise is a big freaky and it's supposedly based on true events. But the characters do very dumb things and aren't very likeable making their situation eventually very wearisome for us viewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"it was an okay rental","review":"I saw the first Open Water and thought it was pretty good .This one was pretty good as well, i didn't expect much from it at all but it wound up being decent. No sharks in this onebut the tension builds up pretty well. The unknown actors were decent, the boat was cool and overall I would say it's worth a rental at least if you get a 3rd one freebie deal going ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Open Water / Closed Minded 2","review":"This has got to be one of the most frustrating movies ever to watch. It goes to show that when people are in a life and death situation that 9 out of 10 people will panic, lose faith in each other, and die. I watched it with my wife and we spent most of the movie speaking out loud and asking why won't they do this or that.The ending was really bad and leaves you with a blank feeling.The only reason I gave it two stars is because of the suspense the movie gives you. I, however, would rent it if I were you before deciding whether or not to purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Open Water 2 - Adrift with Idiots","review":"The original Open Water was an interesting independent movie based on true events that had some good moments of suspense and a good ending. Open Water 2 shares none of those qualities.I almost immediately disliked all the characters, some of the scenes were preposterous (as others have mentioned, let's have the heaviest person climb up!), the interpersonal tension was overdone (to hell with trying to figure out a way out, let's just argue some more), and the ending was [multiple expletives deleted] insulting, or should I say endings? And not just the last 2 scenes, the mother's decision/action before them was laughable.I'll give it 2 stars because it was well shot and I have definitely seen worse. If you haven't seen the original, your time will be better spent watching it and skipping this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic and Dramatic","review":"I think this movie was very heartbreaking. To see a mother go thru this was awful. Those that think this can't happen. Have you ever been on a large boat? Go on one and jump over. Then look up. Try to imagine getting up without a ladder. In life situations panic sets in, you can't think straight. As a mom myself, if your child is stranded, that would put additional worry in.This movie was excellent. It truly showed the fear and the things that can happen. The ocean is a cruel place. It's based on a true story of things that happened, it easily could happen to anyone. All it takes is too much to drink or one moment of fun without thinking. Everyone jumped in to swim, thinking someone else would lower the ladder.We have the video and I'll watch it again. The only bad part is the ending. From reading I've found that Amy and her daughter survive, and speculation says Dan does as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooring","review":"This has got to be one of the dullest films I have rented in a while.

They now open reservations 180 days before your scheduled visit (the book says 90) and the only open a percentage of them them. A large percentage, granted, but they hold some tables which they gradually release over time.

In addition to the factual errors, the authors arrogance about what they like (as opposed to describing the quality or characteristics of something so the reader can decide for themselves) is just too ever-present.Pass on this one and look elsewhere if you actually want to know what to do with the kids at WDW.

Well, after having the book for about two months, I finally decided to flip through. I was totally captivated by the storyline, the characters and the realism.

And the hook for me was not the stunts or the special effects. It was actually the music. John Barry gave a rich composition in this soundtrack, and it shows everywhere. Actually, what makes the soundtrack imperfect for me in retrospect is that it has too *much* atmosphere to the point of losing the fast pace and adventure of Bond.

I've always said it was a mistake to stop teaching sentence diagramming in grade school. I think this book proves my point. It's a great yarn and has a lot of good information as well as all of the Hollywood dirt. That said, the writing could have been more clear--excessive use of reflexive pronouns left me re-reading more than one passage. Thoughts that should be separate sentences find themselves as subordinate clauses in lengthy awkward paragraphs. Despite its subject matter and presumably myriad dynamite photos out there, the photograph section was pretty stingy. In a Hollywoood bio, this is definitely a negative. Overall a good read, but requiring more effort than it should have. I don't like when I have to edit passages myself to make them make sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Read, Somewhat Disorganized.","review":"LION OF HOLLYWOOD is a good portrait of the often maligned L.B.

Meyer was a child, his poor upbringing, his \\"gutter education\\", and then throws the reader--somewhat in a scattershot manner--in the midst of his MGM days. That however is a minor flaw and I only say that because that occurs in the first 50-60 pages of the book, after that it is a great read and well put together, and truly illuminates L.B.

Bernstein is not vitriolic, vengeful. He is also not apologetic about the idealism that led him to the Communist Party. His times of despair also include not only acts of random kindness but a bonding with fellow blacklisted writers that resulted in their mutual support of each other in doing what they did best, writing, with a front, someone who agrees to have their name on the blacklisted writer's script. Bernstein does not shout but with his quiet dignity allows the readers to shake their heads as to how we allowed this hysteria to go on for so long.

In this sense, you may walk completely aside of it and just consider it as one of the early, a bit gothic, a bit romantic novels of CRZ. The story is interesting, if not thrilling. The style & narration are acceptable (but it's nothing in comparison to El Juego del Angel). But there's more to it, if you just look into the magic a little bit deeper.

So again, unless you're a big fan of PINK LADY or know who they are, you'll be better off buying a collection of disco hits by other artists rather than shelling out the extra $$$ for this import.I heard of them during the 70s but never knew their music.

But they are a basic foundation of tales and for someone looking to start learning about the Celtics lore and myths, it is a very good starting point.

It relived the boredom for a few seconds.However, the film portrays the worst aspects of human character. It also makes fun of crooked cops, makes fun of any authority, and generally promotes the idea that driving in an extremely unsafe manner is just good clean fun.Too many people die on the roads each year, and authority in this country is breaking down.

I love when Luke gets up to the side of the truck and says \\"I said No Bo....NO!!\\" I just love this movie and It makes me laugh every time I watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a Disappointment","review":"OMG... what a mess. While I didn't expect it to be as wonderful as the original series I certainly didn't expect it to be as badly done as it was. Other than Willie Nelson as Uncle Jesse, the casting (in my opinion) was all wrong. This movie was sleazy and stupid. They made Jessica Simpson look and act like trash as Daisy Duke -- Catherine Bach never seemed so sleazy... she was innocent and cute/pretty. Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville were totally bafoonish...just awful! The original Bo and Luke Duke (John Schneider and Tom Wopat) were smart, sweet and mischeivious in an innocent way. The only thing original about this movie was the General Lee...Sleazy and stupid. So not worth the price of admission or the price of a DVD. Watch this on cable and call it a day. You are missing nothing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood like !!","review":"Well to all you buyers from a big one to maybe another....I like the TV serie ...I don't know much about the characters on the Tv show \\"rednecks\\" or not but it was a hell of a Tv show. Ofcourse if they are gonna make a big movie about this you can not expect it to be just as the Tv show word by word or scene by scene. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was that they chose Burt Reynolds for the role of Boss Hogg but if you want to play a movie critic at a range of PERFECTION you are never gonna be satisfied ....it is acceptable,modern and fun to watch. It might not be the \\"I gotta gotta buy it \\" DVD for every one but it is good to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst jumps from Tv to Movie","review":"This was one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. I probably should have known once Johnny Knoxville appeared as this 'JackAss' can not act.I was never a big fan of the original TV show but I did watch just about every episode during the first few years. I strongly suggest that if you even saw a single episode of the original series that you go and rent this movie and watch it before you buy it as you will soon discover that even a single star rating is far to high for this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"unrated?","review":"I'm confused. This is the \\"unrated\\" release... and it's rated PG-13? My little cousin could watch this legally. The movie was ok, but this flat out lie of \\"unrated\\" makes me want to do anything but buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What were you expecting?","review":"I'm sick of all the haters reviewing this movie. Most of them were fans of the show, and that explains a lot. Did you SERIOUSLY expect a remake of Dukes with Jessica Simpson, Johnny Knoxville, and Seann William Scott to be anything like the original show? It's a completely different time now, and the movie is going to be a lot different from the show you remember. If it's so bad and you expected it to be, why did you see it in the first place?I was never a fan of the show, I only went to see the movie because of Seann William Scott and Jessica Simpson, who I'm big fans of (both). Simpson wasn't horrible, but she wasn't a reason in herself to see the movie. Scott, however, was hilarious! The best and funniest parts of the movie were all him.I would recommend this movie to anyone who doesn't expect this to be like the original show. It was a great movie, but if you were a fan and don't want a rude shock, don't see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dukes of Hazzard (Unrated Widescreen Edition)","review":"I loved the movie,Willie Nelson is fabulous as Uncle Jessie !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some funny parts but mostly junk","review":"I didn't expect much when i went to see this film and i got what i expected.

The unrated just has some nudity and cursing. They do add a few lines to make it funnier but it really doesnt make a difference. I would stick with the PG-13"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't go if you are a Dukes of Hazard fan","review":"If you were a Dukes of Hazard fan of the TV Series, you will not enjoy this movie. The Dukes really play stupid roles. Jessica Simpson doesn't do much at all but she is cute. She worked really hard to get in shape and it shows. If you do decide to watch this movie, check out Jessica and Willie Nelson's music video. Jessica looks great in those shorts! Willie is cool as always in this movie and in the video. Willie is Willie. There are a lot of car jumps. In fact, it seems that is all this movie is about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like the original","review":"If you are a fan of the original movie - DO NOT BUY THIS ONE. The only thing similar between this movie and the tv show are the character names."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite awful","review":"Everybody said this movie was bad and not even Jessica Simpson made it worth watching. Did I listen? No. Will you? No. You'll think that it HAS to be worth watching at least a little bit because of Jessica Simpson in skimpy clothing, but let me just belabor the point: it's not worth watching. She is not in it enough to make it worth watching.Oh, and the story line? Terrible. In fact, I have to admit that I stopped watching this movie at the 20 minute mark, which is a rare curtailing for me; I normally make it a habit to finish movies but with this one there was just no point. I'd already seen enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i expected!","review":"I RATE THIS A ONE OVERALL. NONE OF THE CHARACTERS IN THIS MOVIE EVEN RESEMBLE THE REAL DUKES OF HAZZARD. COME ON NOW IF YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE A REMAKE YOU AT LEAST HAVE TO HAVE THE CHARACTERS LOOK LIKE THE ORIGINAL. DAISY HAD BROWN HAIR JESSICA HAS BLONDE. YES SHE HAD THE BODY BUT THEY SHOULD HAVE DYED HER HAIR FOR THIS MOVIE. BOSS HOG WAS WAY TO THIN AND HE WAS BALD NOT FULL HEAD OF HAIR.

I saw this movie because it was 105 degrees in my house & I needed to go someplace air conditioned. That's about it. Why did I see the Disgrace of Hazzard? I'd seen everything else the theater was showing.I loved the TV show & still do, but loyalty to that still doesn't demand my hatred for this waste of celluloid. It needs to be hated for SO MANY other reasons. Let's face it. Broken Lizard couldn't make a good film to save their lives. Club Dread was good (thanks to Jordan Ladd), but Super Troopers, that Puddle movie, & Dukes were all horrible pieces of... you know.I can watch the General Lee race around all day & that's the only thing that kept me from yacking up my popcorn. Jessica Simpson... nice, but repeating everybody else that commented on this, she's no Daisy Duke. And what did Nancy Sinatra ever do to deserve her song being decimated?Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This movie doesn't even remotely run along the same lines as the classic Dukes Of Hazzard. We turned it off after 30 minutes and it's now sitting in the trash. Way too much cussing and since when does Jessie Duke smoke pot?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Movie with Good Car Chases!","review":"Sean William Scott and Johnny Knoxville star as Luke and Bo Duke who are in a race to save Uncle Jesse's Farm from the evil developer Boss Hogg and Sheriff Bosco.There is hardly any funny moments in this movie. There is a cheap cameo of the \\"supertroopers\\" character and this felt like a Broken Lizard movie with all the actors; after all, the director is one of the Broken Lizard guys. Unfortunately, this movie was beginning to bore me and it's only 95 minutes. The only good scenes were the chases as you see some fantastic stunt driving and drifting.This time I agree with the critics, this is a terrible TV remake!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jessica Simpson","review":"Not that impressed. The movie was a gift for my stepsons and it was broke on the bottom of case. Luckily they haven't seen it. Thank you anyway. The movie plays great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just an all-around bad movie.","review":"Poorly done on many counts. Bad acting, thin plotline, and characters that weren't true to the original characters in the TV show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"It is a good video it is a must see video I hilly recamind this video to all u Jony nooks fill fans"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better then the GI Joe Remake...","review":"Better then the GI Joe Remake...Hey it's all good...I like it...I grew up watching the Dukes every Friday night...This movie is not the TV show but it's good with a great soundtrack and a typical dukes of hazzard story...GO Uncle Jesse..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Remake of the 1979-1985 Series","review":"This move sucked!! I just rented and thought that I waisted my money on this movie. The only thing that was good about it was Jessica Simpson kicking the crap out of gentleman in the bar. Otherwise, the action in this movie was lame and not enough of the General Lee flying over things!! Moreover, there was to much foul language in the movie and was very crude. Not for children to see like the 1979-1985 series. Boss Hogg and Roscoe was not the same and the actors who played them looked like they were bored with their roles! I would not even give this a one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow, there are some really dumb people in this world","review":"and none are dumber than those who find entertainment value in this piece of turd. Don't even call yourselves human beings."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"I may be a little bit bias in this review because the movie was shot in my hometown, Baton Rouge, LA, but I thought that it was one of the single greatest movies that I have ever seen. It has all of the elements that describe southern culture and the scenes with the General Lee are great. I would strongy recommend this movie to anyone who thinks that Jessica Simpson looks good in a bikini! By the way, I went to the midnight showing of this movie, seconds after it came out."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie sucks!","review":"okay i admit, this movie isnt insanely horrible, its just not good. I havent seen the originals though. Ive seen the unrated and rated cuts (im 15) and i can honestly say the rated version is better. I may be a guy and i like seeing naked girls and everything... but the cussing and nudity take away the family and dating value of this movie. If my girlfriend and I were to go see a movie at the theatre, it definately wouldn't be like this unrated version. It just seems very immorral and cuts down on the enjoyability. The acting isn't horrible, but not great. The scenes are somewhat funny, but other movies are way better. If you're a fan of the old one, you won't want to buy this. And get the rated version if you rent it. The unrated version is just too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"negative 10 stars","review":"This movie was completly craptastic and worthy of straight to video. I would want to buy every copy in existence to erase any evidence of it ever being made. Everything was WRONG about this movie, the only thing it had going for it was the car. The setting was wrong, the acting very wrong, the whole flavor wrong. I should be compensated for the pain and suffering I endured viewing this piece of garbage. Seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Pay For This!","review":"Thank God I didn't pay to see this movie! I paid to see \\"Red Eye,\\" sat through it, and loved it. After that, I sneaked in to the theater for the Dukes, and I shouldn't have wasted my time. In the first scene, the General Lee is shown, but why is \\"Bo\\" opening and closing the door to get in and out??? If you think about the series, once the General Lee becomes a race car, the doors are WELDED SHUT, for that reason. Not because Cooter couldn't repair the doors after an accident, as what the movie explains. Cooter was the best mechanic in Hazzard -- he could fix ANYTHING. Don't waste your time with this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long and boring","review":"I really liked the original TV show-that was must-see TV when I was in high school! But I was disappointed with this movie. It felt like one long car chase with a couple of fights thrown in. Oh and Jessica Simpson is not that hot, but at least she didn't embarass herself. I usually like Sean William Sciott, but he was just OK. I loved Johnny Knoxville in MTV's Jackass and he did OK in this as well. I had to hit the fast forward bitton several times just to get through this one. Although the HD DVD transfer is really good, this is not even worth renting."},{"rating":"1","title":"they ruined a good show with the movie, and made it worse with unrated","review":"I loved the show. the PG 13 version is ok, a decent tribute to the original. but then they completely messed it up with the unrated version. the Dukes would never use the explicit language, and women do not just hang around naked (at least not in America.) Unrated just goes too far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Dukes of Harrard","review":"This movie was a joke. Being a Dukes of Hazzard fan since I was a little boy this was not what i expected. Save your money people and buy something else. This movie was the worst I have seen in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"This movie is utter crap. I give it a one for Jessica Simpson in a bikini and without her I would give it a 0. Burt Reynolds stinks and is miscast. Stiffler is horrible as he always is and miscast. Johnny Knoxville is miscast as an actor and should stick to hitting himself in the groin with objects. This movie is just crap, crap, crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Health-Hazzard","review":"Some movies are pointless in their entirety, where everything about the film, from the acting to the plot, feels below B-Grade (except maybe the picture quality). Those films should never be made. One of those films is \`The Dukes of Hazzard'. I will admit that I had been forewarned before watching this crap, for everyone except my Jessica Simpson loving brother-in-law told me that this drivel was the worst crap they had ever seen. Point is, I believed them, I just had nothing better to do and figured I'd see for myself. Well see I did and hate I did as well. Jessica Simpson has no talent in her body what so ever. The girl can do ample sit-ups that's for sure, and that's what she should stick to. The plot was ridiculous, the acting was worse, and the point, there was no point. Mindless entertainment that should have never been made and or forced upon the general public."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.","review":"Stupid and boring.Thats all there is to it really.I've never seen the tv show version,but hopefully it is a lot better than this remake.It gets two stars because the boys are good looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whats so UNRATED?","review":"How is this movie coming out in a unrated version?

I dont understand how its coming out in Unrated though. This movie had no curses or anything. The Wedding Crashers and 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN are coming out in unrated but that makes sense because they are crude comidies. They are really good though but this wasnt really crude. It was PG-13. Please somone explain this unrated thing"},{"rating":"1","title":"HAZZARDOUS Material--Stay Away!","review":"I'd like to offer some serious film criticism, but this movie really doesn't warrant spending any real time thinking about it. So let's just take a look at the \\"film\\" for entertainment value. I smiled exactly once--and that was at a minor character played by James Roday. This film represented everything that is wrong in Hollywood today. Yet, of course, it was a hit--sending out the message that American audiences will embrace anything and that studios should keep making trash. I, in all honesty, could not imagine ANYONE being even slightly amused by the antics of the Dukes. Loud and obnoxious, the greatest sin is that it's not even good enough to be \\"dumb fun\\". KGHarris, 9/06."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTHING LIKE THE TV SHOW EXCEPT FOR THE STUNTS","review":"The stunts were cool. That is the only good thing that could be said about this movie. The movie was garabage and not worth watching. All of the characters need their mouths washed out with soap. Nobody in the original series would have used God's name in vain. This movie had unneccessary filthy language throughout. Not suitable for children. An extremely bad excuse for what could and should have been an awesome movie. I was embarrassed and wish I had not wasted my money on something I will never watch again or let anyone borrow. Are there any decent people in Hollywood anymore that make good, clean, fun-loving, silly shows without being filthy? The Dukes of Hazzard TV series was successful because it was mostly clean fun!!!!! This movie should have been the same but sadly was not!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"I expected an light entertaining movie.This was dreadful. Casting was horrible.

What made the show so great was the chemistry among all the actors and actresses. This 2005 movie version lacked that chemistry. In the original show Bo and Luke were the good guys and were not dumb but the Bo and Luke for the movie, even though they were the good guys, were portrayed more as dumb guys. Their characters would have been fine for Dumb and Dumber but not this movie. In the movie they also seemed to put each other down occasionally rather than be a real team. The characters in the movie just did not match what they were in the original TV show. I'm glad that when I saw it, I did not see it in the theater or even rent the DVD. I was able to see it for free. I'm glad I did not waste my money seeing it.

One: This movie falls into the era of remakes in Hollywood. Have we run out of ideas already? I didn't think it could get any worse than the era of teen slasher movies.Two: It's a remake of something that really sucks. Seriously, how can you make 90 minutes of car chases and Jessica Simpson?!? I guess when the car chases get old, just flash to Jessica Simpson trying to act sexy. Not working; her absent-minded, Nick Lachey marrying-and-then-having-problems-and-then-reconciling-only-to-quickly-seek-a-divorce antics have already killed what could be tolerated from this one.

He was fun in the ROCK movie RUNDOWN where he did where he did a semi-imitation of the \\"ROY\\" chareacter from SHANGHAI NOON.We rented this movie because my eight year daughter likes Jessica Simpson. Good call Jessie S appearing in a movie like this so my daughter can get exposed to the F bombs and topless nudity... unless her target market is being switched to young men who like swearing and bare naked ladys.Those non-minor complaints asside, the rest of the movie is fun.

In all of hollywood they couldn't find a funny guy to play Rosco.

There are laughs to be had though only mixed in between gratuitous naked bodies, muddled storylines and performances that were more parody than anything. The movie version has precious little to do with the original show except an orange car and characters who share the same names as players on the CBS series. The Duke cousins are hardly recognizable and Uncle Jesse is turned into a raging hippie hick with nary an ounce of the level headed wisdom he had on television. This is pure bologna.

But the tv series had John Schneider, Tom Wopat, Catherine Bach, Sorrell Booke, James Best and Denver Pyle---who no matter how bad the script, they infused it with life and a certain love for their characters.Not so in this unnecessary transfer to the big screen. Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott have little or no chemistry; Jessica Simpson merely fills the babe factor; and Burt Reynolds and Willie Nelson should be ashamed of themselves for even participating. The General Lee as always steals the show but even the frequent car histrionics can't save this really bad film."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too predictable","review":"The whole movie was pretty predictable and cheesy at that.

I could not stand Johnny Knoxville as Bo Duke, he looked more like a jerk in the whole film, and to have him that obsessed over the General Lee. Oh please the original Dukes were not that stupid, or that horny for that matter , and don't get me started on Dasiy Duke who by the way looked like a cheap tart in scanties cut even shroter than the original Dasiy Duke whom was more of a lady than Jessica whats her face. The whole film was really badly miscast, and was more graphic than the series that it was based on. I did recall that Ben Jones did not like the Dukes movie due to it being far from the orginal, and i would say the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW.....","review":"There isn't an adjective to describe this movie. It's full of sexist cliches and racist stereotypes. Every woman in the show is either wearing short shorts, micro mini skirts or towels and wiggling something.

Well, they did. The jack-ass guy is funny, as is the other. I used to like Jessica, but she can't act. She's a singer. Celebrities should stay within their realm and not vtry other things because it makes them look dumb. People put them on a pedestal and they should act within the pedestal they are put upon.On a personal note, celebrities should not be allowed to be married w/o major psych counseling. Tom Cruise would not have passed. Jessica & Nick looked happy, but now they are just ruining their lives and their careers. I don't think Jess will bounce back from this. It will be the end. Who wants to trust people who cannot even be married? The whole marriage system in the U.S. is now ruined due to these celebrities.

Bo and Luke are portrayed as a couple of bumbling idiots - in the series that were actually pretty smart guys.Roscoe is just evil. Boss Hog would have been better if they cast Danny DeVito. Burt Reynolds is good though. Enos is the only character that was pretty close to the original. Uncle Jesse is portrayed as a crass, drug smoking moonshine runner with no morals. Still, he is probably the funniest character in the movie. Willie Nelson was good for this role. Jessica is super sexy, of course - some say the movie is worth watching just for her, the jury is still out on that one.The General Lee is an awesome car for muscle car owners, but most of the movie is hellbent on destroying it.

I was wrong. It ended up being a rated R version with Nudity and lots of swearing. Do not buy if you haved kids and do not buy because it plain sucks. I will never give my money to an unrated film again. I grew up on the Dukes of Hazzard and love all the seasons and could not wait for the movie.

Not for the poor casting (the only one who resembled anyone from the original was the General Lee), the rehashed plot, or the fact that Hollywood has taken a once good and decent show and added alot of sex and profanity to it, but for the simple fact that Jessica Simpson should never be allowed in front of a movie camera.

It dosent share anything with the DUKES OF HAZZARD seires. The only thing thats kool about this movie is the GENERAL LEE speeding, drifting, and jumping. the rest is isnt so hot. In the seires Bo and Luke never cursed and Uncle Jesse would never call Rosco a fat sack of [...]. Thats another thing. Rosco was stupid and funny in the seires but in this movie hes mean.

You had Bo and Luke as a couple hillbilly morons who drive fast, a cousin Daisy who's all body but more brains than they have and Uncle Jesse whose just a dirty old man who tells terrible jokes (he's no family patriarch like the Late Denver Pyle's Uncle Jesse was).And then there's Burt Reynolds. Did he think he was in a Rocky And Bullwinkle cartoon or something. Give the man a black mustache so he can twirl it because he thought he was Snidely Whiplash he was so camp.This is by far the single worst TV Show-turned movie ripoff that has been birthed so far.

Powell has an uncanny ability to showcase an era of both hip hop and NYC culture that seems to have faded in recent years. Like Glen E.

But in doing so he bores the reader at times.You don't have to be boring to write a good philosophical book. Some philosophers seem to be afraid of actions and events.

Over & over again I was given examples of the existentialist's universe that is indifferent to man's presence. There were moments that Sartre twisted, and invited the reader to ask \\"well... why not?\\" He challenges the value that we put on people & events while reminding us that this is all happening within a universe that doesn't care about our contrived evaluative mechanisms.Interesting ideas, but even for this already slender book, the ideas could have been conveyed in a 10-page short story. \\"Nausea\\" as a tale (without the philosophical element) isn't entertaining enough to stick with to the end. So, Sartre offers examples of his ideas \\"ad nauseum.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Sick","review":"Sartre is a world famous existentialist of the times, and I think this wonderful novel really brings precision to the word \\"absurd\\".

The novel consists of the thoughts and experiences (which are displaced into a journal format) of Antonin, an alienated intellectual who falls prey to the feeling of the existential Nausea, as he attempts, nihilistically, to purge himself of the \\"sin of existence\\". The novel, Sartre's first, is blighted by the main fault to which beginners are vulnerable, namely, blatantly making their texts a vehicle for their own philosophical views. Too much of the story is taken up by the hero's obsession with a gramophone record, though one man's obsession may be another man's tedium. The plot lacks any sense of drive, the main character simply fails to engage the reader's sympathy and the result is a book which is amateurish, plodding and just plain boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"wkrc wcpo cpo","review":"I guess.... not think... that about now, krc, you are beginningto have some existential vagaries.An unctuous feeling about the causality of your uvula...swallowing, hearing the swallow... and the exit no exitof hearing door knobs..There is an upwelling from the closure of your uvula inswallowing...You feel the vague dread coming on... ad nauseum.affirmative negative... a nam i really wallowing now"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't know about the cakes, but the customer service sucks","review":"I ordered a cake-of-the-month for my dad and stepmom on the opposite coast on December 15.

With the breadth of an op-ed essayist well versed in political affairs at the national and international level and with in-depth fly-on-the-wall characterizations of pivotal contemporary events affecting our nation to its core, the author weaves a plausible scenario that leaves the reader stunned and wanting to know more. At one level the book operates as a crime novel played out on the grand stage of Presidential politics, and at another level the book provides a study in the psychoanalysis of deceit.

The book presents a good overview of this site, which unlike the Giza/Egyptian pyramid complexes was not treated to in depth technical study until the 1950s and later. Even now, large portions remain unexcavated. The later parts of the book delve into Atlantean connections, a natural link with the speculations of Augustus Le Plongeon and others who appear earlier in the text. While it is not directly a history of the Maya, Olmecs, Aztecs, or others, there is enough citation within the interesting sidenotes and extensive bibliography to take serious readers into the bowels of the beast as of the 1970s, when this was published.

I've tried mixing it with water (per the instructions) and also just dripping it straight down my throat, but either way its really a horrible awful terrible experience.Once again, this is the only liquid extract I've tried so I don't know how it compares to others, but compared to capsules and tablets I found the experience horrifying (after three days I've ordered capsules again)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Product!","review":"I've been using this skin case for almost exactly a month and I absolutely love it.

Her stories do diverge from the stereotypical male-hero stories.In her other books, Jane Yolen has shown respect to males and given males the chance to be heroes, so the extreme feminism the previous reviewer claimed to have seen seems sought for. In the light of this collection, Jane Yolen obviously did an introduction discussing the fact that such heroines were not widely spread stories in our culture. Her saying this doesn't mean she's starting a feminist extreme group or expecting people (children!) to read these stories with feminist concerns.These stories are geared towards the child who likes fantasy a bit - perhaps the regular Harry Potter fan.

I liked its ease of use, great crema and fast steam, even though it is too short for standard espresso cup or steamer pitcher [I use a small measuring cup]. A few months ago, the machine started 'binding up' and did not steam through in less than 20 minutes, much less produce crema, and now it also pours hot water over the top of the portable filter and down the handle -- I cannot make espresso without surrounding the machine with towels! Have cleaned the machine according to the instructions and dismantled the filters to clean by hand. To replace it, Delonghi's 'warranty' requires the customer to cut the power cord and mail it to them with a $15 check for shipping the new machine. Will do it this time but if new machine fails like this one did, I'm putting Delonghi at the bottom of my respect list and not buying another of their espresso machines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Machine","review":"Overall this is a GREAT espresso machine for the price.

I saw this machine and noted that it had decent pressure and read the reviews. I decided to purchase the machine, and have now had it for a few months now. I can honestly say I was pleasantly surprised. This is a great little machine. Can it pull a shot like my old machine? ...almost. But for the price, you can't beat it.

I have used other machines that seem to extract more coffee flavor from the grinds.2) After removing the plastic frothing peice for cleaning, when putting it back on, you must be careful not to strip the threads.3) The area for the espresso cups isn't very tall, you either have to put cups in at an angle for them to fit under the espresso spout, or you have to use shorter, shot glass like cups (or true espresso cups) for them to fit.Some things that i like about this machine.1) Easy to use2) Fast warm up time3) Easy to clean4) The frother frothes really well.5) Very good machine for the price.

Buyer Beware. http://www.amazon.com/delonghi-leaking-frother-boiler-outlet-/forum/Fx3UVNMZ5HME6GT/Tx3M87LOTKNI30N/1?_encoding=UTF8&asin=B000F49XXG"},{"rating":"2","title":"We just love it.","review":"After reading many reviews we went with the EC155. My sister had the older model and I was looking to but that one and being that they were not making it anymore we look at the EC155 which was replacing it. For the money you can not beat it. We had a Mr.Coffee steam pushed machine and it just does not hold a candle to the DeLonghi. I did buy a tapper after reading someone elses review. Even though the machine has one, as did my sisters I hated that grounds would get ontop of it and you can't take it off to clean it. The machine is the perfect size for our kitchen not to big, not to small. Easy to clean, we enjoy it everyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"william","review":"I have had 3 cappucino makers that were more expensive. This one is far better.

It seems well built enough, it does froth the milk quite well, but even the best roasted beans ground to perfection end up being a tasteless brew in this machine. The basket is smaller than expected so need to brew twice, but still the coffee is tasteless. It is very disappointing.

Easy cleanup makes it aperfect gift to someone or for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Lasted 5 Months","review":"I loved, loved, loved this espresso machine until it stopped heating after only about 5 months of use. It was perfect in every way after I got the hang of espresso-making. I used it for 1, sometimes 2 espressos most days, taking off a month or so when I experimented with cold-brewed coffee. After reading the problems other folks had with DeLonghi's customer service I'm considering my options, but they don't include another Delonghi purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"Although I was skeptical about this machine, after reading so many positive reviews, I decided to order it.I've had the machine for about a month. I've experimented with trying to get the flow to run 20-25 seconds, but it is simply not possible without producing a thin, tasteless \\"espresso\\".The machine is so light, that when you put the portafilter into it, you have to hold onto the machine to get it firmly screwed in. The water continues to drip after you turn off the machine. The filters do not fit firmly in the portafilter. Lastly, when you rinse it, coffee and water remain in it.I don't recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work!!","review":"Bought it in may, used it for two months just fine....after that you gave to pull everything apart and clean it after each use or the coffee doeant flow through,even then its only good for 3 shots....not good for someone with 2 people in their house who drink coffee. I spend a little more than i normally would on this because it had great reviews and 4 stars, i give it one only because the option of none is not there. This machine is terrible DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Would buy again","review":"My ONLY complaint about the EC155 is the sizing. The space between the drip output and the drip tray barley lets the shot glasses in. And the frothing nozzle is the same thing I have to lift the machine up to get my 12oz frothing pitcher out. and the way the nozzle is bent makes it hard to move the nozzle around while your frothing milk. these things wouldn't stop me from buying it again but made it a 4 star in my opinion. I'll try to get some 3d video next month with my Evo 3d when it comes out and will post it"},{"rating":"2","title":"espresso maker and expresso are good quality","review":"I'm pleased with the espresso maker and the espresso it makes. As you might expect, having to change the basket that holds the espresso to be brewed becomes a little tedious after a while since you can only make one or two cups at a time. Despite this, I'm still glad I purchased it and am pleased with the espresso it makes."},{"rating":"1","title":"DeLonghi","review":"This was a replacement for my Krups XP4030 which stopped working. Disappointed in its performance. Creme was thin. Returned it. Went looking to buy another XP4030 and discovered they are not made any more and could not find any new ones. So I ended up buying a used one. It works as good as my old one. Delonghi EC155 had a lot of good ratings but could not stand up to the expectations that the XP4030 had set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This espresso maker is perfect for the price I have paid for it. You just need a good espresso coffee powder and that's it, like a really Italian espresso! Two negative points? The steam water tube is too short for tall cups and If you don't rotate the filter holder firmly, with the espresso coffee pods, the espresso machine is going to leaks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vibrating like crazy, not enough room to fit a regular cup","review":"Bought this brand new since most reviews were high. Got around to trying it after 2 months after watching a YouTube instructional video. Turned it on and it started vibrating like crazy. The shot glasses would vibrate off the stand. Also the filter handle would not slide all the way to front position. In addition, I could not fit the smallest cup under the nozzle. So this would only be good if you will be using only a shot glass. The good news is amazon offered a return or exchange despite the fact that it was past it's return policy. After reading other reviews of vibration and water leaking, I decided to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the money","review":"I did lots of research and bought this one. At this price range, I have no complaint. It does good job making good espresso and pretty quickly actually."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and easy machine !!!","review":"Once you get the hang of it, you can make an exceptional latte. Remember to chill your milk in the pitcher first and prime the machine and you will get great foam and a delicious espresso. Skim milk foams the best. The directions are easy to read and follow and are important to review first. A great buy for the money. These are equivalent to the $500 machines they sell at Starbucks!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Espresso Maker for the Money","review":"I've had the machine for a month and can say that it makes the perfect cup of Espresso coffee.

I have used the unit for a few weeks and it makes a good cup of coffee and I have had no issues. That said, the unit is not tall enough to get any cup under the dispenser. I end up taking out the metal tray. I even bought more cups and searched DeLonghi for a solution ... none found. Bottom line ... works well but I wish that I had returned it ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Destined for Landfill","review":"I purchased this Delonghi EC155 espresso machine over 1 year ago. It has died. I have cleaned it w/vinegar, but the pump is just no longer working. Ug. Although the price is right, I will look into purchasing a different replacement machine, given the environmental impact of inevitable annual trips to the dump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Milk Frother is Terrible","review":"They should call the milk frother a milk vibrator because it didn't actually froth milk. The frother was terrible to begin with, but after about a week it just stopped working altogether. Luckily, I did not want it for the cappuccino so I did not bother to return it. If you want an espresso machine... this one is good for the money. If you want it to do more than that, get something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until it fails...","review":"I bought this about 10 months ago, and used it daily. It has now failed, unable to deliver water, the same problem as many others have reported. I have maintained it as instructed, cleaning out with vinegar every 2 months or so. This is an unacceptable life for any kind of commercial product. I liked the great espresso, with good crema. It easily makes frothed milk, and the steamer is very easy to clean (just wipe it and let steam for half a second). It has height limitations for cups but espresso cups and shorter cups all fit fine. If you can accept that this thing will last about year, go ahead. If not take my advice, don't buy one. Build quality has to be suspect (cheap materials in the pump construction?)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality parts and assembly","review":"Though designed in Italy, this is made in China, and it shows. The machine makes decent espresso, but you have to be very careful with the parts. The motor shakes the whole machine, so the cups shake out of position on the stand. Connecting the handle/holder to the machine requires a bit of force--while holding the machine steady. Then there's the plastic water tank. It got knocked off the counter accidentally and cracked. I tried to order a replacement from DeLonghi online, but their site doesn't have a traditionally secure payment page, so that's the last straw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Cappuccino","review":"Bought this because of the brand name, price, reviews[...] It's replacing our old Mr. Coffee Espresso (steam) machine which works fine. However, we couldn't believe the difference in taste and looks of the espresso and cappuccino from this one. It makes an incredible tasting drink, far better than any we've had at a coffee bar. The crema is spectacular as is the milk froth."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally useless","review":"The temperature at which it heats the water is way too low. Add to it that the amount or volume it heats is minuscule, and as you brew its replaced by cold water that then does not have time to heat. Therefore the second half of one cup is brewed with barely luke warm water, and you end with the very worst expresso I ever had.Its also dirty to manipulate. When you tamp there's some grinds that fall off, then when you finish and take the filter out it drips all over.When using steam starts by letting quite some volume of hot water through (watering the milk) and only then steams, and then VERY BRIEFLY until it runs out of it. Milk ends up watered and luke warm.The pump-less (steam driven) one I have from Walmart for $27.00 is of course lacking (brews with water over 212 degrees) but still ENORMOUSLY SUPERIOR TO THIS ONE.Stay away"},{"rating":"1","title":"2nd one died too","review":"We bought this espresso maker based on the great reviews it got in several places. The first one died after 9 months - the pump stopped working. After some more searching we decided to risk buying the DeLonghi again because it made great espresso for the price. Now after 3 months this second unit has also died. The heating unit failed. Fortunately, I saved all the packing, etc. this time so I hope to get a replacement or refund.Bottom line: great espresso, poor longevity. If you buy this machine save all the packaging so you can return it if needed. It has a one year warranty.BTW I don't think we did anything to cause the failure. We read the manual and used it as directed. If we did cause both problems then the machine is too fragile for use in a normal household."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the more expensive Krups machine I replaced","review":"Very nice very simple espresso machine. Produces good foam and crema, and I use it on a daily basis for over a year. Only problem I have ran into is it does not work well with very fine grounds. Couldn't be happier otherwise with the price and performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"DeLonghi EC155 Espresso Maker","review":"I bought this espresso maker on a whim. I've been looking for an espresso machine for some time but they always were so expensive I couldn't justify the purchase. This machine was cheap enough that I decided it was worth the gamble. I drink straight espresso shots so I haven't used it to make other coffee drinks. I tried the milk steamer once and it seemed to work fine. For me, my interest was in the espresso. I've only had it for a month but it turns out great espresso shots that are as good and often better that what I get at a coffee shop. I intend to do all the cleaning and maintenance recommended and, assuming the machine continues to function the way it does now, I couldn't be more pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect starter espresso machine","review":"Wow, what a fantastic deal!This is my first espresso machine and I found it easy to use, clean, and most importantly make delish coffee.So far, we've made lattes and americanos - both have turned out to be near-coffee shop quality.I love that it comes with a steam wand and it gets the milk hot! I usually steam it between 140 - 160 degrees.It is a fairly small machine so it doesn't take up much room, which is great.The steam wand does sit pretty low to the counter so I recommend getting a small pitcher. I got the Rattleware 12-Ounce Latte Art Milk Frothing Pitcher and it works well with the machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"I've had a steam espresso machine for years and it just went out on me so I was looking for a new one, i read the reviews on this one and i just love it.

I would highly recommend this machine if you are looking for a reasonably priced machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool","review":"I absolutely love this product. It is the first time that I have ever made cappuccino and it took me a little while to master, but in the end I am very pleased. I use this now every day and love it so much better than regular coffee. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be preparded to spend more to get a good cappuccino maker","review":"Cappuccino remained tasteless, even after 20 uses. Very disappointing; happy can return to Amazon without paying shipping. I realize,as I love cappuccino, I will have to spend more to get a very good machine which can produce a very good cappuccino. Back to the research. Save your money and the disappoint of what this machine produces and having to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I bought this espresso machine based on the other reviews. It worked for two months and then the coffee started coming out very slow and does not have the creamy look but just watery like the regular coffee, finally, it is just dripping and takes forever to make a cup. It was such a hassel to send to their service center to have it fixed. It took literally a whole month to get it back from the service center, and it still does not work. I am calling Delonghni now to see if there are other options."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great espresso while it works","review":"I have this machine for just over a year. It makes great espresso with nice crema for a while. It broke after half a year use due to water leaking from the milk frother when the top nob is off. The free replacement unit was a bit better. It failed to generate pressure to push through the filter pod after 7 months use. Consider the short life of this unit, $80 for a year use, I recommend getting something better to avoid wasting pricey coffee grounds in this machine when it just stopped working one morning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little espresso machine","review":"Just received it a few days ago and love it! It makes awesome espresso! I use Lavazza coffee. I have found it to be very sweet and pleasure to drink without any sugar. The crema from Lavazza coffee is very rich and thick.It takes only 1-2 minutes to warm up, not 30 min like the other reviewer wrote. I don't have a problem with vibration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Noisy espresso","review":"I bought this for my husband's birthday (he helped me pick it out)and he likes the espresso results, but he has two problems with the machine. One, it has a 30-minute warmup period. Two, it vibrates like crazy and makes a lot of noise. We will have to find something to absorb the vibration. Maybe a computer mouse pad (or two). Overall, it does make a great cup of espresso, it's easy to clean, and its claim on making a great layer of \\"crema\\" on top is true!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"Purchased this based on Amazon reviews and have not been disappointed. Used once or twice a day for the last 6 months without any issues. Easy to clean, compact size for a kitchen counter. I suppose if I had been using a high-end machine prior to this I might have some complaints but I have none."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Coffee","review":"Easy instructions for setup. Makes both 1 and 2 cups at single time and the steamer works well to froth your dairy product. Makes a very good cup of espresso."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started out as a good product...","review":"When I bought this machine last December, I was very impressed with it. Yeah the frother wand is too low for most pitchers and you cannot fit anything except a shot glass under it but the taste was quite good (I would know, I lived in Italy and drank espresso everyday).This machine did not maintain it's level of quality though. In the last few weeks or so I've noticed the pump starting to sound weak and producing watery, flavorless espresso. Most recently I've noticed that the boiler is not getting anywhere close to the proper temp for pulling a decent shot of espresso. I used an infrared thermometer and it was only getting to 130 F. (54.5 C.) The shot's quality has gone from being dark, viscous and opaque to carmel colored, watery and translucent.Since the product is past the return window, I most likely will just be throwing it away. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for cappuccino.","review":"I've been using this now for 9 months, and daily, if not multiple times per day! I adore it! Wonderful crema, if espresso is pressed right. It does take some time to figure out the right process for the perfect cup (it says one thing, but I've found that 1 scoop, pressed lightly, then another 1/4th scoop then fully pressed works perfectly), and a few other adjusting details. Overall, its simple, fast, and easy to use and clean!My only complaint, and the reason it doesn't get five stars, is that the steamer is a bit lacking on strength. For milk it works great, but if you try to use the steamer to heat a cup of chai (tastes great that way if you are wondering), then you are out of luck! It will quickly lose power before the cup is even warm. And the steamer does leak a little on occasion, but I expected that as most do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Espresso","review":"I've tried many machines/devices with marginal success, and just about gave up on making my own espresso. I understand that a number of great machines can be had for around $1,000, but I didn't want to spend that much, so I got this based on reviews. It certainly does not disappoint. Whereas other machines are very sensitive to grind, tamping, and other factors, this machine makes good espresso with just about any grind from drip to fine espresso. The steamer is difficult to use, and it's best to use a pre-warmed receiving cup."},{"rating":"2","title":"great value for price","review":"Unless you are willing to spend $300 I don't think you will find a better machine than this one. You do have to warm up the machine for at least 15-30 minutes before using. A little difficult/confusing to warm it down after using the steamer....."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAS NOT ABLE TO EVEN PUT BASKET IN PROPERLY","review":"I TRIED TO USE IT , I DID NOT WANT TO RETURN IT. BUT I HAVE RA AND I COULD NOT BUT THE BASKET ON IT.

SORRY IT DIDNT WORK FOR ME"},{"rating":"2","title":"Little cute coffee machine","review":"I bought this few weeks back. The espresso brewing part is flawless and if you need high viscous coffee for making cappucino or latte, pack the coffee powder in that handle as tight as possible using a tamper.The froath maker is quite tricky. You got to be used to it to get nice foamy hot milk. Follow the instructions in the manual. One thing I feel inconvenient though is the height of the steamer, which cannot hold big pitcher. Otherwise its a nice machine for making 1 or two cups of espresso."},{"rating":"2","title":"I bought 2nd machine","review":"I'm using my second EC155. The first one lasted 2 years.

We tried so many times and this just plain doesn't brew properly."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Good or Better Than More Expensive Machines","review":"I've had this machine for several years now and it is still making very decent espresso. I don't make many capuccinos, but when I do it works well. I have taken this machine to work and purchased a (considerably more expensive) Gaggia for the house, and the Gaggia has been something of a disappointment after a year - it started well but now takes much too long to make a double. The DeLonghi hasn't lost a step in the same period and is an older machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"works as promised","review":"Classic espresso machine, 15 Bar pressure. Works great so far, like our old $300 Gaggia espresso machine we had when we lived in Europe. Beautiful crema. Have not tried milk steamer. Needs a short espresso cup to receive the coffee. Handle has rubber gasket which seems to tighten firmly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"It is a great machine, I have never had a espresso maker so I dont know if it is slow or fast but in my opinion 15mins prep time is a little slow. I like my coffee immediately when I wake so fifteen is a little slow. The handle seems to have a odd seam so I am not sure if I will have to replace it in a few months. The seal for the coffee is great, very tight. they have two cup inserts for how ever many shots you want. It is a great size, no bigger than a normal coffee pot. Steam works a whole lot quicker than the actual coffee. Over all it is a great cafe, I love how everything comes out. It is a perfect size, and price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Expresso Maker","review":"Received Quickly. Heats up within 2 minutes from complete cold start.

After troubleshooting with a Delonghi rep, to no avail, I had to send the unit back (2 inches of the cord). They told me to expect a turnaround of about 5-10 days. After two weeks of waiting, I'm told there's a back order of 3-5 additional weeks, which puts me out of the amazon return period. I should have just dealt with amazon directly and exchanged the unit for a Mr.Coffee or a Breville. Lesson learned.Pros:-Great tasting espresso when it works-Great latte's when it worksCons:-No pump pressure after 2 weeks of use (cleaned it, primed it, purged it, tried different tamping pressures, etc)-Durability-Customer service"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't produce decent espresso no matter what I tried...","review":"After much research, I ordered this because of all of the great reviews I've read here and elsewhere...didn't work for me. I tried 3 different espressos from 3 different sources--all ground for espresso--one even ground extra fine and the espresso pulled came out weak every time, with just a little crema. I don't know if I got a jinxed machine or what, but it just wouldn't work. And Amazon just keeps raising the price on the little wonder. It's gone from $79.99 to over 100.00 over the past month alone. I sent mine back for a refund.

We have many other De'Longhi products that we have been happy with but this is not one of them. The Krups unit had more space between the base and the coffee filter. This unit limits you to using the cup or a low profile stainless container. The main flaw, however, is that the vibration from the pump literally takes the cups off the platform unless you hold them making this useless in my opinion. Finally, this unit is made in China, something I didn't see anywhere in the product description."},{"rating":"1","title":"this company has the worst customer service","review":"I had one and the water well broke and DeLonghi had me waiting for over 3 months for a replacement part that they didn't have.

I've owned other espresso machine before, but never seen anything messier.- The \\"OK\\" green lights ON time is very inconsistent.- It vibrates pretty bad, where I had to hold the cup the entire time when dripping.If anyone has any fixes for these issues, please leave me comment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two defective products","review":"This may be a good espresso maker but I will never know. My first one worked for a day or two before an indicator light stopped working. I returned it for an exchange and the second one did not work right out of the box.

It's not a month old and I can see it is not likely to last very long :(The way it heats up is already inconsistent, and one of the filters lets the espresso come through, but for some reason after the 5th or 6th use, it no longer produces the creama. I've done all I can to insure it's perfectly clean but still it's worthless to me ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, reliable machine","review":"I would definitely reccomend this machine to people who pull their own esspresso shots. If you know how to grind the coffee and how to pull the shot properly, this machine performs very well for the money. It is an affordable price for the 15 BARs of pressure and pretty good quality. I feel that my husband and I are able to pull shots that are comparable to local coffee shops on this home machine.

It's lazy, the parts don't fit right and the coffee is extremely mild for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vibrates cups out from under the coffee drip spouts!","review":"The pump action causes a vibration that moves cups out from under the coffee drip spouts as others but suspiciously not all have noted in their reviews. I have tested this unit sitting on the floor and counter tops to make sure it was level and each time the vibration moves the cups out of position and the coffee fills the suspiciously deep overflow tray, did they know that this would happen? To remedy this problem I have to wrap a wet paper towel around and under the bottom of the cup to keep it in place. I would bet De'Longhi a pile of money that their R and D department knew of this blatantly obvious design flaw and greedily dumped it on the market anyways. Regardless of all the other negative reviews made here this one alone should send buyers fleeing to another coffee maker. Dishonesty will bring them bad karma and I am not one to refuse them their just reward of a one star rating. I hope and pray they lose business because of this review!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good while it lasted, warranty replacement slow","review":"The unit made decent espresso while it worked.

It made decent espresso with ease and despite the short stem, the steamer made good foamy froth. But in less than 4 months, the machine stopped working. I guess it has to do with the lack of a self cleaning system but after trying out every cleaning tip suggested on this review/board, the machine is still not working. It makes hopt water but doesn't generate sufficient pressure to extract coffee.We are past our return window.... What a waste of money!!! stay away from this machine. It is cheap for a reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delonghi EC155. It's real espresso, Just not good espresso.","review":"I bought the EC155 machine to make espresso shots, not any milk based drinks. Unfortunately this machinemakes espresso that is a little watery, lacking complex flavor notes, and a little bitter.I tried all different grinds (I have a Capresso Infinity Burr Grinder), different tamping forces.I also removed the valve in the portafilter, turning it into an unpressurized portafilter.That didn't help. It does produce great crema, so it looks like top notch espresso, but it doesn't taste like it. I believe that all good espresso has crema, but not all espresso with crema is good.All I want is a shot as good as Starbucks, or Panera Bread etc.If anyone knows how to make this machine produce such a shot, let me know how. If not, how high end of a machine do I need to produce such a shot? Gaggia Classic for $400? Rancilio Silvia $650? Higher end?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great overall performance","review":"Makes great espresso and is easy to use. The only downside is the catch on the handle to keep the pod adapter from falling out when extracting the used espresso pod does not hold tight enough and both the used pod and the adapter module falls out. Other than that, it's a great espresso machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked...for about a year","review":"Bought this unit because of the reviews and because I love to drink cappuccinos on the weekend. Unit worked great for a year...now the pressure isn't strong enough to push the water through. I've DE-calcified the unit three different times and there still isn't enough pressure. I really don't know why there are so many 5 star reviews...my guess is the reviews weren't updated after the first year. You get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a coffee!","review":"I was not sure at a 100% of my purchase until I use it.

Great taste coffee. The only complaint is the space to putt the cups is a little tight i did have to buy small cups."},{"rating":"2","title":"No complaints--makes good espresso, if you know how to!","review":"Not sure why some people have given this not so great reviews. Have had it about a month, and my boyfriend says I make better espresso than Starbucks--great machine for the money--you do have to monitor the time you pull an espresso and the size of grind you use for the beans, but nothing is fool proof. For the price, the milk frother is supberb! I worked for a small espresso store in college and this machine produces the same quality of crema on an espresso and steam power for a good froth--again, that is if you yourself know how to make an espresso or a latte."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short cups","review":"My basic Krups finally died and I decided to upgrade to the DeLonghi after reading reviews regarding the pump system. After a couple weeks of getting used to a finer grind and tamping, I'm pleased with the machine and the espresso. I love being able to froth without running coffe through, the water reserve is great, I only wish there was room to get a full size cup under the spout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great for a year then stopped working","review":"I hadn't bothered to check other reviews until today. My machineworked beautifully for about a year and then the problems began.Drip too slow, coffee tastes subpar, etc. I tried cleaning andall the other \\"remedies\\" suggested in the manual, but nothinghelped. Going to try another espresso maker. I guess you getwhat you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok but...","review":"I will say that this makes good espresso and heats up fast, hence the 4 stars. My only complaint about it is that it sits so low on the counter you can't get a 20oz frothing pitcher under the wand. The other thing is that the wand is so short that it doesn't go far into the milk to you have to hold it at an angle. Creates a mess if you're not careful.I sent mine back and will order a different model."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent workmanship - but good espresso requires some work","review":"This is a very well designed, solidly built machine. Everything is well thought out (like the steamer head, which is, as another reviewer said, not just a piece of plastic, it really helps aerate the milk and get nice froth).The pump is good, does the job of getting the pressurized water through the filter, the espresso comes out well (remember to tamp the coffee well), nice color, good crema.two things you should remember:1. it's more difficult to make espresso than instant coffee. You really have to get used to this rather than complain about the machine.2. you have to clean the machine every so often, and it really does affect the quality of the coffee. Use citric acid instead of fancy expensive descaling solution, take apart the filters, clean them, and you'll get good results consistently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Expresso Maker for the Price","review":"The thing I like most is it really heats up fast. Makes quite decent coffee also.It is easy to clean. However this has only one setting to make your coffee. The pump driven expresso makes better coffee than the steam based system. The frothing system works well. The only reason I gave it a 4 star because of lack of control for brewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent enough","review":"I find the espresso it makes on the weak side, but my co-workers sharing the machine like it, so I guess it's a matter of taste. Very nice crema."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice but not hot enough","review":"It may be that I am not doing it right, but the espresso just doesn't seem to get hot enough for me. I have followed the directions on preheating the unit etc. yet the temp seems to be not much warmer than what comes out of my tap and after I add the froth I end up having to heat it in the microwave to get it to the temp I like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small wonder!","review":"Great espresso maker, but not easy for frothing milk for cappuccinos. My wife has given up. Use 1 or 2% milk at fridge temperature and the same for the pitcher - 16 oz. max. Heat the milk just \\" under surface until warm. Increase steam and while swiveling the pitcher, the foam starts building up. Enjoy your coffees!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to like it so bad","review":"I wanted to like it so bad.

I don't understand why some people have so much trouble with it, but you have to keep in mind the following:1. Clean the coffee filter often, and that means taking it apart by unscrewing the plastic part at the bottom. Fine coffee particles tend to clog this, thus reducing water flow.2. Remove the screw that holds the metal filter (where the coffee basket is attached) and clean it as well.If you did this once a week, your machine will function fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I think I'm being too critical and I may change my rating to more stars in the future, however this is an average espresso machine in my opinion. It replaces my old Cusinart espresso machine that was sooo much easier to use. And the coffee was just as good. With this one, just reading the manual is a 4 credit course! Aside from the complexity, I also can't fully tighten the handle. It will only close about 3/4 of the way, so there's not enough space for 2 cups."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!!","review":"I bought this back in OCT 2011 and since then I've use it almost everyday. And just today I finally cleaned the machine , it was WAY WAY over due . I notice it been getting worse lately and after taking it apart I know why, it gets really clogged if left uncared for . But now I've going to make it a monthly cleaning job for my daily fix. Don't be lazy folk, treat it good and it will do the same for you.Also , as one person comment on taking the jet out for cleaning I used a penny and a needle nose to twist the brass jet out to clean.Thank people for the tips! Love Amazon!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cheap, but decent","review":"for the price, a pretty good deal. the large filter doesn't hold as much coffee as it should for a real double shot, and the built in tamper is a joke, but the quality and speed of brewing is pretty good. *Note: as of 1/2010, this thing is still going strong! Couldn't be happier for the price I paid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in China!!!

There wasn't even a parts list so we didn't know what we were missing until we went online to look it up. Rather than try another we chose to return this for a refund. I have no faith that another would be shipped to us with all necessary pieces or, that it would stand up to daily use seeing what kind of sloppy work they seem to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for 18 months, now leaks badly","review":"This was a great product for about 18 months, then it started leaking - badly. It is not possible to get inside of the machine to figure out what seals are gone, or where the leak is, so the solution is lots of towels. Probably would cost more to repair than replace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Replacement for Gaggia Carezza","review":"We had a Gaggia Carezza espresso machine that made excellent espresso and steamed milk beautifully for three years. Then one day it simply died. We got the DeLonghi EC155 as a replacement and are very happy with it. It makes very good espresso, and it's better looking, smaller and significantly quieter than our Gaggia. (And it cost a lot less.) Yes, you do need to get a good quality tamper, but that's true for any machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would keep looking, horrible machine","review":"Not sure how this got any good reviews, maybe they are plants by mfr.

By April 2010 it was leaking out of the where the steamer wand enters the machine. I could deal with that, but now it's started to pour water out of the steamer wand whenver I attempt to make a shot of espresso. I would think it would last longer than eight months!

I just feel cheated.Moral: be wary of the origin of the products advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product","review":"This product was a waste of money. I guess you do have to spend several hundred dollars at least to get a decent machine. My main problem is the espresso function - it takes about 20 minutes to make one espresso. Turn it on, and out of the filter it comes, drip by drip, for ages. Seriously, a water droplet at a time, for almost 20 minutes. By the time you have enough coffee, it's luke warm, and you have to mix it with foamed milk if you want it hot. If you just want espresso, it's cold - what kind of an \\"espresso machine\\" is that?I am going to throw this in the trash and bite the bullet and probably spend $400 on something that can make an espresso in a more reasonable amount of time.I suggest you do the same unless you want to find out for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only works intermittently- not reliable.","review":"We found this coffeemaker to be faulty within a month and a half of once daily use.

Like the other reviewers indicated, the symptoms of my machine's demise included slow-drip espresso, followed by no-drip espresso. While the machine can run water through without hesitation, it looks like it no longer carries enough pressure to push the water through when grind is added to the mix.The machine did work well in its prime, and would have received 2 stars if I could have it repaired...but it looks as though De'Longhi is designing for obsolescence rather than designing a machine who's parts can be replaced as they fail. On to another manufacture willing to build machines with replaceable parts..."},{"rating":"1","title":"good espresso ... for three months","review":"Considering the price of this machine and Delonghi's reputation for espresso makers, I expected much more. Espresso was great for the first few months. After that, the water leaked everywhere, there was no pressure of water through the coffee, and forget steaming milk. I tried to look for a leak or figure out if something just wasn't lined up properly. In the end, it seems to be a design problem. The seals and hoses that push the water from the reserve through the machine seemed to break down, and any small amount of pressure loss made the machine inoperable. I got this as a gift so I was out of luck. Don't waste your money. Really makes me worry about some of their other products people are paying 500+ for on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely disappointed","review":"I purchased the De'Longhi EC155 after doing a great deal of research. Initially, I was completely satisfied with my purchase and really wanted to love it. However, within a few days of use the machine began leaking excessively through the steam wand. This happened while while it was warming up, while in use (watering down milk), and while it just sat there. It was a significant amount of water each time. There's damage to my countertop where it was before I noticed the leak. I contacted customer service, and they said the machine was still under warranty. Still waiting on my replacement. It's been over a month now (prior to hurricane delays). I wish I had spent more money and gone with something else to avoid all of this inconvenience and frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks water after one week","review":"I bought this because of the decent reviews....WOW I was fooled.

I am happy to report that it did, for about 10 months. We have not had it for a year and it apparently has pumped it's last latte. About two months ago, the steamer started acting up and not passing any steam, though it was full of water and worked fine until then. To make sure it was fully primed, I ran the pump and it worked. I turned it back to steam and nothing happened. The next day I tried again and the same thing happened, only this time the little bit of steam that came through smelled like burning plastic/metal. Hoping this wouldn't effect my coffee, I gave it a go only to have to dump it out because it tasted like smoked plastic in a metal cup.Until this point it has worked great. I'm not sure what went wrong, but, I think we will return this one for the same De'Longhi model, since it suited our needs just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to use","review":"It made a great cup of coffee for about a month but has a lot of problems now. It water starts dripping as soon as the machine is turns on for warming up, before the dial is on brew. The handle needs increasingly more push to the right to get in place. It doesn't stop brewing when it's brewed a cup. The steamer starts by spewing water before steam, watering the drink. The steamer is difficult to clean. The filter holder in the machine is impossible to screw lose and clean, like the manual instructs. I gradually went back to my stove top espresso maker. I wish I had bought a Keurig instead"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Home Use Machine","review":"I like this expresso and cappuccino maker. This is the first one I have ever owned and it was fairly simple to learn how to make a good cappuccino.It does take some time to heat up so you need to not be in a hurry.

At first, it seemed a great upgrade to the Mr. Coffee espresso maker I had, which never really produced crema. The Delonghi was hot enough, had plenty of pressure, and created a beautiful crema. However, within 6 months, the performance of this machine went from a perfect stream of espresso, to coming out in drips. I cleaned everything meticulously. I sought support from Delonghi, primed the pump as instructed, etc. No improvement in pressure, so they determined the pump went bad. They replaced the unit, and I was up and running again. Almost. This replacement, which I believe was used/reconditioned, never had the performance of the original one when it was new, and now we're at a dribble again. My $20 Mr. Coffee lasted 3 times as long as this $80 Delonghi. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good espresso maker","review":"Easy but a little tedious to use.

One morning, the water stopped flowing: it took 15 minutes to fill a small cup. I changed coffee, cleaned the filter, cleaned the machine with a special product but it never worked again. I think the pump must be broken. Now it's sitting useless on the counter. I don't know how to return it.Update: I called delonghi and they told me that they won't fix it or refund me. They want me to cut the cord and send it to them along with a 15$ payment so that they can ship an new machine! This is absolutely ridiculous. What do I do with a defective, cordless espresso machine?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for a basic espresso machine","review":"I am making espresso and cappuccino a few times a day with this machine and overall it works very well. Water heats up fast and plenty of steam is available for foaming milk. Very easy to clean up. The only drawbacks I see with this unit is that you can;t use tall cups with it .... even a 2 oz shot glass will not fit under the dispensor without first removing the drain grate, I would really like to see this unit with an ajustable height (or at least higher). Also the angle of the steamer can't be adjusted at all (it only swings out and back in) but that is not a big deal since you can always alter the angle of the pitcher.Overall, for the price, I would buy this unit again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok to start with...","review":"We have had 3 of these machines.

I wish the filter would secure itself in the holder. This could be easily accomplished. The little clip works to hold the filter in while you are cleaning out the coffee grounds, put it puts your hand in the way for hitting it to knock out the last remaining grounds.

I have not been disappointed. I have been using it for about a month and it makes really great coffee. Initially I had some trouble frothing my milk to a nice foam, but with a little practice and patience I have mastered the froth! The trick is to make sure the water bleeds out before you start the frothing, then open the steam knob to about half way. Barely break the surface of the milk and watch the foam grow!

I fiddled with it and pushed down down on the tank while pouring in water with no success and finally realized there must not be any valve sealing the flow as described. Amazon is taking care of me though and sending a new one right now so my gripe is with De'Longhi for not having good quality control on their manufacturing. Will update if I ever recieve a functioning unit.Thanks to Amazon for great cooperation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes Excellent Coffee","review":"This espresso machine is exactly what I was looking for. It is small and makes good coffee. The only problem I have with it is that, since I got it, I am drinking much more coffee :). The secret to good coffee is to use good quality espresso-ground coffee (I like Lavazza)and master the art of tamping the coffee (buy a tamper, the attached tamper doesn't provide good sensitivity). If you don't want to mess with ground coffee, buy coffee pods. This machine is compatible with the ESE pod standard. You can select from a large variety of pods - mostly from Italy. The pods cost between 30-50 cents, but they save time and they make coffee that beats Starbucks (not difficult), and almost as good as a pro-made coffee.I love this machine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"3 years this Christmas and still no problems!","review":"I don't do many product reviews but I was looking at purchasing one of these for my mother today and thought that it might be helpful to tell people that I have had this machine for 3 years and it is still going strong. I use it every day if not twice a day (on those afternoons I need another pickup) and love it. I clean it every 3-4 months with the espresso cleaner and that's about it for long-term maintenance. It has a small footprint so doesnt take up a lot of space on my counter either. If you are looking for a reasonably priced espresso machine I can only tell you that this was one of the best gifts I have ever received. To mimic some of my favorite Starbucks drinks, i actually foam international delights flavored creamer instead of milk, works perfectly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes home espresso quite well....impressed!","review":"I upgraded from the steam version because I could make better espresso from my stove top. I was reluctant to buy another DeLonghi maker because of my previous purchase. I was impressed with the first shot I made. Strong espresso, and crema...I made a latte and was hooked. The only problem with mine was that the handle wouldn't seal without me holding the entire machine and forcing it into place. After a few uses, it does seal a lot easier without much force. Two shots are better than one, but that is my personal preference. Compared to the Starbuck's home Barista machine, for the money, this one makes better espresso. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good for Everyday Use!","review":"I purchased this product recently and was not happy with it at all. Water must be pre-heated for 15 minutes before making espresso. It just took too long! After 6 days of everyday use, it broke. I returned it and purchased the Breville Cafe Roma Espresso Machine instead. The Breville machine was 100% better. It takes absolutely no time pre-heating the water. Once you turn the power on, almost instantly it's ready to go. The Breville makes the perfect espresso and milk foam. It was more money but worth it. It will save you a lot of time!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Price - Excellent product","review":"Works like a charm. I had the previous version of this model for several years and it worked very well. The EC155 produces a better espresso experience with a beautiful crema and smooth taste. In addition the price at Amazon was very competitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Given As A Gift","review":"I gave this as a gift to my boyfriend last Christmas. The product is sturdy and attractive and he uses it everyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly great espresso -- can't do better for the $$","review":"Tiny, convenient machine delivers a nice cup. The Easy-Serve Pods are super-convenient -- I recommend the Lavazza Grand Crema. If you need to turn out a lot of coffee/froth, you'll probably want something with a bit more heft. But for typical home or small office, this is a great deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"If you're considering buying this product, pull the trigger. You won't be disappointed. I love mine and use it almost every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine. Doesn't need additional tamper.","review":"The machine works fine. I just wanted to comment that the included tamper also works fine and the comments I'd read about needing a \\"good\\" steel tamper are unwarranted. The plastic tamper mounted on the side of the machine is hard and sturdy and more than sufficiently rigid to tamp coffee plus its the right size. Comment about \\"needing\\" a steel tamper are just pretentious dribble. If you like the looks of separate steel tamper that's fine, but it won't improve the flavor of the coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what we expected","review":"We were so disappointed with this! This machine has to be pre-heated for 15 minutes. Even though the resevoir holds several cups of water, you have to stand there and manually turn it off when you get your cup. I just don't have that kind of time in the morning. I also usually brew into a small carafe, but there's no room for one on this machine. I can't take those little cups with me.... Way too difficult and too much trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"tiramisu","review":"This machine is awesome. I love this.The other inconvenient thing for me is the machine itself is not very tall,sometimes it's not very convenient when you're boiling the milk/making frost using thesteam pipe. Other than that, it's an awesome machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"not ok","review":"This machine could only make one shot at a time/ can't deal with that. For us it would have taken all morning to make 2 lattes. RETURNED THE MACHINE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was used","review":"I ordered this from the super saver deal from amazon. It arrived in a box that was unsealed and obviously had been opened before it got to me. When I removed it the plastic bag had obviously been opened and replaced. the cord was just wrapped around the center and the silver had scratches and fingerprints on it. It looked used. Or it was a return item from someone else.Now I am trying to return it to Amazon and printed out the forms and put it back in the box. Except UPS has not shown up to pick it up. So it sits in a box in my hallway waiting for a refund. I am disappointed to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this machine!","review":"I wouldn't even have given it one star, but the system wouldn't allow me to put ZERO! This machine broke after TWO weeks. Week two the heating element refused to heat up enough to work properly. Green light never came on...after leaving the unit on for hours. Even with \\"pre-heating\\" techniques...it STILL would not heat up to maximum. Could not have been overuse. Used it once, perhaps twice a day. Pay more for a higher quality machine. The adage \\"you get what you pay for\\" most definitely applies here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Working Voltage 110V","review":"I received this product two days ago. One thing surprised me: Working voltage 110V! It will not work for most of the world except in USA unless you provide a stepdown transformer which is not cheap. I forgot to check the specification when purchasing this item. Amazon also does not state it! I will not buy it if knew it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"I received it and it seemed beautiful. When I opened it I figured out that the water tank is wet, so it had been used before. But I didn't had the time to return it and other parts seemed new.You should turn it on and wait until an OK light turns on and then you can use it. It worked for several times and the coffee was good but the OK light stopped working. I don't know what the problem is with it.I paid $80 for an espresso machine. I bought a table for it, a tamper, espresso shots, espresso spoons and a coffee spoon. But, it worked less than 10 times!!!!It was only a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"Have in the last few years owned several affordable espresso machines. Each took some getting used to and I did. This De'Longhi EC155 was rated favorably by Consumer Guide. The area for a container to sit is so small that even a tea cup would not fit under the spout. I tried 3 different grinds of beans in various amounts but always had grounds in the espresso. Tamping the grind (or not) did not solve this problem. In the end, I returned the product even though there is no guarantee that a full refund will be issued. Am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait at least 15 monutes????","review":"I have not even started to use it. I read the instruction and was dumbfounded... With the previous model it took 1 push of a button and ~1 minute to preheat the water, and another push to have your espresso ready in 2 more minutes at most. Now it a cumbersome several-step process, a stupid rotating knob, and a mandatory 15 (say, FIFTEEN) minutes for preheating. Reading about the \\"rapid\\" option nearly gave me a heart attack :-) Like I have time and desire to do it in the morning... Boy am I glad I didn't threw away the old one yet. I'll try to order parts and fix it. It stopped dispensing water, apparently there is a problem with the pump. Maybe it's be worth it. The old one was perfect and served me for 9 years. Maybe I'll manage to find a new old one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud, shaky, difficult to clean","review":"The espresso was delicious. But we had to return the machine. It sounds like a blender when turned on, and shakes so badly that you have to hold the cups in place as it's brewing. It's very difficult to clean - lots of little parts and gaskets to take apart. It takes a long time to heat up, and there's not a lot of room between the base and the filter - we had to make espresso into a short bowl, as we didn't have espresso cups. No mug could fit under there. Tamper stinks, and no froth cup is included."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead On Arrival","review":"After spending more than a little time checking reviews I decided on this model for a Christmas gift based on the many positive reviews. On Christmas morning we were expecting to have a nice hot cup of Cappuccino after shoveling snow but instead all we got was aggravation trying to get this thing to work. I contacted Delonghi support on the next business day and they said that the pump was probably defective and suggested I return it through Amazon. Amazon didn't charge for return shipping but it was still a hassle having to process the return, repackage everything back up and bring it to a UPS drop off location. Luckily I hadn't yet sent in the UPC code off the box for the $20 rebate or else I probably would've been denied the refund. I'll buy my next Cappuccino maker from a local store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"Bought this for my wife for Christmas and we ended up returning it. It takes way too long to heat up. There is a \\"shortcut\\" method, but even this is too time consuming. We are not heavy duty latte drinkers - only make a couple a week but the time it takes to heat up and brew was unacceptable. The one time we did make coffee it was pretty tasty so I guess if you don't mind the wait, go for it. Otherwise, go for a different model that won't take as long."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I don't know... maybe it's operator error. I read the reviews, I thought I cold get this to operate but after many, many efforts I have abandon it. I've had espresso machines in the past and never had a problem. This is noisy, the \\"green\\" light that says it's hot enough to use stays on only a few seconds, then, what? I'm suppose to wait again when the cup is only one fifth full??? Just not a well thought out machine... at least for this gal..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needed new espresso maker","review":"Totally enjoy this, although I wish it had a automatic shut off, but I'll get used to it. The item was a little to fancy for me but it sure is nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Grade Product Made in China","review":"I purchased this machine and I had high expectations. It is after all a \\"DeLonghi\\". After testing it for 3 days, I decided to give up. The filter holder won't clip with the shot filter and won't position to the middle as shown in the photo. I will look for another DeLonghi, but only if it's made in Italy."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't last long","review":"i had the Delonghi ec140 before i purchased the ec 155 in sept 2010. The ec 140 lasted about a year and a half but i kept it on for hours at a time and later learned that it burns out the boiler. I bought the ec155 and didn't keep it on any longer than needed to make the espresso. I was out of town for 8 months of the 13 months I had it so it lasted 5 months at 2 uses per day and it died 2 months past warranty. The coffee is great the frother works great but it doesn't last long. Not getting another Delonghi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Espresso/Cappucino machine!","review":"I have purchased this espresso maker for my husband, as an anniversary gift, and I have to say it's the best ever! - I hope we will use it many years from now on.It is small enough to fit on the counter top, makes excellent coffee (for best results, buy Lavazza, Italian espresso coffee, very fine ground). My husband is a big espresso enthusiast, but since my purchase, I am convinced that this is the best coffee EVER!I am very happy with my purchase! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"great product....had it for a month now and it works perfectly, easy to learn and use.my favorite new gift to myself"},{"rating":"2","title":"MMM MMM Good","review":"So far so good.

LOVED, LOVED, LOVED it!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst machine I've ever owned","review":"Before a month was up the pump quit. So I had to send it to a service center because it was a couple of days over the return period. After another 2 months waiting for it, I got it back to have it work less than a month. Horrible!! We are experienced Espresso people, Have a Big pro machine in the kitchen but wanted this as an extra for down stairs. I've gone thru tons of smaller cheap machines, don't expect them to withstand the use we give them but this machine was the worst we ever bought in the less expensive lines."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE QUALITY CONTROL","review":"This is our 3rd (and LAST!) De Longhi expresso maker.The first one broke after a month. The replacement had a cracked water tank, right out of the box and the last one (this one) burned the pump after two months! Even though we cleaned all relevant parts MORE often than the manual even suggests. We are still waiting for a replacement...While it worked, the coffee was good but, 2 months is way too short a life span for a product of this type. And three defective units out of three is too high an average for us to waste out time with De Longhi products again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in performance after six months.","review":"Although it would have been great to have the unit about 2\\" taller, the performance at first was great. After about six months, the unit suddenly stopped creation of LaCrema and no longer made the traditional 'whooshing' sound, plus takes four times longer for coffee to drip through filter. Followed instructions on cleaning although could not locate 'citric acid' so used white vinegar. Disassembled and cleaned all of the filters. Still no improvement. Has anyone else had this problem and figured out next step to improve performance?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Machine","review":"The reviews before are spot on. This machine makes a great espresso, straight or as a latte. The grinds are left very soupy but I just leave a bowl or something underneath the area where the espresso is held and let it drain - in 20-30 mins its dry. This machine is ready to rock in 5 mins, best at 10 mins."},{"rating":"2","title":"extracts coffee properly","review":"One of the trickiest things with espresso machines is to get a proper extraction of the coffee from the beans. I had another similar priced espresso machine (15 bar, not steam) that I used for over a year and it was no match for this machine. The first cup of coffee from this machine was better than any cup that ever came out of the other machine. It generates a very nice head, crema, consistently. Have made about 70 cups so far and the hardware seems sturdy and reliable. Very happy with this machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"dE LONGHI EC155","review":"Overall the espresso machine makes a great cup of coffee. Certainly for the price you can't find a pump driven machine that makes the perfect crema every time. My only complaint is that the machine vibrates a little too much. If it had a bit more weight it would probably solve the problem. Still, for the money I wouldn't trrade it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky...","review":"I have had mine for almost a year now and up until 4 months ago I would have given it 5 stars except it now leaks from underneath and also out the back. When I turn the knob it will either make an espresso or a floor, it's hit and miss. I had read many great reviews on amazon before buying and no one really mentioned this. Now that it's happening I notice this is a common problem from reviews on other websites such as coffeegeek. It used to make great coffee though and I have got a great deal of use out of it for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective, and replacement part unavailable","review":"Bought the espresso machine as a holiday gift. Upon opening, noticed that the valve was missing from the water tank. After multiple emails to customer support and many pings for updates, they finally said that the part was backordered. Now, over 6 weeks later, no part. Returned for refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cappuccino maker","review":"I have two of these, one in each house. Does an excellent job of frothing, but it takes a while to get the hang of it and get the consistency right. I have found the froth is much better when you use a stainless steel pitcher as opposed to ceramic or glass, don't know why that would make a difference but it does. It has started to leak a bit now, but since there is a deep tray to catch drippings, it's not a big problem. I use a tiny espresso cup to dispense the coffee and then add it to my mug after I put the froth in. All in all, I'm very happy with it. It makes a cappuccino that equals Starbucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a manual camera","review":"I was going to get that kind you just push a button and the cappuccino pops out. But we decided to get something with more user-control.This teeny tiny machine is super basic. You turn it on to start the water, you turn it off when you think it's enough.It's a lot of fun to play barrista every morning andIt sure is empowering to make better coffee than I can buy.Why, for a month of cafe coffee you can pay for this twice over.Well worth it.If you like manual settings on a camera, you'll like this machine.The downside is also a plus. It's small! So you'll have to get small cups if you don't already have some."},{"rating":"1","title":"dead after 45 days","review":"was great while it lasted, but after 45 days of use it stopped working properly. very disappointing.

By April the thing is extremely noisy and the steaming wand no longer works properly"},{"rating":"2","title":"great machine for the price","review":"Unless you want to spend $2,000, this probably the machine to consider. Like to see someone hold a blind tasting to see if anyone can tell the difference in taste. The money saved can be used to buy a good grinder to make the grind fit the machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, very, very pleased...","review":"This was my first purchase of an espresso machine and it has definitly lived up to its name. It is easy to use, easy to clean, and makes great espresso. The only thing that I was a little taken back by is that it requires you to warm it up for 15 minutes prior to use. Like I said earlier, this was my first espresso machine purchase, so I am unaware if other machines require this as well. It took a little time to get used to this but now I just remember to turn it on the minute I wake up so its warm and ready to go by the time I want my cup of espresso."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short, bad steamer....","review":"Can I return it? The steamer doesn't work well at all. it just dilutes the milk without heating it well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your own personal Starbucks!","review":"Very deluxe little machine that makes absolutely delicious espresso and cappuccino. Easy to use, just simply follow the instruction booklet. I purchased this machine not because of the brand but because of the endless great reviews I read. Seems to me most of the negative reviews were from folks who apparently did not thorougly read their instruction manual.I use Medaglia D'oro Espresso and every cappuccino tastes like rich delicous dark chocolate! This machine is worth every penny...However like most of the reviews stated, buy a separate tamper. The one on the machine is a nice idea but more trouble than its worth. I've found using the least amount of pressure when tamping is the best for a great coffee!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Espresso Maker for the Money","review":"I received this espresso maker for Christmas from my wife and so far it has been excellent. This machine is very easy to use and I have had no problems with making the espresso shots or with steaming my milk. I love to make mochas and with this machine I can have one created in about 7 minutes. So, if you are looking for a fairly inexpensive espresso maker (I paid $[...] with a $[...] mail-in-rebate) then I highly recommend you try this one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product - Easy to Use - At a Great Price","review":"I bought this product a month ago after reading all of the rave reviews. I'm a coffee addict who loves lattes. I'm not an aficionado so I opted for the PODS. The system is easy to use, has all of the necessary functions and creates a great latte. The PODS are great since there is little to no clean-up required and they taste pretty darn good. I use the Illy PODS and haven't looked back. I've completely stopped hitting the coffee shop and have made the transition to lattes at home. Couldn't be happier and and have already justified the cost. This is a great product - highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"only makes one good latte","review":"This machine spits out too much water when it steams the milk, watering down the steamed milk and once you make a double shot of expresso the moter is not strong enough to make a second double shot, so you have to do single shots to make an extra latte. I will give it to my college daugter becasue she only has to make one latte per morning and I will find another machine that can make more than one latte per session."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't ask more for the price","review":"Being Italian, I am quite picky on the quality of my caffe'. Well, I have to say that this little espresso machine, does what is supposed to. I had it for 6 months now and is still working fine (just some minor dripping when it is turned off), making a nice creamy espresso.For sure the machine does look a bit cheap but hey it costs a fraction of a Gaggia or Rancilio so what do you expect?My complaints with this machine is in its design: the little room under the milk froster (really you can't fit any cup under there) as well as the room under the coffee sprouts which makes it really impossible to put anything else other than an espresso cup. I do remove the tray at the base and this gives you a bit more room but you have to be very careful when you take your cup out or you will spill your coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Great","review":"I just got this and set it up, all excited to make espresso...Read the instructions, waited the 15 minutes, the green light came on much earlier but I waited...I was only running water through it (it says run 5 cups of water through before you use grounds). Turn the knob, lots of noise! No water! Steam yes, water no. Turn it off, try again, wait 1/2 hour...still nothing but noise. I'm returning it for another one. I hope this doesn't happen with the second one..Has anyone had this kind of problem? The reviews are certainly mixed but mostly positive so I went for it....Wish me luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Very small unit, normal cups will not fit under the spout. I had to hold this lightweight with all my strength just to get the filter cup secure. The instructions say it takes a half hour to heat up, although they offer a suggestion for faster heat up by running some water through it. Cheap compared to the low-line Krups I had. It was out of the box for fifteen minutes and I said to myself, nope, it's just not worth it, so back it goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for Only Four Months","review":"I bought this for my husband as a Christmas (2009) gift. He had read all the great reviews here and put this espresso maker on his wishlist. For about 3 and half months it worked great and made excellent frothy espresso. For the last couple of weeks it started to get slower and slower and produced poor tasting espresso with no froth. He followed all the suggestions other reviewers had about cleaning and flushing the machine, even going to so far as to take it apart and clean everything thoroughly. It still made bad quality espresso and after a few weeks of fiddling with it, we finally gave up. Big bummer, a waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Espresso for a month...maybe!","review":"This espresso maker should have been named \\"The Ephemeral\\". That is, it produces delicious tasting espresso, with a fine 'crema' head...but only for a month or two. That's when the pump begins to fail, producing a paltry trickle of some thin foamy liquid that's almost, but not entirely, unlike coffee. I was able to get an exchange on the first unit, but 3 weeks later...almost to the DAY, the pump on the replacement unit started to show the same signs of impending failure. By the end of 4 weeks, it had failed completely.The other reviewers sharing similar experiences pretty much said it all:\\"Don't buy this thing; it's crap\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Product!","review":"Seeing that it was Italian-made, I bought it with high expectations as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend.

Good success with pulling a perfect shot with these tips: wash and heat the portafilter with hot water, then dry; flush the grouphead then the steam wand and grouphead again before brewing; then clean both after brewing. Make sure your cup is hot, otherwise, espresso will be flat. Can improve steaming by keeping your milk container very cold. Try grinding your coffee to the consistency of salt. A great starter machine for the aspiring barista and good value for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but not great","review":"Have been using one of De'Longhi steam powered units for years without problems. Ordered this to upgrade to faster and better results. Found I could make repeat cups faster and easier with my old machine. This required too much cool down/heat up between cups. I found the coffee did not improve with the pump unit as I thought it would. The cup height is a definite issue and can only be attributed to design flaw/lack of testing. I returned it. Still using my old steam unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"it finally completely broke after little more than a year...","review":"I bought this machine because it was cheap. While it ran it produced ok espresso.The first issue was that the steam nozzle wouldn't shut of completely.

This is half of capacity needed for an American sized double shot of expresso.2) The pump is weak. It will not pump water at an adequate rate thru what most normal people would call an expresso grind coffee.3) Most normal sized coffee cups will not fit under the filter bowl.Save your money for a better machine, I wish I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"huge disappointment","review":"I tried using different ground coffees still the result was sour tasting watery liquid with barely any foam.I am very disappointed,reading the reviews I expected so much more,I own a Krups esspresso machine and I wasn't happy w the coffee it was making but after purchasing this I started appreciating my Krups.It is definitely going back."},{"rating":"2","title":"hot and ready in no time","review":"This expresso machine met all of my expectations.

It quite on me a few days ago, it still heats the water and froths milk but will not put water through the espresso. The pump is on, i can hear it but it wont force water through the coffee. Its like it totally lost its power. When it was new it would make a great crema but month by month is slowly degenerated. I have cleaned it with vinegar(per instructions). I always buy fresh whole coffee beans and grind them with a burr grinder. So I am disappointed it didn't last longer. The space between the coffee filter and the base is very small so only espresso cups will fit. If it didn't break so quickly I would have given it 4 stars. Just bought the Mr. Coffee ECMP50 Espresso/ Cappuccino Maker. Made a few cups of espresso and cappuccino today and Am really impressed so far. Comparing both new I would go with the Mr. Coffee over this Delongi.

Opening the box, I found that the handle on the water reservoir is cracked and non-functional.I decided to run some water through it to see the basic functionality. The machine vibrates so much that the cups rattle out of the way of the water (or espresso) output by the machine, so the water (or expresso) runs into the drain instead of the cup.Also, the machine is smaller than I expected. With the metal plate in place, you need expresso cups no larger than a shot glass to receive the coffee. As far as I can see, it's not just low quality, it's also a bad design."},{"rating":"2","title":"DeLonghi rocks!","review":"Good looking machine, and a better espresso maker!

I have been using for the past month after having a steam Krups (which i loved). the espresso is more authentic (great crema) and the steamer is so easy, even a newbie would be able to make perfect foamed milk. It is super easy to clean. The instructions say to turn on for 30 minutes prior to making coffee. I have never waited this long and usually only wait 6-7 minutes while getting milk, coffee, etc prepared. My one remark is for those who have used steam type machines before such as the Krups, you can only make one or two at a time, not the four you may be used to. Therefore making a large beverage is more time consuming. Happy Espresso making."},{"rating":"2","title":"good basic model","review":"This espresso maker gets the job done for small scale users.

My objections to this machine are numerous: it doesn't produce much crema at all; it rattles so much you have to hold onto the espresso cup to keep if from dancing off the side; not only is the frothing wand too low to the counter, as someone noted, but for the first second or two when it's turned on, a straight, hard stream of water--not steam--comes out, seriously diluting the espresso. I'm going back to my old De' Longhi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible value and fantastic espresso!","review":"Bottom line - buy it and if your a beginner to espresso, order some espresso pods to make it easy for yourself. You can always buy a specialty grinder and learn the art of being a barista at a later time. I have owned three other espresso machines in my life, the cheap steam no-bar type and a couple of 15 bar pressure types. This is by far the best one I have owned. At this price, it pays for itself in a month and the espresso and lattes are as good as you can get at a coffee shop.

Granted it does not cost a lot. Problem is it makes expresso and it foams milk, but by the time you get the two steps done it has all gone cold. This unit doesn't make the water hot enough and by time you put it all together it is just warm. Seems to take a long time for the water to get hot and doesn't stay that way. If you go to make more than one cup you will be waiting a long time between brews so don't plan on having friends over to get together for expessos unless you like to drink one at a time or have cold expesso.

Maybe I am a little spoiled by the old machine, but the first thing I noticed was the long heat and prep time suggested in the manual -15 minutes. Once ready, the steam flow was weak at best and took quite a while to prepare enough milk for one cup. Worse, the espresso pump was barely strong enough to pump out one shot of coffee, minus the crema. In short, underpowered and small.

BUT,the machine should be turned on to warm for a good 20/30 minutes (as per instruction) otherwise, espresso in not hot.

Coffee is good - nothing extraordinary yet but I've yet to learn the nuances - but it takes too long. The manual suggests 'pre-heating' the machine for half an hour before making coffee. Half an hour! Really????? My stove-stop maker takes far less time.While searching for a good and inexpensive replacement to my old machine, I read hundreds of reviews including many dozens on this particular model and not one ever mentioned such an unreasonable wait time for espresso (in fact, many have indicated how quick the machine was). Either people aren't following manufacturer directions and still getting a great cup or the manufacturer has inexplicably redesigned a great product into something less.In any case, I'll experiment with timing and report back, but I am not pleased at the moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for cappucino lovers","review":"I use this little espresso maker every morning. It is easy to use, fairly quick and pretty easy to clean. Just like other reviewers said my only complaint is that the steamer arm is so short.

It heats up in around a minute and is easy to clean. To get the best pull however, I would wait around 20 minutes for everything to heat up properly. After 1 minute you can pull a shot but it won't be of the best quality.There are a couple of downsides but not at all deal breakers. First, the built in tamper is horrendous. It's nearly impossible to get even pressure, or enough of it, because it is attached to the machine. This results in low pressure pulls and a soupy mess of grounds when finished. Buy a 49mm metal tamper for $10. Second, the steam want is short. You really have to angle your frothing pitcher to get a steam head all the way into the milk. Once you get your technique down, it's much less of an issue.I have had this machine for about a month and use it daily.

His style tends to use sound effects in the background, but there is a charm to his style that makes him very easy to listen to. A smooth voice and a nice message. He is a poet. This particular release has the translations in the cover sheet which also is a nice touch to those that cannot speak portuguese.

If that's your thing, go for it.Otherwise, this movie is a total waste of money and time. Personally, I found it an odd and non-working combination of humor for 12 year olds and thirty year olds. I couldn't reconcile the mix. Did the producer expect that twelve year olds would be watching a movie with ass porn and harsh language in it, or did they expect thirty year olds to appreciate poop in mouth humor?Maybe I don't get it. Maybe I don't understand the 30-somethings of the 21st century. I'm a male in my 50's, have two teenage kids at home, and I am an avid movie watcher. I will watch anything if for no other reason than to review it for myself.Bottom line, wait for this one to be on HBO if you feel you have to see it for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"The same all over again!! Nothing new!!","review":"The plot was already seen many times on screen, especially here in Brazil, where we have a brand called \\"Se eu fosse voc\\" which follows the same plot of a change-up. Still, I gave it two stars because some scenes are funny and also because I've seen some movies which has no plot at all. At least, this has a premise of a change-up and follows this premise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gratuitous raunch cheapens quality.","review":"This is a 2011 attempt to freshen the hackneyed \\"body-swap comedy\\" that is unfortunately only halfway successful. It definitely has its moments. It starts and ends well. The middle is full of unnecessary raunch to keep the young guys interested. Hardly a classic. Not worth owning. Bateman and Reynolds are okay, but always play within their limited range. Leslie Mann gives the strongest performance of all. Definitely not for mixed company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh...","review":"This video sucked. I really wanted to believe that this wasn't just another dumb lame switch up movie. But... it was a big letdown. Not the worst movie you'll see but it's so cliche and in line with all of the other terrible change up movies. I am a huge fan of Bateman and Reynolds but this didn't deliver. It had a few funny moments but not really much worth owning. If anything, just rent this or Netflix it. I'd say it's good for one watch then you'll be glad you didn't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, entertaining, feel good film","review":"Bateman and Reynolds are 2 of my favorite actors. Story is about 2 men who wish they had the other one's life, thinking the grass is always greener on the other side - some thought of regret for what they haven't experienced in life and thinking it was too late now. By supernatural means they get to live each other's life for a time which leads to some pretty comical scenes while they come to realize what they truly want their lives to be like. I laughed, I cried. Worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspiring rehash of rehashed hash","review":"I realize the studios are risk adverse but endless repetition of the same old themes is really getting tiresome. How many times have you seen thematically similar story lines? Was it really necessary to create yet another version of the family man switches with successful single guy for our amusement and moral edification? What a boring piece of tripe. Note to studios; if I cared more about tits and crude humor than an intelligent plot line and acting ability I'd watch a porn flick. Get a clue, we aren't all fourteen and learning disabled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Film","review":"I just HATE when you watch a movie trailer and you think you are going to see a comedy that may not have the most unique story-line but you love the actors and can't wait to sit back and be entertained and then WHAM right off the bat you are bombarded with the F--- word and bad acting and an excuse to show nudity that doesn't add anything to the film at all.

Really??? Is he that hard up for a decent script that he has to settle for this garbage? Glad I didn't pay more than $1.99 to see it. Even that was too much.

It is written for 13 year olds... but it is rated \\"R\\", so, they can't see it. It is so stupid and loaded with gratuitous nude and vulgar shots including baby poop to the face (that's so ooollllddddd) and a thumb up someone's \\"behind\\", I couldn't sit through the entire move - even at the bargain price!

It was a total waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A supreme disappointment","review":"Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds are perhaps two of the most enjoyable actors around. However, I could not have been more disappointed in a movie had I tried. I don't find the F bomb offensive if used for emphasis, however, in this movie, it is used constantly and in the presence of small children. In fact, it is the first word spoken in the movie. This is not funny and not humor. The porno scene with Reynolds was simply foul. One of the reasons why I was so offended is that these two actors don't carry off this behavior. I truly enjoy when an actor tasks a risk but this was the wrong risk for these two actors. The film stinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of both worlds","review":"This movie, according to rotten tomatoes and other critics, is supposed to be lousy. In my opinion, this is far from it. It shows the sides of living the opposite lives; living a life of a busy/working man and the life of a down-to-earth/relaxing life. I personally found the movie to be eye-opening. Life's meaning is not to always work but it is also not to always have fun; just need to find the right balance. Great movie with funny moments and also serious and thought-provoking moments. The only negative thing is that they revealed too many of the funny moments in the trailer and left the audience with many predictable scenes. Nevertheless, I will buy the dvd in order to have a physical copy since it is a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest movie I've seen in a long time","review":"I have no idea why this movie has bad review.

I recommend this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WHY IS THIS MOVIE GETTING BAD REVIEWS?","review":"THE CHANGE-UP is one of the most hilarious movies I've seen. Yet, the critics say that this movie is 'lousy'. Maybe some people just don't have a good sense of humor. I watched this movie with my two daughters and we had to pause it numerous times because we were laughing so much and didn't want to miss anything.Everyone has their own opinions and that's fine. My opinion is that this is a 5 star comedy and I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I was impressed with the creators for taking an R-rated movie and infusing it within a PG genre. The body swap concept has been beaten to death over the past 25 years, but never has there been one so crass and non kid-friendly. There's nudity, swearing, porno parodies, and poop-in-the-face shots. Things you'd never expect. AWESOME! It's about time! The biggest haters of this film are prudish parents throwing a collective hissy fit because their 7-year-olds saw some boobs. Whose fault is that? As a parent, you should familiarize yourself with MPAA ratings. Any parent who thought this film was going to be as vanilla as the trailer made it out to be should never breed again...ever. As for the humor, it wasn't all frat boy humor. Most of it was smart and witty. The ending was sappy and typical, but I'm glad I took a chance on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"It's not the most original idea for a movie but it is pretty funny!

At first, I couldn't understand how the characters of Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds could have been best friends, but due to the switching of personas, it became more apparent to me. They were living the lives that they felt they were missing and, in the process, found themselves deep down and each other. Not the totally best of cheap laughter films, but it had enough to keep you amused. LIKED IT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"If you like movies like American Pie, Animal House, Caddyshack, etc. you will love this movie!

I never write reviews but I felt obligated to with this one. The f-bomb is dropped what seems like every five seconds and the nudity and sex should have given this film a rating of X. I am far from a prude and this was over the line even for me. The sad thing is, this had the potential to be a really solid comedy, but they ruined it.

What makes matters even worse than the use, or misuse (a much better word) of this overused, tried and true plot is that it was not only bad, it was insulting. How accomplished and usually very funny actors such as Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds could co-star in such a monstrosity is beyond me. While there were a few scattered comedic moments here and there worthy of a laugh or two, I found the film overall to be nothing more than bathroom humor run amok, the likes of which one would expect in films such as 'Hangover I & II.

Too much gratuitous dirty language, but that goes along with the kind of movie it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had such high hopes, sadly it didn't deliver","review":"After seeing the previews several times I decided this was a movie I looked forward to seeing. Sadly, it wasn't all that great and here's why...1. I usually like this type of movie, but does every other word need to be an \\"F\\" bomb? I don't mind the occasional use of swears for humor purposes, but they lose all meaning when overused. That was definitely the case here.2. I expected it to be funny. Admittedly, there were a few scenes that made me laugh, but not many. There were several opportunities to poke fun at things, but this movie sadly missed the mark.3. It almost seemed like they tried to go for a bizarre Hangover 'WTF' type of funny at some places. In my opinion it didn't work and should have been either removed altogether or rethought.Would I recommend people watch this movie? If you have an hour and a half to waste or nothing better to do I would say go for it.

The humor was well-written, and yes, there were plenty of sight-gags, but even these were pretty-well developed. Definitely not for children. There is plenty of nudity and the F-word is rampant, but it is at the same time, charming and dare I say, delightful? It has elevated the body-switching genre, gave me such an enjoyable evening. Jason Bateman is utterly believable in both roles, as was Ryan Reynolds. I had heard Jason Bateman on NPR discussing his role in this movie and his real-life as a father to a five-year old daughter which is why Jason nailed parenting so well in the movie. I will definitely be buying this movie to watch often whenever I need a good laugh and a reminder of what life was like raising small children, and being single and 'contantly out there.....' Life is funny, for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Change-Up","review":"Although I ordered this as a gift, I have been informed it was very enjoyable and arrived in excellent condition and in a timely manner"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read!","review":"I do not care what anybody says about this movie! This movie made me laugh from beginning to end. It is raunchy and yet hilarious and even has a hint of romance in it. It is very creative and Reynolds and Bateman have amazing chemistry in this movie and the supporting cast, Wilde and Mann, did great justice to heighten Bateman and Reynolds Characters. This movie is VERY inappropriate and kids under 16 should NOT see this and if you like Raunchy, Perverted, Outrageous comedies that have nudity, as well as, strong language and Crude Sexual Content and Humor in them then I highly recommend you see this. If you don't but you crave a great but different kind of comedy then get Crazy, Stupid, Love. Crazy, Stupid, Love is an excellent comedy opposite to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand","review":"I love Jason Bateman, but I really don't understand why he made this film???? Obnoxious and gross does not NECESSARILY EQUAL FUNNY. When switching places movies happen, isn't the point for the characters to experience something they've never experienced before???

Not as funny as Cedar Rapids though.I would recommend watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too over-the-top","review":"When I heard that Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds were going to be in a comedy together, I thought it would undoubtedly be a great movie, but I was really disappointed with The Change-Up. I'm a fan of most rated R comedies but I think this movie went too far, to the point where it was too uncomfortable to be funny. At one point, Ryan Reynolds' character explains that every married guy has a \\"cancer list,\\" which lists the women that they want to sleep with if their wife ever dies of cancer. I've never seen a movie that promotes cheating so much. I think the whole movie was just trying too hard for a laugh.

The problem with this movie, and a few others recently unleashed, is that it seems we've regressed back to the 1980s, when showing boobs was the thing to do, even if we didn't understand why. Now, as then, it's pretty pointless and it doesn't do anything for the story. It made the entire movie difficult to watch, and that's too bad, because there's actually a pretty good movie in there - if you can just dig it out from under the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crude and inane","review":"If you are amused by a totally unbelievable story line combined with bad language and crude behavior, like Borat or Hotel New Hampshire, then this movie is for you. The acting is respectable but my wife and I just couldn't stomach the screenplay; it's simply not possible that a lawyer, soon to be partner, could make decisions like those portrayed in this film. It's not possible that their behaviors would have been tolerated by others. My wife and I enjoy a good slapstick (e.g. It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World, Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines and Home Alone) and/or a comedy with a smidgen of thought and depth, but this film is neither.We turned it off after about 30 minutes and watched The Bachelor with Chris O'Donnell. Itself not a very deep or believable film but we enjoyed it far more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vulgar plot without much humor","review":"When viewing the preview of this film, you'll see the very few moments of comedy that have been injected into a bloated, lifeless plot. In sum -- two guys piss into a fountain and, magically, they swap bodies. Family man / lawyer is now a single party guy.This plot COULD HAVE been very funny. But, instead, the writers rely on very extreme scenes (i.e. a naked pregnant woman trying to have sex with Ryan Reynolds) that just aren't amusing -- they're disgusting. Finding the line between gross and funny is an art because anyone can be extreme and vulgar. It takes little talent to shout out bad language and think up extreme situations.To be funny, these guys should have followed some of the thoughtless, yet funny, comedies ---Wedding Crashers or American Pie. In fact, even Beavis and Butthead has better writers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Change-Up","review":"The movie would have been really funny if it wasn't so raunchy.

The dialogue is so shocking and offensive that I spent half the movie with my jaw dropped. This is not a script I would have expected either main actor to gravitate towards but I guess I was wrong.

For anyone who has ever used a traditional Chinese dictionary, they usually have a tiny typeface capable of inducing severe headaches! Not so here! These Chinese characters are large and bold! Very nice feature, also including the cantonese pronuciation along with the mandarin. This feature alone makes the book worth twice what it is. The step by step drawings for each Chinese character are a great help. I highly recommend this book to any student of Chinese. It has helped me in my studies and I keep it with me everywhere. Also, each character is assigned a number which makes easy locating when I study. This is a great help. The multiple systems of looking up a word are also helpful. They include English, Mandarin PinYin, Cantonese, Stroke Number, and Frequency. Highly recommended. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good source for looking cantonese characters","review":"I've only used this book to lookup/review Cantonese characters, and it is very good for that. However, the author really should include some simplified characters now that Hong Kong & Macau have been returned to China.

It's not like this is something that you can still use and it will just take long Imagine trying to look through a dictionary but none of it was in alphabetical order! I wish we still had the old copy that had fallen apart because at least that could be used even though it was in single page form by the end. So a word of caution, when you get this book, make sure everything lines up right!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An essential tool for the beginning language learner","review":"Never believing this book to be a dictionary substitute, I was not disappointed, as was Amazon's reviewer, with the content. But as a student at the Beijing Language Institute, where the faculty assumed you knew how to write characters, or would find out, I found this book invaluable. As students of Chinese know, the exact configuration of characters in language texts isn't always apparent--the calligraphy isn't clear or is too small or contains an unfamiliar feature. Rita Choy's book enables students to find almost any word in their text, fairly easily, and provides clear stroke order charts for the learner.One caution: the book uses complex characters. Nonetheless, even in Beijing, I found the book very useful"},{"rating":"2","title":"useful guide","review":"It's a nicely laid-out book.

Had that not happened, they are still low quality cotton -- stiff, not soft, despite repeated washings and with small areas in which the color dye (mine are cinnamon) has washed away.

(That, as it was part of a get twenty-five off one-twenty-five incentive in kitchen and housewares, with the discount void if you return anything.) They'll probably give me a good 3 to 6 months before I have to relegate them to the \\"towels for protecting skin from hair dye and other industrial uses\\" pile, which is anything but my usual experience with the Martex brand.

Geils Band entered the 80s in style with the album LOVE STINKS, on which they welded their roots in the Memphis-Chicago-Muscle Shoals-St. Louis-New Orleans-Detroit-New York-West Coast blues/R&B/soul/rock & roll axis to the experiments of the previous albums MONKEY ISLAND and SANCTUARY and streamlined the whole thing into a sleek new sound. The song \\"No Anchovies, Please\\" isn't really a song; it's a comedy routine about a woman who becomes the victim of three mad scientists. That said, the best real songs here are \\"Just Can't Wait\\", \\"Come Back\\", \\"Takin' You Down\\", and the title track. This is a great album by a great band."},{"rating":"2","title":"The last huzzah!","review":"For me, this one was the original J. Geils Band's last unqualified sucess of an album, though a case could be made that the radio-friendly FREEZEFRAME, which came after LOVE STINKS, was the bearer of that honor. Maybe so, but it's hard to argue with the good-time holler of the title tune, the garage rock of \\"Just Can't Wait\\" or the \\"we're-still-live-and-kickin'\\" spirit of \\"'Til The Walls Come Tumblin' Down.\\" Peter Wolf is a singin' man possessed here, the band backs him to to the hilt all the way through, and when you've got album where even the comedy filler kicks in (\\"No Anchovies Please\\"), that's not half bad.

The book is loaded with information about the Essenes, the initiations, underground societies to maintain the secret teachings, and how Anna maintained her physical form for some 600 years. It also describes Jesus as a person and all that he went through physically, emotionally and spiritually. It wasn't easy!! It took a community very elevated souls, such as Anna, to help him each step of the way. But, Jesus' destiny was fulfilled and is explained in a way that will go straight to your heart and soul.

The \\"Cayce Readings\\" have great information, also I would highly recommend \\"Life of Jesus Christ & Biblical Revalations\\" by the Anne Catherine Emmerich which has endless insights into the life of St. Anne. Even the \\"Lost Books of The Bible\\" offers better insights. This book seems like a Dan Brown novel, fictional history. Contradicting much of the Information already sourced through Emmerich & Cayce it left Me with an empty feeling, not full of knowledge.In My opinion, without being all knowing, this is a work of fiction.

The special effects and 3-D images don't look at all realistic on a TV screen and many times some of the voices seemed to get sucked away, so sometimes I can't hear what somebody is saying. Add the weak story, the wooden acting, the fact that there is no real sense of danger and you have something that should really be only one star. Even for the 22nd Century some of the technology seems too far out and unexplained. KIDS may enjoy it but even they may not find it as interesting as they may find the extra to the disc the anime short 'Journey To The Planets'. For a film from 1996, this is really pretty bad.If you want something about living and working in space may I suggest 'Living And Working In Space: The Countdown Has Begun' if you can find it.

Roaring Silence provides the stepping stones to start the journey into your very own mind and to the whole phenomenal universe that's dancing in front of our noses, all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fundamental work on Dzogchen meditation","review":"This book provides the best possible starting point for practice of the fundamental meditation practices of the Dzogchen teachings from Tibetan Buddhism. It is laid out in such a way as to enable the student to work through a series of meditation exercises, each building upon the last. Like all works on Buddhist Vajrayana (Tantric and Dzogchen practices) the reader will ultimately need to refer to their own teacher for guidance on practices they read about in bookstore books. This work however provides a glimpse of how such teachers can relate with their students - taking them through stages of practice that provide the ground for the profoundly inspiring practice of Dzogchen itself. The authors are disciples of several of the most revered Buddhist teachers from the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism, yet write in a style entirely comprehensible to Westerners. I hope you enjoy this work as much as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for beginners and everybody else","review":"Roaring Silence is a terrific mixture of accessible and erudite, a combination not often paired together in a single work. The authors really seem understand what it is like for rank beginners to undertake the task of learning to meditate and they lead you through all the necessary steps you need to take to become proficient in this ancient practice.The fascinating thing to me about this book is the inclusion of the Tibetan terminology which describes all the aspects of this Dzogchen teaching. I do believe it was the first time I had encountered it. I had the sense I was getting the real deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roaringly great book","review":"This is the best book I've seen/read on the art of meditation. It gives someone who is a complete beginner all of the basics while also providing the flavor of complete path. As someone who has been meditating for nearly 20 years I still consider myself a beginner in most ways. Ngakpa Chogyam paints the picture of the practice so that depending on who is reading/viewing it, they will see what they are ready to see. A beginner will learn the basics with a flavor of where the practice leads. The seasoned meditator may get a stronger sense of the view of the Dzogchen path while at the same time refurbishing the foundation of their practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lotus","review":"So then, if we accept that the Vajra Master/ disciple relationship is possible and desirable in our culture the issue then becomes how can we know if any given teacher is authentic.

Anne Carter Zimmer's book gives us a window in time into the life of the family of her great grandparents and a look at 19th century housekeeping. I grew up in Ohio before moving South and some of Mary Lee's household hints were utilized by my grandmother and mother.

It leaves a couple inches at the base and wind is a non issue. It even has velcro straps that you could use to tighten it even more, but I think that is only for those who live in Tornado Alley or in Hurricaneville....Although my mother-in-law did manage to blow the cover clear over the fence, but maybe that is just my experience. I use the tie downs when she visits now. The material is heavy duty an has a soft liner on the inside to baby your grill. I have a dog (no, not my mother-in-law) that likes to play hide and seek around the grill and darts under the cover all too frequently and it has held up extremely well. It is very thick and sturdy and has not ripped, nor shown signs of significant wear. It washes easily when it gets dusty and really protects the grill well.

It does appear to be a quality item compared to other covers I have seen. Surprisingly, Amazon lists the dimensions for this item as the size of the box it comes in and not the dimension for the actual cover! Go figure?

The only possible pause for applause is the fact that it is so well tailored that it is somewhat challenging for one person to readily fit it back on to the grill.

The Canadian Corps changed history at Vimy Ridge.Each and every Canadian will surely remember what happened on that horrible battlefield; to stop the carnage of the First World War.The Canadians were brave fighters in the cause of world peace. The Generals believed the Ridge was impregnable, but they devised a strategy that made history. The rocket barrage of the artillery bombardment was an ingenious strategy.

It took a lot of finesse but I was able to get it back in.... all for it to come out again a few days later at home. My daughter is 3 so she can be a little rough with toys but it's not anymore than usual I would think and I would expect something targeted towards kids her age would be a little more durable.

The hero is wonderful. The problem is that she uses her style of interrupting introspection with cute little asides--well, you know what I mean. She does this far too often. Should have used a FIND and cut out at least half of them. All her novels are beginning to sound the same and that gets old after a while--and in this one, just too much.One other problem is that three of her characters have a great deal of unpleasant baggage which Ms. Bevarly handles very well. Unfortunatley, she has to give the secondary male baggage, too. His problem is dropped into the end of the story and completely unneccessary. It would have been nice to have one normal person here.If you haven't read Elizabeth Bevarly before, you'll enjoy this novel.

This slag heap of an album was the accident. The songs are more incoherent than innovative, and the lack of a unifying sound is unfortunate.

I didn't really agree with his conclusions... although I don't think he actually had any. He sort of implies what should be done, but I don't think that is the point of this point.To me it seemed like a man who doesn't like what is going on with third world medicine and decided to rant about it.

Am surprised the other reviewer is having such problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bosch 1600 P tankless water heater","review":"Works extremely well in house with 1 bath, dishwasher and washing machine. Water is extremely hot and plentiful. Would recommend to anyone with small house."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible the worst","review":"Going one 3 years now and yet again another part has broken!I have had to replace the hydro generator the pilot gas limiter and the main limiter. This has been a waste of money. I have now spent more on this water heater than a more expensive reliable unit.I am going to get rid of this pos POS and get a better one.Do not but this water heater unless you got losts of money and don't mind cold showers."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk, stay away","review":"This heater has been a never-ending source of trouble since day one. Won't turn on all the time, shuts off in middle of a shower. Had it installed by the only bosch certified plumber within 100 miles. He's now retired and nobody around here will touch one, but they will work on other brands. Mention bosch and they go running.....that aughta tell you all you need to know. Customer service is not much help, IF you can get them on the phone in the first place. They do not stand behind their product either. Currently waiting for a part to try to fix this because nobody stocks anything for these. Meanwhile, I've been without hot water for a week. Thanks for nothing Bosch."},{"rating":"1","title":"my aqulstar dead after 7 years","review":"I had a aqulstar for about 7 years w/o any problem before.last night when I using hot water I noticed that the fire did not stop after I turn the water off.Then my units get overheated and I found ash coming down (due to copper piper burnt), water pipe leaking (maybe o ring get burnt).It is dangerous. my house may get either burnt or flooded if I did not see this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only works in Summer","review":"This unit works great in the summer, save gas/money & gets very hot. If I lived in florid it would be great, but in south jersey, forget it. If you keep playing with the water supply to cut it down to a dribble & the gas as high as it can go, the water is warm. Forget about washing clothes in the winter in hot water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Automotive electrical","review":"This is a good, fairly comprehensive book on basic automotive wiring. It gives enough information that you can proceed without always having a schematic or a step by step, connect the dots, diagram. Well worth the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVER A MONTH AND HAVE NOT GOT MY BOOK","review":"Over one month and have not got my book!Over one month and have not got my book!Over one month and have not got my book!Over one month and have not got my book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME PHOTOGRAPHY!","review":"you don't have to be into fetish to enjoy this book. higgs' photography is so full of color and fascination...anyone could enjoy it. the women in this book have such mystery to them and they are so beautiful. when i picked this up in a bookstore a few months ago i couldnt put it down. i had it read before it left the store with me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something new every time you open it!","review":"The first time you look through Lee's book, you are so overwhelmed with each image that you can't remember the one you just saw on the previous page! The second time, you begin to choose your favorites. Each time after that, you discover new details in the pictures that reach out to you personally. Local legend has it that one of the images is so controversial that the publisher initially refused to print it. See if you can guess which one it is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"erotic eye candy galore....","review":"Where does one start, I discovered this mans work on the internet...heads and tails above your average erotic fotographers.So very creative with lighting, lenses, processing, poses, costumes, make-up, a complete and totally engrossing style. Besides the obvious....sexy models in incredibly sexy outfits doing amazingly sexy things to eachother and for the camera......this book is so full of visual stimulus and inspiration for any one interested in the pure, raw, erotic beauty that only some of us are lucky enough to experience up close. This book will be an inspiration to me for a long long time.

This album features a more spiritual side of McFerrin not always seen in some of his other works. Great to meditate on in order to--as the album title suggests--provide medicine music for the soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought this book would be better","review":"It wasn't at all what I expected. Author promised it would be \\"extremely funny\\" but it was only mildly amusing. Too many side jokes, but not really any substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy is the gift giver","review":"Already being familiar with the content of these books, I purchased \\"What a Man/Woman Wants\\" and \\"Love Languages\\" (the regular one and the one aimed at men) as a gift for a couple getting married in November. I gave it to them a few weeks before their wedding. They had given away their 'Love Languages' book to someone they knew who was married earlier this year and were very happy to receive a replacement. As for \\"What a Man/Woman Wants,\\" they had heard about it and were excited to receive copies. It made my heart glad to see how happy they were with their presents."},{"rating":"2","title":"great therapy","review":"great therapy for couples old and young. john hagee tells it like it is and if more people would follow these steps, their relationship would prosper for real. it seems kinda corny if you havent been applying these techniques already, but trust me it works, esp. if you want to please your partner. and i really love the way it has the wife and husband part all in one book.it's good, it's goood!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Every Man/Woman Doesn't Want in a Book","review":"Our small group at church decided on this book to use as a study. We will be selecting another book. I couldn't get past the first chapter, as I was trying to see how admitting to \\"femine manipulation\\" and my inate evilness was going to help my marriage. My husband and I have been married for 12 years and counting, because we love God and we love and respect each other. We work as equal partners, not with one in submission to the other. This is a book for the extreme religious right, not those of us with more moderate marital views who are truly looking to love God and love each other, not place blame back with the Orginal Sin for the failings of marriage. I would not recommend this book to anyone. There are many more constructive Christian books out there."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],M={key:0},W={key:1};function R(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",B,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",W,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const N=d(C,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-49690c65"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/8.md","filePath":"quotes/8.md"}'),H={name:"quotes/8.md"},G=Object.assign(H,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(N)]))}});export{j as __pageData,G as default};
