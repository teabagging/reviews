This book has no business being a novel. There simply isn't enough material here for much more than a really good novella. Don't get me wrong. I have read and enjoyed many of King's works. But far too many of them, beginning with this one, are little more than inflated short stories. King is best writing good, short, nasty stories of people doing terrible things to each other, like The Shining, Pet Sematary, Christine, Carrie, Delores Claiborne, etc. His big novels (like Salem's Lot, IT, and the ridiculously overpraised The Stand) soon become predictable, and downright boring. The Dark Half has one or two cool moments, but it is the last King novel I will read, at least until he learns (or remembers) that there is more to writing than filling up paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary?

All original Yoruba divination systems dont just work because of the math equations that mark their results - but because of the presences of Orisa and the sanction of Olodumare - which dominoes do not have. This science is not rooted in Science nor is it a product of the Orisa or Yoruba culture nor is it approved as an alternative by the Orisa. Furthermore the Yoruba divination systems of Opele and Merindinlogun require authorization which can only be gotten by Priestly Initiation. That is even the RIGHT tools will not work unless the Orisa have given the Ase to work them! Simply put - one author's attempt at stealing our money and disrespecting our culture.

It was a struggle to finish, and is a big disappointment"},{"rating":"1","title":"Honus And The Pirates","review":"Well researched. Well written. It just lacked something resembling a solid base hit up the middle. I really enjoyed the history and background on the Pirates. At times I was not sure if the authors were writing a book about Tommy Leach, Fred Clarke, or Honus Wagner. Not until the end did you actually get an appreciation for Honus the man. At that, perhaps you understand why they stuck so closely to developing the story behind the Pirates rather than just Wagner. If that is all that is available about Honus, then the title of the book should have been, HONUS AND THE PIRATES. Good effort, but just another baseball history book with inconsistencies and missing information."},{"rating":"1","title":"a very incomplete picture","review":"One lapse in the DeValerias' work is the preparation of their bibliography, which is incomplete, failing to list many works cited later under chapter sources. An examination of the bibliography, therefore, provides future researchers with a very incomplete picture of the extent of their work. Moreover, they eschew footnotes in favor of a general listing of sources for each chapter. Trying to pinpoint the source of the authors' conclusions or a particular quotation, consequently, is virtually impossible, and weighing the number of sources they used to establish a point even more frustrating. The result is often the impression that a thin foundation of a single quotation or story supports many of the DeValerias' conclusions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flying Dutchman Grounded","review":"If took almost 100 years for us to get Wagner biograhy. Unfortunately, we're still waiting for an effort worthy of the man universally considered the greatest shortstop ever.The main problem with the book is that it gets too bogged down in detail. It goes through tedious information, like his getting three hits in an Iron & Oil League game.Also, there's not enough about what kind of person Wagner was. Generalities are mentioned, but few specifics.In defense of the authors, it would be tough to paint a portrait of a man when there is almost no one left who knew him pesonally. Then again, with such a handicap, they probably shouldn't have tried it in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, no frame","review":"I really like Mayor's books, however, after the first three where the plot was built around someone being framed, I was beginning to lose interest.

Label on the disc was definitely homemade. Picture quality is fuzzy; it may have been copied from a VHS tape. Sound is muffled at times. One scene skipped. Besides that, the storyline is predictable and the acting of the main actress is contrived and horrible. Very much a high school project feeling. Deborah Harry is barely in it and has little to no speaking parts. Alec Baldwin must have been just starting out in his career or suffered through the bad script as a favor to a friend. Even if these actors are your favorites, I would skip this movie and pretend it was never part of their career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Debbie's first film since Videodrome","review":"Debbie Harry of Blondie made a very supporting role in this comedy/murder/drama that was a take off of Desperately Seeking Susan. The comedy is weak and Debbie is in about 10 minutes of the film. She looks great in her Stephen Sprouse outfit, but is lost in a movie that tries to be funny but is not and tries to be suspenseful and is not. A stinker in every aspect. Debbie took this role as she was attempting to make a comeback in the music and movie world after taking time off to care for her then boyfriend Chris Stein. So I guess she thought this might be a funny film. Sadly, it was not and the film was one of the worst of 1987. Notable for the film debut of Alec Baldwin and one of the rare English speaking films for German Hanna Schygulla."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review for The Weight Training Workbook","review":"I am 46 years old and have been lifting weights and working out for most of my life.

The pages have plenty of lines to accomodate exercises performed that day, plus 6 columns that allow you to note 6 different sets and reps for each exercise. The book also contains some blank charts that you can fill in with any informaton you may want to track, i.e., increase in poundage on a certain lift, your body weight, inches gained in size, etc. The author also gives you some suggested routines to do, plus tells you which exercises benefit which parts of your body.

Very annoying organ work by Milt Herth.

The company started issuing classic jazz recordings in 1989, and continued releasing new CDs until its bankruptcy in 2004. (The label, with a catalog of nearly 1000 albums, was distributed by a new owner until 2008.)Issuing recordings in chronological order can have its pitfalls. Here, all but 4 of the 25 selections feature the Hammond organ playing of Milt Herth. Sadly, the organ largely drowns out the piano work of Smith. Moreover, Herth's organ work will have little appeal to most modern ears.There are four excellent Smith tracks without organ. But, only the most dedicated of Willie Smith completists would spend money AND listen to the complete CD. The CD might appeal more to those interested in the early history of the Hammond organ in jazz; and those people should search out the organ work of Fats Waller as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh.. this is bad.","review":"These are not the original recordings. In fact, I don't even recognize the main vocalist. This CD sounds like a colection of bad 70's covers (Rod Stewart, Billy Joel, Stevie Wonder) and remakes of The Association's biggest hits from the 60's, all done by some bad wedding band from the 80's! All of the songs sound too polished and overproduced ... none of those great gritty 60's AM hits I remember so fondly from my youth. I should have gone with The Association's original Greatest Hits from 1968 now on CD. This one is heading for the trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst CD I've Ever Purchased","review":"A powerful statement, but I'm totally dissatisfied with this CD.

As you may have guessed, I'm left-handed. Most people don't realize how many products are designed for righties and the challenges this presents for lefties. The asymmetry on this isn't so severe that I won't be able to use it, largely because it is so small. The \\"D\\" shape described in the product info isn't quite accurate, there is a ridge running down the right side of the handle, designed to fit in the crease of your hand. That ridge hits the middle of my thumb when I hold the knife in my left hand.This knife is great, but I won't be able to get a larger version unless they do away with the \\"D-shaped Pakkawood handle; comfortable offset steel bolster\\" or make a left-handed version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharp, Sharp, Sharp!!!","review":"If you want an excellent knife, this is it.

As a young Asian female I felt offended by the heinous images brought to mind and I will no longer be purchasing this authors work.

A def. must have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"over rated","review":"I agree with the NY reader - a waste of time. I waited on the library reserve list for months and was very disappointed. The characters are not well developed and the writing is amateurish. I did finish it because I was curious about how it could get such rave reviews but found it a 'women's' book. The \\"holy whatever\\" comments of one character were idiotic. Can't fathom how anyone could say it's the best book they ever read.For a good read try Alison McGee's Shadow Baby, Losing Julia, or Peace Like a River."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enormous waste of time","review":"When I read House of Curl I thought that while I didn't care for it all that much, this author has potential - I will try something else she's written. Bad idea: AHEB sucked wayyyy worse than House of Curl, and for many, many reasons:- Characters are one-dimensional and beyond stereotypical- More cliches per written page than I have ever encountered- Men are bad, unless they're gay or at least effeminate- Insulting to politically conservative readers- Characters make many stupid life choices which get neatly straightened out- 200 pages too long to read such drivel- Far too many \\"who-cares\\" subplots- Simplistic style of writingOne thing I learned from AHEB: Never pick up another book by this author again."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best \\"sisterhood\\" books out there!!! Brilliant!","review":"I selected this book because it had a appealing look to it and an attractive storyline about the sisterhood of 6 unlikely friends who form a bookclub to escape the cold and isolation of a northern Minnesota winter. Besides discussing books, they end up helping each other through some very difficult life situations and burdens.I enjoyed this book so much that I was inspired to read all the others this author has written. They were all wonderful, although this remains my favorite of hers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite, Predictable & Trite","review":"Cliche, Predictable & TritePoorly developed characters are thrown together with a 'book club' tacked on I could not relate to any of the persons in this book, male or female. Sappy names like Merit, Slip and Faith-all on the same street- and a host of stereotypical situations insulted my intelligence as a reader. The flashbacks are even worse than the present. I found myself not caring about the characters, and didn't care for how men were portrayed. Personal interaction seemed superficial. Try the Jane Austen Book Club instead. It was much more successful in tackleing the easy plane ride/beach read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want to live on Freesia Court....","review":"This is a true novel of friendship that made me laugh and cry. If you have true friends in your life like these characters then you will cherish this book. If not then envy the characters as I do. Oh well, I guess it is never too late to start a book club. I would have liked to see a little more discussion about the books they read, but that didn't deter from the enjoyment of this book. I enjoyed following the friends through thier trials and tribulations.This was my first novel by Lorna Landvik. I will definately read her again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made me want to form a book club!","review":"Amazing characters! I could not put this book down.

I am thoroughly enjoying this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story of friendship","review":"Don't let the name fool you, this is an outstanding book...maybe one of my favorites. I love the premise of the book, friends start their own book club as an escape. I really enjoyed how the story was told from each character's point of view and really grew to love them. They went through so many things together and with their spouses and kids. By the end of the book I was tearing up. I would read this again and have already recommeded it to others...shoot I'll probably read some of the books they read in their club :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"That this book was published gives hope to us all","review":"I won't repeat the comments already stated, though I'm not sure why some readers bothered mentioning the author's hatred of all things Republican -- a minor point at such a time -- but I will say that it was somewhere in mid-book that I realized how utterly bad this novel was. In every crisis the characters sailed smoothly through and at times benefited heavily. Who would have thought chemotherapy could improve your looks? The author didn't even have the guts to kill off one the characters. But by then we knew she had no backbone, relying as she did on the old trite metaphors and clich��s of the ages with no irony to cut the sappiness. But I said I would not repeat what others have written. I'll just say this: having written trite myself, I can smell it when I read it. This book makes me rethink all those stories I've squirreled away out of embarrassment. Perhaps I should put them all together and publish them for book clubs across America.Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite Tripe","review":"Okay, so I was sucked in by the title. I thought this would be a fun read. I wouldn't even put this on a \\"beach read\\" list. It's everything you'd expect from a \\"chick lit\\" book but a lot less."},{"rating":"2","title":"a MUST READ kinda of book!!!!","review":"I enjoyed this book from beginning to end.Begins and ends in the present, however this book goes back in time and follows the lives of 5 women neighbors and their close friendship through the decades. They form a book club and every chapter centers around a book selection.It's only March but it will be one of my top reads for 2003 already!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Title almost scared me away!","review":"I almost didn't read this book because the title seemed silly. But it was one of the best books I've read recently! The story is about five women who live in Minneapolis. They don't seem to have much in common, but they are neighbors. After discovering that they all love to read, they start a book club. This story takes the women over a thirty-year period of time. They read scores of books, but that's not what this book is really about. It's about the women themselves. As they become better friends, their \\"masks\\" start to peel off, a tiny layer at a time. There's not a main character that I didn't like. It was realistic, touching, thought-provoking and funny -- extremely entertaining. The characters were very well developed. A great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Her others are better","review":"I love all her books, except this one. It is a great premise, it just needs unity. Maybe like the previous person said, it probably just needed some additional editing to make it as good as her others. Knowing that she can do better, I am looking forward to her next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Congratulations to Lorna!","review":"Fans of Lorna Landvik will adore this book. Those who haven't read her previous four novels will discover a writer who makes you laugh and cry at the same time. My criteria for a good read.In Angry Housewives Eating Bon Bons Landvik has crafted a novel of wonderful characters full of depth who you care about. Landvik's vast knowledge of popular culture takes us from the late sixties into the nineties in a jouney that is both funny and sad but ultimately uplifing. Watching these friends go through life and their book club together is a wonderful journey that shouldn't be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche City!","review":"There were more cliches in this book than I can even count. I'm giving this book 2 stars instead of 1 just because it was amazing how the author could remember so many."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Club selection - only 2 readers enjoyed","review":"I belong to a book club and this was chosen. Only two of our readers liked this book. The two that liked it are the two that rarely finish books. I think this book is good if you want a quick read that doesn't require much thought. If you like books that really challenge the reader and fully develop characters and plot, don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a perfect combo!","review":"What more could you ask for? Best of friends and books! These five need to move on my block! I loved being a part of their world on Freesia Court and hated to leave. This book touched every subject, and everything was just in the right amounts. Many times I laughed outloud, only to have to explain why I was laughing!I loved the timespan on the book, she covered many years in such a short time. Lorna Landvik is an author to put on your favorites list!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Loved this book!!!!!!!","review":"I got hooked on Angry Housewivees from page 1! I related to the girlfriend intamacy, being there for one another throughout the years. I think this book touched upon very real life issues that we all face throughout our lives.. the trials and tribulations of marriage,divorce, raising kids, aging, illness,career changes and everything else life throws at us.These friends supported each other through thick and thin and as I read the book, I got involved with each and every one of them. I am lucky enough to be part of a group of friends similar to these girls and I called every one of them to read this book. I know they will all enjoy it as much as I did.I read Saving Graces and loved it, as well as Patty Janes House of Curl but I felt this was the best yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angry Housewives.....book too many (of these).","review":"I did like the story line but there were too many parentheisis (of these) in the book making the reader get frustrated because by the time you would read a sentence or a paragraph, there would be another (of these) parentheisis that would throw you off the story line. It would be a good book if the author would concentrate more on the story line instead of adding more (of these) and making the story too frustrating and not smooth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Readers","review":"It was a shallow novel about paper doll women who don't exist in the real world, at least our world. This author has obviosly not spent any time researching domestic violence or interracial relationships because none of these characters faced real problems that these issues bring into one's life. We kept waiting for the author to develop a character, and in 400 pages she never did. This proud soccer mom only seemed to be right on in naming the chapters of this book, since our book club was able to salvage some titles of future reads. 'Angry Housewives' ! Where did the title come from? What were they angry about? The author didn't even tell us what happened to Slip. The book was so sugary that the author didn't have the guts to but finality to it. This book only managed to make us angry that we chose this book as this month's selection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angry Housewives Eating BonBons","review":"Pointless dribble. This book went on and on about nothing. The characters were canned and the plot was empty. Just another off-the-shelf book about friends. Nothing special."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Landvik book and I'm here looking for more!","review":"One of the best \\"woman's\\" fiction real life books! You KNOW these women, you are these women, you want to be (in some cases) these women. Can't wait to read more of this authors books. Hope they are all as good as this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good tell of friendship among women","review":"I listened to the audio (16 CDs) wow! I think this story really built with the growth of the characters but think it could have been shortened a little without lossing to much of the body of the whole thing. I also did not care for the ending, but that's just me, I like endings that tie everything up in a nice neat package. If you like stories dealing with friendship and life experiences then this is the book for you, recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"heartfelt, powerful, convincing!","review":"I found Landvik's \\"Angry Housewives\\" to be funny, enlightening, charming, and real. It is a story of lifelong friends and how their lives and relationships change over the decades.Landvik did an excellent job developing each character, and portraying their relationships with one another. From the beginning, the reader is engaged and all the through to the end, the stories of each characters' lives are moving, convincing, and heartfelt. This is a book you won't want to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silly man, this book is for women!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Yes, the characters were somewhat stereotypical, and I agree that the kids were a little too perfect, but that woman-hating man's review is much too harsh (why did he give it so many stars if he hated it so much?). My advice to him: Stick with Earnest Hemingway and browsing your Cabela's catalog - hands off the women's books, 'cause you could never understand. Angry Housewives was fun to read and the chapter titles were a stroke of genius - made me want to read all those books I've missed, and also made me long for a close group of friends who enjoy reading as much as I do...so hard to find these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored reader needs a good book!","review":"Trite, silly, sophomoric! This choice was a summer book club selection and so I plowed through it. It is easy to read because it is simplistic and predictable. The 5 women who form this book club would be about my mother's age and they live in the Twin Cities - a place I know very well having grown up in the midwest. So I thought those 2 things might be a hook into the book, but that was a mistake. I did remember (and read) many of the books mentioned in this story - however, there was rarely a thought-provoking connection between the title being read and the actual story being told."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the time","review":"I really was hooked into this story from the beginning. I don't understand some of the poor reviews. I really enjoyed getting to know the housewives and their families. I enjoyed very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book For A Cruise!!","review":"Someone highly recommended this book, I purchased it and it sat ignored on my bookshelf. Left for a cruise and picked up a couple of neglected books and fell into this one immediately. I did make a sort of little spreadsheet to remind me which character was married to the pilot, had twins, etc. etc. but after awhile, you knew and loved each character. I hated getting off the boat for various excursions, leaving the characters of this book club in the stateroom - it is that good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, light beach read...not heavy literature","review":"A fun, beach-read kind of book, \\"Angry Housewives\\" is a quick dip into three decades of a singularly loyal book club. No, it's not thoroughly realistic (where can you find a cul-de-sac populated by 5 close friends, all of whom stay put for 30 years?) but it's fun to pretend for a while.The comments on each meeting's chosen book are entertaining but sparse; the focus here is on the women themselves and their growth from the time of Bobby Kennedy and Mirabel Morgan to the present day. And what stories these women have!Go ahead, suspend your disbelief, and drop in on the neighbors of Freesia Court. You'll enjoy your stay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"I'm shocked to see how many people have given this book 5 stars, it's a travesty. Maybe it's the candy-coated lifestyle she's portrayed that appeals so much, not the book itself. The writing is syrupy and so desperate to paint a perfect chocolate-box picture that not a single detail is left to the reader's imagination. With better editing this book could've been half as long and twice as readable. I'd agree Angry Housewives is very similar to the Ya Ya Sisterhood, but it's difficult to say which is worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Story","review":"I just finished this book. I loved every single page of it! I could hardly put it down. This is the first novel I have read by Lorna Landvik and now I have ordered 3 more from Amazon.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"CANNOT PUT DOWN!!","review":"Don't let the cutsy title keep you away from this book. I wish I could give \\"Angry Housewives...\\" more stars than I'm allowed to give. It is definitely a 10-star book. I promise you will laugh out loud, cry, then laugh again. A wonderful and powerful book about the deep friendship of the wives of Freesia Court. Not just another \\"chick\\" book; it's much more than that. Reading is believing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too long for a chick-lit!","review":"Sometimes, I like fluff and I like light reads. This book fit the criteria, but I can only take fluff for so long. The book is WAY too long. It tries to deal with too many serious issues, but only manages to do it superficially. The points of view change every chapter, which was a bit annoying (a new point of view will be introduced near the end of the book, which felt silly to me). And I had a tough time keeping track of time, despite the year stamped on every chapter - there are jumps that spanned months to years in between chapters and I had a hard time figuring out characters' ages (especially the children). The women are also very stereotypical, especially if you watch \\"Sex in the City\\" or \\"Desperate Housewives.\\" This type of story has been done before, and unfortunately it has been done better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful novel of friendship","review":"I accidentally found this book while browsing the bookshelves at the book store. Thought it looked fun but did not expect it to affect me the way that it did. It is one of my all time favorite novels! It tells the story of neighborhood women in a book club. Each chapter tells the stories of their lives from a different main character's viewpoint. Hated to see this book end and I have recommended it to every woman I know that loves to read. Everyone agrees with me that it is the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This was fun","review":"After reading all the good reviews I figured I would give this book a try. I was skeptical since this is not the \\"type\\" of book I normally read, but the story and the character development were great. Makes me wish I had my own book club to be a part of. Read this book, it's fun and entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"The world's most perfect children","review":"Perhaps Lorna Landvik is not a parent so she doesn't realize that no group of children is as perfect as the Freesia Court children. Julia is biracial and adopted and floats thru life until she has a minor setback at 27. Bonnie is brilliant and apparently never talks back to her mother. Merit's girls are beautiful, talented, etc. and seem to suffer no problems due to the relationship of their parents. Even Beau is movie star handsome and finds the ideal mate. One of Audrey's sons does get into a little trouble, but it is not dealt with in this book. The husbands are either wonderful or horrible. There is no middle ground and no working through the ordinary problems that most couples face. These are all two dimensional characters and about as interesting as wallpaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching drama about homemaking, friendship, marriage, growth","review":"Landvik has a great \\"hook\\" with the title of her novel, which also happens to be the name of the book club which the five friends in this novel participate in. I picked this book up based solely on the title and the Ballantine Reader's Circle logo. Ballantine does not disppoint, delivering another book that is perfect for book club discussions and perfect for anyone who enjoys a good tale about friendship, family life, and growth. If you enjoy this book, check out the work of Fannie Flagg, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The YaYas go to the North Woods? Uffda!","review":"Angry Housewives Eating Bon Bons is a delightful and inspirational chronicle of the Freesia Court neighborhood Book Club: the reading list is well worth the price of the book, but the unfolding of their friendships through three decades of family life is a rocky, joyous, richly layered, sometimes tearful ride. Well written with believable characters and a lovely sense of place.If the YaYas were to go the North Woods they would throughly enjoy the Angry Housewives!Uffda! Mamalinda"},{"rating":"1","title":"Angry Housewives Eating Bomb Bombs","review":"I am so disappointed. My sister had recommended this book to me.I had expected the wives to be original characters who rang true, but they seemed to be amateurishly drawn, articificial and stereotypical - the earth mother Kari, the beautiful but battered doormat Merit,the saintly gay (gasp!) men, and worst of all the insufferable shrill self-righteous revolutionary prig Slip. I won't put up with political commentary snuck into a novel by Stephen King, a much more skilled writer; I'll be damned if I'll put up with it from Ms. Landvik.If you're a Republican or remotely conservative in your political orientation, prepare to be insulted and sterotyped in print in this novel.I can't understand for the life of me why writers of pop fiction would want to needlessly offend a potential fan; it's just bad business.I feel so cheated :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Angry Housewives Eating Bon Bons","review":"Paper back looks very old and dirty with age.

I found reviews online claiming this product sent many animals to the hospital with the same symptoms ours had. I would stay away from this product because it makes your animals sick. Plus you can't touch them for a few days after the application due to the sticky residue and it's hard to stay away from them when they want attention.

I was excited to start the book. It won a feakin' Hugo Award. It must be good. Right?NOT! The writing is horrible. The story is told in such a confusing manner that I really never made a connection with anyone and those that I ran into more than once, I could care less about. The story starts with an explanation of the universe, which is vague and far too long. Then in Chapter 2 the action starts and NOTHING IS EVER EXPLAINED AGAIN! The action consists of people walking to and from meetings and talking mostly about insignificant items. Please, someone explain to me how this piece of trash won a Hugo? Was everything else that year that bad? This was the era where Heinlein, Clarke, Pohl, Williamson, and Assimov were still actively writing. And this won a Hugo?I stopped after 160 pages and put myself out of my misery and moved on to the latest Varley novel, which was a breath of fresh air."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I slogged thru half of this book before shelving it.

It felt like this book went on forever and nothing happened. The universe it's set in is fairly interesting, but the characters and their plight just did noting for me. The main characters came off as whiny and entirely unlikable no matter if they were set up as the good or bad guys. It jumped around too much and was tough to keep straight.

It takes the author about 200 pages to set the environment. 200 Pages of introducing people, their alignments, and describing the war situation. Yet it remains unclear why two factions fight a futile war instead of simply sharing profit. After this the story unfolds with some interesting intrigues and a lot of action, for the next 200 pages. This is the best part of the book. At the end the author wants too much. Too many solutions suddenly pop up. The result is a chaotic finale with people changing sides, ending in an imaginary status quo.

They take place in England during the 2nd world war. Foyal (Michael Kitchen)plays the head detective in solving various types of crimes from stealing war materials to resell them to solving murders. The first four sets have four disks each, set five only has three disks. My wife and I watched all 19 disks together and we both enjoyed them very much. I loaned them to my son and he has been watching them also. He said he also thought they were very good. The disks can be watched in any order, but I think it is slightly better watching them in order. Toward the start of each disk there is a date showing when it takes place starting May 1940 and going through May 1945."},{"rating":"2","title":"Foyle's War series 5 well worth it","review":"This set provides a great conclusion of the series.All the ends are brought together for a satisfactory conclusion and leaves one with the hope that someday there will be a follow-up series with the recently promoted Sgt Milner leading a new series of cases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice finish to great series . . .","review":"Nice finish to a great series - I own all 5 sets - from an admitted WWII history buff . . . born in a northern German bomb shelter on a gray, overcast Saturday afternoon, there courtesy of the 8th Army Airforce . . . but enough about me.This BBC series' main character, DCS Foyle, defines Michael Kitchen for me . . . can't think of anyone else in that role. Well written episodes that detail the \\"civilian\\" side of a country at war and with nice continuity kept from the first episode to the last by keeping the three main actors - Foyle, his right-hand man and his driver - the same throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"No longer subtitled","review":"I'm wondering who the genius was who decided to do away with subtitles after the first 4 sets of this wonderful show. All of the previous sets were subtitled. Now, all of a sudden, set 5 comes only closed captioned. Closed captioning does not work on modern tv/dvd player combinations. The only thing that works is subtitling. I have really been looking forward to the continuation of this series and was so excited when set 5 came out I bought it without checking it out thoroughly. I think it was a reasonable assumption that since the first 4 sets were subtitled that this and set 6 would be. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Foyle's War-set 5","review":"My husband and I have loved the Foyle's War series and own most of them. Well written and acted series. We enjoyed this one, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of best of British series","review":"Love Foyle's War series. Michael Kitchen is one of my favorite actors and he is superb in this role. I am just sorry there will be no more new seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"great stuff","review":"The Foyle character, as he is presented, is one of the best in the English detective genre. It's too bad that there are not people, or more people, in the world who are not as straight talking and to the point as Foyle. Interesting as well are the apparently unconnected story lines outside the murder(s) giving the appearance of true life as it goes on in the midst of dramatic events. Watching these episodes is sheer pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five stars, but the series ends oddly","review":"Great stuff, as usual. By all means, buy. I did, and am very pleased. But I must remark that just three segments to this Part 5, while outstanding, seemed quite skimpy compared to the other parts. Not their quality, but just that there were only three. The others parts had five per segment, I recall. Then, when you see comments about the ending of the series in the special features by two of the three players, it makes me wonder if maybe Michael Kitchen was the one that said, \\"enough.\\" I own all five parts, happily. Each slowly covers the years. However, Part 5 seems to me to jump out of nowhere from 1944 to May 1945 almost overnight. Hey! What happened to the rest of 1944? Somebody must've pushed it to end, so they threw in the concluding episode rashly. I think it was Kitchen that pushed. Anybody know?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too few episodes","review":"Every episode of Foyle's war was outstanding. I am old enough to remember WWII from America. I had no idea what it was like in the UK. Now I have seen a little bit of what life was like on a day to day basis. The plots are realistic and portray the times.The great sadness is that there were only nineteen episodes. I could happily watch nineteen more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank You, Acorn","review":"Loved Foyle's War. Leave it to Acorn to once again take advantage of the fans.

Belle du Berry, the main vocalist is a true master of the new bossa nova . Her mellow, beautiful voice expresses the soft sensuality of this typically brazilian musical form , with a touch of gallic humor in the french lyrics.She is backed by talented musicians, who know all about the \\"right chords\\".The album also contains tracks strangely reminiscent of klezmer music,and of the Stephane Grappelli style of violin playing.In today's soft music scene,Belle du Berry is only matchedby Celso Fonseca(who sings bossa nova in portuguese and english).Both are true HEIRS to the old masters of that genre: Tom Jobim,Joao Gilberto, Vinicius de Moraes and Toquinho.This is an all-round BRILLIANT CD, and a testimony to french musicality and good taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gnome love","review":"I wanted something different to show my Cornhuskers pride besides the flags or doormats I see everywhere.

We watched it but missed over half the dialogue. For a recent series like this, I do not understand why the close captioning is missing and why they reinstituted it the following season. Very disappointing when one relies this and all of a sudden it isn't there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed that there was no closed captioning","review":"I watched all of the first four episodes. The closed captioning feature of all of these disks was extremely important to my being able to follow the storyline. With the British accents and the fact that I view it while working out on a treadmill, the lack of closed captioning pretty much made this set worthless to me. I could not follow the stories without it. I cannot possibly understand why a company would include closed captioning for part of a series and then discontinue it."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK but really the essential George","review":"I like the actors and suppose that it is all right to go on trying to copy the real stories of Elizabeth George. But not good enough compared to the real thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love this series, but can't they spring for closed captions?","review":"I love this series. I have all previous 4 sets (they are all closed captioned). This set however is not closed captioned. The stories are great as always. The only negative thing I have to say is: come on add those closed captions for those of us who have difficulty hearing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the close captioning?","review":"I bought the first 3 seasons together in a box set and they were captioned, then the 4th season, it too was captioned. The 5th season was released by the same company and amazon didn't really say it was or wasn't. I like the series so I bought it. I was very disappointed that there was no caption on this set. A suggestion to Amazon, please list whether a DVD is captioned or not. It may not seem like a big deal but it is to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheated","review":"I feel cheated. All the earlier sets of this work were close captioned. So I happily bought this. It is not cc, so my money was wasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"The Inspector Lynley Series are one of the best mystery shows to come over from the UK. The acting is top notch and the stories are way above average. Each season as been better than the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Also cheated","review":"I, too, was cheated. Owning all previous series, I neglected to check for close captioning before purchasing. I am hearing impaired, even with hearing aids, and have difficulty understanding the British accents, relying on captioning to enjoy the DVDs.Continuing to buy the series, though the writers decided they could improve on Elizabeth George's plots, I enjoyed the characters though the plots suffered. Without captioning, this will be the last that I purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"British mystery at its finest!","review":"It is hard to imagine not being glued to the telly when watching an Inspector Lynley mystery. He is amazing and with out his side kick it would not be the same. They are the typical mysteries we have come to expect from the British. Complicated and complex to the end. Not since Inspector Morse has there been such a duo that is so intertwined in and outside the mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lynley's self-destruction gets old","review":"Haver's real struggles with singlehood & job were interesting, but now the show is all Lynley with long hair and a childish snobby inability to connect. He's a sad widdle boy. Crime plots are about the same: dysfunctional English families murdering each other using archaic methods (a good old head-bonk with a shovel) -- oh my! Still better than most stuff on TV, but in the end you don't really care which unintelligible villager did it."},{"rating":"1","title":"huh? she married a ghost","review":"welp what it boils down to is either she married an imaginary friend that no one could see, and if so, how could she just go to this woman's house and walk in that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT are you KIDDING ME???? I PAID for THIS?","review":"No sense from beginning to end. Worthless, and two bucks for my twenty six minutes of wasted life. Do NOT bother watching this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"First of all, it really is 26 minutes long.Second, the ridiculousness of what happens, and the nonchalant feedback by the characters made me ask, \\"Am I the only one who just saw that?\\" Then, at the end of the movie, I'm asking, \\"What just happened?\\" It was like an unfinished Hitchcock show that nobody has enough information to make sense of. I'm like, was she the mother or the wife? Was he dead or alive?Which character is crazy, the man or the woman, or me for having watched the movie!?! It was awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"A 26 minute Twilight Zone episode","review":"When I rented this movie, I didn't notice that the run time was only 26 minutes.....no wonder it carried only a $2 rental price! The acting and production values were fine, but the story is, well, another story. Rather than laden this review with spoilers, suffice it to say that if you regularly watched The Twilight Zone, you've seen this plot and plot-twist a dozen times. So between the run time and the trite storyline, even at $2 it is over priced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made no sense!","review":"Ridiculous movie! It made no sense and was not worth the $1.99 we paid for it! Very odd considering all the awards it supposedly received."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummm, not a movie","review":"You cannot call something that is 26 minutes a movie. That is barely sitcom length. They have brass balls charging anyone to watch this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse then a B Movie","review":"Sorry, this was a sad attemp to a a scary movie. I'm surprised they asked $1.99 for it. It should be free or not even offered. Disappointed. Bad writing, bad acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great short film","review":"I highly recommend this short film. It is absolutely a must see.

So, while Taubman tries to make the most of his prosaic material, the book frankly could have been made a lot shorter.Hence the two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't believe I've read a 700p book about Krushchev...","review":"...and praising it to the skies! And I don't usually read political biographies, but Krushchev was the Big Bad Guy of my generation, a peasant with a big mole and a fourth grade education (!! - did I ever know that before? If so, I'd forgotten!) who pushed his face up against America's image and banged his shoe on the table at the UN. Talk about a 'character!' So I dove into the book with what I hope was an open mind. Yeah, it's really long, and yeah, there were a few places where I skimmed, but mostly I devoured it with wide eyes.Taubman manages to put a human face on a poorly-understood, highly-complex figure of Russian-American history."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good follow up to Bleed !","review":"The first Angel Dust album, Border of Reality was horrible. It was a breakthrough album, and there was much room for improvement. And improve they did!! The next album, Bleed, is their best ever!! Enlighten the Darkness is awesome!!! Almost as good, and practically as good. It's not quite as dark, but it's got the metal. I miss the keyboards on Bleed a bit. But, they're on the right track here! Helloween has died (my former favorite band for over 10 years), and Angel Dust is my new champ!German metal rocks!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlighten The Darkness","review":"This album doesn't start out as well as Bleed, but it is still acceptional! Anyone into power metal has to listen to Angel Dust! They are a heavier version of Dio, which makes their cover of Temple of the King (which is on Bleed) quite fitting! Check them out; you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GET TO THE POINT OF NO RETURN","review":"This book is life changing if you are just getting into leadership, or have been in leadership. The teaching is fanstastic and Rick Renner is right on in every point of his book. After reading it, I am at the point of no return myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use, covers a lot of material, inexpensive","review":"This easy-to-use reference shows how the words are built, with things like verb endings, infixes, suffixes. It's small, but it has a lot of useful material; for the price it's OUTSTANDING.The SECOND edition is completely revised, by a different author (excellent teaching credentials), vastly more material -- both more gramatical info, and a wealth of additional vocabulary, plus there is also a Quechua-English section as well as English-Quechua, making it an even more valuable reference.Some things are perhaps because Lonely Planet has standardized them -- I doubt you'll be asking anyone for a date in Quechua -- but it's still material to practice breaking apart the pieces.I love the illustrations!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"I found the booklet difficult to use. It may be a good start, but clearer instruction needs to be presented up front. For example, it needs to be plainly stated that pronunciation is as in Spanish. Also, instead of dribbling out the suffixes throughout the book, a simple suffix conjugation table that hit the main suffix uses would be much more helpful. I can use the book, but I'll be looking for better one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kirkland!","review":"I don't know why I didn't read this terrific book ten years ago. It's a very good buy and I'd buy from this seller again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Either it was the broken heater in my apartment that always kept it around a cool 98 degrees or the long, detailed, and pointless descriptions in this book that made me fall asleep after two pages of reading. You decide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality problem","review":"I purchased three of these for my night diving lights. They seem to be heavy duty construction. But, there is a lot of inconsistency in the production quality of the brass snap bolts. Two of the three had sharp edges, one of which cut my thumb when I first tried to open the snap. One of the snaps took a lot of working to get it to slide easily. I had to file down the sharp edges to make them safe for use in the water. The manufacturer should have checked these parts before assembly, or at least before shipping to customers, which makes me suspicious about the long term durability of the product, specifically where the phone cord is mounted to the nylon strap (which looks kind of cheezy). As expensive as dive lights are, I'm not sure I'm willing to risk losing one with these lanyards. The lanyards aren't worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written book on the subject","review":"I looks much like the previous book she wrote. I would like to have seen more details on the research and the production of the probiotics. The first part is devoted to the digestive system,nutrition, microbiology and probiotic supplements. She focusses on the quality of the probiotics available. The second part is about treating disorders with probiotics. Not only gasto-intestinal disorders are discussed. It's an easy to read book on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"not completely unbiased information,still some good info","review":"The author outlines some theories and applications about probiotics that can be applicable to a broad range of diseases.She provided a section called picking the best probiotic supplements. In this section the book centers around her own products without explicitly saying so.For example she says buy a product without fos in an oil matrix carrier thats approved by this and this agency knowing quite well that only her own brand name product follows all those specifications.Trenev why not just go out and say it \\"buy natren my product is the best\\".A little deceptive in my opinion.Nevertheless this book is cheap and provides the layman with some good info to get started on a probiotic regimen.This book is somewhat outdated but there are little if any other major books on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Personal Overview of The Awesome Early Days","review":"I really liked the personal and intimate commentaries by some of the early NASA astronaut veterans. I enjoyed seeing and hearing Alan Shepard, John Glenn, Jim Lovell, Frank Borman, Buzz Aldrin and Gene Cernan to name just a few. Also, thought the overview of Project Mercury through Apollo was very insightful and educational.The VHS video and sound quality is excellent, but, still would love to own a DVD copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moon Shot BEST documentary of Moon Mission","review":"There are many documentaries made of the United States mission and race to the moon. Turner Broadcasting developed this special for the 25th anniversary of the moon landing. This production interviews the original surviving Mercury astronauts and all other astronauts who helped get us to the surface.It is told from the perspective of Deke Slayton. He passed away during the making of the series, so Barry Corbin (who played the astronaut on Northern Exposure) narrates it with humor and warmth.This is the untold story from the men who were there. Footage of astronaut testing, Russian films, and interviews make you relive the feeling of our accomplishment all over again.It's the most entertaining four hours, and you will feel a sense of awe and pride with the courage and determination of the people involved.This should really be made into a DVD, as I have nearly worn out my original VHS copy.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding spaceflight documentary should be put on a DVD.","review":"Moonshot is the best NASA documentary ever and gives a thorough,and personal,history of 1960s spaceflight from Mercury to Gemini to the Apollo Moon landings.It is told by the astronauts themselves and features unique footage of President Kennedy visiting the base.It also tells some stories that I had not seen before,such as Coopers emergency landing when systems shut down in his Mercury capsule.The Moonshot documentary gives us our moneys worth by going for 3 hours and 12 minutes of very interesting NASA history.How about a DVD version? This superb documentary deserves one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"Real\\" Stuff! ... But where's the DVD?","review":"Based on the book, MOONSHOT (ISBN: 1878685546), by Alan Shepard and Deke Slayton (two members of the \\"Mercury Seven\\"), this insightful and educating documentary originally aired on TBS (as a mini-series) in 1995. Covering NASA's early manned space programs from Mercury through Apollo, this series provides a plethora of archived video footage, recent interviews and colorful commentary by Barry Corbin (the obnoxious, redneck general in the movie, WAR GAMES). Aside from Spacecraft Films' digitally remastered archived footage on DVD, this series provides the most comprehensive, albeit compact, overview of how the American space program began and progressed throughout the height of the Cold War.Unfortunately, this series is not currently available on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely passable - sound is off","review":"Wow. I got this DVD to avoid having to pay for shipping on an order. I do love Popeye - especially the old ones where he talks a lot without moving his lips - the funniest parts in the old toons are when he did that.This DVD looks like some kind of illegally made disc from Taiwan or China. It has 8 episodes on it - all from various times in the Popeye history. Most are pretty weak. ALL of them have a problem with the sound: The sound is delayed a good 3-4 seconds from what you see on screen. It's utterly annoying. I just had this on in the background one day while doing chores, but if you were hoping to actually watch it - forget it. The sound issue is pretty bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mythical Indians Who Never Were.","review":"\\"The Invented Indian\\" is a brilliant dissection of the myths that have been so widely circulated by Indians and their apologists. Trading on their supposed past victimization, Indians--like other minorities--have used the power of guilt and smear to gain socio/political and economic spoils from brow-beaten whites. Veteran anthropologist James Clifton is to be congratulated for bravely stepping aside the unwritten rules on how to talk about minorities in general, and Indians in particular by exposing these myths."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly researched and full of inaccuracies.","review":"As an academic specializing in Latin American business, I have frequent contact with senior managers, politicians, and other academics in Mexico and throughout Latin America. As such, the inaccuracies in this book are plainly evident, and there are many. For a contemporary understanding of Mexico, I would instead recommend Bordering on Chaos by Andres Oppenheimer. An excellent introduction to Mexico's Colonial and Revolutionary history can be found in Blood Drenched Altars by Francis C. Kelley.

The bags had a solid metal structure, light but strong. Had plenty of storage sections on the outside. The top had a drawstring to torque it closed, the the very top flap snapped over and down, meaning no water could get in during rain. It would have to be submerged to get stuff inside wet.Adjustable back height made it fit much better for my wife, she is 5'6. I am 6'3, so we ordered the 4000 series for me, also a good pack.She had it fully loaded and the shoulder straps plus the hip straps really helped spread the weight, we had several days with miles of hiking and she was able to carry it with little to no issue.Both packs were in great shape AFTER our trip and we will get years more use out of them.Also, if you pack if full, wear it around a while and beat on it, the material will stretch and you can fit more stuff inside it, you just need to stretch out the material when new from factory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bag for price","review":"I purchased this bag a couple of weeks ago and used it for my 10 mile overnight trip on a part of AT.

There are lots of pockets and areas to tie up what won't fit in the pack. The pack is super comfortable once you get down the correct way to pack it. The rainfly works great as well. There are much lighter packs out there, but if you aren't trying to go ultralight this is a good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pack","review":"I took the Scout 3400 on an overnight backpacking trip and was pleased with it:+ 3L water bladder fit nicely in the inner pocket+ Separate compartment for sleeping bag made for easy access without dumping everything out+ Compression straps on the front served nicely to hold my sleeping pad in place+ 1L Nalgene bottle fit perfectly in side pocketVery, very happy with this pack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Backpack","review":"A lot bigger than I expected.

Over night trips to week long trips. I did have the top bungie strap break, but I'm not that gentle with my camping stuff either. I've been able to fit everything I need in it, even on a week trip with a bear canister and fishing pole. For its price, it's a nice pack.

It's my 1st true hiking bag so I really didn't know what to shop for but it seemed a bit uncomfortable at first and when I finally got it situated a strap broke. This made my 13 mile hike in-to, then out-of, Havasupai Falls a little uncomfortable.The straps across the chest didn't stay on very well so I was constantly having to re-attach them until the clip, (that holds them to the shoulder strap) broke. Very frustrating because I have a normal Burton Back pack that I've used before and have had no problems with. I bought this bag because I was staying more that 2 nights. I guess if you want to spend the extra cash, buy the newer model or just make sure you know what your shopping for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value, durable","review":"Got this pack for short trail side camping trips and because I travel for business (international and domestic dams) to semi-remote areas and needed something I could carry easily and not worry about when I chucked it in the back of a pickup in the rain and mud.Despite the low price, it has held up well so far and seems to be well built. The integral rain fly is a great feature (and it works). Its a definite improvement in terms of carrying it around over a duffel bag or roller bag and is very comfortable loaded. I can pack a weeks worth of field clothes in the pack pretty easily.I haven't hiked more than a mile wearing the pack yet or camped out of it, but there's a suitable amount of extra pockets and space so I don't anticipate having problems being able to fit enough kit and clothes and tent for weekend trailside trips."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"Don't buy this....invest the extra 20 dollars for a quality backpack. this was my first internal frame backpack and was highly disappointed.

The only thing I was disappointed with is that the bottom pocket, made to stuff your sleeping bag in is not quite large enough to fit my bag in it, so i put my clothes in the bottom compartment instead, and stuffed my sleeping bag in the large compartment. My water bladder fit perfectly in the small inside compartment which was up against my back. There is a small hole in the top of the pack for the water hose to go thru, and velcro clasp to help hold it in place. All and all, I am really satisfied with this pack. I recommend this one for sure! Happy hiking!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Our second TETON bag, and just as great","review":"I bought this one for my wife after getting a slightly larger one (Teton Sports 5200 Internal Frame Backpack) for myself. This one seems to fit everything she needs, plus some. I was surprised at the amount since it only holds 55 liters instead of 85 liters of 5200 series one. Both my wife and I love this backpack (as I use it when she doesn't go and it is a shorter backpacking trip where I don't need my 85 liter bag).The quality is great, the straps can be adjusted to perfectly fit your body frame and size. We attach aCamelBak 100-Ounce UnBottlehydration pack to it, making it perfect for any length backpacking trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This backpack was great for my son traveling in Europe it was light and could store lots of things he was very happy with it and the color stood out for identifying"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing pack for the price","review":"I bought this pack over a year ago and have been on about 20 hikes so far with it and I really don't have many complaints. I am 6'1 and the pack sits on me just fine. I have noticed the shoulder pads at time seem to wear down on me about 10+ miles. I ended up wrapping around the tops of them with some bandanas and it has worked out so far.Also the bag is a little heavy, With any pack it's really hit and miss. depending on the body type. Nothing has broke so far and it has seen some abuse so far. I highly recommend a pack from this company if you want some bang for your buck."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good product for its price!","review":"This pack is really cool! Has lots of pockets, very comfortable, and plenty of space. My only complaint is that one side of the internal frame is bent inward. It's very easy to adjust for a comfortable fit, just a pull of a strap and ta-daa! Well, you gotta pull more than one strap haha. One cool thing i didn't know this pack had when i bought it was the rain cover found at bottom of the pack. Overall a very good product for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable Straps...","review":"After trying this pack on, I have discovered that even though it fits my torso (and would fit many people larger or smaller, due to adjustable torso, the shoulder straps are at a strange angle and the inside edges bear the backward pressure of the pack into your shoulders too much. Basically my only complaint is uneven strap contact with the body. adjustment cannot correct for this. Otherwise a very affordable pack!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good backpack for the price","review":"I purchased this backpack 3-4 months ago. I am flying at least twice a year from Hawaii to Europe, and I needed backpack that is smaller then mine 90+ litres, since I was going for a shorter period of time. This backpack survived three flights in each direction without any damage ( I considere this a good proof of the durability). It is also very suitable for shorter camping trips, and long hikes (it can fit decent amount of stuff, in my opinion for 3-5 day hiking trip). Fits a bit high on my back ( I am 6 feet tall), but its very comfortable. Sleeping bag compartment is separated from main compartment, which is useful. Reason why i rated it 4 star is because I didnt tried to use water bag during hikes, so I cant tell if with it backpack fits equally well on the back.

My sleeping bag never had a chance fitting into the sleeping bag compartment. But I was surprised you can just unzip it to link it to the main compartment. Has a lot of straps to hook stuff on.

Unfortunately our packs got caught in the rain between connecting flights and when we got to our destination they were soaked through. Had I known it was forecasted to rain, I would have used the rain shield that comes along with it.

Had tested a number of backpacks loaded with various weights and even gotten helpful hints on adjusting at a store. This pack came with some nice features: separate sleeping bag compartment, lots of compartments, decent size for class, built in rain fly, places to attach things. However, there's a point where the shoulder pads attach to the bag that is a big uncomfortable knot in my shoulders. Also, no matter how I adjusted for height, the pack felt like it was pulling me backward at the shoulders, not shifting weight to the hip belt. I had to send it back and replace it with one at twice the cost. I was sad, because it's nifty for all the features. If you're new, please make sure you get good advice and know how one should fit before you try this one on - that way, you'll be able to make a good decision."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Far, So good","review":"Bought these for my two Webelos Scouts for their advancement into Boy Scouts.

The weight distribution made carrying the 30 to 35 lbs of stuff no problem. After the hike, my hiking buddies were quite impressed when they picked the bag up with their hands, but it doesn't feel anywhere near that heavy when put on and adjusted correctly. There's also lots of little places to stash stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Pack","review":"As others have commented wicked number of straps etc, make this bag very versatile. The shoulder and waist straps are well made and adjustable for a good fit. It's a lightweight but sturdy bag due to the light frame. Generally strong construction, though I noticed one of the stops on the bungee material came off. It was a quick fix. Holds a good amount of clothing, etc, but not overly big. There is a pass through from the main area to the bottom access area. For the price, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"great backpack for a good price!","review":"This pack is a good size and fits well, can be adjusted for all sizes!

If you plan on bring more than clothes, sleeping bag, etc... get a bigger pack!Con:The water bottle holders on each side of the pack are really small and don't stretch far. It can NOT hold a typical water bottle. pro: great for storing small easily accessible items e.g. sunscreen, bugspray, snacks.PRO:My camping trip was very very rainy...everything stayed dry for the most part.

The other two DVDs show instruction as if you have been in gymnastics for quite some time.

He zeroed in on the basic disrespect for everything in the past and he just didn't like it. After hearing him explain that he didn't think that George Washington's wooden teeth were what he wanted to care about, I had to agree with him that the book doesn't make history appealing. People in history end up sounding stupid for not knowing things we know now. I don't want my kids to read history with that kind of arrogance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh Yikes!

Now there is a waiting list for Oh, Yikes! as well. Masoff writes in the most entertaining manner. She fully understands the mind of a child.

This is a wonderful book!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun, but...","review":"It looks like a fun enough book. One that I got for my kids and really wanted to like. But, when I was just looking at the section on electricity I found out that Westinghouse was the inventor of AC current. Really? I guess because he's rivals with Edison and promotes AC, he's suddenly also the inventor of AC current, too. You have to wonder why a book with a subtitle of History's Grossest, Wackiest Moments can't even mention the wacky and wonderful Nikola Tesla? Hmmm....I get a bit suspicious of books who fail to give credit where credit is due, or try to dumb down information to such an extent that it doesn't become information at all, but something more like misinformation. It's even worse if I have to wonder if the misinformation is intentional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for boys--and some girls, too!","review":"I bought this book and its companion, \\"Oh, Yuck!\\" for my nephew for his 13th birthday. He is a somewhat reluctant reader, and both the tone and content of these books are perfect for him. The book is visually attractive, using a variety of fonts and sizes of type, and the illustrations, mostly sketches with a few black and white photographs, are imaginative and well chosen. The books are oversize paperbacks and the pages are high quality. Both books deal with the gross, the strange, and the weird, but a great deal of factual information is imparted along the way. Both my nephew and his sisters loved these books, and I recommend them for ages six and up. Younger kids may need help with the text, but all will enjoy the content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to put down","review":"I never thought gross thing would be so interesting.

I wanted to start out with this deck, since it is the basic tarot deck. I've done countless readings for myself, family, and friends and have even turned non-believers into believers who ask me for a reader before they do anything. I connected with this deck right away and about 95% of my readings have been deadly accurate. I would recommend this deck to anyone starting out with tarot.The Key to the Tarot booklet was a bit hard to get used to for meanings for me personally, so I use another book that helps explain the meanings of each card more in-depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst reprint possible","review":"the colors are way off and quite ugly, they blur and the lines are quite thick, and lacking of detail. this is basically a reprint of a reprint of a reprint, the book that comes with is fine though. when compared to a friend's deck who got me into tarot, these just dont work at all and i dont get the same intuition as i do from his deck that he let me barrow, and his are over 13 years old, these look brand new but are as said before absent of the same vibrant color and detail. and that is important. just a bad experience for a first time buyer of tarot cards. i did want rider waite deck though, thats about the only thing they got right. could any one recommend the original to me with the same vivid colors and detail that i am seeking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep looking.","review":"The artwork on these cards is not as clear as I would have liked. Must be something about the prints, but the lines are so thick in places you can't make out the elements of the scenes and the colors are terribly splotchy. The point of the art is the fine detail and symbolism packed into each piece, and this set loses so much of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so reproduction, bad trademarking","review":"Having used a French deck for the last twenty-six years, I thought I would try the Rider Waite deck. When I got them, imagine my surprise and disgust when \\" US GAMES\\" is printed on the front of each card! Though in small print, it is quite legible and very much unwelcomed. Additionally, the reproduction herein is not accurate nor is it very well done.

These images are the original archetypes that would cause such a dramatic interest in this rather obscure means of \\"fortune telling\\". It is true the images are not vibrant and colorful. The Universal Waite deck came nearly a century later and lovingly pays tribute to these original images. Many other \\"clones\\" would follow with various intrepretations/colorations. The basic images remain a constant.This was the first set of images I was exposed to years ago and have grown to love over time. They have mystery and depth to them which must be experienced first hand. All modern standards come from this set. The backs are the best intrepretation I have ever seen. Much better then the busy lines that most see. The soft colors with their tan tone is soothing to the eye. While not an \\"absolute\\" original reprint of the deck, I feel this is the closest one can get!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tarot Set","review":"Came with a great book and the cards have very nice art.

When I compare them to a similar pack I have, which is made by another company, all the colours are poor, i.e. not vibrant. In particularly the \`blues' (water, sky etc.) appear a dull pastel green. Also, the outlines in the pictures are thicker, giving the appearance of less detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this Tarot Deck","review":"As a beginner of Tarot reader and a stranger to the western culture, Original Rider Waite Tarot Deck is more friendly and easily to get start.I even brought two Decks, one for playing and the other for saving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality reproduction","review":"Having used various versions of the RW deck since the early seventies I can honestly say this is the lowest quality edition I have ever seen. The images are very heavily pixelated and the trademark is quite noticeable on the face of each card. For my purposes the defects in printing are so egregious as to render the deck unusable. If you care about image quality I strongly suggest you pass on this edition of the deck."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE ULTIMATE","review":"How can I give this more than 5 ?????Great - my first and best deck.Don't throw away tradition without replacing it with something better.

But not for a begginer. It is obviously a classic. But, if you are looking for a detailed explanation of the cards you won't find it here. There is no leading explanations for a begginer, which could be tough if you don't know the cards. So if your starting out, learn on a smaller, simpler deck with some explanation of the cards (just so you have an idea). Then I think this would be a good, classic deck to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"What can I say....they're Tarot cards. I knew what I was getting when I purchased them. They're good.

So Yay, have fun figuring out how to read them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it.","review":"Granted, they are tarot cards. So they are naturally use-able.

The book has serious issues, including misnumbering Major Arcana. I bought the deck for my son's first deck, figuring Rider Waite would be a good beginner deck.We're going to have to buy another book for him to learn the meanings of the cards, the celtic cross layout, etc...Not recommended unless you know what you're doing.... And if you do know what you're doing, you still probably want a more traditional Rider-Waite deck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not conform to my requirements","review":"This printing of the Rider Waite deck is tarot-able!For the past 18 years or so I have worked as an (eyes open) Tarot Reader and the RW deck has been and still is my favorite deck. In that time I have worn out many decks, and I have replaced them by going to a Hollywood store and getting a new deck. The previous time I needed a new deck I bought this item on-line, and I was very disappointed. The imaging is poor, and the feel of the cards is rather flimsy. I would not use this deck in my work as the crutch, as they are not as flashy as in years past by other suppliers."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Original Rider Waite Tarot Pack","review":"This is a defective product by the publisher, otherwise it would rec a 5 of 5 stars.

The main problem is the blues of the original images that they reproduced for this deck have apparently all faded to a dull pale green that is very unappealing. I have since acquired the Universal Waite and find it much more pleasant to use. The Original Rider Waite is of historical interest, but I think will not appeal to many users. The packaging is well done, though Waite's Key to the Tarot booklet is less useful to a beginner than a book such as Rachel Pollack's Seventy Eight Degrees of Wisdom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall I am pleased","review":"There were a few comments here about the cards being too rough and more of interest to those interested in the history then in the art. That is true. The style is art nouveau here more then in the newer decks. Some of the newer art looks like the worst sort of shallow New Age-y stuff. On the other hand some of them are gorgeous. If you go for the simplest version this is probably it. It promises there will be no odd variation and it is beautiful in a certain way. On the other hand rivers and other details do not show up, there is colour run-through, and the colours themselves are a bit odd. The back is not gorgeous.Good shipping time, got it before I expected to. Little book is very nice and I like the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Original\\" Rider Waite Deck Warning","review":"The \\"original\\" Rider Waite deck that I received had an ugly plaid design on the backs of the cards, and the image quality of the pictures was terrible.

If you're determined to get a deck labeled \\"original\\" you might want to try to make sure you're not stuck with the ugly plaid version of this deck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old School","review":"Nice ornate drawings and rich colors (I especially love the yellows and reds... my brother said they looked \\"evil\\").Cards seem decent quality, and little booklet included with background and history along with reading spreads and brief divination meanings for all the cards.Seems like all you need for a good tarot starter.Price is worth the cards alone; the book leaves things to be desired if you want more in depth info."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incomplete booklet","review":"The Tarot deck itself is fine. The booklet accompanying the Tarot deck is missing page 147. Instead, page 145 is duplicated. When I contacted the company, the person I communicate with seemed nonchalant about the problem.

I feel I have wasted my money as I will never read with this deck and the printing is of such poor quality I won't even use it as a gift or freebie give away.

In fact, it turns out to be more like an extended version of Raw Is War. For one, most of the matches are disappointing. The WWF championship match is not the last match as it usually should be. It was a fair match, but it should have been saved for last. Another disappointment is the last match between Hulk Hogan and Sid Justice. Hogan had always been known for weak matches, but this one ends on a disqualification. However, the Intercontinental title match between champion Rowdy Roddy Piper against Bret Hart is worth watching. One of the biggest disappointments is Gorilla Monsoon and Bobby \\"The Brain\\" Heenan's poor commentating after the WWF title match as they forget about the match taking place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent movie, excellent quality for its age","review":"Ignoring the ignorance of other reviewers stating the quality is not Dolby Digital sound or perfect digital video quality (DUH! It was made in the 1940s!), this is actually a fairly decent film. It captures effectively the non-battle aspects of war, and delves into the personality of soldiers. Even though it is sanitized in terms of few deaths and mild language, it is a good view for children and adults alike learning about WWII."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Walk in The Sun","review":"One of the great war films of all time, and almost entirely overlooked. Watching it is like spending an afternoon traveling with a regular army combat group with whom you soon become personally involved. This depiction of lightly equipped WWII volunteer and draftees surviving a landing and marching inland to take a bridge and farmhouse is, chapter and verse, as true to life as scripted films get. What faces these men, and those left to come forward and lead after losses and breakdowns, quietly and gracefully illustrates the real strength of Americans in uniform - without a hint of jingoism, personal \\"glory,\\" or patriotic fanfare. Just a company of men on a mission, unsure of what's going on around them, taking unpredictable damage, meeting obstacles, and relying their own collective determined inertia to overcome them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brought back my WW11 Infantry experince as a BAR man in ETO.","review":"I've watched and lived thru this great picture of infantry life 25 times or more.

It looks like Madacy made it from a 10th generation VHS tape. They are even moments when static, from the poor tracking of the source tape, is visible. On top of that DVD compression artifacts abound, and my new DVD player has a lot of difficulty playing the disc without pausing every few minutes.

However, don't, repeat DON'T buy the dvd version of this film. - The quality is simply appalling with a hugely bad compression ratio (honestly it's like watching a grainy movie clip on someone's website). The dvd also had a tendency to splutter to a stop on my dvd player. Now wonder the dvd is so cheap.

The quality is absolutely terrible and if the cost didn't make a return not worth my while, I would have returned this video. The sound quality is so bad that the dialogue can hardly be heard at times (quite often in fact) -- there is also a steady hum that can be heard throughout the movie. The picture quality is a joke. At times the picture drops out completely and you see nothing but static. Add to that the missing footage and you come up with a video that is not worth the money! Do yourself a favor and try to remember the film as it was -- wonderful -- and then DON'T ruin the good memories by buying this disaster of a release. My parents and I were extremely disapointed in this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a restored version","review":"It is apparent that the copyright has expired on this movie, as a number of DVD houses are offering various versions.

I still believe that it is one of the best war films ever made. Yes, I also have seen Saving Private Ryan many times and love it as well.In many ways, these films have a lot in common. They both exemplify the tenseness and horror of war. While SPR is more graphic, A Walk In The Sun succeeds with superb camera work and more subtlety.The acting in A Walk In The Sun is excellent and I practically memorized all of the humorous dialogue between Pvts Rivera (Richard Conte) and Freedman (George Tyne). These two were a quintesential element of the film.This film was excellently directed by Lewis Milestone and should not be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok","review":"Before you go spend money on exam prep information, be sure you know what lies ahead when testing for a fire job.

The album was preceded by their first single Lyrics (which appears on the album), a perfect introduction to the band: a combination of strong melody and intelligent \\"lyrics\\". Musically, think of Kayak as a combination of (early) Genesis and ELO. The album is a mix of shorter songs (Mammoth and the title track were also issued as singles in Europe, with considerable success) and the longer (6-8 minutes) more \\"experimental\\" progressive rock songs such as Mouldy Wood, Lovely Luna, Forever Is A Lonely Thought). This album is the first of 3 albums Kayak recorded for the EMI label, and it is this trio that contains the \\"definitive\\" Kayak sound, culminating in Royal Bed Bouncer, Kayak's best album (see review there)."},{"rating":"2","title":"See see the sun","review":"Another icon from seventiesKayak is one of the best bands from Holland.All compositions in symphonic style.In spite of very good Focus, Kayak symphonic influences are own original, not based in old classical music."},{"rating":"2","title":"old kayak fan","review":"this was the first LP I ever bought.

I don't know where Doctor Elingham came from, but it's a far cry from the Doctor Bramford in the movie.

I've been happy with other Twinlab products for years. Sadly, I've learned about a serious problem with this B vitamin product. It contains the wrong form of B12--cyanocobalamin. According to the information I've received, this form cannot be digested without stealing methyl needed for other purposes. The form of B12 that is usable and best digested by the body is methylcobalamin. For most people taking it orally is not as effective as sublingually, or better yet, in a patch.

After that, it's like listening to someone gargling a mouthful of nails. While Grohl has moved on to something different, his playing is nothing spectacular either on this cd. Cobain takes almost every song too fast, therefore removing any sort of feeling from the songs, and then add in the poor sound quality, the frequent mistakes from the musicians, and you have this cd.

Included in that cd is many of their hit songs along with some cover songs you won't find anywhere else. I also need to add that I noticed that everyone that reviews Nirvana talks about \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\".......ouch. If you are a true Nirvana fan that is not even close to a favorite song.

The only one that was there was this, so, not knowing how it would be, I bought it. This album is a classic. It has opened me up to the world of grunge and showed me the passion Nirvana had live.

When they were on, they were ON. No wonder Krist Novoselic would say that Nirvana would \\"slay\\" onstage, rather than just \\"play\\". Kurt Cobain's guitar squeals and roars, Krist's bass chugs along like a locomotive, and Dave Grohl's drumming is simply untouchable: the greatest rock drummer of his generation. These selections from different gigs showcase Nirvana at their live peak: every song is played as if the band would drop dead after they stop: they make it all last, they give it their all.

It was a disappointment. Johnny Kidd & the Pirates had their heyday in the late 50s/early 60s and are probably best known for the original version of \\"Shakin' All Over\\" which the Guess Who took to much greater heights.Kidd (born Fred Heath) does not have much of a singing voice and aside from \\"Shakin\\" none of the songs are memorable. It's understandable why the group never was able to have an impact in the States. When the beat boom occured in the UK, they were just unable to keep up. I think the biggest hook they had was Kidd's eyepatch and the pirate costumes so they probably generated a lot more excitement in live performances. On a positive note, the liner notes were very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teresa Dorsey","review":"Some good information in this book, but should have been spiral bound and possibly organizing pockets inserted throughout so would have made it easier to organize.I would not buy this book again due to the facts written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Synchronicity Explained","review":"\\"Synchronicity An Acausal Connecting Principle\\" is a must read for those interested in the subject of synchronicity. At 115 pages this book is deceiving at first glance as it appears to be a quick read. However, it is difficult to get through, not because it is uninteresting - but really because it is fascinating and much of the thought in this work is new and is counter to traditional thinking. The translation is good, although it would be nice to have a new simplified version released which \\"dumbs down\\" some of the complex concepts. A fascinating book and well worth the time and effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad writing on a great subject","review":"The subject matter of this book deserves a 5, the writing deserves a 0. Jung should have taken a course on writing - he used typical psycho babble and unnecessarily complex wording to discuss the concept of synchronicity, which is an incredibly interesting topic. Unless you know latin, greek (yes he actually wrote some quotes in greek letters), and have a good understanding of astrology, I suggest you find one of the many contemporary books on the subject to read. If, like me, you feel you have to go to the source to get a better understanding of the topic, then I suggest that, at a minimum, you skip the chapter on astrology, or, better yet, skip the entire book, and read only the appendix. In the 10 or so pages of the appendix, he summarizes the entire book.Bad writing on a great subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like Carl Jung.","review":"So I am predisposed to look positively upon his discourses. ;-pI did find it fascinating that Jung was the \\"original\\" thinker about Syncronicity, which now has become a frequently used \\"Spiritual\\" or \\"New Age\\" term.Like they say: There is nothing new under the sun :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Synchronicity","review":"I read this book as a free-reading experience and although you may ask why it is becaue books like this are interesting to me at 16 years old. Although I thought it was a bit difficult and there were a lot of terms I didn't know, I still understood most of what C.G. Jung was trying to say. If you decide to read this book I suggest keeping a dictionary nearby or at least have some prior knowledge to many different pyschological terms. Not a lot of the things he said can be proven currently with our current technology but that doesn't mean this book won't provide interesting insight into the world of psychology."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book which will make you think","review":"This book will forever be linked in my mind with the Police album, just like Lolita links with \\"Don't Stand So Close To Me.\\" One of the things I like most about this book is that it is easy to read and not intimidating. For starters, it's not very long and the language is not challenging. Jung uses a lot of interesting stories to explain his theories of synchronicity, when unrelated things seem to happen together at the same time with a purpose. The first time I read this book, I found that while I was reading it, I would experience synchronicity. For instance, I was reading it on my lunch break from work and I ran into one of my coworkers that I had a crush on. Maybe that's just a coincidence, but maybe there are greater forces at work. I would say that if you are intimidated by reading huge books by Jung, this is a good book to get started with, and it will definitely give you something about which to think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holmes and Russell in India","review":"Was the \\"Kim\\" of Rudyard Kipling's espionage classic a fictional character? According to Sherlock Holmes in this excellent book: \\"He's as real as I am!\\" That line alone was worth the purchase price of the book. Once again, Ms. King has given us an excellent tale of suspense and adventure featuring the intrepid Mary Russell and her husband Sherlock Holmes. In this one we are transported to British India in 1924 on a search for the missing Kimball O'Hara, the grown-up urchin of Kipling's book. Along the way we meet the usual odd assortment of characters, every one of which is well-drawn, and not just a cipher. The action moves along at a fast pace, and certainly keeps the reader turning pages quickly. There's also a very good history lesson embedded in the book, one worth knowing about the course of empire. As always, I highly recommend this series, and will await the publication of the next installment with impatience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring Your Game.............","review":"Russell and Holmes set out on another exotic adventure, this time to British ruled India. All the elements are there to make the reader speed through the pages enjoying every historically rich morsel. Great secondary characters; the Goodhearts, Americans traveling to India, a Maharajah with a quirky personality, a zoo and village of dwarfs, Nesbitt a ripe old English chap of Her Majaesty's Army and best of all Kimball O'Hara....yes Kim, of the Rudyard Kipling book fame. Russell is on her own most of the time, honing her skills as a detective and using the various tools she has learned from Holmes during her apprenticeship with him. This is not your typical \\"who dunnit\\", it is rather a slow, rich unraveling of a complicated tapestry that always comes to an exciting conclusion with at least one surprise thrown in that leaves the reader wanting more. Well done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"with a magnifying glass you can find Sherlock Holmes in this volume.","review":"This book is wonderfully descriptive but generally lacking in plot. Mary Russell is extremely competent, resourceful, and generally well dressed - at no point in the book are we in doubt about her wardrobe - and whether she purchased it, borrowed it, improvised it, or is in disguise. We are similarly illuminated about her surroundings - she would narrate a wonderful travelogue. Sherlock Holmes is mentioned from time to time, but the main character is mostly an English version of Rudyard Kipling's Kim, not Conan Doyle's Holmes. So it might be fairer to say that Ms. King has written a Kipling type novel than to associate it with Conan Doyle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phooey on Ms King","review":"Pedantic. Boring. Waste of time. Shallow and trite characters.

There were some good tracks here and there but the CDs seemed totally inconsistent. In both CD they would start out alright and then suddenly it would drift off. A little different style from what i've typically heard from AP.CD 1 was very chill and had some nice beats bordering house and breaks but then a vocal track 7 was added, which although isn't too bad, was totatlly outta place. Then it slowed down and got a little boring only to pick up just a a little towards the end.CD 2 was more dark progressive and started off good with tracks 1-3 and then suddenly strange vocals tracks are added 4-5. I hate vocals especially if its a guy talking. These kinds of tracks don't belong in a good progressive set. The rest is ok with some notable tracks 9-10 but the CD never picks up as I was expecting from a 2nd CD after a chilled out first one.OK but not his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome playing","review":"Claude Delangle once again puts on a clinic of precision playing. Of all his cd's, his tone is definitely the best on this one, very even and projecting. The concerto by Denisov is very eclectic to say the least and features many unique effects on the saxophone as does the revolutionary sonata by Denisov written for Jean Marie Londeix. His altissimo and his pacing in the extended phrases are the stuff of dreams. His technique is absolutely brilliant, you would never know how difficult these pieces were if you only listened to this recording, he makes them sound way too easy. It's recordings like these that will make the saxophone a respected classical instrument for it's beauty of tone, technical athleticism, and seemingly unlimited flexibilty. The saxophone needs more pioneers like this. If you love this recording look at the rest of CLaude Delangle recordings and also the recordings of Timothy Mcallister, John Sampen, and Cliffor Leaman.

Wyatt writes sentences with sequences of program-specific, interreferential terms that become so circular, they are totally indecipherable. Should one opt for a try at decoding this spaghetti dinner, there is no set of definitions that would provide a place to begin. In addition, paragraphs consist of utterly unconnected thoughts making reference to all sorts of directions the student may take. As an explanation of how to think about the program it is a nonentity. There are ligically laid-out sequences of how to perform specific tasks but no sensible explanation of how they might connect to any work other than the specific tutorial exercises on the accompanying disc.

The couple do not meet over the Internet - they meet when Rupe, the gorgeous sytems analyst (I know, it looks like an oxymoron), moves into one of the rooms advertised for rent by Tine, widow of a prominent artist. And Tine, at least, knows who she's cybering with - some of the time: I will admit there's a twist in the tail. I enjoyed this book. Before the erotica kicks in there is actually quite a moving portrayal of Tine's efforts to get on with her life which is good writing in any genre. There are great food scenes. There's a sub-plot about stolen art, and some interesting, sexy characters doing interesting, sexy things. This was not half bad.

But thank god for the dvd remote, way too much time is spent on long shots of the train,etc and old newsreel footage instead of on Romy and Jean Louis Trinignant.I guess they didnt have enough of a plot to sustain a whole film.

Todas las canciones del disco son buenas"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Objectivist Alternative","review":"The primary virtue of the this book is a complete demolition of the typical Conservative claim that without God there is no morality. Craig Biddle does an excellent job of refuting all sides (the religious and personal or social subjectivist) of that particular mistaken proposition in all their manifestations and proves his points both with authoritative quotes from the various advocates and helpful examples that serve to clarify the ideas in a manner far better than I've seen in virtually all presentations of this sort.In addition Mr. Biddle does not just stop there but spends the rest of the book presenting the proper alternative to the false God/Anything Goes dichotomy -- a morality based of reason and principled self-intest. He shows how morality can be derived from facts and what the specifics of such a fact-based morality would look like. He concludes by outlining the essential principle of politics -- individual rights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Morality is practical","review":"A clear, simple and highly enjoyable presentation of the morality of self-interest. \\"The purpose of morality is to teach you, not to suffer and die, but to enjoy yourself and live.\\" -Ayn RandMorality is a code of values, based on certain requirements of human survival. The author shows how a proper morality must be based on certain facts of reality, facts that makes human life and happiness possible.It's your life! Are you living it? For your own well-being and happiness - or somebody else's? The ideas presented in this book have the power to change your life. What are you waiting for? Go get this book - now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Introduction to Ayn Rand's Ethics","review":"_Loving Life_ is an excellent short introduction to Ayn Rand's ethics, particularly for people who find her writings too condensed or too polemical. Unlike the convoluted and rationalistic writings typically produced by academics, Craig Biddle's writing is clear and engaging. His plethora of examples not only illustrate the ideas under discussion, but also show their real-life importance.I particularly enjoyed Biddle's discussion of physical force as invalidating an individual's judgment in Chapter 7 since so many people struggle to understand that point. (I had some minor technical quibbles with the book, most notably the confusing structure in the discussion of the virtues of rationality and productiveness. Those problems are unlikely to cause any significant confusion in the mind of the reader, however.)I can highly recommend the book for someone curious about Ayn Rand's ethics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Objectivism for beginners","review":"Loving Life is the perfect beginner's text for anyone interested in Objectivism. I became curious about Objectivism through a conference that Craig Biddle was actually a part of. Interested, I began reading Ayn Rand. However, I found Rand to be a little bit hard to follow in The Virtue of Selfishness. Enter Biddle's book. Craig Biddle logically and concisely breaks down the other major forms of morality in the first part of the book. His demolition of religious and social morality is about as complete as any I could imagine. The latter half of the book explains(in brief) the major points in Objectivist philosophy with crystal clarity. I would recommend to anyone curious as to what Objectivism is all about to buy this book. You won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fountainhead Companion","review":"This book is a great introduction to Objectivism. It is a good bridge between the Fiction and non-fiction. An Objectivist will find nothing new in this book, but it is a great re-enforcer of Ayn Rand's works; a fantastic book for those \\"peaked\\" by the ideas presented in the Fiction works. It is clearly written and a fast read. Buy ten and give them to friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Examples too extreme","review":"Biddle uses quotes from religious extremists and references the actions of evil leaders such as Hitler and Pol Pot as evidence to support his arguments, and I found myself saying \\"Well, no kidding\\". Obviously these are not folks to emulate and most people, regardless of their philosophical leanings, would agree with him. He mentions criminal behavior: embezzeling, robbing banks, mugging, murder as examples of amoral activity, and once again I thought \\"Tell me something I don't already know\\". He never explained how the nice family next door with the lawyer dad and stay-at-home mom, who go to church on Christmas and Easter, volunteer once a year for Habitat for Humanity and love to go camping in state parks are \\"anti-life\\". Addressing instances of black and white is easy - the shades of gray that we encounter every day need to be analyzed, and at this Biddle failed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent, More Objectivism","review":"This is not very original work. Basically an Objectivist introduction, with some analysis. The shortcommings of the book, then, are fairly easily predicted. Read up on other philosophy in addition to reading this (if you MUST buy it). I haven't the heart to bash people's ideas here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying to justify greed","review":"I will give the author credit for a clear, concise writing style. This makes it that much easier to understand that what his philosophy boils down to is greed - whoever ends up with the most stuff, wins. He makes selfishness sound like a moral imperative, and the only way to true happiness, but fails to explain why this concept has not caught on like wildfire. How are the majority of Americans happy, without being Objectivists? These ideas are not new to Mr. Biddle, and he does nothing to make them any more appealing than the many who have tried (with little success) before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical tips on fasting","review":"It has been many years since I have read anything by Derek Prince.

Even though I am what Miller would consider a conservative, I could very much appreciate his book. It is a diagnosis like no other; it is coming straight from the heart of the beast -- a PR executive who realized the fine line between reality and fiction, advertising / entertainment and real life, and saw how it became uncoscionably blurred in post-Industrial America. I recommend Miller's inter-disciplinary (everything from economic sociology to art theory) book to anyone seeking an irreverent perspective on what at first glance seems to be a wornout subject.

If you're looking for the wonderful sound you remember from the terrific TV special or video, this will be a big disappointment.

Every kid should have this musical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mid 70's Kid Memories Still Alive","review":"This was the soundtrack to an animated TV special in 1975.

It really is worth the purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Terrific at EVERYTHING!","review":"Without being sentimental, since I never knew about Really Rosie until I was a teenager, this is a great album for parents and kids to sing to together. The combination of Carol King's music and Maurice Sendak's warped lyrics (a boy named Chicken Soup who swallowed up...a little bone no bigger than my pinkie...and he choked...and he gagged...and he smothered...and he sagged...) is terrific.I love the tunes. Singable, interesting, fun. Same thing with the lyrics. I'm partial to one side of my tape (the Sendak side) more than the other, but they're both okay. In fact, before I had a child, every now and then I'd listen to this just because I plain out LIKE it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Rosie by Carole King","review":"I agree with the other reviewers that this album is Terrific BUT who remembers that this was a Broadway Show with an all-children cast?

She waxes poetic about her grandmother's famed caramel cake, but then provides a recipe for a three layer cake made with only one stick of butter, which resulted in a cake with the texture of cornbread.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Single Perspective But Still Great","review":"First and last, this is a great book. It clearly explains one of the major economic theories of business cycles and goes on to apply it to the Great Depression. The book is best suited to a college economics student, or to a layman willing to devote a considerable level of effort to understanding the subject, but it would not be a particularly difficult project for anyone who reads on a college level. It should be noted that the book espouses ONE of the major economic theories of business cycles, the Austrian theory. Since the book is well written, it is almost dangerous to a student going into it blindly--you are liable to become an Austrian economist! Not that this is a bad thing, but you should realize there are other viewpoints. I do think Rothbard is a bit monomaniacal in his devotion to Austrian theory at the exclusion of everything else, but that doesn't prevent this from being a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pornography for Economic Geeks","review":"I really enjoyed this book, even though it dedicated itself to a rather dry discussion of the Austrian School of Ecenomics's explanations for the causes of the Great Depression. I have to say that I simply did not understand much of Economics until I started reading Rothbard because he argues that much of the Economic theories that I had such a hard time grasping were hard to understand because they were absurd.It's definitely something that will allow you to argue with your econ teacher for hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too technical and too boring","review":"I wanted to read more about the Great Depression of the 30's so i bought this book.As i started to read it, i realized the book is just too technical and full of words that at least,for me,required i do a little research.Is just too boring because this book reads like a university course from Oxford.I am sure that people well versed in this matter will find it interesting.But i dont think the average person will enjoy it.I was looking for a \\"common man\\" explanation of the Great Depression and this book is not it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real economic history","review":"I have read a lot of Murray Rothbard lately and can say this book (like all of Rothbard's others) offers an excellent analysis of economic history as it it not taught in business schools or discussed in the media. Always a joy to read. My only critic of the book is Rothbard's habit of over-using dense economic data that sometimes upsets the flow of reading, hence the 4 stars. I suppose I was reading a book on economics though so I know I shouldn't really complain."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome Collection of House Music","review":"Recently I got an opportunity to hear this great disc. It's probably one of the best locally-produced collections of house music I've heard. There are a ton of great songs with heavy bass (a subwoofer is required for this one!). Probably the best track on here is \\"Percolator,\\" it's a bit repetitive at first, but the track is very addictive! Plus some of the remixes of pop-music tracks on here are really good too.The only downside to \\"Taste of Chicago\\" is the fact that you have to really be into house-styled techno to enjoy it, but if you are a club music junkie, this is an excellent choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"UPDATE: great taste, hoping for just as great results","review":"This product tastes AMAZING and somewhat sweet, naturally. Seems to have plenty of ingredients that health reviews agree are supposed to be good for what this tea is claiming to do - enhance the function of your mind and memory. I suffer from terrible memory, and while it is too early to tell, i am going to continue drinking this (alternating with Brain Booster tea) for the next 3-6 months, as it definitely cannot hurt, and if nothing else, is delicious. I will try to update after 3-6 months.UPDATE:Almost 3 years later... I have no way to calculate if this product helped my brain, but I still drink it just because it is delicious, well priced, and although just a feeling - i feel good drinking all the great ingredients this tea has in it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's good.","review":"It's good. I don't drink it too often now, but I think it has a good taste and maybe it is a little stimulating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tea","review":"The tea is great in helping me to concentrate. It also tastes great as well. I'm especially impressed how quickly the tea got to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ice Magic~Matt Christopher","review":"I bought this for my nephew and he hasn't seen it yet.

Another lame unoriginal song about some guy treating you wrong. Trina's presentation on this song is so obnoxious that I don't blame any guy cheating on her with another girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steelers Monopoly, Before Ben","review":"Fans of monopoly and the Steelers should enjoy this product thoroughly. It seemed to be the perfect blend of both genres when I decided to purchase this for my father, who loves both. The only downside I saw in the product was how it gets dated very quickly and that unproven players are given property spaces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent........ Nothing special...","review":"I just seen this DVD and I figured I'd give it a review.The DVD itself is poorly produced, there is a chapters selection but it don't give chapter titles or anything like they are seperated into in the movie, only pictures that are pretty much useless unless you've memorized the movie inside out.The wrestling on the DVD is ok. Some of it is very talented wrestling and some of it, like most backyard wrestling is extremely sloppy and hard to watch.The DVD also includes a few Whole matches or almost whole matches and these are boring and have no psycology to them at all. If you are a real wrestling fan, don't bother. This isn't for you, or if you re just a fan of backyard wrestling in general this still prolly isn't what you are looking for cvause it is very lackluster.If you want something better and more like a real movie, check out \\"The Backyard\\".... it is like the Backyard \\"Beyond the Mat\\" and it is MUCH better then this."},{"rating":"2","title":"BACKYARD CRIMINALS RULES!","review":"This is a great DVD if you love pro wrestling or if you love backyard wrestling. The wrestlers will also say a lot of great things about Backyard Wrestling that you wouldn't expect to hear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks cool, but falls appart","review":"This toy looks cool, but has faulty joints where the legs attatch to the body. My 7-year old boy got it for his birthday and was really excited to open the box and play with it. However, as soon as he removed the Axel figure from the bike, the legs fell off. Examination of the figure reveals that it happened because of the faulty design of the toy and not because of an isolated defect. The legs can be re-attached with some difficulty, but they easily fall off again when played with. My son has experienced frustration instead of fun with this toy. I do not recommend it for playing with. About the only thing it's good for it to sit untouched on a shelf or remain in the blister pack as a MIB collectors item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"All I have to say is Spencer Tracy and Myrna Loy are superb actors. With great actors, everything is automatic. They don't have to pretend to be anything because the feeling is their own. I love watching classic movies to observe actors and these two are among the most talented actors. It's just to bad Ms. Loy never received an oscar because she is superb in any role she plays and every role is always believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful","review":"This has got to be the worst \\"reggae\\" I have ever heard recorded. From the wanna-be-Bob-Marley cliche lyrics; to the fake Jamaican accents; to the painfully dull melodies; to the droning, uninspired bass lines, this is just awful stuff. There's just too much excellent to really even just passable reggae, from Jamaica and beyond, for anyone to ever have to endure this affliction. Sorry if this review isn't quite \\"irie\\", but \\"who da cap fit\\", as is said."},{"rating":"2","title":"ORIGINAL","review":"This is entirely authentic music from entirely authentic musicians. I have watched the evolution of this band since they were in their mid-teens. I watched as they fell in love with this genre and incorporated it into their own style of music.I have listened carefully and witnessed their evolution and I think that they finally got it perfect.Their music is authentic. They are the genuine artical. They are some of the hardest working musicians you'll find anywhere. They love what they do. This album is brilliantly produced. The sound is incredible. While I am a much bigger SKA fan than a reggae fan, JBB has inspired me to listen to more reggae -I have no problem with the way that Kevin Kinsella tunes his voice... he's been tuning it this way since he started singing. It works. If his \\"authentic\\" Jamaican friends and fans don't have an issue with it, then neither should his bourgeois fans from the North East."},{"rating":"2","title":"How To Play From a Fake Book","review":"Great book. Goes into lots of details. All kinds of ways to make your music more special and create your own style and flair. This is for the beginner but also more experienced player, with lots to learn. Loads of songs in it.It says on front, \\"Faking your own arrangements from melodies and chords\\" \\"Crack the mysteries of a fake book by learning about chords, inversions, scales, left-hand patterns and much more.\\"I've barely started with it but I can tell it will take a while for me to get through it."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"I can understand it. But, surely everyone knows, you must practice what you know. Must create muscle memory. The songs are fun and incorporate new information quite well. You know what you are trying to learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake Fake Book Lessons","review":"The sample review gives the appearance this book is all about teaching how to use a Fake book to play Keyboard.It begins with a basic simple to understand chapter, but moves fast paced into teaching standard Treble and Base clef just as a typical piano book does. All Fake piano books have treble clef (melody) and the chord (letter) shown above the staff. If you have limited piano skills as I have, this book does not address learning to play keyboard using a fake book and is just filled with typical piano lessons. I would not recommend it for the biginner who want a book that teaches basic improvisation skills on a keyboard (eg: fills etc), moving slowly toward more advanced stuff. This book is far out. If you want early results stay away from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"now I get it!","review":"I took piano lessons for 5+ years and in elementary/junior high. I never had the least idea how to make any chord, except by reading the notes. I never knew why one chord was called a G and another was a C7. (Possibly my teachers tried to tell me, and I was not paying attention -- I wasn't the most attentive student.) I started recently trying to play keyboard and I bought one of those little books that shows every chord and its inversions. Very time consuming to look up and try to memorize each chord! But after reading this book and \\"How to Play the Piano Despite Years of Lessons\\" I can actually sit down and play any major chord, and figure out any minor, diminished, augmented, and 7th. There is actually a rhyme and reason behind it all! Who knew?! I'm having a lot of fun with these books, although I can't say I'm ready to play for an audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A valuble book for any musican","review":"This is of the best, most clearly explained books ever written on practical music theory as applies to piano. It teaches, without the use of extensive diatonic charts, the principles of chord composition for all chords in all keys. It does not dumb down theory, rather it explains it in its true form, which is in fact simple. It is a great way for a non-paino playing musician to learn piano."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to learn all the chords","review":"If you're a self-learner who wants a very nice and gentle instruction on all the chord variants, this book is pretty good... it almost feels like you have a good-natured teacher sitting beside you. The book is interspersed with 50+ fake book songs, and comes with a chord reference chart, so it's hard to go wrong for the price.However, it doesn't cover much more than block chords, so if you've learned all the chord variants already (or are going to learn them from the many websites), and don't care for the songs it includes, then this may not be the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying and Obnoxious","review":"The writing style of the author is so obnoxious and annoying, that I never made it past the first few pages. Here's a few examples:* From page 4, under \\"How much should you know about music to use this book\\", he writes, \\"Alphabet letters A through G (gosh, you don't even have to know letters H through Z!)\\".* Here's another on the same page: \\"Will any of this hurt? I certainly hope not. Just don't turn the pages too quickly--paper cuts really sting!\\"* One more, on page 14: \\"Drummers call these the backbeats, but then most drummers can't read music, so don't listen to them!\\"If you find those things funny, then go ahead and buy this book. But if you find those \\"jokes\\" obnoxious and annoying, then pass it by. I recommend Mark Harrison's, \\"The Pop Piano Book\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful bookT","review":"This book is a little corny, but if you can overlook that, it has a lot of useful information. Well worth the purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book to Know What's up on a Fake Book","review":"I'm a Begginer student of keyborard and i found this book very helpful in my first steps of learning, and when you get a song with only a few letters in the top coded as \\"c#,a,c7\\" or something like that, now you may know what to do an even add your own style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"If you follow this book to learn how to play from a fake book, all you will end up with is sounding like you are playing a melody on your right hand, and block chords/arpeggios on your left. Not only very amateurish, but sounds downright ugly, and certainly no need for 88 pages to teach you that! You will have more fun and learn more on the way by getting pop sheet music. They all come with piano arrangments and chord symbols. Studying how the pros arrange the harmonies and accompaniments in these pop sheet music will tell you much more than anything this book has to offer. If you are classically trained and don't know what the chord symbols mean, a google search will give you all the answers. And if you don't know how to read music, well, this book won't help you anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Israel Spoofs Itself","review":"I found this Israeli comedy to actually be laugh aloud funny and incisive about the national and cultural quagmires within Israeli society. IT has its Hollywood 'Feel Good' aspect as well as a bit of hyperbolic, eye-popping acting, but the film has many wonderful nuggets of truth. Since I'm going to Israel in about ten days -- I've spent much time there -- it's a zesty appetizer for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this one","review":"In the first story, Lord of the High Lonesome, Reese is kinda cool, but Kit has the biggest chip on her shoulder. She is very hard to like, which makes the story hard to like.In Heart of Stone, it's the hero who's a problem. He is such a jerk! Stephanie is okay, and her brother's nice.In both stories, the girls are simply too young for their positions. The writing is good, but the characters ruin the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny memoir","review":"Anders is a combination Joan Rivers and Ricky Riccardo's wild younger sister (if he'd had one), with perhaps a dash of Mary McCarthy thrown in. She writes with insight, affection (mostly), and a kind of manic joy about her often difficult childhood as well as her experiences growing up Cuban, Jewish, and a woman in the United States. Made me think more deeply about the ways that different cultures intersect and influence each other. Great dialogue. I found myself speaking Cubanese for days: Joo no whaa ah mean? A refreshing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Therapy For Anders, Bad Read For Us","review":"There's a fine line in memoirs between an insightful look into a person's life that contains meaning for everyone and an exercise that the author's therapist prescribed to them in order to deal with psychological issues. Anders crossed that line with Jubana. It seems pretty clear that she was trying to write a story which portrayed the wackiness that cross-cultural issues can create (sort of a \\"My Big Fat Jewish-Cuban Wedding\\"). Instead, what the reader gets is a manic, unorganized depiction of a woman who was spoiled to the point where she has difficulty dealing with life. Anders probably found some comfort and insight while writing this book. But, the rest of us don't have to spend our money eavesdropping on her therapy session."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lukewarm","review":"This book started well, but about the time the author enters Sidwell Friends, I was paging ahead to see if it was ever going to be 'dazzling.' Young Gigi is far less interesting and 'cute' than she imagines herself to be.The rendering of all her mother's foul mouthed dialogue into Cubenglish dialect grated after the first couple of chapters.Mami in general seems rude, arrogant, and snobby.I am mystified at the author's identification with all things Cuban. Her grandparents were all Eastern European Jews who immigrated to Cuba in the 1920's, and the entire family left in 1960, when the author was two, so how Cuban are they? Her nostalgia for Cuba seems mostly for the family's lost wealth there rather than the country itself. The author seems far more spoiled JAP than Cuban.Other than a few amusing vignettes and anecdotes, this book is isnt worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT READ","review":"Funny, moving and out load hysterical.Spanish words slowed me up a little but who cares.My husband helped me with a few of the words and ended up loving the book himself.A great summer read."},{"rating":"2","title":"critica","review":"I enjoyed the book and having come from a Cuban background myself I could identify with Ms. Anders upbringing. Most will enjoy reading about Cuban idiosyncracies and the prerequisite caffeine buzz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good.","review":"This book is good because it tells of the secrete ambitions of the ninjas.

He is at a stage now where he is gathering vocabulary as fast as he can and loves to point at pictures, ask for the word, and repeat. So I needed something with pictures he could identify.

Dr. Reinhard is an excellent communicator and his book contains all the elements of an engrossing novel - mysterious and chilling religious practices, daunting physical obstacles, political intrigue - yet it proves that real life can be more interesting than fiction. The book is very readable and is difficult to put down once started. Dr. Reinhardhas clearly done his homework in terms of researching the lone-gone Inca civilization and how it relates to the present situation in Peru and how the Ice Maiden and other mummies form a bridge between past and present. The generous use of illustrations adds tremendously to the enjoyment and understanding of one of the most important archeological finds of the 20th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Layman Archaeology Adventure","review":"Reinhard has done a masterful job of writing up a fantastic archaeological find for the layman who is without formal anthropological education. The mountaineering aspect of both Reinhard and friends and the Inca 500 years ago is beyond ordinary. The politics of trying to do a scientific adventure in a third world country is described very well. I recently (Nov '08) did similar work; volunteer conservation trail work, teaching mountain rescue to local rangers/police, ruin and trail stabilization, etc. in Peru and can fully appreciate his descriptions of the surroundings. I recommend this book for anyone planning a trip to the Arequipa and Cuzco areas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Here!","review":"Save your money. This book lacks real wit, nor do the pictures give it a boost. The text is not funny, the whole thing looks like it was slapped together quickly. I gave it two stars for the fine grade paper and the idea which was not realized. Buy James Lileks \\"Gallery of Regrettable Food\\" if you like the notion of razor sharp wit wedded to pictures from bygone times."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just knew it","review":"I picked it up, unknowing, thumbed through it for a minute or two, and thought \\"MST3K.\\" But without the cleverness.The lethally sweet pictures are cute (ever notice that \\"cute\\" is a four-letter word?) and added captions funny enough, for the first two pages. Maybe three. Then I started wondering, \\"OK, I got that joke - what's next?\\" There is no next, just the same joke again and again.At one point I was hospitalized and on heavy painkillers. I tried to watch the Flintstones, but turned it off when I couldn't follow the plot. If you know someone in that state, for medical or recreational reasons, they'll experience all of the book's humor for the first time again and again. They'll love it. That's not me, though, at least not today.-- ww"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality material.","review":"The author claims he is \\"authorized to transmit material\\" - well not on the evidence presented in this book. Sometimes we can be so full of ourselves...A serious factual error on page 2 (repeated later in the book, and undermining the credibility the author professes to have), mis-spelling the names of his 'teachers', numerous typos, gross generalisations and dumbing-down of essential material do not bode well for this book.Add to this some mundane re-hashing and hackery of ideas (expressed concisely and appropriately outside this book by others clearly more qualified), a penchant for tittle-tattle, other people's stories, name-dropping, self-promtion and low-level writing skill points inevitably to the conclusion that this line of work demands much finer product in its representation.Any old rubbish will not do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous and incompetent, to give exercises in a book","review":"The author writes about an exercise in this book, the socalled 6-point exercise. This is very thoughtless, incompetent and rather irresponsible, as this particular exercise, as the author should know, needs preparation of a special kind, based on other inner exercises. Otherwise, this exercise can not only lead to wrong results but might even harm. Has the author not read and understood the hint Mr. Gurdjieff gave in the second series?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Acid Trip","review":"After reading Maxwell's \\"1983, The Unknown Season\\", how could I not get to his other book with the title \\"Sex and Dope Show Saga\\"? Right! There's nothing like knowing something about an author's life to give the reader some insight into their fiction. It's like the perfect eavesdropping! It took me a bit of time to get into the format that he chose to move his story along, but I was hooked by the \\"acid trip\\" page. I laughed so much, it felt that real. But it was Ernie's plight--and to a lesser extent, poor, poor Hook-- who made me want to not put the book down. Yes, there's Jed's life and his stalwart companion, Matt, who make for an interesting pair up, and Jed's Thelma Ritter-like mom with her crazy antics, and the schmuck of a Principal who really is out for the Christian slaughter. But in the end, it was because of Ernie that I needed to know, had to know the ending of this unique comedy/drama.

I totally agree with Mitizi's review. I can't express it any better, she says it all. When Ms Morsi returns to writing her books, instead of this unknown person who has written her books for the past 4 years, I will, once again, buy anything w/ her name on it.

What should we do? Where did we go wrong? What is the best 'process' for getting him back?\\" The author is a back-in-the-closet homosexual who obviously rejects his true self. Depending on how you take it, this book can make you laugh or shake with anger(it's both stupid and horrible). When I put the book back on a shelf I placed it in the history section -- between Mein Kampf and a book about Hitler's SS & The Order Of The Deathhead.

Antigone, the daughter of Oedipus, hears that the king refuses to bury one of her brothers because the king feels that he was treacherous. She expresses her disagreement and the king contemns her to death. The book can be read easily even by people unfamiliar with Greek tragedies.

I have only two requirements for a grill, it should start up and cook food. Due to a design flaw that Weber refuses to acknowledge, it's ability to start is short lived. This is due to the burner tube which has a series of large holes that feed gas into a chamber that houses the igniter so that the grill can quickly light. The problem is that once the grill is lit, those large holes release the largest amount of gas which generates the largest flames and the most heat - right onto the igniter. Any replacement igniters do not last long. I expect much better from a grill that I spent $1,000 on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stainless Steel ?","review":"I bought this grill sight unseen and agree I should have done more research. I bought the stainless version, or at least the version advertized as stainless (S-420). Basically everything weber doesn't show you on their web site is not stainless.. The entire frame, back of the lid, internal drop pans etc.. are all regular coated metal. I was really disapointed to see this coming from a company like weber.I don't think I can post a picture on Amazon, but I have posted one on other reviews. Its almost funny what this grill looks like from the back.If you want an all stainless grill, you will need to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weber S-420 Poor Design","review":"I have been a lifelong Weber fan until I bought this grill. What a piece of junk. The hot air vents are located in the front of the grill, right over all of the controls. This is a design problem in my opinion. This creates black grease across the front of the grill (so much for the pretty stainless lid). This black grease over time is not removable. Also, the vents have the effect of channeling all the heat discharge to the area of the grill where the valves are located. In my case, one of the valve controls was completely fried. I have had this grill for about 4 years and am ready to junk it. Why Weber would vent the grill to the front is a big mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING! Don't buy a Weber.

I did not want to, but Amazon website forced me to give it at least one star. Would you like to clean up a combination of grease and water overflowing from the grease pan after a rain? No retrofit? Weber's only solution is that you Have to MAKE SURE you cover the grille. Well, it started to rain during our grilling... and the grease pan overflowed and made a real MESS! Please do your homework and review Weber online. Their customer service is not only ridiculous \\"you have to make sure the cover is on\\", but also very rude and sarcastic when I sent an email. It would be a very long time before I would buy another Weber (yes, I had one for 14 years and loved it). Their Summit Series is significantly flawed, or maybe their whole line is flawed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Summit Line Has Problem","review":"The Weber Summit line of grills have a design flaw that Weber refuses to consider an issue.

Furthermore, the drip pan cannot be easily removed without almost totally spilling the greasy mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weber Summit Design Flaw","review":"This Weber Summit grill, as well as the entire Summit line has a design flaw that Weber refuses to consider an issue.

Answer: Because it has a deftly written script and superb acting by the entire cast. I won't summarize the story, as you probably know it already. Let me just say that each actor is perfect in his role, but that the great Lee J. Cobb truly stands out as the juror who, by repeatedly voting \\"guilty,\\" is really trying to punish his own son, who abandoned him. As explosive as Cobb's performance is, I cried at the end when he suddenly breaks down weeping and says, \\"Not guilty.\\" One feels that Cobb's character is finally \\"cleansing\\" himself of the pain that he has suppressed for years. This is just one of countless memorable moments in this brilliantly written, directed, and acted film. 12 ANGRY MEN is a great drama from start to finish. You MUST see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be compulsory to see this film..........","review":"Anyone who ever says \\"Oh, I like movies\\" or who states \\"My favourite film of all time is Titanic/The Postman/Sound of Music\\" etc, etc should be made to watch this film.If anyone can find fault in it (the original, I've not seen the modern remake)then could they please explain it to me so I can try to understand.Everything about this movie is perfect.

They just don't make movies like this anymore - no studio would produce this type of film for fear that it would not be \\"exciting\\" enough since the excitement comes from the viewer actually paying attention and thinking about the movie as they watch it.Anyway, this is a great film at a great price. If you like Fonda I would also suggest Fail Safe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie","review":"12 Angry Men is an excellent movie that any person can easily enjoy. It takes place during a fifties courtroom trial. The whole film is about the jury debating whether or not the accused man is innocent or guilty.

This film may be a bit slow for children to enjoy, but I am sure that some of them can. For anyone else, this is an excellent film that anyone will enjoy watching again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good movie","review":"Who would have guessed a film about 12 men arguing over a case can be so interesting and thought-provoking? Each and every one of these men is a unique character with a distinct personality that is developed over the course of the movie. You just got to love how the story progresses - where one dissenting man convinces the other jurors that the man charged with murder is not guilty. The script is incredible. Not once do you actually see what happens in court... almost the entire movie, except the end, took place in a small room, where all 12 men analyzed the evidence provided to reach a decisive, unanimous verdict.Worthy of repeated viewings. Highly recommended for the acting and script."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly great movie!","review":"This movie is a really powerful demonstration of the \\"art\\" of movie making as it is hard to find today.

The drama centers around the actions of one juror (Henry Fonda) as he marshalls all his skills to influence the other jurors to reconsider the case despite overwhelming evidence against the accused.It is absolutely fascinating to watch Henry Fonda's character as he employs various influence techniques to get each juror to change his vote to not guilty. These techniques include: reciprocity, liking, time limits, public committment, social proof."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting","review":"A marvelous look at the court system, peer pressure, and social norms then and now, this classic ranks up there with TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, INHERIT THE WIND, and a host of other great movies from the fifties and sixties.

Of course, the primary characters as portrayed by Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb dominate the story, but it would not be the \\"classic\\" it is w/o the contribution of actors such as E.G. Marshall and Jack Klugman. Well worth your time if you simply love a good story well told."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic character-driven drama","review":"This classic drama is unmatched in its emotional character-driven plot. With the most Spartan of sets (a single meeting room) and the tension created by the apparent guilt of an accused who is hardly mentioned by name, the tension grows with every moment built upon the emotions of the 12 characters. The characters are everyday individuals we all know, each with their own assumptions and emotional types. It is a study in group psychology as well as civics and perfect for classroom use in either discipline. The cast is perfect in their delivery and make this a one of a kind classic that will never be matched.

It is set in a jury room where they are debating the guilt of the defendant. It is 11 against 1, with one person not so sure. By the end of the movie, it is 11 against 1 with 1 person not so sure (only with the opposite verdict). Being made in 1957 this is a movie that can be watched by all family members and is well worth watching. One of my favorite films of all time and it is very thought provoking. Once you pay attention to the different characters in the movie and their reactions to the questions and information and each other.

You get the entire range of human experience in the 12 men on this jury, the cankerous one who vents his personal rage on strangers, the apathetic, the silent but wise, the businessman, the good man and everything in between. The motivations and drives of not just the characters we see, but the unseen defendant, DA, defense attorney, witnesses and the general public reflects true human nature. You just don't see that type of honesty in movies often enough anymore. Or this caliber of acting, directing and production. The only thing you could say bad is that there are no women or minorities on the jury, but as this is 1957, it's no surprise. Despite this, the relevancy of 12 Angry Men is still valid, especially with our justice system continuing to imprison and execute innocent people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Got to Watch It","review":"I know nothing about this movie because I wasn't given the chance to watch it.

The First half of this documentary jumps around from idea to idea while giving almost no information. None of the people presenting the ideas are credible AT ALL. It is as if someone with a home camera went to a new age convention and interviewed random people. Then once the credible people such as Jordan Maxwell are presented the dvd is practically over. Jordan maxwell doesn't say anything he didnt say in his lectures which you can watch for free on Google. And as for the person before me, who says he is making it up as he goes, he isn't.

Unfortunately, our A/S Level Literature class had to do this -terrible- book that is apparently, a work of literary art.Martha is depicted to be a self absorbed adolescent who is 'struggling' to come to terms with her self discovery. She is also coming to terms with herself as a sexual being. She is somehow, meant to represent all seventeen year old girls out there with her self indulgent views on the world. Her arrogance and pride, meant to be some of her 'positive' points, grate on the nerves. Martha, as a character reeks of unnaturalness, a pity as the story rests upon her.The only redeeming factor, in my opinion, is Lessings description of the natural beauty of South Africa and her depiction of the simmering racial tensions in the veld. The era of World War Two and the legacy of World War One perhaps, created a world which my generation could not relate to. Or at least, I could not."},{"rating":"2","title":"read \\"children of violence\\"..pass it on..read it again","review":"i can't quite fathom why this series is not more widely discussed and celebrated, can only be enormously grateful to the bookstore clerk who was so enamored of it she approached me on some instinct as i browsed the woolf section and said, \\"you have to read lessing's 'children of violence' series\\"..i read through all five novels and was struck by lessing's extraordinary insight into the mind (and heart) of young women: with martha quest, the literary characterization of the young woman emerged from half-told shadows in full astounding complexity. this alone makes the series significant. add to that lessing's brilliant writing about organizational politics and psychology, landscape, history, etc etc, and this series is truly a masterpiece. read it, pass it on to friends, read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing character creation","review":"It took me a while to get through, but this book was really, really good. It was, perhaps, one of the better written, more psychologically perceptive novels that I've read. The way Lessing builds the character of Martha Quest is as close to perfect as I've ever read. Martha is annoying. It's pretty hard to like her at all. You don't really sympathize with what she does or her motivations, since she's pretty clearly an impulsive idiot kid. Nonetheless, it's impossible not to believe what she does or see her actions as extremely genuine. There are no simple stereotypes here. I've called her an impulsive kid, and that's what she is, but I don't want to oversimplify. Just like any impulsive kid, she doesn't always do what you expect. She's not stupid, and doesn't always make the wrong decisions. She is 100% herself, and even 60 years after the book was written, she feels fresh and new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gave a s gift and was a hit!","review":"If you have a Raiders fan in your life this is a good gift to consider.

It takes great advantage of my iBook's video capability. The only issue is the music track-notes stick and last longer than they're supposed to, the track skips, slows down, or speeds forward at random intervals. It does not seem to affect gameplay, however, so my solution was simply to turn the music all the way down in the Options menu.

For us, the game started to crash the computer after about ten minutes, then would not work again unless we reinstalled it.We contacted PopCap games (a small nightmare; there's no provision for customer service on their webpage, and I had to search for a direct line to their offices), and they advised us that it was probably a bad CD-ROM.

It sounds nasty, the playing is bad, the sound is bad, but it cranks because of this. This is a song that especially works when its played as if in a garage.

With gritty humor and straight talk he shows us that leaders do not demand respect - they earn it. And when they earn it, people follow and succeed.

The author is one of the few men on the national scene who can write about these topics on a \\"been there, done that\\" basis.Most impressive to me was that the book is heavily laden with extensive quotes by members of the Hardcore Battalion rather than just the author's own recollections. It's graphic, thorough and credible. Additionally, the book's final chapter does an excellent job of relating the story of the Hardcore Battalion in 1969 Vietnam to the challenges now facing the US armed forces in carrying out the war against terrorism. Definately worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Not To Late To Learn The Lesson","review":"Colonel Hackworth has done it again.

What a powerful voice! Listen to this album and you will see what I mean. First of all this album hit the streets back in 1981 and proved to the music world that Chaka Khan was in the same league as legendary artists such as the Queen of Soul, Aretha Franklin, Patti Labelle, Gladys Knight, and Dionne Warwick. Chaka's WHAT CHA' GONNA DO FOR ME was certified gold and the title track topped the R&B singles chart. My favorite tracks have to be the title track, \\"Any Old Sunday\\", and \\"Father He Said.\\" The latter mentioned does not seem to garner much merit, but the fact that her vocals are awesomely powerful make it worth my listen every time I play this album. Also try Chaka's 1980 album NAUGHTY, which is just as good as this one, maybe a tad better in terms of continuity of material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bumpin'","review":"I Love me some Chaka Khan always have always will She is so unique&talented with her range&vibe.She breaks styles in halves.the title cut is a classic that you can't ever shake from.her take on \\"We can Work it Out\\" is a Mutha for the ears.Her madd take on \\"Night in Tunisia\\" is a gem.She is one of the Greatest Vocalists Ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs More Stars","review":"There aren't enough stars here to rate this one. This was a defining moment in Chaka's career. She took some risks with such material in terms of style. It is an ecclectic mix of R&B, Rock, Disco, Jazz & Pop. I mean the Beatles & the Dizzy Guillespie covers alone make this a worthy purchase. She make them her own while respecting the intentions of the authors. She rips into We Can Work It Out, reminding me of the pure sassy enrgy Aretha had with 'Respect' back in the sixties. She blends with Miles on Night in Tunisia with such fluidity Billie & Ella would be proud!! The title track is a classic dancefloor filler for the cool uptown set. 'I Know You - I Live You\\" is still a gay club staple to this day. We Got Each Other is an amazing vocal workout she shares with Mark Stevens, her brother. Any Old Sunday has the classic Chake inspired bassline - if you're a true fan, you know what I mean!!

Many of the songs are mediocre at best (\\"Comfort Me\\", \\"Torn\\", \\"Encrypted\\"), the backing vocals remind me of corny 90's power rock ballads, and the most notable issue are the weak melodies, almost comical at times.The standard edition does not list the band members or what they play, who produced or recorded it, special thanks, etc. This is the only disc I own without liner notes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow... just wow...","review":"That is how I felt when I first heard this album. I have to admit, this was my first introduction to Carl Cadden-James, Gary Wehrkamp and Shadow Gallery and I can safely say that I was not dissapointed at all. This is a gem of Progressive Rock/Metal and music in general.There is one way to describe this album, beautiful. Listening to \\"Comfort Me\\" for the first time is like nothing you have experienced yet.

I'm wouldn't call myself a huge prog-metal fan, but I do like good music when I hear it, and this is definetally not that good. Bands that come to mind in the game gendre would be Symphony X, Evergrey or Therion. Although they have the same style in common the one thing they have that this band does not is catchy tunes and engaging vocals. What Room V has to offer is rehashed prog-metal with bland non-interesting vocals that seem to me belong more in a high school play. If you can't get enough prog-metal then this one's for you. All others should stay away and get your prog fix from better sources. Unless you like uninspired lyrics like \\"And now you've gone away, I've begged you baby, please don't go away\\"...yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Musicians, Strange Approach","review":"Sometimes you get fooled by the sample audio files on Amazon and this is one of those times. The musicians are top notch prog-rockers. That being said, I find their approach off-putting.

Whoever at Publisher's Weekly said his prose is \\"axe-sharp\\" should be fired. This is a novel which requires no work whatsoever on the part of the reader (well, maybe only to stifle laughter at Heppner's terrible sentences and dialogue), uses no imagination, and would be utterly forgettable if it wasn't so unbelievably awful.It's supposedly satire but it's not funny, it's supposedly literary but contains no artistry whatsoever. The Egg Code showed some promise, which is how I unfortunately got suckered into buying Pike's Folly. I won't be fooled again. This feels like something Heppner wrote in twenty minutes to fulfill a book contract. This is a work of fiction which is utterly without merit. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring - bland - bad","review":"Heppner's first, bloated novel, \\"The Egg Code,\\" was critically well-received but, on its own, a knockoff of everything trite and tedious you might come across in a graduate-school writing program. Toss in a bit of Powers, a dash of Wallace, some Barthian hyperbole, some Pynchonian futurizing--blah, blah, blah--and you have \\"The Egg Code,\\" one of the worst books ever written, despite the gargantuan advance and \\"postmodern\\" preening of its author.Now, Heppner's back...and worse than before. If that's possible. \\"Pike's Folly\\" is a skeleton of a book: poorly written, blandly plotted. At least the book has one purpose: it's now supporting me left-leaning toilet.

The precious few insights he offered into the real workings of some wonderful kitchens were interesting, but he wound up the telling of every part of his professional life (except his time with Ducasse) by telling us that while that particular chef and his staff obviously meant well, they did not have the true commitment to preparing and presenting great food like Psaltis himself did. (His favorite backhanded compliment went something like, While that may be fine for some kitchens, it wasn't up to my standards.)By the end of the book, I had grown weary of Psaltis's snobbish take that no one else could live up to his standards. If he walked into my kitchen with that attitude, he wouldn't last five minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"subtitle \\" I cook for the rich\\"","review":"With a brother in publishing does that explain how such a dull read was published?Some name dropping and various gossip but not much of how/why the 10 year old became a 'world class' seasoned chef.....I got an advanced review copy and to make it even less interesting there were no photos!Not much of an autobiography!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a dictated pseudo-memoir","review":"Doug Psaltis's twin brother is in the book biz, which might explain how such thin material got published. Can see it: \\"Sit down, Doug, and talk to the tape recorder; we'll fix it later.\\" They transcribed it but they didn't fix it. You learn the name of every cook in every kitchen but nothing about the taste of the food. And nothing at all about what Doug learned (techniques? flavors? recipes?). With no professional training except what he picks up on the job, he hangs on to become chef de cuisine in one of Alain Ducasse's kitchens. So? Brilliant? Lucky? Or did he just keep showing up? You come away from this dreadfully boring book with no sense at all of what makes Doug special, and you might be right in suspecting there's nothing special at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read.","review":"A fun read, an interesting insight into some famous kitchens, with contrasts from New York to California.

Many of these manage to convey not only atmosphere, but also the genuine love that professionals in the culinary industry have for food. Unfortunately this book does not convey any love of cuisine to the reader. I have read books by Michael Ruhlman, Bill Buford and others, and this book comes nowhere near the quality fo those simply because of it's lack of feeling. For all the emotion Mr Psaltis manages to convey, he might as well have been writing a book on computer programming. I am not asking for 'food porn' of any sort, but this book seems to be very soulless, and in the end comes out as quite boring reading. The author seems to have a very high opinion of himself, and not in a self-effacing manner either."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN!","review":"This anime is fun but you need to watch the first season before you watch it.

The ending if you can call it that seemed to be left unfinished and from what I could find the manga goes much farther into the characters giving them more depth. I was surprised that there wasn't a third series in the works and several sites were waiting and emailing anyone they could for information.

Crim have let me down bigtime in the same way here. Yeah, yeah--I know Hendrix put a certain ammount of this sort of thing on \\"Electric Ladyland\\", but it fell in the midst of a lot of incomparable avant-garde blues playing.

This release wonders through the notes like a drunken student at a college frat party."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crimson experiment succeeds","review":"Unlike most bands who are lost outside of the three chord, three chorus, three minute song world, King Crimson seeks to move beyond such conventionality and into experimentation. On Thrakattak, they include improvisations recorded live on their 1995 tour. At first, I was skeptical as to how these improvisations would stand together sans the composed material that was also part of the performance. But quickly, my fears dispersed as I listened. Crimson has always been a great improvisational band, and the talent for making these instrumentals interesting shows through here. This album is all the more needed as an antidote to the pre-programmed pop that pervades the airwaves in 2000."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlistenable","review":"I am a big prog nerd and a big Crimson fan. But the stuff here (one would be hard pressed to call it music) is an unending continuous racket that will induce nothing but a pounding headache in the listener within a very few minutes.

I can listen to Albert Ayler and Sun Ra at their most extreme, but this dreadful mess is totally irrelevant to any kind of \\"music\\" whatsoever.

I love King Crimson, but this CD sucks. Don't look for any songs here. It's a cacophany of \\"improvisational\\" dissonance. My cat's ears bled from this and it's the first time my normally open minded wife (loves Three of a Perfect Pair) told me something I owned sucked.

After all, the one improvisation worth of note\\"Thrak\\" has already been featured twice on the band's other live album B'BOOM: AN OFFICIAL BOOTLEG LIVE IN ARGENTINA 1994. The liner notes to the compact disc answer that King Crimson could release THRAKATTAK on the band's own label(Discipline Global Mobile) because profit-driven major labels would not allow the band to act on its \\"wilder impulses\\".

It is the foundation of a sense of self worth and self-confidence. It is self-love in its benign form. But then, having fulfilled its role, it is replaced by love directed at others (object love). It is here that pathologies occur when the individual is unable to successfully accomplish this transition. Pathological narcissism is a lot more than a fixation on an early developmental phase, though. This is the first weak point of this otherwise seminal work. It is, well, fixated, on a psychodynamic-object relations scenario. additionally, the distinctions between borderline conditions and pathological narcissism - both states of low organization of the personality - are blurred. Otherwise, it is a masterpiece of hands-on clinical work well worth perusing. Sam Vaknin, author of 'Malignant Self Love - Narcissism Revisited'."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterful Treatment of a Turbulent Era","review":"This book is one of the best I have ever read on this era in Medieval history. Dr. Runciman leaves no stone unturned in presenting an entertaining, yet enlightening narrative of the events which precipitated the First Crusade, the hardships endured by the Franks during these holy wars, and the strategies employed by the Byzantine, Frankish, and Moslem rulers in conquest and counter-conquest in the Levant. One only wishes he had given more glimpses into the lives of the foot-soldiers and natives and the impact of the war, both socially and economically, on them. Notwithstanding, the book is a classic survey of the First Crusade. I am now reading Volume II in the series and find it equally fascinating."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great example of why people dislike history","review":"I purchased these books laregely based on the recommendations here at Amazon. However, I was extremely dissappointed in them. I stopped reading after book one. Perhaps my problem was in my expectations. I was looking for an excellent narrative on the crusades. These read more like a reference/text book.The pages are THICK with information. However, the failure of the author is that he just doesn't \\"tell\\" the story. In a single page he can introduce 5 locations and 10 people, 8 of whom are dead before the page is finished. If you are looking for detailed information on the crusades, I can only assume that it is likely in these tomes. If you are looking for the story of the crusades, you won't find it here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well made leather bag","review":"Solid construction, good quality leather and good design.

The video quality is bootlegish. 35mm film should transfer into wonderful 16:9 1080p quality. Now I know why I sold my audio gear in the early 80's and left the scene for 25 years. The 80's were the dark ages of R&R; music. Those costumes are repulsive and the music was lost, just a shadow of what it was in the 60's and early 70's.....We had this metal music and disco.

Her prose (especially her talent for visual description) is deep and compelling; it helps the plot draw you into a totally believable fantasy world; and you'll end up caring deeply about the political/religious issues that her characters face with various levels of commitment and expedience.

This book is similarly lacking in depth and generally poorly written, so I can't recommend it. They spend page after page talking about workarounds for things that have been fixed or made obsolete by SS 2000. If they don't know about these very basic things, you have to wonder what else they don't know about.

You *won't* learn to write SQL Server 2000 procedures by reading this book.The third problem is the SS2K coverage - it's barely there. Many workarounds are shown for things that SS2K makes obsolete anyway. Obviously the book was written for SQL 7.0, then reworked for SS2K.

The book is full of cliched, trite stuff like this. What it's not full of is useful technical info.

DO NOT EVEN PLAY!!! COMPLETE RIP OFF!!!","review":"This is not an authentic White Collar Season 3 DVD set! In fact it is a pirated set. The first DVD doesn't even play and the other DVDs are so pixelated and choppy that there is no way this set is genuine! I understand that $15 dollars is an absolute steal for a brand new set of these DVDs, but that is what was advertised. Would never have bought illegal pirated DVDs! I honestly cannot believe that Amazon allows your company to sell on their site. All your wonderful reviews most definitely must also be a fraud, because no one is going to be happy or satisfied with ripped versions of DVDs. I what these exchanged for REAL AUTHENTIC White Collar Season 3 DVDS or my money BACK!!!

What show were you looking at? Even if there was an increase, it's still one of the cleanest things one can watch on TV. And to add to that, the naysayers are talking about a decrease in quality in the series. I hope nobody's taking these comments seriously at USA. In both White Collar and Royal Pains, they have two of the most entertaining and clever TV series ever seen on American TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Show","review":"Wish the DVD had better commentaries by the directors and actors.

I can't wait for the next one to come out and I'm not even done with the 3rd Season yet. Now that's good..Also a good t.v. show by the same network is Burn Notice.

The con and the mentor, but the mentor is learning a lot from the conman. Its sort of a big brother with the little brother knowing the answers but the big brother trying to keep him in line. The writing on this show is phenomenonal and they casted this show perfectly. Its great to see the personal side with DeKay and Thiessen. I wish they would have more scenes with Boomer and the character Sara Ellis. It would be great to add more celebrities (in cameo) into the show since they are filmed in New York City. How about during a concert at Madison Square Gardens?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better dressed than ever","review":"Series 3 of White collar continued to surprise me.

Like the Civil War novel, \\"The Killer Angels\\", it describes real history with real historical characters mixed in with a few composite or fictional characters. The scope of this book is larger, covering the run up to the war, the politics of the war in Washington, the the three major theaters of action: Great Lakes, Chesapeake Bay, and Gulf Coast. The major characters are James and Dolley Madison, Winfield Scott, and Andrew Jackson. I find particularly compelling the description of the different types and styles of leadership. Madison's cerebral style, Scott's military professionalism, and Jackson's charismatic dynamic style, and the growth of these characters through the war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book-weak ending","review":"This is a wonderful book that I would recommend to anyone who is an avid reader of historical fiction. It had me glued to the pages until, the end, however, when I got the faint impression that Nevin had let the characterizations slip and let the battle scenes take over. Overall, however, this is a MUST READ for any history enthusiast. Have fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A well-written historical novel","review":"I thought the book was well done. The author succeeded, for me at least, in making those long-ago people come alive. The descriptions of the battles were quite vivid, without being gory. I was left looking forward to more books by this author on other wars or events. All in all, a well-written historical novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Historical Fiction","review":"I enjoyed reading about our country in it's infancy --- the political trials & turmoil that Madison had to endure trying to cement a union in trying times --- the struggling young democracy. The characters Nevin describes are real people not cardboard cutouts idealized thru time. I also enjoyed descriptions of the battle -- especially the Battle for New Orleans -- & how they progressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific read! Well crafted and absorbing!","review":"Highly recommend this book. David Nevin has done an excellent job in providing the reader with the tastes, smells, political machinations and the high drama atmosphere of the struggling American nation in 1812. The reader emerges with a greater appreciation and admiration for James and Dolley Madison, Andrew and Rachel Jackson. Has sent me on the hunt for more books covering the same period.David Phelps"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too much fiction, not enough history","review":"I read this book based on reviews describing the rich narrative on the war. I was disappointed. There could have been much more on how decisions were made; particularly in regards to the treaty that ended the conflict. The cringe factor is very high with ridiculous dialogue and unnecessary descriptions of arousal of \\"Jimmy\\" Madison by Dolly and other personal relationships and dialogue that did not seem credible. The build up to the battle of New Orleans was interminable relative to any other part of the book and still did not give a good account of what actually happened. I read to the end because this is a war that has not been deeply covered by historians but this was not a suitable alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy anything reconditioned","review":"It's going to cost me more to return this thing than I paid for the item.

Just what this compilation's producers were thinking of when they decided to include the songs by Dynasty, Kraftwerk, Marvin Gaye, Ashford & Simpson, Kano, The People's Choice and the others that managed to make it onto this CD is beyond me as they are all uptempo Disco hits that got plenty of exposure in the clubs but that most certainly don't belong on a romantic music series. If you are looking for a compilation of late-1970s or early-'80s Disco and Urban R&B you'll probably like this compilation but it should never have been included as part of the \\"Smooth Grooves\\" line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Florida's Stars and garage bands","review":"If you order this book be aware that it is a 2 volume set.

You can also buy this book from the publisher and you will get both volumes for the $99.95 price that is advertised. The book is great if you grew up in Florida and were attending all the dances locally. It has great info on the bands that put out records and who went on to stardom nationally.

However the sequel turned out to be the largest disappointment I've ever experienced from a game. 3 was both a return to form and a change in direction for the series, but all in all an excellent game for anyone looking to kick some demon butt and challenge themselves. If you get this set, don't bother with 2. It's not a broken game, but it's almost completely devoid of fun or anything that made the first game special. If you enjoy games like God of War, Dante's Inferno, Heavenly Sword, and the new Castlevania, You should enjoy this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basketball Fun & Skill Building At The Same Time!","review":"Boy, did my son and I have a great time looking at this video.

It's not the charming drawing room type, with tea and butlers and crumpets and vicars. More gritty, windswept, somber scenery. Vera is a shrewd, sometimes impatient, sometimes motherly detective who gets results. The fun part is she hypothesizes out loud with her team as to who is the villain and why--the crimes are complex. I couldn't guess who the perpetrators were as there are enough plausible plot lines, motives and villains. These stories seem very realistic, not cozy, but not overly-gruesome either. Love to get on the treadmill and exercise to these. The suspense keeps you interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best","review":"The best of British tv. Never dull, never predictable,.

Why give advice when you realy make the job a crusade yourself?Episode two explains so much I missed plot wise, by not watching this episode first. Sometimes the photography is rather dark, but so authentic. I love Midsomer Murders. However, Single-Handed and Vera are now my two favorites. If anyone can tell me what \\"bierens\\" or some sort of slang for kids is, I would appreciate it.The scene burning her father's possessions, and saying I like this \\"farm couple AND the scene helping a lost little boy who is hiding, when she lacks mothering skills, are priceless.I purchased the video myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique Detective","review":"Were quite surprised when we viewed the DVD.

She us not that vibrant go-getter as she once was. I am starting to believe that Tamara Hayle is getting to be too old for the private detective business. The book had some eye stretching points, but for the most part, the ending was very disappointing. In the first two series, I couldn't put the books down! In fact, I read them both in a matter of days. But this, by far, has got to be Valerie's most uninspiring work to date.

I was disappointed!The writing style chosen by the author is terse, as if writing space is at a premium - and this for a book which is 600+ pages long. The examples are badly chosen in my opinion, and the explanation of basic concepts is presented in the style of a reference manual. Take for example the explanation of the NOTATION element attribute: \\"A notation type attribute contains the name of a notation declared in the document's DTD... In theory, it could be used to associate types with particular elements, as well as limiting the types associated with the elements\\".At this stage, I gave up on this book and went instead to Hunter's \\"Beginning XML\\".

You must \\"move\\" both characters separately - very repetitive. Huge mathematical equations that go on and on to complete a task. This game contains a puzzle in which you must beat the computer. Until you do (twice in a row) you are stuck and cannot go any further in the game. I feel that there are only two good things about this game (1) If you want to solve this game you can purchase the cheats for an additional $... from the company and (2) this was a gift - I did not waste my money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad...","review":"Okay, first off, I've played MYST since I was five, so don't think I don't know about this stuff. *ahem* Anyway...it's horrible.First off, the storyline is so...bland...boring...bizarre...(need I go on?)... It lacks the depth that I expected.Second of all, the puzzles are almost impossible to solve. My dad and I eventually stopped playing it, even after we looked at the walkthrough on the internet, because nothing was coming together right and we were basically just walking back and forth thinking we missed something. Well, there's really nothing to miss...it's just poorly done, that's all...Third of all, despite what you may think, the graphics aren't that great. Sure, the music is OK, but...I've seen better...So, the verdict? I would suggest skipping right on out of this web page and ordering yourself a copy of Real MYST."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelieveably bad","review":"CDROM version. This game is horrible. The graphics [arn't very good], the gameplay is slow, it keeps crashing, and the game riddles are insanely difficult because there is no logical flow to them. I wanted a game that was like MYST and got a big piece of do-do. Stay away at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the Bugs!","review":"Although this title has quite a few reviews, I wanted to add the information that some people, myself included, have found the game to be extremely buggy. I have the CD version, and it has some serious bugs. The worst is that when you switch from one character to the other, the current game is not loaded. If you save often, you can always load the correct one, except when you get to a puzzle where both characters have to work cooperatively. In that case, it is impossible to get past this puzzle because no game will exist with the cooperative actions in it (if you see what I mean). After struggling with this game for 3 days, I threw it in the trash. I've never done that before. The bugs, combined with some of the most irritating puzzles I've ever encountered (can't save in a multiple part puzzle, for example) made this game a total waste of $..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Schizm DVD release","review":"I've just started to play. As far the game seems to be an excellent Myst-like adventure. Stunning graphic (despite 640x480 resolution), 360 degree view, 4-point 3D sound and good storyline make it a real time-thief. Only thing that really annoys me is the quality of cut-scenes. Acting (wooden indeed) and animations (especially the first one!) should be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pshaw, ignore it.","review":"This is a nice game, but somewhere around the second or third puzzle I had to cheat to figure out how it worked. No sane person could figure it out. I NEVER would have.I wouldn't recommend it. I never even finished it. How can I if I have to cheat to do the puzzels?"},{"rating":"2","title":"It rocks","review":"hey there, wanna tell you why most of you guys didn't like Schism? Because you weren't supposed to play it! Go play Larry, Syberia or something else! For those of you who have no patience DO NOT BUY Schizm. Yes it's a difficult game but most puzzles are very nice. They have no ... solutions like aother ...adventures. I am a die-hard Riven player and I find Schizm very astonishing too. To be honest I haven't finished it yet but I will in a couple of days I guess. For those of you who REALLY Like Myst series, just like me, go buy Schizm now! For you who have found games like Syberia difficult don't even bother.

In fact it was MADE for DVD-ROM. The CD-ROM version offered here for pre-order is very scaled down and not equal in quality.

Don't expect that the real game is the same as the screenshots. The graphic is terrible compared to this in Myst III Exile. I expected to see something much better. Almost all graphics contain really big squares (10x10 or 15x15 pixels) and look like JPEG images that are compressed 70-80 times. Don't tell me that I have a hardware problem - I'm with PIII @ 1GHz, GeForce II, DirectX 8a and latest NVIDIA drivers, and games like Unreal Tournament, Deep Space Nine - The Fallen, Max Payne and Myst III Exile look fantastic on this machine.Maybe the DVD version is better.The mouse navigation is not good also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the DVD version!","review":"Do NOT buy the CD-ROM Version of this game! I made the mistake of buying the game on CD-ROM. The game was so butchered and chopped up just to get it to run in the CD-ROM drive that the game was impossible to play. I just got the DVD version. Its GREAT. The graphics flow. There are tiny animated sequences that are not in the CD-ROM version. There are many more clues and indicators that tell you that you are doing the right thing that are not available in the CD-ROM version. I have only played the DVD game for about an hour last night, but I am convinced!So far I would give the DVD version a 4 star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"ummm- does this make the slightest bit of sense","review":"While the gameplay was enjoyable, and the puzzles may have been difficult- I needed help and I had gotten through Riven and Myst III in 2 days a piece, I found that I could not get into the fun. The tasks seemed more laborious than puzzles, and the graphics were absolutely terrible. I found it difficult and annoying to change characters and disliked the funky camera angles. At some points, you seem 5 feet off the ground and at others about 8. The storyline was also terrible- I still do not completely understand what the logic is behind what happened where and who the heck the gatekeeper and Matia are. There are also no ways to fail- failure is an option in real life.The main purpose for buying this game was to see great graphics, piece together a great storyline, and to tackle mediocre to hard puzzles. This game provided none of the above. Yuck"},{"rating":"1","title":"Schizm: Mysterious Journey","review":"Why aren't you offering the DVD version of the game? It is available from Dreamcatcher--but they have been having problems at their website and it is impossible to order either on the internet or by phone.

Just throw your money away instead!","review":"I purchased thsi game in the discount section of a local retailer thinking I would have a good alternative to the usual first person shooter clones that are flooding the market.After starting up the game and watching the two main characters do their thing It became quickly apparent that no matter what I tried to do the curser indicated that no action was possible for me.I guesss the game consists of installing it, watching the intro, and then uninstalling it. Not as I expected at all.Moreover the game is unsupported. My copy is in the trash now!I Wish I had the money I spent on it instead!In my opinion a genuine Rip Off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I don't mind the graphics or interface of this game, but I do find the puzzles both trivial and frustrating. I don't much care for games that require me to keep detailed notes of obscure symbols, sounds, etc., some of which may be useful later. (I recognize that there are people that do enjoy this, and consider this a mark of a good game -- I'm simply not one of them. Since I don't usually play a game all at once, but over the course of two or three weeks, I find this process tedious.) I finally went to a walkthrough and, frankly, I never would have figured out the solution to the first puzzle. I'm not an idiot, and have played many of these kinds of games before, but this one is, in my opinion, not worth the trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money unless you're a masochist","review":"Like many before me, I give mixed reviews because this is both good and bad. The bad outweighs the good overall because the bad is so, well, BAD! I thought the music and graphics were gorgeous. I found the cursor was difficult to use. It took me two or three tries and reinstalls to realise the problem was you needed to swing the cursor left and right to get a response. Bizarre. I found the puzzles had no relation to the environment, and that really put me off. I spent a few hours and solved the first two puzzles by guesswork. That is not what I want the game for; I want to use the old noodle, but not merely guess. It almost seemed random, but since I didn't go through it all, I cannot say for certain if that were the case or not. Overall, any of the Myst games would be preferable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Purchase","review":"I agree wholeheartedly with reviewer Stebbins19. After a nice start, this game becomes furiously tedious. Shoveling discs around to get back to some island to ... I don't know, look at the shape of a sun? Or maybe not? The games are characterized by an arbitrariness (not clear logic) that destroys the possibility of satisfaction. I just spent an afternoon trying to work backwards from an answer (found in a walkthrough) to the clues or *instruction* provided in the game. I could find no link (the triangle puzzle). The sound (voice) puzzle is poor. I like the guys who made this game about as much as I like telemarketers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic metal you can't go wrong","review":"Please be informed that this is not their first album.

It was made of imported cheap brass and and the grip was stiff and plastic. Also, it did not fit together well and was hard to connect.

This novel differs from some of his others in that the hero actually has a sex life.While, I would highly recommend this book, Francis does throw out a number of easy clues to figure out the true villian in the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, slight change of formula here","review":"In many ways this is a quintessential Francis novel, with a fairly normal, likeable hero put into a situation where he is subjected to physical and mental challenges. The plot here is pretty good, although somewhat far fetched. However, this novel varies from the typical successful Francis formuala by having a sexual interlude between the hero and a female supporting character quite early on in the story. This is unusual, since Francis' characters are typcially fairly chaste, but this has the addes uniqueness of having the supporting female character be an older woman who wants to experience sex and chooses the hero, barely recovered from a dangerous brush with criminal types, as her man. This is diverting mostly because it seems to me that it is so different from the norm! I was quite taken aback by this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Francis hit","review":"Much, much better than I'd hoped :)Young accountant Roland Britten is kidnapped (twice!) and has no clue as to why this should've happened to him - a non-descript, normal, guy. But as old enemies and friends seem suddenly to change their behaviour towards him, he begins to suspect foul play. The only problem is - he doesn't know how best to avoid the traps that await him, before something really terminal happens...I didn't know I'd enjoy this book so much - from the reviews it was supposed to be more average than it proved. Even if I'm a fan of Mr. Francis', I am trying to be objective - and I think this one stands on the same row as \\"The Danger\\", \\"Rat Race\\" and \\"Proof\\".A very enjoyable mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Love Love these trains","review":"I've purchased these as gifts and are always a favorite.

Very informative liner notes. One has to really into Gospel to appreiciate the early recordings (Mostly found on Disc 1).The sound changes on Disc 2 (More modern sounding) ala The Soul Stirrers, the Mid 50's recordings of the Swan Silvertones. Very enjoyable throughtout. Should have released on seperate Volumes."},{"rating":"1","title":"I SHALL NOT BE MOVED","review":"This historical compilation of the Harmonizing Four although well packaged with great liner notes about the history of the group; was very disappointing to me. I wished there was a better way to have cleaned up the production values so that the true essence of the group's vocal harmonies could distinctively be heard. Instead unfortunately it's like although Cd formatted; listening to a very aged 78/33 mp phonograph record on the 1st disc. The second disc was better due to the fact that they were some of the group's later recordings in their middle years. I just wished disc two would have had a better sampling, and featured the better of their best recordings. If you're a collector or history buff. This is for you. If you're desiring good quality listening? Skip this one! Over half of this project is inaudible and annoying static. Also if they'd featured their most famous songs mentioned in the liner notes it'd have made the difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad soloists","review":"This is a symphony, and as far as that is concerned, This recording is very good. J?rvi brings out the best of the G?teborg sources, and it's all recorded in clear sound by the BIS-engineers. But this symphony also includes many parts of singing, and that's where my objections come. The choral parts are OK, but the soloists really aren't. I had to turn it of the first time I listened to it, take a short break and then begin again from the start. The vibrato and strain from just about every voice is extremely disturbing. This is most surprising since you're usually spoiled with good recordings from the BIS-label. You ought to get another version of this fine symphony. Solti has made a great version for Decca with just as great solo-singing as conducting, and Bernstein (though always being Bernstein) makes another almost as good version for DG. Both these are definately worth their money even if they would cost twice as much as this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author didn't seem to read the first 3 books carefully.","review":"I couldn't finish this book. I know that may make my opinion invalid to many, but I just couldn't.It was infuriating the way the author changed the mannerisms of many of the characters, including their grasp on the English language. One of the more prominent supporting characters went from speaking like this in the second book: \\"Just because I am in union with you at the moment, it does not mean that I am delving into your innermost secrets, my sweet.\\" to THIS in the fourth: \\"And if correct is the Bombay being, Being Clive? If led we are by secret Dungeonmasters, might they not also in strangeglowfireplace be?\\"I just can't justify spending more time on a series whose multiple authors seem to have no respect for the work of those who came before them.

Though I have in the past mainly bought Barrons's books for test preparation, I must say that the Princeton Review has outdown them in the AP test prep. department. I found this book to be very good at being concise and to the point, while providing those students who need extra help with extra problems with complete explanations.

It covers all the major areas and goes into about as much depth as you *need* for the test. If you're hoping to unlock the deeper mysteries of chemistry, this isn't the book for you, but if you're a student who slept through the class and now has two weeks left before exam time, this is a near-perfect cram guide.

There are plenty of colored diagrams of her designs, but (as is true of many of her other books) woefully little in the way of instructions, sizes, yardages, etc. This is mainly a 47 page combination coloring book for her designs...and a \\"new\\" design for \\"Barn Raising\\".

While Loscil flirts with glitches and odd rhythmic sounds, sometimes in a fast techno-like beat, he grounds most of the music in drones and slow, subtle chord harmonies. These make for compelling listening, whether acitve or passive. My favorite songs are the ones squarely on the dark-side (minor keys) - like Gymnote, Resurgam, Triton and Kursk. The music sounds very simple, perhaps even to the point that one asks - where's the talent? But, Loscil pulls off a hard task - minimalist composition with deep and moving effect. I highly recommend this albumn to fans of dark ambient music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great if you dont have a stupid iPod or iPhone","review":"This is a great product that holds my Palm Pre well during my workouts.

Most of the pieces in My Kind of Place have appeared in The New Yorker Magazine and others. They cover a wide range of offbeat topics.Since these articles are all over the map, so to speak, you may end up picking and choosing. Some are very short and personal, others are longer and more journalistic. Some of my favorites were the piece on baby beauty pageants, in which Orlean brings out the rather creepy aspect of such contests very subtly; the taxidermy convention, also a surreal occasion; and a stay in Midland, Texas, a dusty oil town whose claim to fame is being the hometown of George W. Bush.Orlean's travels outside the States were also good, just not quite as interesting as when she explores the weirdness that exists in our own back yard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good writer; uninteresting topics","review":"I think Susan Orlean is a very talented writer, but a lot of the essays in tihs book left me wanting. I liked the essays about the social fabric of a particular place (such as her visit to Midland, Texas). Much less interesting to me were her essays about a grocery store, taxidermy convention,and beauty pageant, often in exhausting detail. For example, if you want to know everything about how a small supermarket appeals to a group of diverse customers, then this is the book for you. But I grew weary of her describing the delivery schedule, stocking schedule, customer complaints, managerial challenges, etc. You get the picture. Orleans can be fascinated by any topic, no matter how mundane. I am often described by friends as a very curious person, but even I could not get into a lot of these topics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"I normally love travel essays, but this one was unexpectedly boring. The cover made me think it was going to be thrilling and exciting, but it was just a bunch of articles the author had published elsewhere and lumped into this book.I only got through the first two articles before putting the book down and never picking it up again. I've been looking for a great woman travel writer, but I'm sad to say I didn't find it in Susan Orlean.

Take the time to read the reviews before purchase, if there are no reviews, move on, there are plenty of other vendors who want your business.My battery will be a year old in May of 2012, if there is a one year warranty let me know.

The online picture suggests these gloves are the ones that come in the box, a better quality glove. However, the gloves are the ones packaged in plastic bags, a poorer quality product. Also, one of the gloves I purchased arrived damaged--the glove fingertips of two fingers was cut off by what looks like a box cutter.

I've been using this brand for years, and recently have found that after a short while, the fingertips become sticky/gummy and during dish-washing and rinsing, they leave cross-hatched residue marks on all my hand-washed dishes! And whatever these gloves are made of, it's dang near impossible to get these marks off my glasses, dishes, pots and pans and silverwear.First I thought it was a defective pair, and threw them out (they were relatively new, a couple of weeks old maybe)and replaced with a new pair.

I go through 2 pairs a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average--nothing spectacular","review":"With all the rave reviews, I expected this book to be spectacular. It wasn't. It was simply average, and nothing more than a bunch of stories about Kay's personal life, which I didn't find that interesting. Okay, Kay, you've got manic-depression and you're worried about telling your friends, your boss, you're worried about losing ward privileges, etc. I get it. I get it.

Although the topic is not the most action-packed persay, it was not as descriptive as I would have hoped.

Beyond that, I found the writing rambling and repetitive. The utter lack of situational details and contradictory statements makes me wonder if this author really does suffer from manic depressive disorder to the extent she claims. I find her pretentious and condescending, and sense that the book is written primarily for the purposes of self-glorification rather than to give an honest depiction of life in unique circumstances; something I expect from a good memoir."},{"rating":"2","title":"It help me understand my husband's depression.

There is a new therapy approved by the FDA in August of 2005: vagus nerve stimulation. I read the book \\"Out of the Black Hole: The Patient's Guide to Vagus Nerve Stimulation and Depression\\":.

She is a psychologist who heads a psychiatric department. If you have read this book, you know that.I've read over a dozen books on Bipolar Disorder. Being Bipolar myself, I really felt a kinship with Kay. My family also read this book and tell me that they now have a better understanding of my illness.A very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of this story sounds awfully familiar...","review":"As a fellow BPDII patient, I sympathized greatly with a lot of the emotion expressed in her book.

The author writes in a holds-no-bars style that is refreshing and honest. The research is accurate and up-to-date. I recommend this book to anyone interested in bipolar disorder."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rings of Saturn","review":"This is an informative read about manic depressive illness, especially for someone who knows little about the illness. It is seemingly hard to look down upon a well written memoir such as this due to its raw passion and detail. Jamison leaves you with a solid message that a combination of taking medication and psychotherapy are what make it possible to live with manic depression."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing journey through an amazing mind!!","review":"This is, bar none, my favorite book on the planet! I almost cried when I finished it because I wanted it to go on forever. I recommend this book to my educated patients that have bipolar or love someone with bipolar. This is an uplifting, inspiring, intimate autobiography of one of the most amazing minds on the planet. Kay Redfield Jameson is a PhD in psychology, has written over 700 journal articles as well as a 900 page text book for psychiatrists on Manic-Depressive Illness. Kay shows us the absolute beauty of the bipolar mind as well as some of it's horrors. Her skill in writing brings you into the world of her brilliance, madness and humanness, something any human can relate to. Bravo!See also, A Brilliant Madness by Patty Duke, a quick easy read.See also, Exuberance by Kay Redfield Jameson all about the up side."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO not worth the time","review":"Kay Redfield Jamison wrote so movingly and lyrically in her book about suicide, \\"Night Falls Fast,\\" that I was interested to read her own story, and pick up some information about bipolar.Well, I got part of my wish. Jamison does indeed tell her own story, with a whole lot of self-congratulation thrown in there. It's nice that the author thinks so highly of herself, her family, her education, her position, her etcetera, but I really don't need to hear about it over and over and over again.As for information about manic-depression, this book is a dud. If you or a loved one have been diagnosed and you're looking for info or even just COMPANY, please look elsewhere. There's none of that here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat and uninspiring","review":"If this were a fiction book, I would critique it on the basis that the main character is painfully one-dimensional, and as another reviewer wrote, somewhat self-centered. The fact that this is actually a memoir is not a good sign since memoirs are an opportunity for authors to explore their own uniqueness and get beyond narrative cliches. Its a pity that she has applied such a normative frame to understanding the complications of her life, and unless you are totally comfortable with the narrow ambitions and desires of a \\"normal\\" bourgeois life, you probably won't find this book compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enlightening","review":"This book was really well written and an eye-opener for anyone with BiPolar Illness. The author writes with a poetic quality and honesty that is very refreshing."},{"rating":"2","title":"So True","review":"As I read Kay Jamison's book I could put myself into every senario. As someone who lives with bi-polar It truly helped me to understand that a lot of my action and moods are related to the illness. The book gave me hope for one day learning to cope instead of succumb."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Unquiet Mind","review":"I have a young friend who was recently diagnosed as \\"bi polar\\" and my late husband was manic depressive and committed suicide, 20+years ago. This books was an excellent description of what goes on in a brilliant, but \\"unquiet\\" mind. It helped me understand both the terrible guilt and sadness and then the sense of invincibility and brilliance people with this disorder experience. It did not speak to what the families and caregivers experience which is heartbreaking to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest","review":"Kay Jamison has told of her personal battle with Bi-Polar disorder - leaving nothing out and revealing the good and bad of being diagnosed with a mental illness. I first heard about this book after reading Professor Gordon Parker's book on mood disorders called \\"dealing with depression\\". This book helped me, made me cry and made me realise I have an illness which I can control. Anyone struggling with the stigma of mental illness should read this and discover a truly remarkable woman who opened up her life to help the rest of us recover from the darkness within."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishingly thought-provoking","review":"An Unquiet Mind was my first foray into the world of bipolar disorder. I went into it knowing nothing about the illness except that it involved highs and lows of mood. Dr. Jamison does a masterful job of portraying her own sad experience with the disorder while also educating the reader about the science of the illness. Her writing is engaging and sharp, and I found that I could not put the book down. I recommend this to students thinking about going into the mental health field as well as to those who are affected by bipolar disorder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile reading for anyone with or without the diagnosis.","review":"The book is an honest expression of one person's wild ride with manic depressive disorder. I found it interesting and freeing that someone could put it into print in the face of possible professional jeopardy. Its helpful for me( who also has the diagnosis) to feel less insecure about being open with others about it. Although it's still rough. This book is an important aid in shining light into a dark subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"book content","review":"Appropriate for use in mental health facility. Seemed to be new. This was recommended by some patients who have struggled with hearing voices and compulsive behavior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written and enlightening","review":"I read this entire book in two evenings. Jamison uses rich prose that clearly illuminates a sad, scary, sobering illness."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dumb Book","review":"This book was hard to follow. The author cannot follow a clear chronology...cannot explain how it is that she is a \\"Psychiatrist\\" when she only completed a PhD in Psychology which would mean she is a \\"Psychologist.\\" She gave no new insight on bipolar disorder that I didn't already know before. A waste of money.Reading this book will only leave you irritated. The author must have been manic while writing this book because she certainly had a delusional sense of self grandeur."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unquiet Mind by Kay Jamison","review":"A wonderful look into the tortured mind of someone with manic-depressive illness. Terrifies and illuminates the mind of this reader. As someone who lives with clinical depression, I wonder sometimes if I have had manic episodes. This is helpful for anyone who loves someone with depression or manic-depression and those of us who live with it daily. I highly recommend it. The only detraction is too much personal info."},{"rating":"1","title":"blech","review":"If you are looking for a book about bi-polar disorder, or even about living with it, this is not the book for you. This is a book to tell the world how adorable KRJ is, how well she has been loved by absolutely everyone in her life- and all these people are exceedingly good-looking & charming, btw. I found myself wishing halfway thru the book that I'd started counting at the beginning how many times she described a man as \\"handsome\\". All her relationships are with perfect, supremely kind, passionate, bla bla bla people. Yuck. Less about the disease than a desperate insistence that the author is FABULOUS.This book is not written in a professional tone at all, and is more of a preening, pretentious, vanity fest than a memoir of a sufferer of mental illness. Though she does still seem to be grandiose and rather too intense in her adoration of everyone who ever adored her (which seems to be everyone but her sister).I am very disappointed. And annoyed. And grossed out."},{"rating":"1","title":"superficial account of author's pretty nice life - not an in depth account","review":"Ok, Kay Redfield Jamison has manic-depression. This is a horrible disease. However, she underscores time and time again its association with creative genius. The accounts of her highs and lows are superficial - it is mostly a memoir of her, her academic career, and her various boyfriends (and husbands)- all tall, or handsome, or wonderful dancers or artists. Dr Jamison appears smug, and not a little full of herself. The disease which she has is glamorized and sanitized, and minimized. The basic story is unremarkable. I am sorry I bought this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unquiet Mind","review":"Kay Redfield Jamison's 'An Unquiet Mind' has been for me an adventure into the chaotic past life of my beloved first daughter. For so many years our family has lived with this disease, never diagnosed until mid 1999. This book transported me back to her first suicide attempt at age 16, her many many relationships, two marriages, countless changes in schools, outrageous spending sprees, severe panic disorder, inability to raise her own child, and so many other tragedies. Our lives have been complete chaos. Never before have I been able to understand this disease, but this wonderful book has given such tremendous insight, it could very easily be my daughter's story. Thank you Dr. Jamison. Now with this new knowledge, gained from your story, so beautifully told, and the prescribed treatment which is working so well, we can all look forward to recovery with confidence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"Having a family member with this horrible illness has been very hard on my whole family and her self. It's encouraging for my family member who is ill, know and hear that medication has its benefit to keep one well and move on in life and that things will be ok. My family member had her first breakdown at age 18, she is now 77. She has been in and out of several hospitals over the years and more recently this year to adjust different meds and dosages. Nice to know others have the same situations and we are not alone.Thank you for sharing your life's ups and downs. Very inspirational."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so impressed","review":"Not as good as I had heard. A little excessive drama in the descriptive elements of the text. I would have liked more about her feelings and motivations."},{"rating":"2","title":"an unquieted reader","review":"The author's approach is real, relevant and revolutionizing.Women who suffer with manic depression struggle in ways that can often be charted as early as age 5 but are usually undiagnosed until life is so out of control and/or unbareable.Jamison's personal story is inspiring in that she suffered her way into a victory.Isn't that all we really want. We just want to know that there is some meaning to the madness and that the moods will not overtake us in such away that our handicapped but hearty functioning is deemed invalid.Jamison's honesty was the thing I most appreciated. I've experienced days like she described and will use this memoir as a model."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a miss","review":"Unfortunately, Jamison regurgitates all the same old tired cliches that have infected the pscychiatric profession. The profession is characterized by arrogance, condescension and patronization toward sufferers of all emotional illnesses. Sadly, Jamison is no exception. She and her colleagues are doing a great disservice to patients, by practicing an insipid form of treatment that has its origin in the relativism of the 60s. The sooner this generation of \\"professionals\\" retires, the better it will be for millions of people."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's wrong with me?","review":"By the end of this book, I began to think I was the one with the problem. I have never had the highs Jamison seems to find so exhilarating. I have also never had the abysmal lows she speaks of. I must have a deficient personality. I guess I should be grateful."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Authoress is a drunk and a hypocrite","review":"One of the first rules of psycho-pharmacology is that you do not mix alcholic beverages with antidepressants or other mood altering drugs. Ms. Jamison does not seem to know this -- or is ignoring this very well know fact -- since she is clearly boozing her way through the story and her ensuing manic depressive episodes. No wonder she's nuts. She belongs \\"inpatient\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quieting the \\"Unquiet mind\\"","review":"Dr. Jamison does an excellent job of describing a disorder that I have heard one person say \\"manic-depression is the disorder to have, it's sooo cool!\\" What the person had been watching was a psychotic episode of someone in a manic cycle. After reading this book and realizing the struggle, this person changed his tune very quickly. Dr. Jamison gives the most graphic, honest, and accurate account of what someone with Bipolar Disorder goes through and lives to see another day. She is a credit to her profession as well as a shining example to others that a dibilitating disorder does not have to mean death. It is a must read for anyone who suffers from, lives with, or is curious about, Bipolar Disorder."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unquiet Mind","review":"An Unquiet Mind: A Memoir of Moods and MadnessThis book was so disappointing. She kept telling the same story over and over just in different locations.Very repetitions and very unrewarding. I gave it to the Goodwill. Would not recommend it for any insight into manic depression."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book From Which Patients Can Relate & Supporters Can Learn","review":"Many sufferers of depression and bipolar disorder will find they can relate to much of what Jamison describes of her own life experiences with a brain disorder. If this is what you need - to know you are not alone with your symptoms & related behavior - then this book is helpful in that way.Supporters may also feel, as they read about Jamison's symptomatic behavior, that they are almost reading about their loved one who suffers -- and thereby realize, by recognizing the similarities of symptoms, the biological nature of these disorders.For these reasons, I recommend this book to all my readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare peek at a usually private matter","review":"This book was especially compelling in its honesty in revealing what is usually kept carefully under raps. For those interested in what the inside of other peoples' therapy sessions looks like, try a collection called Inside Therapy: Illujinating Writings about Therapists, Patients, and Psychotherapy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The reality of full-blown manic depression","review":"This book has a good account of the realities of full-blown manic depression. Those of us who have milder versions, such as myself, come out understand ourselves more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hauntingly Accurate","review":"I've suffered from manic depression for ten years and this book is a hauntingly accurate description of what it really feels like to suffer from the disorder, unlike any others I've read. Ms. Jamison's accomplishments despite her affliction provide hope for all fellow sufferers."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unquiet Mind","review":"A truly remarkable read! I just ordered 3 more copies. My favorite autobiography. This book is a candid no-holds-barred insight into Bipolar 1 (Manic-Depressive Disorder) by someone who has both suffered-from *and treated* the condition as a medical practitioner/professor/educator. A literary masterpiece. Honest, charmed. An intriguing *must-have* book, and one that says as much about so-called *sanity* as insanity. Where is the line to be drawn?? Intensely human, sincere. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This tells what it is to have mental illness","review":"My son has bipolar disorder. He is in prison. We were and are close. I never thought that a member of my wonderful family would go to prison. But I Had suffered with a mostly depressed life since... say 8y.o. . I took notes on this book because she speaks of experiences I have had. Or watched my son have. She has a way of recounting all this which made this book fly by. I read this so fast, that IS will be able to reread it soon. Beautiful prose. Wonderful characters. Deep insight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative","review":"I am a psychiatric nurse and I found this read very helpful. I think it would appeal to professionals, patients and their loved ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Insight of BP!","review":"This is an excellent insight of a person with manic depression/Bipolar Disorder. The author is an exceptional writer as well as a very intelligent person. This helped me to gain an insight into the mind of relatives I know with BP. I want to thank the author for taking the time and effort to write this book. THANK YOU!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Painfully frank and boldly accurate","review":"Kudos to Dr. Jamison for having the courage - and it takes tremendous courage - to publicly acknowledge and discuss BiPolar depression. I know because I also am BiPolar. Her story gave me comfort in knowing that I was not alone or unique in my feelings and struggles. My only criticism of the book is that the vast majority of people do not have her financial, educational, and social network resources . By constantly name-dropping her association with wealthy Ivy League schools, colleagues, and 'pillars of society', she put me off. Less elitism would have mad her story easier for more people to relate to and glean hope from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Celebrating medicine","review":"I'll let the back of the book speak for itself. Kay exposes a lot of very personal details about her life in this courageous book, but it wasn't my style of biography because she kept coming back to the same theme: take your meds if you want to be \\"normal.\\" I think her exploration of manic depression was a bit limited here because there are many other theories of mania that treat it less as a disease and more as a way of coping with a fast-paced, ever-changing world. Her next book is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The other side of the coin","review":"I have just suffered the anguish of watching my manic-depressive sister destroy her marriage and career as a psychologist with a severely psychotic break. She would not listen to her four sisters tearful entreaties that she obtain help, because she was \\"on another planet,\\" in another reality. This book gave me comfort and hope. I don't agree with all the sentiments of the author, especially when she rambles about the \\"rings of Saturn\\" she has experienced, and the joys of the manic highs. I don't agree because I have been on the other side of the coin, suffering and humiliated by my sister's self-destructive actions. But I understand more. The author has made me see what the manic-depressive person experiences. I will read and reread this book, hoping it will help me heal, and somehow reconnect with my sister."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unquiet... and deadly accurate.","review":"After being diagnosed with bipolar depression (following years of painful suffering), my psychiatrist recommended this book to me. As a caveat, however, he added, \\"but she *is* a bit overly dramatic.\\" When I had finished reading the book, experiencing in it all the emotions that make up the bipolar spectrum to begin with, I returned to my doctor miffed at his casual dismissal of her memoir as \\"overly dramatic.\\" \\"You just don't get it,\\" I told him. \\"That's not drama... it's called being bipolar.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a college student and this was the best book that i own","review":"This was a extra creit exsinment for class. as soon that i started to read i could not put it down. i changed my major to pyhcolgey. it was by far the best book that i've read."},{"rating":"1","title":"So?","review":"I am bipolar and this book didn't do much for me. In her defense, Ms Jamison did something very important in that she showed the world a manic depressive who had come to live in the real world and had succeeded. It takes a lot to undo what Patty Duke did when she made a movie depicting herself pitching King Kong fits and ruining everything - not an image that does a lot for the rest of us when we are out here trying to get insurance, jobs, and everything else. That's why Jamison's book is very necessary. However, as a bipolar person, reading about someone else's problems with the disease doesn't do anything for me. If I wanted that I'd write my own autobiography. I found this book egotistical, and if she meant to help me with my illness by writing it, then she could have talked a little more about my illness and a little less about the life she found so extraordinary."},{"rating":"1","title":"simplistic overview","review":"Poorly written, although a good story of a woman's struggle with mental illness. I think she simplified what living with bipolar illness is like. It's more complicated than just going up and down in moods. The book disappointed me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the average reader","review":"While I think it's wonderful the author opens up her private life to share the pain and struggle as a manic-depressive, I wouldn't recommend this book to the average lay-person. It appears to be more suited for an audience within the medical profession. I also wouldn't expect to find a lot of answers or hope, but it is interesting reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"helpful","review":"K. Jamison has done a great service with her informative book and self-revelations about bipolar disease. Helpful to both therapists and others to better understand the severity of the disease."},{"rating":"2","title":"Salute to courageous fighter","review":"Dr. Jamison risks her professional standing by being so upfront about her illness. Yet she lays it out in the hope of helping others with the same problems. And I think that she IShelping others. In \\"Personal History\\", Katharine Graham cites Jamison's work, and it helps Graham's healing by giving her (Graham) further insights into her late husband's wild mood swings and action prior to his suicide. I wish Jamison wouldn't be quite so hard on herself. If she were able to grasp the concept of a higher power, she might begin to discern some of the peace which she so richly deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and irrelevant","review":"I had to read this book for my graduate psychopathology class. The book was supposed to provide experential content about bipolar disorder. Well, this book is mainly composed of trivial events like dinner parties or visits to England, rather than a description of bipolar disorder. Whenever bipolar disorder (or manic-depression, as the author calls it) is discussed, it's in vapid, over-the-top poetic terms, like \\"it was a wave of bleak foul despairing madness, an eruption of manic volcanic fury\\". The author uses four adjectives where one or even none would suffice, making me groan with every paragraph. I have never read a book before that said so much and yet said so little. Don't read it unless you have to, and if you have to, here's a tip: the first 3/4 of the book are totally unimportant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly informative extrordinarily pretentious","review":"Having recently read many text, autobiographical, and various memoirs on psychiatric illness; I found Dr. Jamison's \\"The Unquiet Mind\\", to be more pretentious than anything I have ever read. It was difficult to empathize or identify with her, due to the constant and obviously purposeful references to the fact that she is more intelligent, more cultured, more creative, and more capable than most human beings.Every other sentence in the book makes a point that you must realize, she listens and appreciates classical music,fine art, gourmet foods and knows all literature and poetry of any consequence.She never actually details any real episodes in her life, nor does she describe any relationship of any value with another human being (exception her mother) that does not have a doctoral degree.How anyone could label this memoir an actual \\"memoir\\" in my mind is ludicrous. It is a self-indulgent, self-important rambling of \\"big words\\" that say nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"an unquiet mind","review":"Very Boring.The first 70 pages she talks about how smart she is and the pampared life she's led, Poor grammar.Waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive and poorly written","review":"This book was selected for my book club, so dutifully I plowed through an unenlightening, ungrammatical and repetitive story of one woman's struggle with manic-depression illness. The writing was choppy, her poor use of punctuation was infuriating, and her style left much to be desired. The story seemed to end halfway through the book, leaving me to wonder what was left to tell in the second half - much to my dismay it was basically a repeat of previously provided information, or more detail on episodes already described. It was all I could do not to throw the book across the room in frustration! I can see how this book might be helpful for those who suffer from this illness, but Jamison needs to stick to textbook and article writing, and leave the layman's books to those who know how to write."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic!","review":"I have lived with loved ones with bi-polar problems and I could feel the writer's emotions in this work. Writing is beautiful and sensitive, at times rises to poetry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"Fast shipping, great price, and the book is absolutely amazing. Jamison's ability to actually describe manias with such clarity is beyond impressive. There were several times I would re-read a quote or passage and then sit there and let it mull over in my mind simply because of the beauty in which she wrote it. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unquiet Mind, by Kay Redfield Jamison","review":"For anyone who suffers with a mental illness called manic-depressive disorder, or anyone who is related to someone in that position, this book could bring hope. I must add a warning that the journey is very hard and could become a deterrent to reading on...but it is an impelling,true story. Ms Jamison, who wrote the book, is herself living with this disorder, yet fully functioning, teaching, writing, relating to others, and living her life. The book is quite scholarly, yet readily available to those of us with little or no expertise in the field of Mental Health. I recommend it to anyone interested in reclaiming a life from an illness at least as painful and deadly as cancer!Janet Gary"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and provacative for those with bipolar","review":"My psychiatrist recommended this the first time I was re-diagnosis-ed from severe depression to bipolar disorder, and I wanted to learn everything I could about this disorder. It was written by Kay Jamison and was her road-map through bipolar and how she led a successful life, despite he diagnosis. Most impressive is that she wrote the book back when bipolar disorder was a more of a negative stigma than it is today.She continued to work in the medical field and had great accomplishments, and was very informative about sharing her personal battles, as well.Well written and a MUST read for anyone who shares this diagnosis, as you can relate and she kept on pushing on."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Should Be Read!

Great personal history of bipolar disorder from a successful psychologist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best source to learn about manic depression","review":"For some reason, this is always the first book that people run out and get when they, or someone they know is diagnosed bipolar/manic depressive. This author, along with having a highly romanticized view of herself and her illness, simply takes the opportunity to yak about her life in academia, and portrays her illness as having the dramatic flair and drama of someone who's bipolar one. However, not most individuals have a textbook case of manic depression. I almost feel as though since she is so well-versed in the diagnostic aspect, she chose to paint her own life in absolute accordance with the DSM-V. When I was diagnosed, my parents bought this book and gave it to everyone thinking it would all help us \\"understand\\" my illness better. I couldn't relate to this book at all, and still don't, unless you have a personal interest in Kay's academic challenges or love life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A found mind.....","review":"I am a 26 yr old woman that has only six months ago been diagnoised with bi-polor...this book was amazing. So many of the same things that Kay speaks of I feel- deeply.

I recommend this book to anyone that has a family member that has been diagnoised or a close friend.

What I got were glowing platitudes about her many friends who supported her, her travels and romances, and how she grieved the loss of those marvelous highs when she was manic. There is hardly a word about the cost to her in terms of her personal relationships as there is not one instance in which she may have alienated friends and family because of her disease. Instead everyone was so understanding, even in her professional life. Despite a suicide attempt, I got no picture of what this disease has truly cost her. I also wondered with her many detailed scenes of drinking alcohol, if she ever considered that that was exacerbating her symptoms or the efficacy of her medication. She seems to spend far too much time ruminating about her disease and glorifying it, and not enough time in the solutions."},{"rating":"1","title":"A long fan letter, not a biography","review":"Written by R.K. Johnson, personal friend of Bob Jones, Sr. and in the employ of Bob Jones University at the time this book was first published, this hack job is anything but objective.

I don't know when it started (another reviewer said it happened to them after 3 weeks), but I just had to throw out what seemed to be otherwise fine gloves because they are leaving check-marked fingerprints all over everything I touch, most noticeably glassware. Whatever this stuff is, it's really hard to remove (actually I haven't completely removed the marks yet.. I just had to stop washing to leave this review!!). Stay away. I usually get the Casa Bella gloves, but tried these to save a couple of bucks... definitely not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Cotton Lining","review":"Purchased this with the sole intention of having an additional layer (cotton lining) to keep hands warmer ... however there is no such thing as \\"Super soft cotton, absorbent lining keeps hands dry and comfortable\\" and do not be fooled - this lining IS NOT present.The seller responded quickly to my request to resolve the issue only to state that they shipped the correct item and have never had any complaints. BS!For this price, you can get better quality gloves!Am returning mine for a FULL REFUND!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware these gloves leave marks on stainless steel!","review":"These gloves left cross hatch marks on my stainless all-clad cookware and the top of my french press coffeemaker. The only thing that removed them was goo gone. Needless to say I will not be using these gloves again for doing dishes. I am not going to use a product that adds time and aggravation to my cleaning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sticky Residue","review":"These gloves deteriorate after 2-3 weeks and leave a smeary, sticky residue on dishes. I only used mine for dishwashing, and I do like to use pretty hot water, but these are meant for washing dishes and they should be able to tolerate hot water, right? It's a shame that they have this issue because otherwise, they would be great gloves. The arm length is nice, they fit well, and they are durable as far as not getting holes easily -- but the residue problem is definitely a dealbreaker. I won't be buying these again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not use with bleach","review":"I cannot say 100 percent that these gloves are responsible for turning a white shirt purple, but all I can say is that I was soaking a white shirt in bleach because it had a small beige tea stain. When I removed the shirt from the bleach and wrung it out, I took it outside only to be shocked that the entire sleeve had turned the same purple color as the gloves! Is there a warning on the box not to use with bleach? Why else would I need rubber gloves? After sitting in the sun for four hours, the shirt faded from bright purple to dingy yellow, so it is still ruined."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave sticky residue on dishes","review":"These work well for about 3 weeks. They're long enough to cuff, unlike budget gloves. Of course you have to take care that you don't stab them w/ a fork or knife. They're not as strong as they used to be b/c they only have some cotton dust (flocking) stuck to the inside instead of the woven cotton lining they used to be made with. And after they've been used w/ hot water and dish detergent for about 3 weeks the latex softens and leaves sticky, dirty-looking residue all over your freshly cleaned dishes and glasses. So don't expect them to last longer than that when used daily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible gloves","review":"I would actually give this product a zero star rating but not sure I can do that. I finally figured out that these gloves were the reason that all my glassware looks terrible with residue. I thought it was hard water and had cleaned glassware in vinegar without much improvement. Once I used \\"De-solve\\" or \\"GooGone\\" the glassware looked terrific. However, the key was that I had to do it WITHOUT the gloves on. The moment I used the gloves again it left the same residue. I spent about three hours this morning cleaning all of my glassware and it all looks like new. I did this AFTER I threw away the gloves. Extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I ordered from this company.","review":"I finally found these gloves here so I ordered 3 pair.

But this one found boring and derivitive of William Burroughs. I advise others to skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype!!!","review":"I found this book terribly hard to read and extremely boring. The whole Dr. Jeklly and Mr. Hyde element of the book was poorly executed. And this is really bad when the whole book rests on the credibilty of multiple personalities. The \\"I'm a cop. I'm a junkie. I'm a cop and a junkie\\" idea is really interesting but it becomes so repetive after a while. On top of that, Philip K. Dick's writing style is very rudimentary and completely lacks anything to the effect of mood or atmosphere. The only thing I would get excited about was coming across the names of cites I had been to around Southern California. Honestly, I really don't understand why people like this book so much. (...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A great plot - an addled delivery","review":"He may have a cult following, but like the characters in this novel, P.K. Dick appears to have been drug addled at the time he wrote 'Scanner'. The author in fact admits to this in his postscript. The plot is intriguing but fatally flawed with inconsistencies. The last fifty pages are so laden with filler as to be virtually unintelligible. If he intended this as a cautionary tale of drug abuse, PKD succeeded in ways he never suspected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful Read!","review":"I was so excited to get this book, but it really sucked.

I read it as a narrative of his own schizophrenic degeneration, catalysed by speed addiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let Them Play Again","review":"This is not an SF novel. This is a story about Dick's drug-addicted friends and their sad fates. The book consists of a series of anecdotes and scenes that range from the absurdly funny to the grotesquely tragic and are too familiar if you have some experience with drug addiction.We see the characters (Dick's friends) degenerate into madness because of their drug habit. But still we refrain from saying they are degenerates and brought it on themselves, because of the compassion that Dick puts in his writing. All they wanted was to play, how can you think that is wrong.At the end is an author's note in which Dick honors his dead friends and wants them to play again but in another way. This note is one of Dick's best writings and will break your heart (if you've got one that is). Oh yeah there's also a kind of plot to the book, but that's just thrown in to please the straights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping","review":"I loved this book. The opening pages brought me into the story in a way comparable to the red pill, Blue pill moment in the Matrix.A fantastic story that had me considering life and it's meaning as I continued to read, gripped to the story.Now I need the physical version to be able to pass down to my kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who are you?

Although his writing is somewhat hazy at times, the inventiveness is nearly constant and always interesting (true in all of his books I have read so far). Scanner Darkly, is my favorite, but I would not read it again because the ending was gut wrenching, (almost as depressing and defeated as the end of Orwell's 1984)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incomparable Dick","review":"Once you know what this book is about (i.e. where Dick was in his life) you can get a good idea of the meaning of this work. Everyone who reads Dick on a regular basis knows his main themes are Reality (or surreality) and Authority (or actually a dislike of authority). This sums those themes up perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best for last, or nearly","review":"It is a crying shame that this was almost the last book that Phil Dick ever wrote before his untimely death, but at least he has left us with a ripping yarn that transcends mere genre fiction. Set in a future that was then near and now even nearer, it has taken on particular poignancy now that we know the extent to which the good guys ostensibly running society can also be the bad guys who subvert the very principles on which the society is ostensibly based. Since its publication, we have learned much about administrations who collude in the overseas production of the very narcotics their \\"War on Drugs\\" ostensibly would suppress here. While Dick leaves us with a faint hope that the perps will get their come-uppance, \\"Who guards the guardians?\\" remains as open a question as ever. A modern classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only got half-way through","review":"I'm willing to get just about any book a chance. I've read \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\" and enjoyed it. This book is just too weird and disjointed. I have no idea what's really going on. I have no idea what the book is driving at. There are sentences of dialogue and such that barely even make sense after I read them 5 times over. The concept of the scramble suit and everything is really fascinating. I had to give up on this book because it was just way too much effort. I wasn't really enjoying it on any level. I may try reading it again, but I doubt it. I hardly ever give up on books, so I'm actually pretty upset that I had to give up on this one. I would only recommend this book if you're an absolute hardcore Philip K Dick fan. Otherwise, it's just a lot of confusing dialogue and strange chapters that seem to go nowhere and are hard to follow. I wish I coulda given this more stars, but I have to be honest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Androids","review":"I, too, loved Androids. I hoped that all of Dick's stuff would be as good. Not so.A lot of the time, I had no idea what was going on. I got hung up on the date of 1994; everyone says things like \\"dig\\" and listens to Cat Stevens music. I wish he hadn't told us a date.Not a page turner. For serious fans only."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant version","review":"Paul Giamatti's reading of this book is brilliant. He captures the humor, the insanity, and the tragedy of this sad tale completely. His voice acting ability is remarkable and has spoiled the other CDs that I own of the PKDick books. It was never difficult to discern who was speaking, male or female. I highly recommend this CD for the original work and for this audio version. Mr. Giamatti please read more of PKD works for us. Please! I can also recommend the Keir Dullea readings of the short story collection, Minority Report, but Giamatti's skills are incomparable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy if you have an e-ink kindle","review":"Do not buy this book if you have an e-ink kindle and changing fonts is important to you.

Artscroll has also developed a unique method of printing an interlinear text so that the English never seems to intrude into reading the Hebrew - and yet it is there in case you cannot remember the meaning of a particular word.One extremely minor criticism is that the interlinear often uses a relatively dynamic-equivalence approach. It might have been more helpful if the interlinear was a bit more woodenly literal.If you love the psalms - you must have this edition!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Artscroll Interlinear Tehillim","review":"This is the product of your dreams! Honestly. I don't understand hebrew, and going back and forth between English and Hebrew makes me feel less than smart. Reading this book is like understanding Hebrew... like putting on a pair of glasses when you were previously blind and didn't even know it. The interlinear approach actually makes you smarter. The more you read it, you will actually recognize words more quickly with frequency and actually learn hebrew WHILE you are davening. This is a way to make your prayers heartfelt and meaningful. I actually know people who understand hebrew who still use this book simply because the size of the type (in the pocket size book ) is SO user friendly. I used to go to shul and struggle to follow along.

If you are a serious student of the scripture, each and every book is a must-have. This particular book on the Psalms is more than wonderful. I already had purchased a book on the Psalms from this publisher, but this one has a direct translation under the Hebrew word, which I truly believe gives it an extra dimension of language in which to understand the author's intent.

The watch tells you the speed, distance, heart rate, etc, but when you finish your run and try to download the data you find out the recorder stopped mid run. This is very frustrating.

However, I think Live from Austin may be even better. The sound is better than Dinner and the tracks are a really good cross-section of REK's best stuff. Aside from a \\"new\\" version of Dreadful Selfish Crime (my favorite REK song) that is, well, different, the CD is flawless (I like the track, I'm just too accustomed to the versions on No. 2 Live Dinner and on Party Songs). I would LOVE to see the DVD, but cannot find here in stores (but I'm seeing REK live tomorrow night, so the problem will soon be solved)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the quick makeover of a hardball into a softball book","review":"This is, regrettably, a quick makeover of a good book on hardball squash into barely acceptable book on softball squash.

I'm an owner of 3 cats and now 5 kittens. The only problem is it doesn't scoop kitten poo as easily since it's so small. But other than that, it's perfect. You might need patience with cats that are afraid of everything...I have one that is like that and he steps into the litter box very carefully.

The songs are overall very easy to like, but maybe a bit to easy. If you want to compare to other bands (which often have to do becasue it is so hard to describe music without some kind of reference) it sounds like Oasis or the Verve when they play it soft. The vocals are more emotional and maybe a bit depressed, but in the end very good.

Sure, they sure common elements. There's nothing ground-breaking here. The lyrics are above average.

But that's not the only trick up their sleeves: \\"All Bad Ends All\\" has a swinging feel, while the slow build of \\"All Our Base Are Belong To Them\\" ends in a banjo free-for-all boosted by some hushed vocals. (More vocals punctuate the staccato \\"Getting The Done Job.\\") \\"Thankyoubranch\\" begins into chaos and ends with darkness, while \\"Mikey Bass\\" has plenty of bass plus some additional epiglottal sounds, as opposed to the chopped up strings of \\"Excess Straussess.\\" Odd fun a-plenty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huh.","review":"Just to spite the fellow below, who actually still believes that the term \\"pseudo-intellectual\\" is even remotely insulting, when in fact it is a term of speech employed solely by those who are just that.

This game is very challenging - but once you get the hang of it, you can be very successful. At that point, the game then becomes a matter of how fast you can press a button, which seems to me to be a measure of reflex as opposed to intelligence. Game will ultimately get repetative but there are many, many types of puzzling questions to figure out in the meantime. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys numbers and math, much like myself. If this does not describe you - then you will likely not enjoy this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun but punishing","review":"I love the minigames or tests you take in this one.

It also has a nice intro to meditation, and includes severla different meditatoin techniques to introduce you to this idea.

Overall, a good little book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Yoga Book!","review":"I am a Yoga teacher, and I recommend this book for home practice. The point of Yoga is to turn inward, and really feel what your body is doing, and what your body needs. In classes, we tend to get competitive, which really hinders our practice. This book is a great way to learn poses to do at home, and without having someone there yapping at you the entire time, you tend to really FEEL the poses. I think classes are important to learn postures and how the corrected posture feels, but I encourage people to have a home practice as well. This book is wonderful.... big pictures makes it easy to use while practicing, and a few different series of Asana's in the back help guide you through an at home class. The basic meditation helps people start to understand how to quiet the mind, and the Chakra info is wonderful!

This book does a good job of keeping it simple and providing representative examples. However, it often leaves you feeling like it's not telling the whole story (an obvious lack of details) AND, even worse, its figures are screwed up time and time again. The 5' and 3' labels are often wrong, and those kind of details need to be the basis for a student's true understanding of virology. The figures need to be completely redone. They contain mistake after mistake. I plan on having my students write up their own comments before the semester is over, and I'm going to add my own list of errors and send them to the authors. I hope that they spend more time on the next edition's figures, as this is just plain sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Virology Text","review":"I'm not sure if there is just a shortage of virology textbooks, but this reader, although well supported by cited work, is hardly well-written.

The truth is, Sunna must be one of the few bands I've had incredible difficulty categorizing. The single \\"Power Struggle\\" is powerful and hard, and one of my favorites. However, the entire album is very diverse. Tracks like \\"Too Much\\" and \\"One Conditioning\\" are very mellow, almost comparable to Massive Attack (Jon Harris actually played bass for Massive Attack on Mezzanine). Then there are simple acoustic tracks like \\"7%\\" and \\"Preoccupation\\". Most of these tracks are on the darker, intellectual side- and hold a particular beauty about them, especially \\"I Miss\\" and \\"Forlorn\\". This is a band that deserves more recognition than they have received from radio stations and MTV. Unfortunately we live in a Blink 182/ N'Sync world of mindless music without imagination.

I immediately liked it a lot. Then I saw the vid for I'm Not Trading, which I also liked quite a lot. After downloading the rest of the album as mp3's I discovered that most of the other songs are quite different, more often with acoustic than electric guitars, however they are quite good! So I decided to buy the album, and as I already knew what the album soundend like I wasn't disappointed, actually after listening to it over a propper stereo instead of the computer sound system I've grown to like it even more. I just wished they had put a few more Power Struggle type songs on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Check this one out...","review":"The electronic crunch of Nine Inch Nails, tossed in with the toned down vocals of Tool gives you this great new band called Sunna. Most people have seen this band live with A Perfect Circle this summer, and let me tell you, they are one of the best new bands of the year, and this CD proves that they have a bright future. Songs like Power Struggle are typical 90's metal anthems. Preoccupation is a on a lighter note, noticably more toned down than the rest of this disc. Insanity Pulse is probably the best song on here and sounds an AWFUL lot like Nine Inch Nails. If you like this band, I highly suggest you check out Nine Inch Nails, Taproot, Tool and A Perfect Circle."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY","review":"It was not nearly as durable as one would hope.

It's band is very tight, meaning that it only varies by a degree or so on either side of the temperature, unlike the typical 4-6 variation on typical appliance thermostats (even the digital ones). Since you usually plug it into a wall outlet, think about plugging it into an outlet on an inside wall, to avoid the cold drafts that come in through outlets on exterior walls. I have several of these working 24-7 and they work great. The programming is quite easy and you can set up to 4 time periods during the day to optimize the heating for when you are actually in a room.

I had LUX exchange my first unit, but the replacement acts exactly the same. So now I have a 24 hr timer that powers the LUX unit ON in the morning and OFF in the evening, otherwise the fan would run continuously. So the unit has been nearly useless to me. They definitely have a technical problem with this unit and am quite surprised it hasn't been fixed yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliable and Easy to Use","review":"Nice product. I decided to buy four of these to use with portable space heaters. One of the four was defective (kept cycling the heater on and off) but Amazon promptly replaced. The devices themselves do what they are intended to do. Four stars (instead of five) because I don't know how accurate the thermostats are...I have independent (high quality) thermostat/thermometers that are usually 2-3 degrees off from this....I am prone to believe that the digital thermometers are correct. Overall a solid product. I don't regret purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea but needs better engineering/design","review":"These are a great idea but the design/engineering is poor. The thermostat only extends about an inch. This is a problem since the unit (and then the thermostat) heats up when switched on. The result is that the thermostat reads high when it turns the heater on causing it to turn off the heater while the room is still well below the desired temperature. It will eventually stabilize to the desired temperature but the reason someone would use a thermostat is to conserve energy by allowing the room to cool when not occupied. To make this work it is desirable to have the room heat up quickly.The manufacturer should re-design the thermostat to accurately detect the room temperature, if the company has any designers/engineers (may be just re-packaging a product purchased from over-seas manufacturers???)"},{"rating":"2","title":"great for economic heating for animals","review":"i use these with heat lamps to regulate my poultry houses to keep them from extreme cold and to keep water from freezing works better than the regular plugs that come on at 35 and go off at 45 because you can set it to come on at 50 or more and seems to work better because 35 is to cold to kick on. i have bought several and they all have worked great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost a FIVE!!!","review":"This is absolutely the most sophisticated general-use plug-in thermostat I have ever seen --- we have two of them. (We use a LUX programmable for our heat and central air, too --- superb!)ONLY \\"complaint\\" --- the sensor is hard-mounted to the case. If you use an electric heater next to a cold wall --- well, you can see the problem: the sensor is down there near the floor, and next to that wall.IF they had made this with a micro-socket and a sensor with a long lead, I would have given it SIX STARS.I'm not necessarily \\"recommending\\" that you do anything like this, but it really isn't too hard to disconnect the sensor and wire in a long lead.

They just stopped triggering the mechanism when they're supposed to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as promised, could be improved","review":"I'm using this thermostat with a large commercial fan to send the cool air from my basement up to the first floor. The fan works in conjunction with my A/C to save energy. I placed this product in the basement, plugged the fan into it, and set it on the \\"Heat\\" setting. The thermostat runs as long as the air in the basement is under my preset level (e.g., 70 degrees) and turns off the fan when the basement temp rises above the same preset level. Doing so prevents wasting electricity sending up the warm air!What annoys me is that every time I decide to test a different preset temp, the thermostat takes me back to the \\"programmed\\" temp for that day and that period and I have to start all over to reach the temp that I want to set to \\"Hold\\" the temp. My main A/C's thermostat lets me start with the existing \\"Hold\\" temp.Works as promised.

The temperature in my bedroom that night was consistent and I slept soundly. I left the space heater running the whole next day with this device controlling it. The 2nd night I was awoken by the relays clicking on and off every couple seconds. I finally had to give up and shut off the space heater and risk getting cold. I spent the whole next day testing the programming and replacing batteries but the relays still don't stay on so I'm returning it for a full refund. It's not worth playing the game of returning and replacing until I get one that works. I just want to be warm and healthy so I'm buying one that costs almost twice as much. Hopefully that works out.If it had worked it would have been great. It was easy to program and simple to install. It's cheap so it might be worth gambling and trying out. I wish you luck if you choose to get one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"I use this product to control the temperature in a chest freezer that I use to ferment beer. Most products designed for this purpose retail for $50-$60 so I decided to try this out in hopes I could save a few dollars. There are limitations (the termometer is on a VERY short cord, so the unit needs to be in the same space as whatever you are cooling), but overall, I am pleased with the simple controls, digital readout, and the energy-saving differential (approx. 3 degrees), so that it is not constantly cycling the compressor on my freezer. If you don't mind running an extension cord into your freezer, this is a good way to save a little cash in your homebrew setup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not reliable to shut off","review":"I've gone through two of the WIN100's, to turn an exhaust fan on in my small greenhouse at 90 degrees, and both units will often not turn the fan off if the temperature gets over 100. That causes the fan to keep running into the night, bringing cold evening air in, which I definitely do not want! (Mostly orchids in the greenhouse). Since I can't always be around to be sure the WIN100 turned the fan off at 89 degrees, I have replace this with something reliable.In the winter I used this unit to turn a heater on when the temp gets below 58, and it seems to work properly at these lower temps, but it fails with temps over 100. (And I'm in Sacramento... 100 in the shade, outside, is not unusual). It's top set point is 90 degrees, and it fails at just 10 degrees above that?! I tried setting at 89 and 88, but same result; this is a thermostat that can't take the heat."},{"rating":"2","title":"so useful!","review":"This thermostat is so useful and it's the only one I found that I can use with my space heater.

I think it is actually more sensitive now and it keeps my temps well within range. You might get better signal with thermostat wire, but the low voltage around water is safer, so it's worth it to have a $40 remote thermostat for your duct fan.It is better if you program it within +/-10 degrees of where you want to be, because it's so accurate that it will turn on and off every 5 minutes if your fan works well.80-85 across the board and back-draft damper on the fan works explosively well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Invention","review":"I bought this outlet thermostat to use with a oil filled radiator for in my 1.5yr old's bedroom.

I'm just cautious of academic-type books that consistently have to invent words to make their point (e.g. findability, everyware, wayfinding).

Of course, lyrically mega holds it down and raps about a variety of topics, reflecting the struggles of project life and haters in the industry (how can Nas diss 'mega, man). Best cuts from this album are True meaning, Love in, love out, Endagered species, The legacy, verbal graffiti, built 4 this but to be honest, the whole album is quality.

Cormega executes effictively again this time, leaving no open gaps. \\"The Come Up' with Large Pro, \\"Verbal Graffitti\\", and \\"The Legacy\\" are the albums best tracks. \\"Love In Love Out\\" is a deep song that you just can't skip, that answers Nas in a sincere sort of way. This album was made entirely for the street heads. If you're looking for a radio friendly hit or some commercial wana be thug material. This is not the album for you. Overall this is a good album. Worth the money, this will probably grow on you through time too.

Eveyone from d.i.t.c. veteran Buckwild, to Alchemist, to Hi Tek,to D.R.

He proved me wrong by releasing which maybe this year's best album, \\"The True Meaning.\\" It's too bad that wack rappers like Nelly get so much press while one of rap's best emcees gets no press. This album is not as dark as \\"The Realness\\", but his emotion and love for Hip-Hop are still just as evident on this record. The first two songs \\"Introspective\\" and \\"Verbal Graffiti\\" deliver some of the rawest lyrics and beats that are missing from hip-hop's mainstream releases. He doesn't diss Nas on this record, he rather explores their falling out and explains where their relationship went wrong on \\"Love in, Love Out.\\" Again, their are no bad songs on this album, there is just not enough time to go thru every song.

The trombone concerto, the so-called Symphony No. 9, is a case in point, and perhaps my favorite of all his works. One hears ideas, sometimes rather radical, never heard before; enchanting, yet crafted to a degree that it is hard to imagine them other than inevitable. Still, they remain fresh and clever on repeated hearings.It's an exciting ride - all the more so because trombone soloist extraordinaire, Christian Lindberg, has what must be an impossible part (except for him!). There is a real \\"gallop\\", the breathtaking presto of the first movement. The use of full register (and then some) required in the upward lines that start the second movement. Louder dense passages that lead to a peaceful, evocative, and sublime suspension. And the trombone \\"vocalizations\\" of the third movement. Wonderful stuff all. Neat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dense, Demanding, But Rewarding","review":"Kalevi Aho (b. 1949) is a contemporary Finnish composer who writes dense, dynamic, demanding, but very rewarding music. Both pieces on this CD are utterly fascinating. The 9th Symphony, which shifts in style from modern to archaic and all around with an effortless ease, is the piece more likely to impress upon first hearing. This is not music for the faint of heart, but for those with a taste for musical modernism, this CD is a must-hear, and is excellently recorded to boot. It is always a thrill to discover a composer you have never heard of, and when I first heard this soon after its initial release, I thought it was one of the most exciting new orchestral CDs I had heard in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old films little info.","review":"I enjoy good documentaries, especially WWII films.

As a film, the first 25 minutes are good, but that's no reason to recommend this CISCO to anyone. When Laser discs were the way to collect films, I had it. When I got rid of Laser when DVD took over, I always figured it would be released in this format sooner or later. Nope...never happened.

Barber's \\"Stop Watch and an Ordinance Map\\" is crisp, chilling, and has never been recorded in a performance that is nearly as compelling as the one contained on this disc. On the opposite end of the spectrum are the irresistably creamy smooth \\"Turtle Dove\\" and absolutely lovely recordings of male choral classics by Britten, Schubert and Weill.

The best song, however is #8, the cover track, \\"No Boundaries\\". This is an incredibly beautiful progressive song.This CD has no vocals. Michael has the best guitar sound i have ever heard.

Personally, I prefer the neoclassical sound, but he has some good songs on here such as Jam Game. Definitely for any fan of fast, technically astounding guitar work.

But, after viewing the DVD of this story, I would never want to. Since when does selfishness and possessiveness pass for love? That is not love.

Then Sassinak and finaly Generation Warriors. (Also by Anne McCaffery and Elizabeth Moon.)That way you can read the WHILE story, starting with the first time Lunzie gets shipwrecked till they all save the known universe, almost by accident.

Pick any book in the Honor Harrington series instead if you wish to see how this story should have been written. Note to self: once your reputation is made as a mega author, you can make money from publishing eclectic drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"McCaffrey's done better stuff...","review":"This book was quite a disappointment after being brought up on McCaffrey's excellent Pern series. I expected something a bit more moving then *this*...at best, a rather bland muddle of confused conspiracies and an unlikable heroine.I don't know how much to pin on Moon - but I have heard that she's done excellent military books, so it's possible that the book's greatest strength can be attributed to her. While it failed to stir me in any way, the book does present a semi-realistic view of the military in the future. Hurrah. However, where the book goes astray is when the authors try to have it both ways - I have no problem with hard science-fiction, but when soft sci-fi sensibilities are mixed in with it - ugh.In short, save your money and go for some other stuff. This is not their top work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sassinak: A meaningful read","review":"Sassinak is an incredible book, telling of one girl's heroism in overcoming a personal tragedy. The characters come to life as one loses all track of time. It incorporates the perfect blend of personal relationships and adventure without ever giving the impression that everything is already settled. Although this is a futuristic society, it deals with issues such as racism and exploitation that modern society still has to solve. The genre of the book only serves to emphasise the possibilites that could happen if we do not solve our problems. This is science fiction that could just happen some time in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Horrid","review":"Unreadable.

I was very disappointed in Bite Me if You Can. There was no romance whatsoever. Each page I turned, I was hoping for a tease....but it did not come.....still page turning until 3/4 of the book had been read and nothing! Like most books, the author teases us with sexual desire. This book did not even do that! There was no teasing, no love, no romance, and.....no sexual desires like other books written by Cole, Lara Adrian, Gena Showalter. It was a complete waste of money and reading time. Next time I will pay more attention to what others write."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the Series, Skip it.","review":"I picked up this book because it was the next in the series. I loved the other books, the characters were funny, had the 3 dimensional feel you love to get with books. Boy was this book a let down big time. Lucian was so uncaring, so 2 dimensional, I found myself falling asleep at times. And poor Leigh had to be shackled with him. And this is suppose to be a romance book. Ok where's the romance? You don't get to the romantic parts until almost page 292. The book was very plodding, boring and yet it felt like the author slapped this book together at the last minute and called it good. I call it bad. Hopefully the next book will be better, perhaps with Thomas as the main character. Now that would make for one yummy book.

I can't hardly put one down when I start reading one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not fine literature, but the stories are good","review":"I like the Argeneau series because I like when authors continue building and expanding on the worlds they have created. The think the twist Sands puts on the myth of vampires is particularly interesting about the Argeneau storyline. Having the Vampires descend from an advanced race of humans is creative. The books are quick easy reads, and the characters are interesting enough to keep the pages turning. Although you don't have to read the books in order, I found that some of the stories are more clear if you do. Sands weaves previous storylines and characters into the new books, but not so much that if you missed a book you would be lost. There is always a twist of mystery in the books, which breaks it out of the boy-meets-girl-falls-in-love mold. This is not the best series in the paranormal romance realm, BUT it is entertaining because Sands takes a different perspective on the origin of vampires and how they live their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked on the Series but miss the humor","review":"I liked Bite Me If You Can, but like the previous entry in the series, Sands is getting more and more serious.

I hoped this would be an improvement. It was not.Sands' writing is plodding, and she spells out everything in a pedestrian manner. By the end of this book you will have read several pointless descriptions of the dog going out to pee, and if you should happen to not know what \\"he raised his eyebrows\\" means, don't worry, because Sands will follow that statement by telling you \\"he was surprised - he did not expect that.\\"Whatever conflict there is in this book takes place on 5 pages, and is completely uninteresting.This book was completely dry and flat. I picked it up at an airport because I am a bit of a fan of the genre, but you really have to tread carefully there.

However, while I enjoyed this book, I could not stand Rachel. She was awful and mean and snarky and in way too many scenes. Why would Lynsay allow a 3000+ year old powerful man to constantly be bested by a \\"baby\\"?! The scene where the family tried to \\"help\\" him with Leigh - the way they all read Lucian's thoughts was rude and insulting, and when Rachel loudly announced the titles of his books...it was almost too embarrasing and painful to read.

Bad graphics here to.SPORTS CAR GT Graphics are A little better here but still not much. The cars are hard to control here to.NASCAR ROAD RACING Same problems here plus you cant remap the controls and for some reason A is accelerate and Z is brake.ANDRETTI RACING Same deal as all the others, and the nascar part of the game is an exact copy of the Road Racing game.

But, having just experienced a MC this week, I am looking for something to help my young son understand, but I don't want to lie to him. The idea that people become angels when they die is not correct doctrine. I believe my child is in heaven with the angels, but people do not become angels. I am not being heartless.

For a 2 year old, I was hoping the book could explain the situation and leave her feeling comforted in some way (she was very excited for baby brother and now he is not coming). Yes, I agree that it is good to teach her that it is okay to be sad about the situation and yes, I agree that having the baby would be better than having an angel. But at her age, I just wanted a book to help explain to her why everyone was sad and her routine has been thrown off and then leave her comforted in some way. I felt this ending may not leave her comforted.

This book helped her understand that it was ok to talk about her feelings about the loss of a child. It wasn't too medical or too religious - just the facts. She is 9 now and still pulls this book off the shelf and reads it.

The poor quality is no doubt the result of these being produced directly from the free, dark and fuzzy reference room VHS or 1\\" tape copies at the National Archives. These low visual quality shelf copies are intended for content review and the idea then, is to have masters made from their film intermediates that would be ordered and processed by a NA approved lab. This does not appear to be the case.When DVD's such as these are made from the 35mm film intermediates, the result is a crisp, sharp, gorgeous black and white result.

The pivot pin has a small metal slide at the opposite end of a spring at the mushroomed head. You put the particular plier tongs part you want in the appropriate position and push the pin through the spring, the plier tongs and the main hinge of the tool. While pushing the mushroomed end and nearly compressing the spring completely, you pull the metal slide out, pivot it parallel to the plane of the tool and slide the plate so that it straddles the hole. Release the pressure and the tool stays intact. I could see where it's perhaps a little too complicated for what it does but once you figure it out (the directions are rather horrendous) the tool works well. One beef is that they could have provided a pouch or a cheap plastic box to keep the main tool and the plier bits together.It's a good tool. It gets dings for the directions and lack of storage when not in use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap tool, cheap performance","review":"As some others have mentioned, I havent found that the tips just fall off when the tool is turned over, however...When using the tool to engage a clip, if too much pressure is applied to push the clip on the tool tip does lever away from the pressure due to a large amount of slop in the way the tip is clipped to the tool.Also, when stretching a clip prior to placing it on the part, if you stretch it too far the tip will slip sideways and can bend the clip.The problem in both situations is that there is just too much slop between the toolheads and handle.I also don't like the lack of a storage box for the tips, I hate having parts for tools strewn all over my toolbox.Because often this leads to one of the parts getting lost. A tool with multiple parts should come with a storage boxfor all the parts so they can live together.This is a cheap tool and its performance is sub par. I regret buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible tool--stay clear!","review":"Snap ring pliers with interchangeable tips have been around for a long time, so this versatile set (four tips in total: straight and bent tips in large and small diameters, that can be placed in position for either internal or external snap rings) looked very attractive. This tool was a complete disappointment, however. When installed, the tips wobble, then fall off when sideways pressure is applied. There is a removable pivot with a cross-bar that is supposed to lock the tips into place when using the external position. Instead when you put the tips on, \\"lock\\" them into position and turn the tool over, everything (tips and lock) falls off the pliers. I did a double take! As you know if you've used snap rings, you must often work in a difficult orientation and apply some downward pressure to keep the tips engaged in the small holes in the ring. A rigid tool that you can trust is absolutely necessary. This tool is unusable and should not be on the market. For shame, Irwin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pig in a Poke?","review":"I bought this thing without checking the pin specifications thinking that it came with standard sizes; no one to blame but myself. Buyer beware; this might not fit your snap rings.Pros:1. Easily intercgangible heads for internal/external snap rings.2. Inexpensive with adaquate quality and suitable utility for occasional use.Cons:1. No tip size specifications at amazon.com.2. No information at Irwin WEB site.3. Only one 180 deg tip size works with standard 1/4 amd 3/8 inch snap rings. This severely limits the usefulness of this tool. I can just see myself with a jeweler's file reducing the size of the others...4. You can injure your fingers opening the package.5. Needs a storage case (Michigan Industrial Tools has similar pliers with a case).Sugestions:1. You can use the inner molded plastic packaging for storage.2.

The tips of the took kept coming out of the holes on the ring when I was applying pressure.(1-1/2 inch ring with holes that a round toothpick would fit into)This product might work for other smap rings (very light duty with smaller holes maybe)My final thoughts: This item should be able to remove a 1-1/2 snap ring and it didn't. Pass on getting this item unless you are only planning on light duty. I ended up purchasong the Channellock 927 8-Inch Retaining Ring Plier and it worked flawlessly on the first try."},{"rating":"1","title":"unstable without modification","review":"The positive feature of this item is that you can easily convert the pliers to one of four different heads. This also appears to be the major negative of this product. The center shaft that holds the interchangeable heads onto the grip does not stay in. It is meant to be kept in place by a sliding bar built into the shaft that is kept in place by the tension of a spring. In my opinion the shaft pin is longer than it needs to be and adequate tension is not maintained on the slide to keep the pin from falling out. It is also possible for the two pins from the grip that apply the power to the points to slip out, again because the center pin is too long. I replaced the center pin with a nut and bolt that fit and these now work really well for me. I don't hate these conidering the price I paid, but they could easily be top-rate if the pin was different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"This tool is a piece of junk that doesn't even grip in either setting with any tip.It \\"grips\\" with a force a three year old could overcome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed the journey","review":"An enjoyable read and journey down the river.

Author seems to be caught up in making himself out to be a hero, whereas there is no deep contact with life; with other people. What strives to be insight seems shallow as the main character has rapid, passing interactions with dozens of people; would have you think that in 5 minutes one is able to sum up the character of a person or place.

It was written with a dear friend of the lyricists in mind; someone who seemed to bring joy to those who knew them. It is about the questions and regret left over after a loss. It is truly special. I would have given this 5 stars, but the sound quality on the two live tracks leaves a little to be desired. Grievance is a powerful rocker full of emotion with a driving bass line, and yet, the drums do not seem full, and Jeff is all but missing from the recording. Still very good, but not great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Live B-sides","review":"Obviously, you've heard the song 'Light Years,' so there's no sense in talking about that...but the live version of 'Grievance' makes this single more than worth it...more energy and punch than the album's version, this song really flies live.

Emma is a totally identifiable character, I felt for her in the bad situations she was put in. I felt that the author did a fantastic job with the Emma and Adam story-I'm glad she didn't make Emma a character who longs for her ex even though the ex is horrible, which some characters in chick-lit tend to do. I loved the character of Jack and I couldn't wait till the end to see how the story ended.

No surprises here -- too much time spent on brand names and boy friends, nothing much of interest in the characters or plotting to keep me interested.

Rather than just let the story unfold, she'd jump ahead: \\"Later that day I was really, really mad because of something that happened...\\" And then jerk you back: \\"This is what happened...\\" Didn't work for me.

At a higher price there are more options available and I have know idea how these would compare to other non-Epson cartridges."},{"rating":"1","title":"get what you pay for","review":"I was happy at first, especially to pay only half price. Upon initial installation, all the colors seemed to work fine. Then when they started getting about half way through, they started either just not showing up, or printing weird color results. This is very frustrating when trying to print professional looking documents/business cards! I will stick with the tried-and-true name brand inks from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not perform at all!","review":"Very disappointed. Did not work at all. Will buy the name brand now.

Support emailed instructions to me for unplugging the printer and trying to install again. It didn't work so I called them back, I received additional instructions which allowed me to print but the colors were not exact. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"clear to see they're not original Epson","review":"colors just a bit off EOM inks.

Had to go the the store and buy what I needed which cost as much for one as I paid for all six. But you get what you pay for and I needed the color to make the rest of them work, it won't print if one is reading empty. So it does fine just to print everyday items, but you may get one thats defective (that's why the 2 stars) but for the price buy two sets and you may get all the colors working."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good and save a lot of money","review":"When I received the shipment, there were 2 cartriges missing from a total of 14 (?)cartriges.

These seem to work great in my Epson R200. They fit in just like the other cartridges, and seem to last me about a year or so. I don't do a lot of printing, just confirmations and concert tickets and stuff, maybe an occasional photo or two. But I've been totally happy with these cartridges. I just always do the printer head cleaning and alignment after installing them. Give them a try, you'll be happy you went with them and saved a bunch of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reasonably priced ink","review":"Ink seems to be good for the price.

I don't print any photo's so I only need the ink to print documents and don't see the necessity to spend double the amount on Epson genuine inks. The problem occurred upon receipt of the order which was shipped in a timely manner. I received 6 cartridges but two were yellow and no primary magenta was included, the seller was totally unresponsive and never answered any of my emails. Additionally, the cartridges were not immediately recognized by the printer and somehow caused the existing cartridges to register as empty when they had ink left in them. Finally the cartridges are very messy and caused my fingers to be stained for about a week (couldn't get the ink off my fingers no matter how much I scrubbed) So, in conclusion you get what you pay for, friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ends up costing you more than Epson OEM","review":"You don't really save any money with these as opposed to buying new OEM ink. 1) Most right out of the package require print head cleaning to correct streaking and that wastes ink for ALL colors. 2) Because of #1 you end up having to replace ALL inks more often. 3) Too many are not recognized by the printer and cannot be initialized.You're better off searching around for the lowest priced OEM Epson ink as it will save you time and hassle.Finally, consider shipping costs as you can end up paying more for these refill companies who charge per unit rather than others who charge for actual weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love McGriff but...","review":"If you like Jimmy McGriff, you will not like this CD!

Evetts however deserves credit for writing a book that gives more information than most, even though much is obsolete (not Evetts fault).

Any fan of Tedeschi and her marvelous guitar playing, and equally captivating vocals (reminds me very much of Bonnie Raitt) will enjoy this live album. The only mark against it --- and this may sound trifling to many people --- but I got real annoyed by Susan chirping \\"Thank You!!!\\" after nearly every song.

In fact, this album is a lot better than FEVER in my opinion. A bonus is this is an enhanced CD, and has the videos for \\"I Begin To Wonder\\", \\"Put the Needle On It\\" and \\"Who Do You Love Now\\". \\"Creep\\" is one of my favorites, a really funky dance number that will have you dancing. \\"Mystified\\" is another favorite, urban heavy. \\"Who Do You Love Now\\" is a great dance song with Riva. \\"A Piece of Time\\" is a great heavy dance track that will have you hitting the repeat button. Other favorites include \\"For The Record\\", \\"Put The Needle On It\\", \\"I Begin To Wonder\\", \\"Vibe On\\" and \\"On The Loop\\".

I was definitely wrong!! Besides the aforementioned song, the only other really good cut on here is \\"I Begin To Wonder\\"....and that even takes a while to grow on you. I really wish I had kept my $15. If you want a really good dance music album...try the remix album from the classical music group BOND.

Nothing sounds like the single \\"I Begin To Wonder\\" except for \\"Who Do You Love Now?\\" which is not even her song, she is just the featured singer. All the other songs sound really cheezy like some old bad rejected Madonna. This cd is so behind in its time. It should have been released in 1982 or something. You have no idea how disappointed I was. Even the highlighted song \\"Put The Needle On It\\" stinks. Trust me if you like Kylie and are expecting something similar, do not go in this direction. 2 Stars for the 2 Good songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damn those Minogues","review":"I admit that I bought this album for the last name of the singer. I've been waiting a long time for Kylie's follow-up to \\"Fever\\" and thought I'd see if her sister could curb my appetite. It far surpassed my expectations. I've described the music as such: Imagine the sound if Kylie screwed Daft Punk and raised the love child in a lesbian relationship with Donna Summer. It's that good. Sadly, the lack of promotion in the U.S. will likely relegate this album to the underground. Obvious singles are \\"Put the Needle On It\\" and \\"Creep\\" which thump, cavort, and tease with the best of them. \\"Vibe On\\" is perhaps a first in its own right- a tribute to a vibrator. Highly danceable, wildly suggestive, and just plain fun, this collection of disco-infected funky tracks is a winner. Don't let the awful cover and liner note photos throw you off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Electro Funk at its Best!","review":"This album is a more funky electro dance flavour that suits Dannii's sultry image, enough to give Britney Spears a run for her money. The opening tracks, \\"PUT THE NEDDLE ON IT\\" and \\"CREEP\\"(one of my favorite guilty pleasures on this cd), would be the right sort of sounds to float out across a hot summer's night. The highlight on the album is also the single, \\"I BEGIN TO WONDER\\" with its stop start dance beats and a vocal delivery that would keep the crowd on the dance floor. Dannii's dark song-writing powers can compete right at the top of the charts and this by far shows her talent and place in the music industry.

The sound is of course a bit rough compared with the full orchestra version but Cecilia Rydinger have made a genuine work with excellent soloists (The toasted swan aria is maybe the best recorded ever) and the clear choral sound so typical for the swedish choirs. No doubt this young conductress is a scholar of Eric Ericson.The pianists (Derwinger and Poentinen) and the Kroumata Percussion Ensamble do their task with accurate precision even in the most subtle parts.

From the ups and downs of any long trip, the \\"touristy stuff\\" and \\"A 20,000-piece model of Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, all carved and painted by one man and his wife,\\" there are many nuggets that have gotten me thinking of traveling again.As one navigate's the chatty, down-to-earth style and sifts through the communications, a lot emerges as true treasures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks!!!!","review":"This has been a great journey for me.

However, I don't know what he was thinking about here. I love the kinkiness and nudity of most Franco movies, as well as the occasional kinky night club act scenes and music. This movie fails to capture any of that. So what does that leave? Not much and I sincerely wish that I could get my money back for this one. Thank you very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Franco still playing with cinema","review":"It is refreshing to find Franco still unafraid of playing with cinema. He takes the Frankenstein myth and injects his own outrageous themes into it. Moira Frankenstein is visited by her father's female creature who eliminates all sexual predators/suitors from Moira's life. That is the plot. The pace is hypnotic or should I say slow? If you have never seen a Franco film before, this not the place to start. He is preaching to the converted with this work. A good place to start your descent into Franco madness would be at the beginning with \\"The Awful Dr. Orlof.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Romay should keep her clothes on","review":"I have one other Jesus Franco film with Lina Romay starring in it (Ilsa/Greta/Wanda The Wicked Warden/Mad Butcher), and in it she is young and beautiful. That film was made circa 1977, and some 25+ years later here she is in Franco's Lust For Frankenstein. I don't believe anybody who buys Franco films is hoping to see a woman in her mid-50's at youngest, complete with liverspots and vericose veins, expose herself and have love scenes. Please, if you have any common sense, stay away from this movie. I wonder if the late Soledad Miranda (Franco starlette/lover who died young) would be still doing movies if she were alive....."},{"rating":"1","title":"lust for frankenstein","review":"The women on the cover are NOT in the movie.

I ended up brought the car to dealer for service that cost me $880. I still have it in my car. I washed it again and misted it with very very light oil. If you want to put this in your car, be careful, K&N filter oil has been reported to cause trouble with intake sensors in many modern cars.

I believe the editorial review presents Indochine's latest album as the \\"Hit album from 2002 by the most popular hard rock band\\". Indochine is everything but a hard rock band.I was a fan of Indochine in the 1980's. I stopped following the band in 1991. At that time, Indochine was running out of inspiration. To tell you the truth, until very recently, I thought the band was dismembered. It is only when I read a glowing review of Paradize that I decided to give Indochine another chance.This is a brilliant album with great lyrics. For those who do not know Indochine, this band sounds like The Cure. Great album, excellent contributors. The old fans of Indochine will not be disappointed. Nicolas Sirkis and his bandmates were able to reinvent Indochine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun art punk jazz","review":"I remember hearing the song Bitch Party on WXPN(University of Penn) radio back in the 80's.

This happened once in a while and became more frequent until it would not set any staples. I do satellite TV installation so just thought it was wore out. I purchased another but within a couple of boxes of staples it started doing the same thing. You would think for $50 it should not be too hard to make a reliable staple gun.

The author, Kim taps into peoples fear arising from terrorists and global terrorism to encourage them to support his extreme views. Kim distorts the situation in the Middle East so that he can justify his anti-Semitic political stance. Kim gives an inaccurate impression of the social forces at work in the Israeli society e.g. he claims that there is conflict within the Jewish community with white Jews being racist towards coloured Jews (Arabic speaking Yemeni and Moroccan Jews). These ideas are simply untrue and nonsensical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopeless","review":"'Romeo and Juliet in Jerusalem' really was the pits as far as fictional literature goes.I found this story to be very slow moving and predictable. The plot was uninspiring and fails to in captivate the reader. One becomes very bored after only a few pages. There were a lot of ridiculous ideas being conveyed i.e. the idea that Moroccan Jews are discriminated against in Jewish society because of their Arab-like appearance. The characters made unrealistic declarations to each other and happily divulged private and personal information to complete strangers. Everything was so Americanised to the extent that the story wouldn't look out of place had it been set in New York.This was a very poor collection of stories conveying the message that Christianity is superior to all other religions. Islam is the fastest growing religion whilst Christianity is on the wane therefore, if anything, it is superior. Avoid this poorly written book at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply awful!","review":"When one reads through these short stories, one finds the worst literature imaginable with equally appalling messages and undertones. The content of each story was more or less the same, in other words they were very predictable. The material covered consisted of anti-Semitic rants, descriptions of prurient and lewd sexual acts. It seems to me as though Kim is merely writing these stories to convey his anti-Semitism and lewd sexual fantasies. The standard of English was very low. I can only assume that English is not Kim's first language. It is clear to me that Kim is a very inexperienced writer, who has much to learn about the subtleties that good literature entails. I would add that this book was very poorly edited, if indeed it was edited at all.I would avoid this book since it really is simply awful in all respects. If you do decide to purchase this book, I suspect you'll find yourself falling asleep after about one or two pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read In Jewish Experience!","review":"This book is nothing like I have read before.

Given that the situation in Israel is an important part of the equation for Global Peace, this book is very important. Enjoyable reading that teaches something valuable about today's conflicts. A must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Semitic drivel","review":"This novel is absolutely abominable. The storyline and plot are crap, with no real excitement/twists and turns. The characters make ridiculous comments to each other e.g. \\"I think there is going to be a civil war in Israel\\". Anti-Semitic views and ideas are supported throughout the novel, which I'm sure will cause great offence to Jewish readers.

But don't listen only to this CD as there are many other songs that make INXS so great. If you are an old INXS fan you probably have everything on this CD, but it is worth buying to hear some of the different mixes. The bonus tracks are definitely INXS, but they are at best \\"B\\" side tracks that need a lot of polishing.

While it does have many fan favorites, there are many tracks noticeably absent. I know this same criticism comes up every times a band releases a greatest hits album, with fans saying their favorites songs weren't included, but this isn't about the album missing my personal favorite songs, it is missing legitimate \\"hits.\\" Where is Mediate (not technically a single), Heaven Sent, The Stairs? How could they not put the most popular self-titled track \\"Elegantly Wasted\\" on an album of \\"The Best?\\" With the band no more, this should be the final \\"greatest hits\\" album, yet somehow they manage to screw it up.The bonus unreleased tracks are mediocre, but don't belong on an album that is already missing several notable favorites.

The item did not come packaged and did not have any mounting hardware - just the receiver. I notified Amazon about the problem and they immediately processed another one to be shipped to me. However, the second shipment was exactly the same as the first - just the receiver. I had to lug these two heavy pieces of metal to the postal service to return it. What a hassle.

Many parallels can be drawn fromparental approaches, to environmental concerns. It's astory that teaches the value of unconditional love, andprofound respect. An interesting essay on mankind, Silverstienskillfully incorporates material need and emotionalstability into the text in an easy-to-understand andchild-like manner.

I read it myself before reading it to my 3 year-old son, as I always do. What a horrible story about an egocentric, self-centered child. I felt so sorry for the tree. It is so sad. How can anyone enjoy this book is beyond my understanding. The parallel some people make with parents and children makes it even worse; a son that takes, takes, takes and NEVER gives anything in return? Not even vultures do that. Nothing to be learned from it so straight to the garbage can it went. What a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame.

I loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emotionaless and Forgettable","review":"I didn't dislike this book but it was a bit of a chore to get through. It told the tale of a black community trying to figure out their new freedom. It followed the life of Sister Mary and her dozen children. None of the characters particularly stood out to me and I wasn't really taken in by the narrative. It was interesting from a historical perspective, but I would have liked to see more emotion coming from it, or being elicited from me.In summation : I can't say that I'm particularly thrilled to have read this, nor do I expect it to stay with me for long. This is one of those books that a year from now I will be unable to recall much about."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Love-Charm","review":"This delightful story by Julie Peterkin caught the eyes and surely the hearts of the committee to garner the Pulitzer Prize in 1929. Mary has the misfortune to become besot by July, the biggest rascal in the Quarters. The love-charm that Old Daddy Cudjoe makes for her comes too late to win back July as he drops out of sight with Cinder and is lost from Mary's life for the next twenty years. Mary goes on to be the Venus of the Quarters eventually having nine children by an untold litany of befogged lovers. A word of advice Mary gives to Seraphine, her eldest daughter, is telling of her view of men. \\"But don' never let yousef tink on one man all de time. It'll run you crazy if it don't kill you.\\" After the death of her first-born son, Unex, Mary undergoes a religious conversion and welcomed back into the Heaven's Gate Church. But she secretly holds something in reserve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Volumes 1-3, but forget Volume 4","review":"I have greatly enjoyed Volumes 1-3 of these recordings. They give generous samples of a wide variety of Tibetan music ranging from several kinds of chanting to traditional folk-dance types of insturmental music that include varieties of percussion instruments. The fidelity, sterio seperation and general mixing are all excelent for field recordings made in the early 1970s. But Volume 4 was a real disappointment to me. The quality is fine, but all the tracks are single (folk-song) vocals with little or no instrumentation by singers who don't sing very well. Some people may appreciate this, but I never want to hear this CD again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling, dense and intellectual","review":"Margaret Drabble is most definetly a very intelligent woman but I totally agree that her personal stake in this material was too deep and the reader is often left adrift. The historical details of early 20th century england is fascinating as well as the main charachter's descent into the negative oppressive options of menopause. I was bored and lost with the material, the DNA business, the archeaological digression and the author's idolization of Faro (sorry I didn't feel that way about this charachter - why should the writer impose this patronization?) Its a good lesson to would be writers: mind your audience or beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Nabakov she","review":"In all fairness, I didn't finish this novel so I can't attest to its literary qualities. The reason I didn't finish is because Drabble gets the essential details on the Peppered Moth Experiment, which provides the central genetic metaphor for the book--plus its title--ass backward. And she muddles other details. If she can't be bothered to get this right, I can't be bothered to read the book. There are some other silly things, too. Such as the character who wins the \\"Nobel Prize for Molecular Biology.\\" There is no such prize. Nabakov criticized fiction writers for not getting right the details of the natural world. It's okay to change the details for some fictional purpose, he said, but the author should at least learn the truth first."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I really didn't enjoy much of anything about this book. The author didn't keep my interest. It was just dull and boring.I gathered from what I read she wasn't a happy person, and then I read that this book was about her mother. No doubt she had a difficult childhood but that wasn't what I cared to read. i could never recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your life is too short to read this book","review":"There are two good things about this book. First, the cover art is outstanding. It is what drew me to buy the book in the first place. The second good thing, is that despite its incredible ability to seem to go on forever, there is indeed, mercifully, an ending. As I staggered to the ending all I could think about was not how good the book was, but my determined, but silly need to say that I finished it.The book should have been called the Wandering Moth instead of the Peppered Moth. The book wanders from the past to the present and back and forth, back and forth, till one is thoroughly sick of it. The book wanders from one character to another, always too late for the reader to have anything but disgust for the character just left.A quote from the book. \\"A pity and a waste\\". Yes, it was a pity the author wrote it and a waste for me to read it. Another quote, \\"Unimportant people, in an unimportant place\\". That, in a nutshell, is what the book is all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read this book.","review":"This book was boring, plain and simple. I understand the cycle of tryany and abuse, one generation to the next theme... but really, what is the point. A book should tell a good story, one that is entertaining, one that makes the reader ponder the feelings of the characters or events that take place. I got none of this from this book. It did not speak to me. I labored through reading it because once I start a book I always finish it, but for this one it was a real chore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glasslover","review":"this dvd records the four hand version of glass' recent opera L'enfants terrible played by davies and will soon be released as a CD.

VV & Hotel have a palpable chemistry on-stage that translates beautifully in the studio. There's this raw, urgent, detached energy to their sound that digs right into the soul of Garage Rock. VV's voice is clear and sensuous and Hotel has this sort of hoarse sexy whisper that compliments her perfectly.The fact that they choose to use a drum machine may feel incongruous to some rockers out there. I know it did to me at first. Yet as I've kept coming back to their stuff, I realize that it's part of their 'mystique' and definitely, for me, since there's no one else to compete with, makes this duo even hotter on stage.\\"Keep On Your Meanside\\" will forever be embedded in my mind and heart, but \\"No Wow\\" will keep me going until I can see them live again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terell is fine","review":"Terell looks good and I bought the book for the pictures.

In so many others Scrooge only decides to change as a result of seeing his own death. This Scrooge changes gradually as he meets the various ghosts and truly seeks a change even before learning of his fate. The vocals are nicely done- Ranging from the creepy depths of the graveyard to the uplifing duet between young Ebeneezer and Emily. The best being Scrooge's prayer in the graveyard. This CD is definately a must hear!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a tremendous musical!!!!","review":"If you want to get in the Christmas spirit you have to get this. I first saw this musical on television in 2004 and purchased the DVD in 2005. I enjoyed it so much that I purchased the audio CD in 2006 so I can listen to it while driving. I think I know why I like this so much. Its because the music was written by the same guy who wrote the music for Disney's Beauty and the Beast (one of my other favorite musicals) during the early 1990's. This Alan Menken is an incredible music writer. Very inspirational! Very upbeat! Very uplifting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite!","review":"Exquisite music in real, original Alan Menken style.You can really hear, that Alan Menken has expirience with musicals and that he has made many for Walt Disney.Absolutely Fantastic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but the Broadway Production is Better!","review":"This is the 2004 film version of Alan Menken and Lynn Ahren's \\"A Christmas Carol\\".

I usually like to read books that are page turners while vacationing and this book was that...and so much more. Sara has an uncanny ability to recall minute shifts in consciousness that are hard to put into words to begin with, let alone 15 years after the fact. For me, this book ranks up there with the likes of \\"The Teachings of Don Juan\\" in its tale of one woman's path from vague, cosmic discontent to a clear look at the patterns that have caused human beings to suffer for thousands of years. Her account of finding her teacher in Cheri Huber, a female, western Zen teacher, are marvelous, scary, tender and funny...everything a Zen teacher should be.

Definitely a good, timely read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Same Old Thing","review":"There are only 4 pages in the book that tell you what to do and the advice is general--not specific. I think the Fool have put one over on their readers by publishing this book because everything in the book has been said before. A couple of years ago I heard the Fool say on their radio show that the NASDAQ could hold at 5000, but look where it is today---1600. At the time of the Internet boom the Fool were big Internet investors in such companies as Yahoo (then 250--now 17), etc. Hahhah If you look at the picture on the cover they don't seem happy and they are holding what appears to be a bag of cash.

As an old music commercial used to suggest, \\"...you got's to get your own!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"HILARIOUS!!","review":"This is the season where the Martin show really took off. It has the hilarious scene with Brother Man taking his shoes off while watching the fight on TV. It also has the hilarious episode with Martin in traffic court (What does GTD mean??!) Hopefully seasons 3, 4, and 5 will be released. I'm waiting the see the DMV episode from season 4 with Sherman Hemsley. I wish they would have put bloopers and outtakes on the DVD set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Martin is the Best!","review":"I have been waiting for the Martin series to come out.

Well worth it. You will not be wasting your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring It On","review":"My sentiments is with the rest of the fans. Martin was the funniest show on tv.

The main complaint is that the two compartments are not the same temperature so one gets done before the other."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment","review":"I've read four children's versions of the Iliad, and this one is by far the most disappointing. The author has chosen to concentrate on the romantic aspects of the war, which is certainly an option, but to end it with Menelaus in tears is going way too far. My students, familiar with the story from other sources, found the dialogue trite and laughable. As one said, \\"Since when would Achilles say 'Sir' to Agamemnon?\\" There are far better versions of the Trojan War out there to use to introduce children to this classic. This one's a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"K-Tel Notorious For Not Using Original Recordings!","review":"All I had to do is listen to the song samples, and I could tell these aren't original recordings. K-Tel is pathetic. This collection is way over priced. I avoid anything with the K-Tel logo. I've had the original recordings of these songs, and they aren't even close. Especially Saginaw, Michigan. Awful, and not even close. If you are a serious music lover, and enjoy the original recordings stay away from anything that K-Tel puts together."},{"rating":"2","title":"super fit, lousy wet traction","review":"Vasque has some of the best boots ever made. I love the comfort and fit of the Breeze. The wet traction of these boots are lousy. The boots are very slippery on damp rocks. I live in the White Mountains of New Hampshire and treeline hikes on rocky terrain is common. I have slipped and fell a number of times.

They are bound and determined to override a work of collaborative genius with their own stale biases and canned interpretations.And not a one of them shows a sense of humor, so far as I could discover. The writers and illustrators of The Simpsons are miles ahead of these writers in evaluating contemporary culture.Maggie would not countenance their hogwash."},{"rating":"2","title":"great production solid cd","review":"les raw than Menace with less Lizzy screams,but holds up better than any prevous release"},{"rating":"2","title":"Butch Cassidy CD","review":"This cd soundtrack was in great condition and I received it promptly upon payment!

I've been advised to steer clear of simple sugars, esp. white sugar, white flour, rice and potatoes. I thought this book would be a great addition to my cookbook library, but alas it was not. Unfortunately the authors simply omit white sugar from the recipes, but still include huge amounts of simple sugars through white flour and fruit juice concentrates. If you are specifically allergic to white sugar, then this book might be for you. If, however, you're a diabetic trying to cut out simple sugars I'd pass on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sweet tooth satisfying recipes for restricted diets","review":"The recipes in this book are very tasty. They are excellent for people who need to eliminate refined sugar from their diets. As most of the recipes call for fruit juice concentrates or other sugar sources one must pay careful attention to the diabetic exchange guidelines.My favorite recipes are the muffins and breads. I purchased the book to reduce the amount of sugar in my childrens diet as I felt it triggered hyperactivity.Most ingredients are available at the super market. A few require a trip to a well stocked health food store.

Many questions are answered, but not all of them.The scope of the finish here is the biggest I can remember, and the poignacy of the end is distinct from the triumph or anti-climax at the end of many other major science fiction tales.I've read this entire series four or five times completely, and it was worth it every time.Vol. 1: Midnight at the Well of SoulsVol. 2: Exiles at the Well of Souls (Part 1: War of the Well World)Vol. 3: Quest for the Well of Souls (Part 2: War of the Well World)Vol. 4: The Return of Nathan BrazilVol. 5: Twilight at the Well of Souls"},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"must\\" for all fans of the New Yorker magazine.","review":"The New Yorker was founded in the Jazz Age and grew to literary proportions, coming to represent the arts of the city and the major participants in these arts.

I wasn't disappointed. But the book also introduced to A.J. Liebling and John Hersey and host of other fine writers that I hadn't a clue about. On top of that, it's just a doggone fine history of the greatest literary magazine in U.S. history. Hats off to Ben Yagoda for another fine work"},{"rating":"1","title":"flimsy, cheap","review":"It's easy to put together, but the legs aren't strong enough to support the weight of the batteries, can, and motor.

Getting a soda can is easy enough. The educational value is decent because the kids get to understand how to build things. I was personally very exsited to build it. Some of the screws were very hard to get in. I almost hurt myself because I had to use a lot of force on these very tiny screws to get it together. I soon as I was done I started to wonder if I did something wrong. It only had 3 legs! But look at the box carefully and you will notice that there are only 3 legs on this thing. No balance, if any at all! Oddly enough it came with 2 more legs but with no way to attach them.If you can get it to balance, the vibrations from the motor will shimmy the object across the floor...very....very....slowly."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissatisfied","review":"I bought this product for my 10-year-old grandson.

It could have been awesome. But instead, as other reviewers noted, there are some very tragic design flaws. The main one is that the wires soldered to the motor are soldered in the wrong direction forcing a kink. Once the toy began to vibrate, it only vibrated for about 25 seconds. And then it was silent. The wires at the motor had broken. A HUGE disappointment.The other flaw is that there are only 3 legs spaced close together. It makes for a top heavy toy prone to falling over. But like I said, before we had a chance to bend the legs and get it stable, we were out of tries because the wires broke.Major bummer. Perhaps they'll redesign this one in the future. I think it has real promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"It can be fun, if you try. Use your imagination.","review":"To make it more stable, just bend the back legs out a bit. A level surface helps. And I'll bet that with a bit of simple circuitry and muscle wire connected to the back legs I can make it radio controlled by limiting the movement of one leg at a time so that the other one turns it. The 'wings' would make a very good antenna. The circuitry could be put in the soda can. Does anyone want to work with me on this project?

On the day before Father's Day, while he was out, I set up these four tie organizers and he was pretty surprised. His ties are neat and always in order. We asked him the yesterday what he would rate the tie organizers out of 5 stars and he said a 6! So nice to get a great product at a great price!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Design. Broken in less than 4 months.","review":"Granted these tie rack organizers were pretty cheap, so I went in to the purchase with pretty low expectations. I really didn't need a complicated electronic tie selector or anything overly complex. Unfortunately, I was disappointed even given the considerations I made prior to purchase. This design has a fundamental flaw. The hook fits into the rotating disk by a plastic prong. Over a period of about 2 months, using the organizer 4-5 days a week, the plastic prong has worn down. This allowed the disc to detach from the hook. It's no longer able to hold up the weight of the rack of ties without popping out. Your options at this point are either super-glue the two pieces together (and lose the rotation ability) or simply throw it away. I can not recommend it for purchase, unless you are only using it once a week or so. It's definitely not suitable for anyone who wears ties daily to work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent price! Excellent product!","review":"My boyfriend had 20+ ties draped over a hanger in the closet. Every time he went to get one out to wear, he had to push through them all to find the one he wanted.

If someone only has 5-8 ties, these would probably be fine, however with so many slots for ties this is just a gimmick cheap item that can't hold the amount it is built to carry.Warning for any consumer, if you want to place more than 5-8 ties on this rack, DON'T buy.

It comes in a flat padded envelope and it comes as two pieces that you snap together. The part that you hang your piece on spins wonderfully and that is a plus.

Don't be deceived by the cheap price. If you have less than 20 ties, simply spread them out on the tie hangers so that the spindle is in balance and spins freely. The ties are stored neatly and compactly. Installation consists of snapping two pieces of plastic together. Nothing could be easier. I'm amazed how well it works. For this price I didn't expect much, but I couldn't be more satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this rack, go for another one","review":"I had very high expectations for this rack, since I have a lot of ties and didn't have any proper storage for them, sadly, I had to go into the market looking for another, as this one couldn't do the job.Short story: this rack can't stand the weight for which it was designed.Long story: This rack is made of two pieces that snap together, a design flaw that probably was made with the purpose of allowing the rack to spin and maybe to make its packaging easier, however, the fact that it has two pieces, with nothing to hold it together but the very same plastic form the hook that snaps into the carrousel, as a result of all this, when you put one tie in each of the hangers, as intended, after one or two minutes the carrousel loosens from the hook, and falls to the ground along with all the ties."},{"rating":"1","title":"fell apart","review":"even though it's cheap, don't waste you money, it's flimsy and fell apart. I'd rather pay twice the price and have something last"},{"rating":"2","title":"Plastic Tie Rack that holds your ties!","review":"First off I'll note on how I don't understand the 1 star reviews.This item is $2.00, I got it in on sale for <$2.00, but it really does what it is supposed to.I don't see any durability flaws in it, I already have several ties hanging from it. It is very basic and simple to use. For the price I don't know how people may be complaining. It's basically like a 99cent store or Dollar Tree item that performs what it is supposed to perform.Back to the product :It holds the ties well and the hook works with my closet (which should work for any closet). It spins like it's supposed to and holds my ties very well. This is my first tie organizer so I may be cutting it slack, but its the cheap basic tie holder. Not stylish or anything. The packaging was a little off, which is why I can see it being in a 99cent store of some sort.But overall I enjoyed the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONLY ONE IN THREE PERFORMED PROPERLY","review":"\\"Wow! What a great product to organize my 40+ neckties,\\" I thought as I placed my order for two of them. They were sent flat in two pieces per unit (hanging hook & rotating spindle) and the first one snapped together in a flash. When I tried assembling the second one the hook broke as I tried to duplicate my first success.\\"Oh Well,\\" I opined. The cost was cheap enough and I could always just buy a replacement, which I did. When it arrived I carefully snapped the two pieces together and breathed a sigh of relief at my success. I rushed to gather up my remaining ties and when I returned the Tie Rack Organizer had fallen off the arm of my couch onto the carpeted floor where it laid broken into two pieces, utterly useless!DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does it's job","review":"This item works just fine. It is supposed to hold 20 ties, but for thicker ties I would suggest you only fit 10 (1 tie on every other hook), unless you don't mind cramming them on there. For the price this was a steal (it was about a dollar). It saves space and gives my closet a more organized look."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twirl a tie","review":"Am very disappointed but I should have known for the price I paid it wasn't worth it.

There are many fancy tie contraptions out there, but this simple and affordable device does the job masterfully. I hang my ties on two of these and now I can quickly turn these to find the tie that matches my shirt. I give it four stars because the spokes are spaced close together and I place my ties on every other spoke to make it a little easier to sort through. Not a big deal considering how low the cost of these are."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM","review":"I bought this rack hoping it would help me stay organized.

What more can you ask for in something that should be just that. Easily twirls to get to my favorite tie and fits any coat rod I have put it on. Without getting any ties wrinkled, I can fit ties and belts on this without taking up much space. A must buy for anybody that has ties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Small","review":"I bought this for my BF so that he could have a way to organize his ties. I saw the low cost and 4 star rating and thought it would be a good buy. Unfortunately I was wrong. The sections are so close together that the ties end up being smushed. My boyfriend doesn't even use it. I havent tossed it quite yet, still hoping to come up with a creative use for it....maybe I can tie ribbons to it and use it as a cat toy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for...","review":"There's a reason these are cheap. They are cheaply made, and they fall apart with ties on them. The rack itself is made from two pieces of plastic. One is the hanger and the other is the portion that holds the ties. When the rack gets more than 1/2 full, the part that holds ties just falls off the hanger part. It kind of renders the whole product useless, in my opinion. Only way I got it to work was to super glue the pieces together, of course then it no longer rotates.Like I said, you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy arrived broken","review":"Although very inexpensive its not even worth it if it was free.

Filled the tie rack to the brim and it held itself together while still twirling. It does the work of what other ties racks 10 times it price do.

Right after I plugged the hook in the hole of the body it broke. This item is definitely not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for.","review":"The product came as described, in a new box so nothing to complain there. Know though that the plastic that it's made out of is incredibly cheap...hence the low price. The hook of mine snapped off as soon as I put any pressure on it which was a bit disappointing considering I waited a few weeks for it to arrive (within the estimated time frame though). Overall, if you just need something really cheap and are careful with how you put the two pieces together, you should be fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hangs to close to the closet rod","review":"We have really tall closets and our closet rods are high this makes it impossible to use this product. It hangs only an inch or two away from the rod so you can't reach it without knocking all the ties off.

Finally, this is a product that works, and works well. If you don't have 20 ties to hang, just spread them evenly to evenly distribute the weight on the hanger. It fits nicely in the closet and makes it easy to find the tie that I want. I don't have to pull out all of the ties to find the one I want anymore.

Since we needed something bigger with a growing family with was the one for us. Took it out of the box everything was like brand new.. I put it to use right away , the test was leg quarters. Set the time and off it went.. The chicken was wonderful, it was juicey but really tender. In other words just right. We did the same with Pork Chops, they turned out great.. I really have enjoyed the rotisserie so far. Expect one thing.. The spit rod came apart at one of the rods. The bolt was no longer holding it in place. So I contacted the seller and I had a new one sent to me with no problems.. It comes with a 6 month warrenty.. So keep all the paper work and the box if you are able to just incase. It is a really wonderful rotessierie to have around when you dont want to heat up the whole kitchen. If it wasn't for the spit rod breaking off, I would have given it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"WE BE COOKIN'!","review":"We owned the smaller version of the Ronco Showtime Rotisserie and thought we'd step up in size.

The price is onest and the ship very fast!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great photos, terrible writing","review":"This could have been a much better book if it weren't for Nichols continual essays on how Indian Larry fits into the author's personal view of Viking mythology. After the umpteenth time reading how Indian Larry was a \\"mythic hero\\" confronting his self-made demons and emerging as a new person, I was ready to scream. Seriously, that thought makes up about 90% of the written content of the book. The pictures, and the brief comments from other bike builders are pretty interesting, but the maddening writing of Dave Nichols ruined this book for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fairly good read","review":"I was very interested in the subject matter, but was disappointed in the style of the author. Nichols practically made Indian Larry a god. I would much rather have read of his more human side, the way others in the book talk about his interactions with his fans, than to see him portrayed as a mystery-shrouded spiritualistic holy man. Indian Larry was a human, full of human faults, quirks and characteristics. His motorcycles were as unique as his lifestyle, but, in the end they were still motorcycles, just as he was still a man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Ordered the book for my dad for Christmas see that he had met Indian Larry a month before he passed away...

Being a John Barry fan I thought I would try their new cd. I can't tell you how very disappointing I found it. First of all the recording itself didn't have the rich tones you would expect. It actually sound \\"tinny\\" in some spots as if it were being recorded in a high school auditorium by the senior glee club. I also found myself wishing that the voices weren't there and I could just hear the music. I'm sure this review will find disfavor with many, but try and listen to the cd if you can before you buy it.

You have to go to the Olympic Airlines WEB site and get the domestic timetable of flights from Athens. Even flying Olympic from London you have to check in again as a domestic passenger and then go through security and then you find a row of gates with numbers and names of islands. It's simple if you're not half asleep. The first class lounge (ok - not real island hopping but I'm 65) is hidden at the end of the row AFTER security.

The Xplain data definition and manipulation language is just great to create consistent data models. This book is an excellent introduction to that language. In my experience Xplain diagrams are far easier to understand that ER diagrams. Handy if you come in new to a project and need to understand the database: just draw an Xplain diagram. With an Xplain diagram most of the time I can also immediately offer suggestions for improvement.Another advantage is that semantic modeling recognizes only inheritance and aggregation, so it fits well in an OO approach to software development.So if you do a lot of data modeling and data base design I suggest you get hold of a copy. Your data models will improve, guaranteed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Recipes for Success","review":"This is an excellent reference for the working blacksmith.

Francis thoroughly discusses forges and forge equipment, tools for the smithy, and basic blacksmithing operations and how they are best performed. All this is filtered through his many decades of hand-on experience at the highest levels of blacksmithing.I especially enjoyed this book because Francis was an opinionated, crusty old blacksmith and his persistent, forceful personality shines through in living color!This great book is out of print now, but it is worth the effort to find yourself a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Eau de toilette foe men","review":"I am charmed with this aroma.

Recomended","review":"The clubs are very inexpensive and are great quality. I purchased a set of Dunlop clubs and also these Cougars. With the Cougars I drive farther and my short game is also better. The only thing I did not like was the bag, but for the price you can afford to buy another bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low price because of low quality","review":"I am new golfer and don't know what kind of clubs I should use. So I bought this complete set in Amazon. Lowest price I can find. The clubs looks good when it came. But I have already broken 7 and 8 iron in driving range practice. They broke at the same position of club head. So I think the material of the club head doesn't qualify the club head requirement.Bottom line is, it's really cheap. The bag is OK. The putter won't be broken. For the rest, at least I got a trial on all the clubs.My conclusion is this set of the clubs can be a candidate for first club set to get some experience on golf club but not qualified to play golf."},{"rating":"1","title":"These Clubs are Defective","review":"I purchased clubs thinking they were a good deal.. I did see 2 bad reviews on here but... I said to myself well they must be doing something wrong... Well I was wrong for having not listened to them.

I would not recommend these clubs to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy!","review":"I bought this set after reading the positive reviews but I must say that I am terribly disappointed.

It is captivating, stimulating, and the evidence supports the claims.

Excellent work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing-- save your money!","review":"This book was very disappointing. I heard the author on Liddy and got the book based on that and his two Pulitzers. G. Gordon failed me! Obviously the author did not get his Pulitzers in history. The book is poorly researched, makes elementary errors of historical fact on almost every page and does not really add to our knowledge of the spy called Werner who was operating in Hitler's headquarters. In addition to these transgressions, the author is actually sympathetic to Adolf Hitler and claims a state and army which fought to the last until their enemies had occupied the country, was \\"disloyal!\\" This shows a basic misunderatanding of the nature of the Nazi state. This work once again shows clearly why journalists should stick to newspapers and other works where inaccuracy is no failing and footnotes aren't required. Think- National Inquirer does World War II and you have this book in a nutshell."},{"rating":"2","title":"An involving, informative addition to World War II history.","review":"This history of Martin Bormann and the defeat of the Reich charts the activities of a high-level traitor within Hitler's regime. Soviet agent 'Werther' was the most devastating traitor in history: this examines the facts and identifies Martin Bormann, Hitler's second in command, as 'Werther'. An involving addition to WW2 history."},{"rating":"1","title":"It wasn't Martin>","review":"Actually, from my intensive reading about the subject, I believe the spy behind the Nazis down fall was Admiral Wilhelm Canaris. Head of the Abwehr (Germany's CIA), he not only hated Nazism and Hitler, but he also intentionally recruited people for his organization who felt the same way. In fact, I dont believe the British broke the Germans code (Ultra & Enigma). I believe Wilhelm gave it to them. Furthermore, Bormann was way too personally loyal to Hitler to even dream of [messing with] him. It just didn't fit his psychological makeup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucy Ring","review":"This is mostly about the Lucy Ring in Switzerland with some speculation about Martin Bormann. I found it very interesting, as it linked the battles on the eastern front with Lucy reports. Very fascinating. The theory that M.B. was the source agent is difficult to fathom. M.B. would have had to be very perverse, not impossible but I would have expected a master spy to have an escape route ready. Still a fascinating read about some wonderful FEMALE spies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not particularly well written spy story","review":"I found that the author did little to explain Bormann's motivation for undermining the Third Reich. The explanations of the strategic issues facing Germany will shallow and weak. The section on Russia leans heavily on Manstein's and Von Mellenthin's books so I suggest anyone interested in this topic read it straight for the horses mouth. All in all an unconvincing, unsatisfying book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb anthology","review":"This anthology successfully synthesizes the work of leading social scientist in the diverse and growing field of gender and immigration. This book teaches readers about how immigrants (both men and women) are impacted by immigration policy, socialization, religion, and transnationalism. In addition, the essays also look at generational conflict, as well as ways that second and third generation minorities develop a cultural identity. All in all, this textbook is an invaluable resource for teachers and students. I highly recommend this book for course adoption, especially for those who teach about immigration, race, gender, and work."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wouldn't change a word!","review":"I've seldom read a book in which I wouldn't alter one single word. This is one of those books. Mr. Simon gets it spot-on right. As I read it I did a sort of connect-the-dots thinking of storied he'd filed from his time in Sarajevo. When I'd listen to him I'd think this isn't simply a story for him. He's having a life-altering experience. Pretty Birds is the result of that amazing and terrible time.This book stands as both a great work of historical fiction and a memorial to those wonderful souls ripped from this world by the hand of tyranny that swept through their lives. Read it and learn. Read it and remember. Read it and laugh as the human spirit struggles to find joy in a joyless slaughter pen. But, most of all, as the popular saying goes, read it and weep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Birds Review","review":"An absolutely beautifully told, yet dark book. I'd seen an interview on morning TV with the author and, based on his first-hand experiences and his discussion of the novel, I had to go out and read it. The story is incredibly touching and poignant, while at the same time devastating. The characters are all very vivid and the strength they illustrated was amazing. However, the reaction of the rest of the world to the horrors unfolding was unconscionable and incredibly disappointing - a fact I had not fully realized until I finished this story. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written - okay story","review":"I like Scott Simon on NPR and I really wanted to like this book, but I was disappointed.

I do enjoy listening to the author a lot on the radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Surprise","review":"It is no surprise that Pretty Birds is now at the top of my list when asked for book suggestions. This first time novel from Scott Simon is as moving, informative, and as humorous as the host of NPR's \\"Weekend Edition\\". It is a coming of age/war novel for the twenty first century that asks the big questions. I began slowly reading, savoring each page but the compelling storyline urged me on and I found myself turning pages late into the night. Take it to the beach to read this summer but don't plan on doing any swimming. This book is just too thoughtful, too important.

I was dying to read it since then, and I finally got a copy.Whoa.I could not put the book down from the time I started it until the time I finished. It was a real page-turner. The characters are very well developed and you feel their shames, sorrows, and anxieties as though you were living through it yourself.I was hanging on the edge of my seat until the very end.

The Filthiest Show in Town sounds like a soft core 60's B-movie with an extra helping of sleaze added for good measure. TKKs latest offering is the ultimate soundtrack for driving down the seedier areas in your neck of the woods, where neon lights & hookers welcome the lonely and lost to crash and burn under a groovy bass line and a spinning disco ball.Although I personally miss their more aggressive take on music with songs from the past like The Days Of Swine & Roses, After the Flash, and Lucifers Flowers, the Filthiest Show in Town does pack a mean punch in terms of originality, groove, style, and subject matter.

It is a dismissal, either intentionally or unintentionally, of writing that is, to those who do reviews, foreign.Playing in the Dark also examines the use of blacks in literay works. it explores how black characters are somewhat a non entity. They are used somewhat as a prop, a filler, though, the story and/or the story line, in many cases could not exist without these characters.the book explores how the authors do not know how to develop these characters because the authors themselves have a preconceived opinion of blacks, therefore it would be almost impossible for them to understand how to utilize these characters in a way that enriches their story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Story of a Common Soldierof Army Life in Civil War","review":"This is one of those books that gives a real view to what life in the army was like during the civil war.

Reading this book is like being with Leander. You can feel the heat and dust on the march. You can taste the basic army fare and can rejoice when the soldiers find a farm that would feed them a decent meal. The description of the meals shows the importance of this seemingly singular event to a farm boy so far from home.

Years later, he again came into possession of those letters and from them wrote this account of the Civil War. His perspective, and the details of his daily life are facinating, and though he wasn't a professional author, his narrative is extremely entertaining and insightful. For example, in order to prevent or cure malaria, the Regiment gave the men a mixture of wiskey and quinine in the morning before breakfast. Most didn't think it did any good, but they got their ration anyway.

I won't ever watch the sequel movie though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inadequate in every respect","review":"It's almost impossible to describe how disappointing \\"Scarlett\\" is to a serious fan of GWTW. The character becomes two-dimensional; the deep pain between Rhett and Scarlett is portrayed as a mere lovers' tiff; and worst of all, the plot inexplicably abandons the deep south setting where GWTW is so firmly rooted for a trip to Ireland, so that the last vestiges of Scarlett's original characterization can be laid aside in favor of romance-novel tropes. When the villagers decided Scarlett's new daughter was \\"cursed,\\" I seriously wanted to call up the Mitchell estate and ask who approved any version of this story. I understand that Ripley's other work is better, but she was just the wrong person for this sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"The bottom line on this book is this author attempted to make it her own. She took beloved characters and developed a silly storyline, set in Ireland, of all places (sooo not interesting), she left all the interesting parts of GWTW behind, all of the reasons anyone might have picked up this atrocious book to begin with. It went on and on in the most self-indulgent way, the endless dialogue and descriptions of nothing, i found myself skipping many, many pages toward the end, racing toward a very disappointing ending. The author seems to think she developed Scarlett into a very mature, interesting character, when what she really did was create an even more unlikeable, somewhat boring caricature of the past (Scarlett embarrassingly becomes known in Ireland as \\"The Ohara\\"-so ridiculous). Stick with the original, this book is shamefully bad, the previous reviewer was spot-on, this is a cheesey Harlequin novel in disguise. Shame on the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage!","review":"This has got to be one of the worst books I've ever read. Why in the world Alexandra Ripley, who is a mediocre author at best, was chosen to write the sequel to GWTW I have no idea. The characters were unrecognizable and the writing is pathetic. Calling this book a sequel to GWTW is an insult to Margaret Mitchell's memory. Whoever chose Ripley to write it must have been either drunk at the time or illiterate. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow","review":"After I read that Rhett looked amazing in his cotton shirt, because \\"the cotton never wrinkled on him\\" or something of that nature, I had to put the book down.

Gone With The Wind will never be \\"broken.\\" Alexandra Ripley just didn't have the Southern writing like Margaret Mitchell. The story line didn't seem like anything Margaret Mitchell would write. One of the best things about GWTW is you don't really know what will happen to Sacrlett and Rhett and that's better than trying to give it a happily ever after ending like Alexandra Ripley.

That is part of the magic of GWTW, the greatest love story of all time. I can't believe that Alexandra Ripley even read GWTW. Tara was Scarlett's heart and soul, the source of her strength, and she never would have left it, not as long as there was a breath in her body. \\"Scarlett\\" is an enjoyable book in itself...Ripley tells a good tale. However, she seems to have written the book as her own story, as if by moving Scarlett to Ireland can give her the freedom to change certain pesonalities with the characters, but not quite understanding the depth of them as their creator did. Treated as a seperate book, it would be more enjoyable, but not as the sequel to the greatest love story ever told"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful - I wish I hadn't read it","review":"As a 'sequel' to GWTW this book was embarrassing. Ripley seems to have little idea as to characterisation, and the main characters do not ring true to the original. And where have the supporting characters gone?In addition, as an Irish person I am both embarrassed and offended by the appalling portrait of 19th-century Ireland. Authors should write about what they know; Ripley certainly does not know Ireland.Forget this book, and remember GWTW as it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful yet Different","review":"I believe that what these people write in their reviews is harsh but they have a right to their own opinions. I must say that even though I haven't read the book yet, when I saw the mini series I fell in love all over again with this wonderful, exciting story. There were a few dissapoinments though; I didn't like the way Scarlett got when she fell for Lord Fenton and making herself look like a slut; I also found it hard to follow because these aren't the same actors you were so fond of... these were others; I also didn't like when Rhett married Anne Hampton , which I thought was ridiculous due to the fact they are very different; yet there were at some parts where you felt so much suspense that you just couldn't stop seeing it. All in all I liked the way Ripley tried to make the public happy by making this sequel even though she will never be able to measure up to Mitchell's style and story. I liked the movie and I'm considering on buying the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excited for a sequel, but disappointment is flooding","review":"The first time I heard of a sequel to GWTW was when I saw ads about the miniseries. I was overjoyed because someone had finally decided to write a sequel. It must have been hard to follow in the footsteps of one of the greats. I could never do it. Even though I haven't finished, I'm disappointed. Ripley failed to transfer the feelings and emotions into the sequel. Tara was barely mentioned, Scarlett's pride and soul! Some things Scarlett did in the sequel were unthinkable. It rushed in places and was too slow in others. It also had too much of a 90's touch to it. The emotions that had sparked in me after reading GWTW were washed out in this book. I was disappointed, but glad to have read something that will put my mind at ease. Besides, this is only one person's hopeful attempt at recapturing the romance and emotions of this amazing classic novel.

One who has loved Gone with the Wind will find that the few characters who have not died are shelved, and, since we came to know them so intensely and at such length in the Mitchell work, old friends seem to be total strangers.All in all, it is very disappointing.

The way Scarlett is depicted in this novel is sickening. I was severely disappointed with this book. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"I absolutely LOVE GWTW, and was a little skeptical of a sequel by an unknown author in the first place, but decided to read it anyway. It was horrible. It shouldn't even be associated with GWTW.The author's style of writing seems to skip along without much detail or insight into the characters, save Scarlett. I felt like the author spent most of her time trying to tie in key phrases and ideas from the main book (to the point that I was fairly annoyed by the end of it), all the while failing miserably and making it quite obvious that she couldn't have penned the original.It was a pain to read and I was thankful when I finally closed the book. I understand the author must have had big shoes to fill and a high standard to meet, but it would have been better if the book had not been written at all and we were left with our imaginations to decide Scarlett and Rhett's fate."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't stop being attracted to this story.","review":"The author Alexandra Ripley did a wonderful job writing this sequel to \\"Gone with the Wind\\".\\"Gone with the Wind\\" ends with question marks. Rhett Butler has left Scarlett O'Hara --- and she determined to get him back. Can she? Will they become happy? A lot of fans wanted to know.But Alexandra Ripley was not Margaret Mitchell. Scarlett's personality was coming from Margaret's personality and life. Ms Ripley was an excellent writer but she was a completely different personality. She said to herself, \\"Scarlett is not my kind of person\\". So we don't have to compare these two books.At any rate, Ms Ripley did her best. She continued the story the only way it could be continued. This book has shown me the greatness of experiencing true love.Please don't pass this book up because of pre-judgments or the movie version of Scarlett. I would recommend this to anyone who loves the heroine, Scarlett O'Hara."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Too Windy","review":"I was very happy to have a sequel to GWTW, but this book left much to be desired. There was such a long winded tale just to find out if Scarlett gets her man. I especially didn't like the ending it left me wanting more. There was not much development on the relationship between Scarlett and Rhett so the way their relationship ends was too sudden and abrupt. It is a very good read if you are not looking for GWTW but that is the purpose of reading this book. It may be that my expectations were too high, I was very excited after reading GWTW and was very much looking forward to finding out how it ends. I have to say I was somewhat disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Before you even think about giving this book 5 stars...","review":"...please remind yourself that there is a difference between a groundbreaking, epic historical novel and an overly lengthy Harlequin Romance. \\"Gone With the Wind\\" is the former; \\"Scarlett\\" is the latter. This book is the single most oustanding example of why some books and movies should end where they end, without a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":".....why?","review":"The only good thing about this book was the ending. It was a little cheesey & kind of boring. The writter just wasn't very good. The first is my favorite book & this just doesn't compare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The book is romance novel trash. I suppose the only benefit was that the Mitchell Trusts got to extend their copyright on GWTW, which would have expired in 2011 if they had not consented to the writing of the sequel. Scarlett lacks the interplay of history and devotion to the traditions of the Old South that is evident thoroughout Margaret Mitchell's work.Ripley obviously spent a lot of time engaged in historical research. For example, she knew that South Carolina law did not permit divorce (a circumstance that was not changed until after World War II) and also knew that military courts sometimes granted divorces anyway during the Reconstruction Period."},{"rating":"2","title":"i Loved this book!!!!","review":"everybody is always giving this book a bad rap granted theres some parts that could use reworking its still really good. and hey no sequel is ever as good as the first.800+pgs is abit much and i have to say im impressed that i actually finished it. and even if you have a hard time with the beginning as i did the last 200+pgs make it all worth while for a romantic like me that wanted everything (more or less) to work out. so i think you should make up your own mind if you like it great if you dont then i hope ur able to find something you like with out feeling like you have to trash someones work weather it was hard work or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would read 100 sequels!","review":"I agree, this book pales in comparison to GWTW, but what sequel not written by Margaret Mitchell wouldn't? With that in mind I loved Scarlett. The characters of GWTW have lived on in my heart for years, and I appreciate any work that tries to revive them. Does this book do justice to them, somewhat, and that is all I ask. Many reviewers have said that if you \\"really\\" love GWTW you will hate this book. Not so. I relish any conversation with a rabid fan that can ruminate over what happened to Scarlett and Rhett, and reading this was like having a very satisfying conversation. I wish there were numerous sequels and I would read every single one and probably enjoy all of them. This book is a great enjoyment if you don't take it too seriously as a real continuation of GWTW, and if you like discovering another's interpretation of what happened to Scarlett and Rhett, well this is the only thing out there so enjoy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What?????","review":"I can't believe anyone would have the arrogance to think that they can take such a great novel as \\"Gone with the Wind\\" and write a sequel to it. The beauty of the end of \\"Gone with the Wind\\" is that the reader is supposed to guess what happens, not some other author. Just from hearing the title and reading the first few sentences, I knew it would be a ridiculous and cheap interpretation of one of the greatest love stories of our time. I'm still fuming with anger."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recommended!

I could write better than this. It's written in what I call *1ST GRADE WRITING* yuck! I don't think this is even worth reading. It's such immature writing. Scarlett isn't the selfish complicated woman that Gone With The Wind described, in Ripley's book, she's a heartsick wuss who needs Rhett's love and can't live without it. She suddenly turned kind (am I missing something here? Spoiled Scarlett O'Hara? Kind! Ha!) And early in the book, Rhett takes her dressed as the queen of hearts into his arms and laughs, when his mind is supposed to be set. A. Ripley is mistreating the characters in this, writing simple words, not writing with the passionate love that Mitchell wrote with..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scarlett: The Sequel to Margret Mitchel's Gone with the Wind","review":"This is an excellent book!

While significant legal and historical research is evident in Ms. Ripley's book, it does not approach the historical and literary heights of Gone With The Wind and is nothing more than a romance novel. Sadly, I paid $25 for the hardcover of this book when it first came out. I am disappointed to see it being sold on ... for less than $7. Not a very good book investment on my part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Compare To Gwtw!!!","review":"This book should not even try to be compared to Gone With the Wind.

Too many times in 'Gone with the Wind' I wanted to slap her silly for being such a pampered, spoilt brat. In 'Scarlett' though she matures into a headstrong but likeable woman, still determined to do things her way and succeeding at it. Several interesting characters are introduced and loose ends from 'Gone with the Wind' are tied up. All in all, a satisfying read."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally missing the point!","review":"Ok, I tried it. I even went out and bought a FIRST EDITION (not a wise investment). I think Ms. Ripley missed the point. Remember in GWTW that Scarlett would do anything to keep her precious Tara? It was the motivation behind the underhanded things that she did. In the sequel, she simply passed Tara on to Suellen and hightailed it to Ireland. The Scarlett of the South and of GWTW would have NEVER done that!! The book was believeable at the beginning; I was actually interested when Scarlett went to Charleston, and I was glad to \\"meet\\" the Butler family. After that, it got too weird for me. Not one to put a book down, I trudged through to the end. I was very disappointed and would advise only the curious to read this book. Don't expect much out of it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Romance Novel or Great Work of Literature?","review":"Ripley is no Mitchell. Quite frankly, is not a very good author. I must say, the first portion of the book had me entertained, but it failed to capture me the way good literature does. After Scarlett moved to Savannah, it was all downhill. By the time she reached Ireland, the book read more like a cheap romance novel than a great work of literature. The scenarios, while well researched, were somehow unrealistic and laughable. Some of Scarlett's qualities do show through, but otherwise, the maturation process Scarlett suffered through in GWTW was totally lost. You are better off imagining your own conclusion to the story of Scarlett than reading this monstrosity of a sequel. It's not worth the paper it is printed on."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm so glad this book was written.","review":"I started reading Scarlett the same night I finished reading GWTW. Frankly, I was mad that GWTW ended in the way that it did. I could't believe it. Sure, Scarlett was hopeful at the end, but I wanted full closure. For Alexandra Ripley to pick up and continue Scarlett's story, I'm sure it was a hefty undertaking that she did not take lightly. I would have enjoyed to see how Mitchell would have continued the story, but who is to say that she ever would have? I'm thankful that Ripley wrote this book to give readers closure. I really needed that."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a laugh!","review":"I'am sorry but I just finished \\"Gone with the Wind\\" a minute ago and LOVED it! I look up the sequel,read a excert and after only one page I nearly died of laughter! Is it me or is it that Mrs. Ripley wrote a list of things for Scarlett to say like \\"No! No!\\"or \\"Not Melly!\\" and some more \\"No! No's!\\" and made a chapter or more? I would think she would go out of her way to give us some details like good ol' Margaret Mitchell did. Please lady! I've read better soup directions than this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I really liked it","review":"I really liked this book, Alexandra Ripley isn't as good of writer as Margrett Mitchells but I loved what she did with this book. After everyone reads Gone With The Wind they always come up with a different ending so that Scarlett and Rhett are happy and in some way everyone tries to change Scarlett and so Ripley wrote her own version of this and even though its just a book once it's written down then that seems to makes it \\"real\\" so Ripley just tried to answer everyone's questions about what happens next and so on. And she made it a happy ending so that everyone was satisfied and not always wondering \\"what's going to happen next?\\", or \\"How can Scarlett get Rhett back?\\" So all in all I loved this book because it just but my mind at ease knowing that everyone was happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I couldn't even get into it.

I was EXTREMELY skeptical because GWTW is my favorite book of all time and this was not written by the same author. I started it and i picks up where GWTW left off. I honestly enjoyed having an ending to the whole \\"Rhett Leaves\\" ending. I LOVED it. The big realization (kinda in the middle) made me EXTREMELY excited to hurry to the ending. Most people think that is automatically is horrible because it was not written by the great Margaret Mitchel,however i think that is not the case at all. If Margaret Mitchell were to write the EXACT same thing people would love it just as much.

I love this Scarlett book. She is so loveable, yet she still has this strong quality. Nobody gets Scarlett down for long. This character just flows from the Gone With The Wind book.

AWESOME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frankly, my dears, I didn't give a damn!","review":"This was a horrid sequel; trite and uneven plot throughout.I cared nothing of the characters, nor their actions as I plodded through this tome.

Sadly, this one wasn't quite worth reading. Ripley's long-winded, unimaginative writing brings shame to the Scarlett and Rhett saga. Scarlett would have never chased after Rhett. She's much more a believer in the best revenge being living well. Rhett is vastly more intelligent and clever than Ripley can apparently imagine. She fails to capture any of the original character's personalities and turns them into disappointing hollow shells of themselves. I'd suggest skipping this one altogether, or reading it with shots of brandy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophomoric is too good","review":"A poor effort that constantly reminded me of the books read as a middle school educator. It's not nice to fool with Mother Nature, or a classic. Only no good can and did come from this endeavor. Where the inane ideas for dialogue, settings, and happenings came from is surely a mystery. Margaret Mitchell would be appalled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, don't read this book.","review":"Did you like GWTW? Actually do you love GWTW? Do the characters come to life in your mind? If yes, then stay away from this horrible waste of paper.Ripley obviously did not carefully read Gone With The Wind; if she had she wouldn't have changed so many important details. Selling Tara? NEVER! As reiterated at the end of GWTW, Tara is perhaps the most important thing for Scarlett, so for her to move is unimaginable. Ripley's characterization of Rhett is also atrocious. He's practically a puppy in this 'sequel'. What happened to the strong, carefree Rhett?Do yourself a favor and read something else (anything else, except for Rhett Butler's People which is perhaps worse than this) if you truly admired and appreciated Mitchell's beautiful novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.","review":"~*The book was just okay. I give it two stars because the ending wasn't too bad. Getting there was just frustrating. Rhett came across as really really stubborn. I wanted more focus on the love between Rhett and Scarlett, and their life together, but.. well, i won't say anything more than that. If you want that focus, then you might not like the book.. it'll frustrate you, too. It probably would have been better if the author just used totally new characters. I personally think creating your own ending would be better than reading this.*~"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Favorite Book!","review":"This is my favorite book!

This book said that the stock market crashed in the 1860s it didn't crash until the 1920s or 30s and that is just a starter. She messed up the entire book even more than it was already messed up. There was so much running around all over the world that I got confused. Scarlett did the chase after the man who doesn't want you again. Scarlett had no pride and once again no self respect. How could she? she should have moved somewhere else like Ireland eithout the entire running around and getting divorced it would have saved us a whole bunch of trouble. I could not stand this book it was quite frankly annoying and it seemed to have this long intricate plot that nobody understood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Pages","review":"I was not happy with this purchase. The book had the first thirty-five pages missing and then as you are reading, every page falls out. So this definitely gets a low rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucks","review":"This book is way too long, and the plot is slow, boring, and pointless. Scarlett is reduced to chasing Rett and never having him, with some pit-stops with the O'Haras in Ireland, and the Robillards in Charleston (or somehwere in the American South, but who cares, really). I love Gone With the Wind and have read it dozens of times. I struggled to get through this book once. Ripley's descriptions of characters, places, events, etc. can't hold a candle to Mitchell's, and she embarasses herself by trying. The worst part is that in some parts of the book, the narration switches inexplicably between first-person and third-person. Why? What editor let this happen?Alexandra Ripley should be ashamed of herself--at least proofread when you're writing a sequel to Margaret Mitchell's masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll Never Read Specious Sequels Again","review":"Let me put it simply.

I could read it only because it was a sequel \\"Gone With the Wind\\". That novel lacks the spirit of its predecessor. Scarlett no more cares about material things, she goes through a transformation, Rhett marries a regular woman. The conclusion was terrible. The novel's beauty was partially due to its open-ended conclusion. \\"Scarlett\\" overlooks that fact.It is a commercial book.

It wasn't Scarlett it was a pale shade of pink. Margaret Mitchell's Scarlett would have never fallen for that guy in Ireland because ,duh, remember she realized she really loved Rhett. She also wouldn't have given up Tara. The lady Anne wasn't anywhere near Rhett's type of woman so he would never marry her. It made Scarlett look trashy and it made Rhett look less dashing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is pretentious, long-winded, and a waste of time.","review":"This book is an embarrassment to Margret Mitchell. Alexandra Ripley is a tacky, un-original, and cliched writer. If I wanted to read about magic and overly dramatized romance, I'd be in the fantasy section.

It's real writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT GWTW !!!!!","review":"This book could never amount to Gone With the Wind, and it didn't. Scarlett is not only trashy and uncuth, it is totally unrealistic. The book wouldn't be so horrible if the sex wasn't to that extent. Mitchell portrayed a brave, beautiful woman. Ripley painted a piture of a wealthy tramp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alexandra Ripley captured the nature of Scarlett O'Hara!","review":"Gone With the Wind is a great book, but nothing more than a well-written historical fiction; not all are shallow romances. Alexandra Ripley has met the challenge of expanding one character in the sweeping novel, Scarlett O'Hara, and as far as I'm concerened, it is the same Scarlett about which Mitchell wrote. I've just finished my fourth reading of the novel, and it is Scarlett's growth that holds my attention. It is, to me, a fine representation of \\"how Scarlett grows up\\", which is what I wanted to know."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it, and am surprised to see so many people don't!","review":"I read GWTW for the first time only a few years ago, or I should say I devoured it. I wanted more and immediately started with the \\"next one:\\" Scarlett. I devoured it as well and to this day I have trouble remembering which parts are in which book. I mention this only because to me, they seam together flawlessly. I read a few comments that Ripley's book was written as a mass-marketed media tool and this just completely shocked me. Perhaps it was written that way (although I doubt it), but it was never something that crossed my mind even once. Scarlett O'Hara's character stays true to herself and I never felt any inconsistencies or thoughts that Margaret Mitchell's Scarlett wouldn't have said this or done that or any such thing. In addition, I love the story and history that is told in Ripley's book. It was amazing, I still get a tugging feeling at my heart when I think of it all. If you love GWTW, I can't imagine not loving this book as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scarlett","review":"I thought this was a great book and a wonderful continuation of Margaret Mitchell's story. I hadn't ever ready Gone With The Wind until right before I read this story, so I was reading them back-to-back and couldn't do it. I had to wait a few weeks, read a few other books between them, to really appreciate Scarlett. Obviously the characters and the feeling of everything is a little different, because of the author's voice, but it's still a fun read.

While GWTW is a great novel, I don't feel that it is a sacred text so I didn't mind that a sequel to it had been written.Ripley's work is well-written and her research impressive. I have lived in Charleston and it is clear that she spent a lot of time there. I recommend this book. It's really entertaining!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Trees","review":"If you read Scarlett as a sequel to GWTW there is no comparison. Scarlett is a complete waste of our trees and should be burned.I am giving the book 2 stars bc if it is read not as a sequel...it is okay. Not great, or good.Personally I don't think Scarlett would have acted that way...nor would she have \\"grown into a woman\\" as the book makes her do.Rhett irritates me constantly by over use of the phrase \\"I'm no gentleman\\" which he only uses a couple of times in the original book.Mostly I think the writer was trying to exercise her knowledge of Ireland around 1870 and her cheesy romance novel skills.The book is worth reading if you are looking for a different perspective of the characters, but definately not worth spending the money on. I would suggest if you *have* to read it, check it out from the library and save your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some things should be left well enough alone","review":"I can't help by feel that it takes a certain amount of narcisstic arrogance to pen a sequel to one of the best loved novels of all time. While Alexandra Ripley obviously attempted Scarlet as a labor of love, her work comes up short. The tone and voice of the characters is somehow dishonest to the ear of this reader. Some things, as our grandmothers taught us, are better left alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Give it the Time of Day","review":"I'm sorry, but I just couldn't even get past the second chapter of this book before I decided THE HECK WITH THIS! I really am sorry that I didn't at least give it a chance, but I couldn't! After I finished Gone With the Wind (SCARLETT's prequel), I was starving for more. But SCARLETT is such a disappointment. No one can capture Scarlett's character the way Mitchell did. There were too many obvious differences. Also, the drama in SCARLETT seemed much too forced in comparison to GWTW. And certain rules of etiquette in the South that Mitchell made clear in GWTW were completely forgotten in SCARLETT. I do apologize, but I have to suggest that no one read SCARLETT---no one who HAS read GWTW and no one who hasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste the time or money!","review":"GWTW is one of, if not, the best novel I remember reading, which is why I just had to read the sequel to it. I will admit Ms. Ripley is a talented writer, and the story would have been passable if one didn't expect so much from it. Unfortunately, you can't help but want Scarlett to match or even surpass GWTW.I think the biggest problem is that it doesn't come from the same author. Ms. Ripley and Ms. Mitchell are not related story writers at all. As hard as it may be, the best idea is to leave this novel be and let GWTW just stay as it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful as a Sequel - Fine as a Novel on its Own","review":"I pre-ordered this novel when is was published in hardcover. I raced to the bookstore to pick it up as soon as the store opened. I spent the next two days reading constantly, with decreasing interest and passion. This is not Scarlett and this is not Rhett.

I was faithful that the Stephens Mitchell trust would do a good job in selecting someone to carry on the legacy. Well, I was thoroughly disappointed. The way it deals with sex is appaling; I can't imagine Peggy Marsh writing about any \\"thrusting\\" Rhett was doing. The whole scene where Cat is born is absurd. It threw in a magical element that was not needed at all. Scarlett's metamorhasis is completely ridiculous. There is no way Scarlett O'Hara Hamilton Kennedy Butler would change so drastically unless she had something to gain from it. The end of the book is perhaps the worst part. Rhett showed really no indication that he would go to Ballyhara for her, yet she magically knows he's there and rushes to him. All I can say is, what was Alexandra Ripley thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"OOPS","review":"Though Alexandra Ripley's impressive sense of history and her flair for romantic fiction set against a broad canvas are clearly on display here, this novel nearly destroyed my love for the original. The classic characters of Rhett, Scarlett, Ashley, Mammy, etc. are subjected to a mish-mashy plot that, as it rambles along, increasingly diminishes their glow and vibrancy. The twists in the plot defy description. It is utterly repugnant, both in concept and in delivery of that concept. Unlike Margaret Mitchell's true original, which had its heaping helpings of soap-opera, and which sprang from the driven mind of an original voice, this book feels manufactured in every way. It robs ideas and characters created with affection and creativity and pushes them, unwillingly, into situations that feel at every step false, silly and even stupid. Steer clear of the television film which uses this epic disaster as its basis -- it is even worse. Commercial fiction at its most engineered, and least authentic."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is truly discouraging...","review":"...to read the reviews of those who gave this book 5 stars, and realize that so many people have such undiscriminating tastes as to be incapable of seeing the immense difference between GWTW and this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripley - believe it or not...","review":"must never have read the book for which she wrote the sequel.Awful.The only reason I gave it 2 stars is that, if this hadn't been about the fabulous Scarlett, I might - emphasis on the \\"might\\" - have been able to read it more dispassionately.Because it was, however, the long-awaited sequel I had great expectations going in. Ms. Ripley, it seems, had no such ambitions.

Not only does Ripley not understand the characters created by Mitchell, but she makes no effort to mimic Mitchell's writing. Not only does Ripley begin the book by removing some of the book's most beloved characters, but she makes Scarlett act in a way that any reader of Mitchell's amazing novel knows she wouldn't. With out going in to detail and 'ruining' this dreadful book, I would like to conclude by saying if one wants a good sequel to \\"Gone With the Wind\\", read the book, also commissioned by Mitchell's estate, \\"Rhett Butler's People\\". I really enjoyed reading it.Basically, \\"Scarlett\\" was a terrible, horrible, atrocious creation. I wouldn't do it the honor of calling it a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is ludicrous...","review":"The book was good until Scarlett went to Ireland where at that point it just went down hill-the book was outrageous and far fetched-I hated it.

It's Tara.There is no way Scarlett went to Ireland to reconnect with her poor family. NO WAY!.So stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"Not as good as Gone with the Wind. In this book, Scarlett goes as far as Ireland to find Rhett. The story is not very believable and doesn't strike me as the sequel that Margaret Mitchell would have written. But if you are one of those die-hard fans of GWTW, you would probably enjoy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would recommend it","review":"I grew up in South with Gone with the Wind and could not wait for Scarlett to be written. I've now reread it twice and thought I would review it. I know people seem not to like it, but I can't really see why. No, Ms. Ripley is not Ms. Mitchell, but she does give us closure on a story that has caused many people to long for it since 1936, and many have died waiting to know what happened to Scarlett and Rhett.I thought Scarlett was wonderfully written and a beautiful story. It will go down as a classic to the classic. It is filled with moving emotion and a gripping plot just like the original. Come on people. If you keep trashing good writers we'll soon have nothing to read but senseless tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Margaret Mitchell is rolling over in her grave","review":"Although I really do like Ripley's writing and her stories, this one was shameful what she did to the memory of GWTW. I have to blame this on the editors. Scarlett was not the colorful character as in GWTW in this so called sequel. Publishers and editors should know there is no sequel worthy of the original great classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Rhett?","review":"The problem that I have with this book, is all of my favorite characters (except Scarlett) are missing for most of the book. Melanie and Mammy are gone, and Rhett makes only brief appearances. The appeal of Gone With the Wind was Scarlett's relationships with these three people, as well as her love for Tara, which is also missing. A big disappointment, but I should have known that it would be."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS \\"Book\\" SUCKS!!!!","review":"I cannot believe such a hirrifying book has been published!I had to read it because I had to know what will happen to my favourite charachters of all time,i started it, read maybe a 1/3 and i just couldn't do it anymore! this Ripley woman is a disgrace, don't start something you have no idea how to do!!! Scarlett was made act so stupid at times, Rhett was so bland and boring,the writing was of a 2nd grader.if you want to know what happens in the end just save yourself some time and read the last pages, (the ending is not exciting either), yes it ends happily,they get together at the end, but come on Ripley, i could have thought of it myself!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally disappointing","review":"Unfortunately this book isn't a sequel to GWTW.

I saw Gone With The Wind when I was a child and the movie had just been released - thought it was wonderful; but on becoming an adult through these many years, I was tempted to put this book aside (in the trash).. getting use to Scarletts' immature personality is a chalenge. I'm 1/3 of the way into the book and I still might not finish it if she doesn't grow up soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very silly indeed","review":"A montage of endless tea parties, hunting and house parties and senseless self indulgence .... yawn.

Then i read \\"Scarlett\\" and suddenly.... Before, Scarlett O'Hara had stood for the south and how much it meant to her. Suddenly, she goes off to Ireland and hates America! And Rhett, who left her because he lost all passion he had, comes back because she keeps drawing him in or something. Thats not what should happen. And her and Rhett have another kid! And Scarlett likes it for once! Plus, she gives up her corset and fancy dresses for black peasant clothes, gives up her home in Atlanta for a shack in Ireland. It was terrible. Everything Scarlett ever stood for in gone and the whole story is changed around into a bad romance that I secretly suspect thats how Alexandra Ripley meant it to be. It did not deserve to be the sequel to the greatest book ever written. it doesnt even deserve a spot in your supermarket checkout line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definately not GWTW","review":"Ripley tried but it ended up a flop. People often begged Margaret Mitchell to write a sequel to GWTW. But she refused. Do you think there was a reason behind that maybe. One of the best things about GWTW is that MM left the book to your imagination. You got to decide what happened. I was appalled at the statement that Tara no longer felt like home. What was Ripley thinking. Tara was Scarlett's strength. She loved it with all of her heart. How can it change all of a sudden. If you loved GWTW don't read this book. It will ruin the magic of the classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scarlett, no match to Gone With the Wind, don't bother","review":"Alexandra Ripley is good at writing other things but Scarlett was simply totally distasteful! After I read GWTW I was crying from that romantic scene, I liked to think they got back together so I eagerly pick-up the book. I was most seriously disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"And now they are planning another?

Atlanta burns again and hopefully takes with it this \\"sequel\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"eh","review":"Margaret mitchell is rolling in her grave. The Idea of Margaret Mitchell coming back to life and whaling Alexandra Ripley's ass is only slightly less believable than this book. Explain to me why the most selfish sociopathic woman who everybody loves to hate suddenly becomes Mrs. Wonderful.

THEN THE MOVIE WAS EVEN WORSE. SCARLETTE WAS KNOW FOR HER GREEN EYES, HASN'T HOLLYWOOD HEARD OF EYE CONTACTS. THE ACTING WAS BAD, THE WRITING WAS BAD. RHETT (I BELIEVE) WOULD OF NEVER RETURNED TO SCARLETTE. THE ONLY THING I CAN THINK OF THAT WAS ANY GOOD WAS THAT JEAN SMART WAS IN THE MOVIE."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shame.","review":"The book would have been good if it was a continuation of another book or a book all by itself. I would have been joyous and not upset if the book was good. I do nto recommend reading it unless you are in the mood for disappointment. In no way was Ripley thinking the same way Mitchell was when writing the book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scarlet? No, it's a very pale, insipid shade of pink.","review":"Granted that GWTW is a hard act to follow, Ms. Ripley could nevertheless have done a better job. What made Scarlett an appealing, memorable heroine was her selfishness, her bullheaded tenacity and almost complete lack of taste. What emerges from this wreck of a book is a jewel-bedecked beauty with a mysteriously attractive spell in her smoky green eyes (is this Zebra, Harlequin or Silhouette?). And Rhett, a strong vital person who was nearly always in control of himself, \\"feels threatened\\" by his ex-wife's advances; as if that wasn't apocalyptic enough, he marries a frail, delicate Melanie-type to spite Scarlett (the last woman I can see him marrying, for the last reason). If you liked GWTW, do not read this book. There is actually only one reason why you should read it - the miniseries was so bad that the book actually seems competent in comparison"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, but it had potential.","review":"Alexandra Ripley's writing style is immature. Who let this amateur publish a sequel to one of the greatest love stories of all time? The story-line had potential and a better writer could have taken it somewhere. Alexandra Ripley makes Scarlett pathetic and overwhelmingly stupid and the people of Ireland take a beating as well. The climax scene is so unconnected with the rest of the book that it leaves you totally confused and unsatisfied"},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucked!","review":"After reading 'Gone With the Wind' I was eager to read the sequal 'Scarlett'. From the very first I was disappointed in the book but I read it anyway. I was disappointed because the characters were very poorly developed, especially that of Rhett. The only thing that kept this book from getting a 1 for a rating instead of a 2, was that the author was at least smart enough to use a different setting for 'Scarlett' and so could therefore create new and different characters instead of trying to recreate more from the original story"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally the answer to what happened next!","review":"Nobody but Margaret Mitchell herself could have written a better ending to the story of Scarlett and Rhett! I enjoyed this novel almost as much as Gone With The Wind!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Time and Money","review":"I am embarrassed to admit that I actually finished this book, painful as it was. Two things stick out about this book: first, most of the book and dialogue is simply a re-write of GWTW; second, the parts that are original are the most ludicrous, simple-minded drivel that I have ever read. How can you screw up a book when you're writing from a classic original? Well, it's been done. Scarlett returning to Ireland and going from a drunken lush to \\"The O'Hara\\" a respected member of her clan? How about the almost instantaneous metamorphasis of Scarlett from shallow and selfish to caring, loving and intellectual? Or Rhett from the masculine character to the love-struck wimp? Or the birth of the changling baby? Is there always a witch in these dime-store romance novels? Don't bother with this one, it's a total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: Do not read this book","review":"This book was sooooo obviously never supposed to be written. That is not to say that Alexandra Ripley did not do her homework, but she made the sequal to Gone With The Wind into a trashy romance novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't enjoy it at all! Terrible.","review":"I read Scarlett before I read Gone With The Wind. I wasn't living in America at the time, and could only get ahold of Scarlett. It was not interesting. Sure, it was okay, but the characters seemed flat somehow, and the story was boring. I did read it to the end.. and the only character I liked was Cat. A few years later I had the chance to buy Gone With the Wind. Doubting that it would live up to all the raves, I opened it up. It was wonderful. Is that the Scarlett I read about in the sequel? No. And the ending - maybe not so satisfying to everyone - and I don't really like endings that leave me guessing - but it was Margaret Mitchell's book, she chose to end it that way. And she probably did have her own ideas about what happened.. and I doubt she'd be happy with the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"I DONT KNOW ABOUT THIS ONE","review":"This book cannot compare to GWTW. It was also unbelievable. I found myself saying, \\"rhett would never say that\\" or \\"scarlett would never do that\\" I thought the middle of the book, scarlett relises who she really is and how she is going to make her child her number one priority, well little did we know that scarlett was going to leave her kid at home while she went to paries week after week in dublin. And i also thought that rhett was a dashing man....what happened to that? A true dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corrupting the original to call this a sequel","review":"Completely unsatisfying -- none of the depth and complexity of Mitchell's GWTW. Characterizations are shallow and very inconsistent with the original work, and crucial scenes are just skipped over with a brief mention after the fact -- as though the author wasn't confident in her ability to write them. Worst of all, the ending is a joke: characters aren't supposed to KNOW they're larger-than-life -- it nullifies any sense of humanity they may have been given (which in this case wasn't much). If this story was meant to stand alone, I'd simply be rolling my eyes at it (like the dime-store trash novels it resembles -- you know, the ones with Fabio on the cover?), but as a so-called sequel to \\"Gone with the Wind\\", it's appalling and downright contemptible. It's tragic that the iconic excellence of \\"Gone with the Wind\\" has been corrupted by this pandering mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"No classic. Still worth the read.","review":"This book was very well written. Ripley is obviously no Mitchell but I don't believe she deserves the raw criticism of people who've only read the book in order to justify their prejudiced opinions of a novel written by someone other than Margret Mitchell. If you are willing to allow for the fact that this book is not by Mitchell, and read it with a neutral mindset, you may be presently surprised.If you are worried about reading the book after viewing the awful made for t.v. movie, please don't allow the movie to act as a deterrent."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Can't Improve On The Original!","review":"Without taking time to recap this read let it just be said that you really can't improve on the original and folks really should have accepted Margaret Mitchell's thoughts that the original story ended where it ended.\\"Scarlet\\" is really the story of Scarlett going back to Ireland and finding her families roots. Her journey is both a physical and emotional one for Scarlett. Her love is gone. Rhett has walked away just when she realizes that she loves him and wants him in her life. Scarlett decides to grow and hopefully this will bring back Rhett.Ms. Ripley is not Ms. Mitchell and her writing style is also different. This is probably a good thing as it's her own may of putting her mark on the read. This is also an unfair way to be introduced to this writer. \\"Scarlett\\" is a lackluster attempt at trying to finish a story that was already well and truly over. Long time fans of the original will be let down and possibly even feel cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book made me sad...","review":"I was highly wary of this book to begin with--and with good reason. The book is....ridiculous, to say the least. Ripley took the MOST far-fetched idea possible and ran with it, and that would be to have Scarlett go to Ireland. Ireland!! What's worse, is that when in Ireland, the villagers practically do a dance around her because they love her so much. Ugggh! No one loves Scarlett that much.The ending was probably the worst part of the entire book, though. It is nonsensical and improbable. That said, if you manage to detach the idea that this is THE Scarlett O'Hara from THE Gone With the Wind, the book isn't an entirely bad read. When I remembered that I was reading about the \\"same\\" Scarlett, I got pretty upset, because she's just not the same at ALL, and Rhett's not even there most of the time. He's only there when it's convenient.I guess I'd recommend reading it if you've never read GWTW or seen the movie. It's better that way. Much less painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, God's nightgown!","review":"Read the book in 2 days on my sick-bed after a wisdom tooth extraction. Hurried through all the boring parts of the book, which was plenty.In my opinion, there was not enough of Rhett Butler. And too much about Ireland. *yawn*The ending was totally rushed and came up on you so quickly and the next thing you think to yourself was \\"That's it?\\"There was only two good points in the book, which was the beginning w/ the whole Mammy situation. And then in the middle after the boating accident. The rest is just blah blah blah......Saw the movie before the book too, a long while back.....the movie wasn't even close to resembling the storyline of the book.

How in the world any publisher thought for one moment that someone who couldn't write that phrase could do justice to the sequel to GWTW, is beyond me. And Ripley doesn't. The characters are shallow pretenses of the originals, the story is more cheap paperback romance than the original and the entire effort is one, sad joke.Ripley claims she read GWTW six times (be still, my heart -- most of us fans read it more than that before we were out of college) and she outlined it, studied the language (??? she isn't even a Southerner?), and \\"even\\" copied 200 pages to get the feel of it. A totally unsuccessful venture, judging from the result.Don't spend money or time on this if you loved GWTW.

This should have been illegal!!!! PLEASE do not waste your time or money. You will only be mad and disgusted at what this lady has done to the memory of Margaret Mitchell.

I only wish I had been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was far fetched and poorley written","review":"When I had finished \\"GWTW\\" I was utterly depressed, Margaret Mitchell had made me fall in love with her characters, so naively i picked up this book. The first couple chapters disapointed me with the death of Mammy, who seemed almost immortal to me. As things progressed the story became more unbelievable, Scarlett an alcoholic, traveling to Ireland to discover her roots, and that whole buisness of making love on a beachwith Rhett after a boat wreck just seemed wrong to me. Scarlett was a strong woman in the original but in this book she appears desperate and the ending is the most unbelievable part.

Has the woman even read the orginal book? Where is her sense of daring, boldness, and excitement? Her Scarlett is truly a washed-up copy of the orginal, some little-girl, sad cry-baby,if even that! She is not daring, nor bold, nor independant as we know the real Scarlett, but frankly she is quite annoying! Don't bother with this book.

I was mad the way Mitchell created her characters and then Ripley changed them. A sequel should follow the original book and keep the personalities of the characters the same. Also, it was much slower than the original, there were parts that didn't seem to fit into the story.

Ms. Ripley's usage of literary elements is very good, as is her \\"storytelling\\" talents. However.....I still don't understand WHY Gone With the Wind HAD to have a sequel.One should understand; Margaret Mitchell based GWTW on things that happened in her own life and on her own love experiences. It's always harder to take up another writer's pen and write about his/her characters ( Take the VC Andrews Books for instance...)But....the book is an interesting read in its own right and to me, is 100 times better than the horrible miniseries where Joanne Whalley Kilmer butchers the role of Scarlett and Timothy Dalton comes just an inch short of playing a real Rhett Butler.The facts are the facts, folks: This might be a nice evening time read, but nothing's better than the original. Period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!","review":"Margaret Mitchell had left us hanging in the air with \\"Gone with the wind\\". Would Scarlett ever put her life back together or not? Well, Ripley's sequel was an amazing end to the story. The author not only understands Scarlett's character perfectly, but also makes the reader keep the pages turning. This time, Scarlett is most determined to get Rhett back and makes a fool of herself far too many times to get his attention. But, the way she earns the title of The O'Hara reflects her strong will and no-nonsense attitude. Reading about Gerald O'Hara's Irish roots and Scarlett meeting her father's kin is a refreshing experience. Scarlett finally learns what love is. At the end of the story you find her more mature, caring, yet with the same bossy nature. (some things never change!) All in all, a fantastic book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame to call it a sequel","review":"Maybe I didn't like this book because it wasn't GWTW, but maybe I just didn't like it. Like probably everyone who has ever read GWTW, I dreamed about how things would turn out between Scarlett and Rhett. But this book makes a joke out of anyone's imagination. Ripley has all but sabotaged the original characters. Scarlett has been transformed into a simpering \\"little\\" woman, as opposed to the strong-headed heroine she was in GWTW. Rhett is no longer a rogue, but just some average, boring, southern gentleman. Not sticking to any characteristics of the Mitchell's original creations, this book is bound to disappoint you."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU HAVE TO READ THIS !!!","review":"Scarlett is one of the best books ever written. It follows GWTW completely, it is almost as if they were the same book. The style is the same as Margaret Mitchell's for the first half, and then, on the second half, it changes a little, but in a good way.And, as someone already mentioned, yes, Rhett does end up with Scarlett, but come on, wasn't that what we all wanted ?This book is definitely worth buying. I did, and I don't think I have ever made a better buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only because I love Scarlett and Rhett....","review":"Let me preface this review by telling you that, at first reading (at the age of 14), even I didnt quite understand how Rhett loved Scarlett. I guess that just leaves me and Scarlett as the only ones clueless to this fact. So, in reviewing 'Scarlett', I have to grudgingly admit that I enjoyed it. However, I must say that I enjoyed it as it was: completely isolated from GWTW. It was a fun, easy read, but it had absolutely nothing to do with the original. Or, you could say, it was an exact copy of the original. Replace Scarlett's longing for Ashley with her longing for Rhett. Take away the Civil War and awkardly slip in the conflict between English landlords and thier Irish tenants. Ripley's only saving grace is that Scarlett, at some point, HAD to gain some maturity, allowing Ripley to change the character. However, if you are looking for something fun to read while you are taking a break from War and Peace, by all means, enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadfully disappointing","review":"\\"Gone With The Wind\\" is my favourite book, and like many others I bought this book because who doesn't want to know what happens with Scarlett and Rhett?I was so disappointed.

If you love \\"Gone With the Wind\\", leave it there."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad","review":"I loved GWTW as a child. I read the book over 20 times by the time I was a teenager. When I heard that a sequel was being written, I was thrilled. The thrill lasted as long as the first chapter. I was very disappointed in this book. Scarlett behaves nothing like Margaret Mitchell would write her. The only redeeming factor in this book is the descriptions of country life in England, and even those aren't great. Read Gone with the Wind again and write your own sequel. It would be much better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected better from the book","review":"Seriously? The movie was a better portrayal of what a sequel could, and should, have been! However, we are here to discuss a book, and not a movie. As far as books go, Ripley has a fine way of discribing area, culture and character. Consequently, the reader will find satisfaction in those areas, though be prepared, the book comes across as being somewhat predictable. My suggestion would be to check the book out at the library and save your money purchasing something else. Perhaps an audio version would be more thrilling ... who knows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scarlett","review":"This novel is too \\"wordy\\". It needed some more editing.

I'm sure Mrs. Mitchell had a much better sequel in mind but unfortunately it died with her. . . I do not recommend this book to anyone who read \\"GWTW\\" and loved it as I did. \\"Scarlett\\" is a silly book that has only one plot practically - for Rhett to fall back in love with Scarlett. Meanwhile, Scarlett has seemingly forgotten about her children and Ashley and his child and her deathbed promise to Melly! Instead she is running about like a sixteen year old after a beau. Simply dreadful! As a forty-year old woman I have read a whole lot of bad books, and I must say this is the worst! It was so incredibly stupid I never even finished it, (although I read the end, which wasn't particularly good, either!)but I got far enough to get a conclusion: This book is horrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"I would not recommend this book to anyone who had a love for \\"Gone With the Wind\\". \\"Scarlett\\" was a disgrace to the characters and to Margaret Mitchell. In this book, Scarlett was not the same person she had been in GWTW, she has been changed to a weak, cry-baby woman and it was a disappointment to see her lose her strong, courageous aptitude. \\"Scarlett\\" does not do justice to GWTW and I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Must Read This Book!","review":"I thought that this book book was a wonderful sequel to GWTW. Alexandra Ripley completely captured the Scarlett and Rhett that Margaret Mitchell created. I was apprehensive about the idea of a sequel by a different author however, i believe that it was done very well. If you love GWTW as much as I do, this is a great great book. I must have read both GWTW and Scarlett over 20 times each and I will continue to read them over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Insult to Gone with the Wind","review":"In GWTW I was quite impressed with the interesting story line and excellent character development. Mitchell ends her masterpiece stunningly. The sequel was an insult to Scarlett's self-realization in the final chapters of GWTW. \\"Scarlett\\" should not be read by anyone who thoroughly enjoyed the transfomation of Scarlett in GWTW. Ripley creates another Scarlett in her novel who is not on parrellel to Mitchell's original. I was disappointed in the choppy way it was written and the desicions of Scarlett that were not true to her original character personality. If you are not a critical reader in search of perfection you will enjoy the story line and the predictable ending but GWTW fans will surely be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTING SEQUEL","review":"As I remembered correctly at the end of GWTW, Scarlett had finally come to her senses regarding Ashley and knew she didn't love him. Then in the beginning of Scarlett, she is whining about him again at Melanie's funeral? Scarlett lost her edge. The real Scarlett wouldn't have run off to Ireland. She was a true southerner and wouldn't have left HER roots--the south. i thought this book was very weak to be the sequel to GWTW. Don't even bother with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"AS GOOD AS A SEQUEL CAN BE!!!","review":"Although it can't compare with GWTW(what can?) I liked Scarlett. I think Alexandrea Ripley created Scarlett as the person she always wanted to be, like Ellen and I thought that was nice. I think that it was a good book and I enjoyed it throughly."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Margret Mitchell, but Alexandra is a respectable writer","review":"As an AVID GWTW fan, I knew no sequel could compare- perhaps this is why Margret Mitchell herself, never wrote a sequel or published another book in her life time. While this novel cannot hold a candle to GWTW, I give Alexandra credit for taking on such a big project, and her historically accurated descriptions of a post-civil war south. Scarlett isnt the same character she was in GWTW, neither is Rhett- Scarlett's adventures to Ireland leave a bit to be desired and 1/2 the book only covers 1/6 of the time spand of the novel, the plot tends to go ON and ON and ON with no direction. When it comes to descriptive lanuage however Alexandra has it right on the money- if the characters were anyone other than Rhett or Scarlett the book may actually be very good. But then its very easy to fall short when you are trying to imitate a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK! Painful.","review":"My mother told me it was a terrible book. I read it, and I agree 100 percent. Firstly, it has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with GWTW. Secondly, Rhett WOULD NOT marry another woman. Sure, he'd leave Scarlett, but only to make her sorry for whatever she did. Thirdly, every child should know her siblings. But Scarlett isolated Cat from that opportunity. The week in which I read it was painful. It could not have been more painful if someone had taken a red hot poker an applied it to my backside. Moreover, If you enjoy rewriting history and epic novels, by all means, go ahead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very nice read","review":"No, this is not GWTW but it should not be expected to be . I have read GWTW dozens of times and find that this IS a good sequal. Yes, Rhett lost some spark but there is a reason, he has also lost his love. Yes, Scarlett is not as sparky as in GWTW but in this novel she has matured and grown into a woman who no longer only wants things but want a family and a past. I recommend this book to all GWTW fans, just remember Marg. Mitc. is dead and no one could finish the story as she would have."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful read!","review":"I loved this book! I thought that the writer captured the character of Scarlett and Rhett perfectly. This book was beautifully written and the characters were so true to the original book that I became swept along with the story immediatley. I understand that some people object to things that happened in the book, for instance they say \\"Scarlett would never sell Tara\\" but in real life people do things that others would never have expected. I think that the author did a good job of showing how Scarlett grew and matured, but didn't really change so much that she was unrecognizable. Anyway, I would fully recomend this book. I loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"a review about scarlett","review":"scarlett is without a doubt the worst sequel that was ever published. even i could write a better book. where is all this so-called research ripley did in writing this piece of drivel? she must have had an excellent vacation in visitng all those sites where her book took place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the original","review":"Pleae read GWTW before reading this book. It was OK, but don't read it as a true sequel. I'm sure Ripley tried, but only Margaret Mitchell had the talent to write a true sequel. By the way, Scarlett DOES have (i.e. gave birth to) a total of THREE children in the novel GWTW. A son Wade to Charles Hamilton, a daughter Ella to Frank Kennedy, and Bonnie to Rhett Butler. It was the MOVIE version that portrayed her as only having Bonnie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The second-best book I ever read - after GWTW","review":"I thought this book was pretty good compared to GWTW and really great compared to any other book that has ever been written. I don't think Margaret Mitchell ever meant for their to be a sequel, but if there had to be one, this is about the best anyone could write. Alexandra Ripley must've read GWTW about 50 times before writing this book. The whole thing flowed along so nicely, with everything mentioned from GWTW completely accurate. All in all, this was a pretty great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"AUGH!","review":"Maybe the book wasn't that bad, but it is nothing comapred to Mitchel's real masterpiece.

Thanks again."},{"rating":"1","title":"No one could top GWTW!","review":"And Alexandra Ripley proves this point with a passion.

This is supposed to be a great literary work. A masterpiece. THE great American Novel! I barely made it through with my sanity intact.Scarlet really let me down as a character. I don't know why but I thought she wouldn't be such a ninny. Plus I don't mind reading a long book as long as all the pieces are taking me somewhere. This book seemed to have so much filler.Perhaps I had such high hopes for it.

Most of the movies are adventure comedies with a little violence. This film has no mercy it shows clear the horrors of war to the fullest, there are no cheesy one liners in the film. Everybody should watch this, it will really make you respect those men who went \\"over the top.\\" Get This!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding - Best of the series","review":"These are arguably the greatest episodes in the series. They are emotional, moving, action packed, and realistic. If there's a knock on the series it's that it's often hokey, and Indy runs into too many famous people. But this episode pulled no punches and delivered on all cylinders. It is so excellent, I rate it better than the last two Indiana Jones movies.I should also point out I agree with reviewer James Irwin in his comparisons. I found SPR a nice story, and I love Tom Hanks, but if you want a much less Hollywood drama, and something to both thrill you, and move you, check this out. I also agree on BWP being the most overhyped film ever....but that's another thread.If you're at all curious about the series, buy this, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liquorice John Death...a.k.a. Procol Harum","review":"Many don't know that Procol Harum, the group which brought the world \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\\" during the '67 Summer of Love and produced eleven original albums over the span of an often interrupted forty year existence, began as a Jerry Lee Lewis '50s-style rock & roll band in London called The Paramounts. (Whiter Shades of R&B;) While recording their Home album in the early '70s, the guys got together as a lark to cut some tunes in that earlier style with producer Chris Thomas. This album, released independently in 2000, is the result. Fun stuff, and a far cry from Procol Harum!The group is:Gary Brooker - piano & vocalsRobin Trower - lead guitarChris Copping - bassB.J. Wilson - drums"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!!","review":"I would recommend this book to young women who are in a steady relationship, whether it's serious or not. This book is about a young woman who has been with her boyfriend for awhile. It's humorous, and shows the jealous side and insecurities that some young women face while in relationships. It's fiction and a great read. It also encourages people to get involved with the community like the main character did when she joined a special group. A lot of events happen in this girls life, and her friends are awesome.

WE'RE IN TROUBLE IF THIS IS THE MENTALLY OF THE 20-SOMETHING CROWD!! Shallow, Vain, Insecure. Why would someone promote this virtues for the future generation by creating a character with these qualities? Not to mention the lists are TERRIBLY ANNOYING."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Once again, Michelle Cunah has succeeded in bringing her main character Emma, alive on the page.This is definitely a chick lit book, but the author manages to make her story interesting and gives her main character some personality and finally (a tad) more guts.The writing is fun and breezy and although this is certainly not the most literate of reads, this book is a great beach read and I hope that Cunah is working on a third book in this charming series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but rips off BJ","review":"This book could have been so much better. The writing is terrific, the dialogue is great and the main character seems nice. The problem? It's a huge Bridget Jones clone! The book relies waaaay too much on the tired, \\"single girl in the city\\" routine. It also borrows too much from 32AA (this book is the sequel to that one). 32AA was a lot of fun, even though it was still very Bridget Jones-ish. However, Call Waiting recycles both Bridget and 32AA. Nothing new or fresh here. But if you loved Bridget Jones and you aren't tired of that plotline, then definitely check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great sequal","review":"I finshed 32AA and had to start the sequal.I really enjoyed reading this one.Emma reminds me so much of Beck Bloomwood from Sophie Kinsella's Shopoholic books. Not sure why.I highly suggest reading 32AA before this.

It was like some friends got together for the weekend and decided to make it into a film, but they don't even come across as the type of people you'd want to hang out with. The thing just dragged, the story, such as it was, just started and stopped. There was gratuitous sex, which ended up coming across as gross and unecessary.

Normally, screaming electrical guitars don't blend well with violins, and drum traps don't mate well with Tympanis. Here, they do, and damn well seamlessly. If that weren't enough reason for buying this jewel, most live recordings...well...suck. This doesn't. It's great, it's beautiful, buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Procol Harum","review":"If you were allowed to own only one Procol Harum album, this would be the one for me. It's incredible how under difficult circumstances, they were able to produce such a great Live album (OK, admittedly they re-recorded some of it, but even so).Conquistador rocks, A Salty Dog soars and In Held It Was In I with its subtle piano at the beginning of the grand finale never fails to move me. The re-issue has a great set of liner notes and a bonus track - Luskus Delph which had only appeared as a single B-Side so far. Get this one. Satisfaction guaranteed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome remastering!","review":"I too had the MFSL CD and thought that it sounded OK.... although I knew from experience there was a lot of information missing, I assumed, due to poor master tapes, etc. I worked on a project with MFSL back in the eighties and knew how capable they were of doing some great things.I received the remasterd disc from Repertoire and about fell out of my chair the first time I listened. It is indeed amazing what modern technology can do to restore some of these \\"treasures\\". This CD is one that every musician should, by law, be required to have - it really is that good.

Second in greatness only to WrestleMania III, this tenth installment features two great matches. The first being Bret Hart facing his younger brother Owen. One of the most technical matches ever as Owen stepped out of Bret's shadow. The second, the legendary ladder match between Intercontinental champion Razor Ramon and Shawn Michaels, who had claimed to be true champion. The match was designed to determine the undisputed WWF Intercontinental champion by way of climbing the ladder and capturing both belts. The ladder match at WrestleMania X is unquestionably one of the greatest matches in WrestleMania history. Don't look for great commentary in this one, it seems to be a bit weak.

Not that there's anything wrong with stick-figures, mind you. The problem is: these characters aren't supposed to be stick-figures. They're supposed to be 3D characters.

So far, it seems to be just tedious exposition. I can see why people speak of Updike's keen observations and his poetic use of language, etc. However, this book is not my cup of tea. My interest in the characters, places, periods described simply has not been piqued, not after nearly an hour of listening. This will be one of the rare pieces of literature that I shall leave unfinished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Villages a cover for pornography","review":"Updike is a great writer so why does he have to resort to all this salacios sex? My background has many similarities to Owen's but for the many escapades outside of marriage. Maybe I'm jealous of his exploits, but I just think it's sad that Updike has to resort to the many pornographic desciptions of the sex act to fill out the 321 pages of a novel. Is he fantasizing or actually reliving his real life experiences? My wife gave this book to me as a Christmas gift... do I think she's giving me hints on how to improve our sex life? I don't think she read beyond the descripition on the flyleaf. I'm really debating whether to recommend it for her reading. It's a shame really because we both enjoyed all the Rabbit books.

As an IT professional, I found the references to the IT world, ostensibly the professional setting of this novel, less than convincing if not completely unbelievable. The sexual exploits of the filandering protagonist and behavior of the whorish women in the novel even less so. Mr. Updike's mysoginist fantasies are so removed from reality that they reach the point of comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story of Sexual Experiences, but devoid of Passion!","review":"I was in college when John Updike published \\"Rabbit Redux\\" but I never read it. I may read it to compare it to the disappointing \\"Villages\\".Since I haven't read any of Updike's novels, I felt it was about time. The brief and humorous description of Cabot City (Beverly) and Haskell's Crossing (Prides Crossing/Bev. Farms) made it momentarily interesting. However, my dislike of the main character, Owen, made it painful. One would think that the sexual escapades of a successful businessman might be a quick read, but it was just the opposite. Owen lacked passion in his extracurricular activities, or for that matter anything in his life. The one character that I liked, the first wife Phyllis, was \\"accidently\\"(suicide?) killed driving to meet her divorce attorney. I don't think Updike was fond on his main character, Owen, and the writing reflects it.I enjoy a good read, and this wasn't one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Tricks","review":"Okay, Updike is a master, and I've enjoyed many of his books through the years. In \\"Villages\\" a bored suburban husband turns to a life of petty adultery in all it's various forms. As the main character Owen studs his way through the married women in his wife's circle, each provides insight into his character, sagely extolling his virtues; he is such a little boy, so innocent, sweet, so... Eeh gads, Updike, what were you thinking? I was hoping for a bit more depth, more exploration of the complexities of marriage, middle age and beyond. Is sex, frequent phallic worship and a return to fetal-like maternal comforts all a man thinks about? That seems the central message of this book. Poor Phyllis, the only really interesting character is conveniently bumped off at the end giving our \\"hero\\" a get out of jail free card. A tidy and unexpected soap opera ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I could have been there","review":"A must read for anyone familar with the North Central Idaho Mountain Country (Lewiston, Orofino, Pierce, Headquarters, Elk River).

There are other times, such as with the book based on 'Born Into Brothels' and this lovely 'Memoirs of a Geisha', when the end justifies the means. Standing alone, this is a lovely evocation of Japonoise with liquid, flowing images of geishas in costume, swirls of airborne petals, moody lighting, darkened streets - everything one imagined while reading Arthur Golden's fine novel.Of interest are the attached comments from the crew surrounding the film, sketches and extended drawings of costumes and scenery, portraits of the cast members at rest. The result is a reverie of Japan of a bygone time admixed with a recreation of a period for a film. The contrast is dramatic: the book is lovely. And I have yet to see the movie!

My parents live in a rural setting. When I visited for a time, the man across the river was holding these rituals at his house. The group used microphones and the sound traveled across the river. We heard a dog being sacrificed at midnight. We called the police, but nothing seemed to be done. I have never personally experienced this type of abuse (thank God), but I was horrified to think that children were being exposed to these hideous practices.

This is not the case with this book. The opening scene is a good example.Cunnah starts off with a funny premise and then goes on and on and on and insists in describing it in minute to minute detail at which point it just becomes boring.We get that the boss is a jerk and we get that our main character is going to have to be the poor suffering soul among all the kiss ups. But for some reason, Cunnah just kept going page after page on ONE scene.It was too much and it basically set the tone, for me, for the rest of the book.I just could not get into this storyline.

The main character is the type of woman I despise. She's shallow, self-centered, insecure and dishonest.

Recently I decided to collect more INXS CDs, this being one of them. This CD is awesome! Why didn't I get it sooner? It is full of good songs, my favorites being Beautiful Girl, which is a lovely song in itself, All Around, Taste It and I really like the opener, Questions. All the songs are good though, this entire CD is listenable, good for playing in the background or in the car. There are familiar INXS sounds and some newer sounds like ones heard in Questions, which is a brief song but it just sounds so cool. People have said that INXS dropped off after X and even Kick, I disagree. This CD is great, I would highly recommend for any INXS fan. Maybe it didn't sell as well as the others but who cares? This is good music! I think so anyway. Lots of guitars, but some softer sounds too, there is even some symphony music, it's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their best post-KICK album.","review":"Ok, so the cover art isn't so good, but musically this is one of their best efforts. It's my 3rd favorite after \\"Shabooh Shoobah\\" and \\"Kick\\". It starts with the interesting instrumental \\"Questions\\", then gets to rocking with the track \\"Heaven Sent\\". Then the next three songs I think are the best on the album. All are essential INXS. The later gems are \\"Beautiful Girl\\" and \\"Strange Desire\\", but it's all good. The bonus cuts here are nice, but the original 12 are a must. Even though I also like \\"X\\", this is their \\"All Around\\" best release of the 90's, and highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"shoulda, coulda, woulda","review":"This album should have been terrible. It could have been a rehash of everything that came before it. That would have been sad. Instead, INXS somehow adopted a new attitude and sound and became trail blazers again. Too bad it didn't catch on like it could have. I agree with other reviewers who say this is INXS' most consistent album (although I think \\"The Swing\\" gives it a run for the money). Unfortunately, I don't think they toured for this record.

They would be: \\"Heaven Sent\\" the only thing in this set that really rocks, and the best track \\"Not Enough Time.\\" \\"Not Enough Time\\" is a sexy, catchy cut that captures a true feeling of passionate romance. Particularly good is the piano. The keyboard player in this band is responsible for laying down the bedrock of more than a few INXS hits.Sadly, most of the rest of this album is unremarkable and often bad. Even the cover art is weak and the CD case is annoying (hard to open). At least \\"Questions,\\" the opener, attempts something different with its Middle Eastern flavor. It kind of peters out and the band must've agreed because they abruptly cut it off with \\"Heaven Sent.\\" \\"Men and Women\\" attempts something different as well by utilizing an orchestra, but the results aren't much of a turn-on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap band - crap music","review":"INXS tried to imitate U2 by actually having meaning in their lyrics and tried to imitate U2 by actually writing a song that you could listen to.Mission failed, guys.

Heck, it's even got a fair amount of mystery for those of you who like your mysteries with a dose of adventure.If you like Cussler, Clancy, Wilbur Smith, Frederick Forsyth, Robert Ludlum, and all the other biggies, The End of Enemies is right up your alley. i highly recommend it.

A concept album with outstanding production and track flow. Some great songs but it takes a couple of listens before you settle in with it because it 's very different from the pop rock material from the first album. Title track \\"Hope\\" is a great song by any standard with an uplifting message that's still applies today.

A galant effort and probably the best Classical / Rock album every made."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best concept ablum of all time","review":"Hope happens to be one or the best concept ablums of all time.

This is only the 2nd Delinsky book I have read and I have become a fan of her intelligent portrayals of some very controversial subjects. This book is written primarily from Francine's perspective and follows her journey from the meek assistant in the shadow of her famous mother to becoming the strength of the family. She struggles to accept her mother's deteriorating health and desperately wants to find out the secrets of Grace's early years.I am not certain if the description and details of Alzheimer's disease are accurate, but they are emotionally touching and surely seemed realistic! This story is not totally about Grace's failing mind. The issues brought to light in this book establish a great sense of love and strong family unity. There is a wonderful and sizzling romantic interest for Francine. I would not hesitate to recommend this novel to others or to read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I read this book about a year ago.

This peek into the lives of the authors helps parents create a life that is blessedly ordinary for their kids when life may not feel very ordinary at all.

Walking bass lines on guitar actually sound very complex. But the key ideas behind them are simple. You won't need another book beside this one.

Shreier's treatment of Clara Bow and Marion Davies is shameful to say the least considering all the facts that have been unearthed in recent years regarding both ladies. Bow triumphed at Fox with her two final films, and it was HER OWN idea to retire to Nevada with her rancher husband Rex Bell; Fox begged Clara to stay. Davies was one of the most gifted and well loved clowns of her era. She is accumulating a wealth of latter day fans who are discovering this fact. While stifled under some of the more lofty productions hoisted on her by Hearst, Marion was brilliantly funny in many films and also retired (as many of the leading ladies did at the time) when she hit 40.

Thrillers can get away with the first fault and still be good reads, but lacking in the other two is pretty inexcusable. The main characters spend most of the book discussing how bad China is, talk about China's rise to power at the strangest times in situations, and their conversations sound like a political science paper each time.The action really only starts at the end and manages to miss any opportunity to redeem itself, for example a sea-air battle over Taiwan that sometimes just consists of listing the ship names that were sunk.If you want to read books about war with China, read Dale Brown's Sky Masters or Fatal Terrain, do not read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another 12 month wait","review":"Well Mr. Weber has done it again.

Mr. Weber's crystal ball was right on target again.What I like the most about the book was the ability to use my imagination to determine outcomes within the book, IE Scott and Jackie's personal life and the significance of there secret mission. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out these things, but each reader may have a different spin on it.The technical details were accurate and did not bog the story line down (After all who cares what the lat/long is of a microphone on the ocean floor, or how far a photon torpedo will travel in the vacuum of space (If this is information you need get a tech pub)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd techno-babble","review":"My first book by Joe Weber and it will be my last.

Combining an in-depth analysis of the finds from the 8th cent BCE in the southern Levant, along with an astute discussion of the relevant biblical and ancient near eastern texts, Dr. Vaughn produces the most up-to-date and convincing study of the period of Hezekiah, King of Judah. As he most lucidly demonstrates, this is one of the most important and formative periods in early Judean history. He quite convincingly demonstrates that the representation of Hezekiah and his time in the book of Chronicles is to a large extent based on a strong historical basis. This book combines first-rate biblical studies with an intimate and sometimes astounding knowledge of the relevant archaeological material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Oops!!!!","review":"Nicely done AUTOPARTSWAY.COM OR AMAZON.

Drums were then added, along with extra guitars and the vocals. The only thing positive about this CD are the drowned out vocals reminiscent of the old great shoegazing tunes of the early 90s.It really seems as if Lash went at this halfassed.

Milarepa was both radical and loving to all whom he encountered. Mila, too, amply revealed his human frailty during the process of enlightenment. He not only overcame a series of personal tragedies, but also evolved into the consummate example of mastering the poisons of anger and revenge - transforming enemies into friends and bringing many to the dharma.Milarepa is highlighted as an example of how anyone can achieve enlightenment through hard work and perserverance despite his or her past.

Also damn near perfect is the choice of John Doe for \\"Me and Bobby McGee\\". Inspired, as is the rest of this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"Don't waste your time & $. This movie was a boring drama. There's no exciting scenes or good dancing. The plot is way stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too lousy to be campy","review":"This movie is so poorly directed and acted (Hats off to Darryl Hannah for a horse faced perfromance) that it can't even be enjoyed as a midnight movie. All the characters are underdeveloped and the story so muddled, you actually get bored when the girls are stripping. The movie is really long and horribly improvised. Sandra Oh is the only credible actress and does her best to carry all the scenes. The documentary about real strippers (on the dvd edition) and where the story was inspired, is what should have been released as a movie. It's more interesting and gritty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I bought this movie only because I will be taking Sheila Kelly's S Factor classes and I wanted to see \\"real\\" performers in action without going to a seedy club. I found this movie to be completely boring and senseless. The acting was poor, the storyline senseless. Ah, but the sountrack was interesting - some really good songs on it. At the very least, I got what I was looking for - an overview of the dancing before my classes begin. Aside from that - I'd give it zero stars if I could for sheer boredom and stupidity. As the club's owner says to Jasmine at the end of the movie \\"You have no life! This IS your life!\\" That says it all. What am empty existence."},{"rating":"1","title":"This blows!","review":"This has to be one of the worst films I've ever had to witness. Slow and very boring. For its subject matter the film is very un-sexy and has many many flaws. The main one being the truely dire acting courtesy of Daryll 'Splash' Hannah and Jennifer 'Bride of Chucky' Tilly who's character is obnoxious and annoying. I could not possibly reccomend this film it ... big time and you will be very disappointed if you rent this one out, never mind buying it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid and pointless !","review":"This is one of the worst films I've ever seen ! Here are just a few of my criticisms:3 of the actresses (Hannah, Oh, and Kelley) are way too old to be strippers. Yes they look great for their ages, but they wouldn't cut it in a strip club with younger competition.Strippers aren't all a mess, and yet the ones at this club are. Very unrealistic.No men would go to a strip club where the women kept their bottoms on.There is no point to this movie other than to apparently moralize that stripping is a depressing road to nowhere. But the reality is that many strippers are pretty much normal women with normal lives, they can just make a heck of a lot more money stripping than doing anything else.AVOID !"},{"rating":"1","title":"just purely terrible","review":"...in which a group of moderately talented big name movie actresses get somebody to film their improv class.

I must admit that while I truly enjoyed the photographs contained in IN TUSCANY I was less than satisfied with the written content. I feel that the passion Ms. Mayes felt with her first book, and so openly shared with the readers, has wained with each successive book and she is nothing but commerical at this point.I feel she has allowed celebrity and money to corrupt her art ..... much the same as Mr. Kincaid.

On the front insert it says I will learn how to \\"bring the beauty and spirit of Tuscany into (my) home decor, meals, gardens, entertaining, and most important, outlook on life.\\" But 90% of the book is about their projects and travels in Barmasole. Little to none about transferring that back into their California home, which is what is implied. I was expecting more photos of her home(s) here in the states, showing how she brought Tuscany life back home, as the title suggests! (i.e. - Bringing Tuscany Home) In the back of the book, there's a listing of Tuscany dealers. I guess that was to cover bases. While Mayes is indeed a wonderfully entertaining writer, this particular book of hers leaves the reader very frustrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Photos - Great Recipes","review":"Beautiful photos of Bramasole, local people, food & furniture.

Although sometimes when my eyes are a bit puffy in the morning I use a few drops of the cold bottle from the fridge and it really helps! My skin tone is evening out, my wrinkles are softening quite a bit, and my skin just looks clearer and healthier over all. I only gave it 4 out of 5 because of the packaging, it is hard to get out unless you pull out the plastic cork drip system, it really should come with a dropper vial inside!

I use it as a moisturizer on my face at night and use my regular moisturizer during the day since my face usually gets pretty oily on its own during hot weather. It moisturizers really well and an added benefit is that it has helped to reduce the scarring on my face left by previous acne that I've had. I also put it on a huge scar on my leg twice a day and the scar has lightened up also. It really helps to moisturize and reduce scars so I love it for that but I can't stand the smell.

Essentially you pay for some inexperienced college girl to watch you step on a scale once a week and attempt to upsell you senseless overpriced snacks.

To make it interesting and appealing to watch would require more than the pale blue lighting that pervades throughout. Even if there were some colour in the costumes, sets or faces, it wouldn't show up because of the poor lighting. The staging is overly stylized as well, setting a new low standard. The same forces issued a production of Alceste which was somewhat better.Musically and aurally the performance is very good indeed. The cast is great. But I wanted something that was also satisfying to watch. I already have a terrific CD of this opera.It might have looked fine on stage, but as a DVD on my widescreen HD set it is a big mistake.

It is a very good CD...If your into the electronic music of the 80s..this is your CD. It is loaded with synths and sequencers and some drum machines to boot. As the previous reviewer stated, most of the tracks are from Logic. I am personally surprised by leaving out of the track \\"Unit\\", which is one of the best Logic System songs.XY was a hit...and yet it was left off the CD for some strange reason. If your new to the band, or looking for new 80s band to play as opposed to the worn out hits found on every other 80s hits comp, then this is definitely worth a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Songs to Like the Human Race By","review":"The kind of CD I tell people to just buy --don't worry, don't ask questions, you're bound to be glad you got it. I've listened to it over three days now. You fall in love with certain songs. A second effort is always a slight let-down, because a really great idea is hard to duplicate, yet that's what you sort of expect. When you first put this one on, you don't hear border music, and you feel let-down. Then you notice how damn well they do all these songs. And they seem to know how to go back to the basic principles of all these forms and to show you them.The singing is great across the board, but listen esp. to one of Cateno Veloso's numbers and listen to Susanna Baca --I never appreciated her before. They aren't afraid to riff with their voices, and what they do is so sweet. And that Rick Trevino --damn!Those Lobos never disrespect music, know what I mean?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 2 good songs","review":"This CD has a variety of styles and different front men per song.

The first night I made a roast and it was the best tasting roast we've ever eaten. I have since tried chicken,porkchops and spare ribs and they turned out great. The cord to it is very short and it's a little akward to use. The door has no latch and you have to be very careful when you take the food out or you'll burn yourself. Cleanup is simple.

The poems are the same and so are the fairies and while this book is beautiful in itself it doesn't have the detailed descriptions about the flowers and plants, the pop-ups nor the little notes. The pictures of the flowers and fairies are lovely but not quite as gorgeous as the new edition in the Fairyopolis series.If you don't want to spend too much go ahead and buy this one, it's an amazing deal for this classic, however if you can afford to splurge and want to escape into the magical world of make-believe get the new series which is visually even more stunning."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Complete Book of the Flowers Fairies","review":"This book is very nice .Beautiful water color illustrations and lovely poems.I was very pleased with my purchase and it arrived quite quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical....","review":"I came across it while shopping for my 5 year old daughter and it was in the children's section in the bookstore.

In that time they have put out album after album of very quality material, the best being Heaven Shall Burn and Nightwing. With this one, I believe it eclipses both of those by a mile. This album shows why they have gained that strong following. Brutal guitars, incessant blast beats, demonic sounding vocals(very greatly done btw), and a killer atmosphere. If you like very brutal keyboard-less black metal, then this album will be in your cd player all the time. I very strongly recommend this album to any black metal fan. Also, if you like keyboard black metal, pick up the new Emperor and Cradle of Filth, both of which are phenominal. Hail Marduk!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"I must say...I expected to hear nothing but 100 mph music here...not the case.

I love it, and if you like Marduk you will, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good music coupled with violently retarded lyrics","review":"Yeah I like the music: aggressive and dark. Powerful and sufficiently evil to suit my jones for black metal. However these guys just never get above a middle school intelligence in terms of lyrical worth. They make Cannibal Corpse seem like poets. For example:\\"Loving the deadA torso, a hand or a severed headThe cemetery girls don't say no to their fateWhen their bodies gets too rottenTheir skeletons do great\\"LOL, and these guys have been around since 1992?!? Simply stunning. I wonder what it's like to be thirty somethings singing the musings of a disaffected 15 year old? Much to Markuk's chagrin their lyrics are more humorous than evil. I would hope that's what they were going for, but I know it's not. Why this gets a two rather than a 1 star? You can't understand the lyrics most of the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Fans Of The Genre Only","review":"Marduk is probably one of the more popular of the many \\"euro-black metal\\" bands out there, with a slew of albums. I personally don't much care for what I think is the corniness of the genre, but I can easily put that aside as a big fan of metal in general (and death metal in particular) if the music and riffs are cool. Unfortunately that simply isn't the case with Marduk.First of all, where is the almighty riff; the very basis of all that is metal? Marduk's style seems to be to play super-fast, but rather dull-sounding harmonies and blastbeats, without ever really sounding ominous or heavy, and I found that after about four songs my attention simply wasn't there. It just isn't particularly dynamic or interesting metal, at all. Pretty bland stuff, for all the \\"hail Satan\\" posturing. No thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sure.. I like alot of Black Metal","review":"Aside a good song or two as far as melody and musiciansship goes this will be granted 2 stars, other then that, this album is just poor. I dont think there is a shred of intelligence running through this band. These guys are like 14 year girls discovering some patent leather bound Le Vey and any blasphemous script they can muster.Maybe Im cruel but I desire for artists to be challenging, I'd rather not be ready with a gun full of ready satire. This is like the Limp Bizkit of black metal.As much trash as say, Old Mans Child get for being well produced and famous, they have lyrics and music to back up what fans they have. this band is just 2cnd grade satanisms without a shred or unique vision or interpretation.Save time and go buy a Bathory CD that you might not have or maybe even the new Bloodbath CD (it kicks major ^$@)and forget this cheese."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"This is a piece of junk.

Both the 5 year old girl and 3 year old boy wanted to see it again at the end of the first showing. It is well done, and my kids obviously enjoyed seeing other kids perform on stage. My kids have no prior exposure to ballet, and this is why I bought it. Based on one of the prior reviews, which complained of close up camera work, I nearly didn't order it. It turns out that the occasional close up is not at all a negative, especially for my kids, since it allowed them to identify with the character. They argued which one they wanted to be. In any case, usually most or all of the stage is shown.The DVD, although short and without extras, is inexpensive and a good counter to the latest disney shlock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I understand that evaluating this DVD may depend on what one is looking for. I've seen a full production of Peter and the Wolf as a continuous ballet, not as a learning experience narrated so that children (and others) can figure out which instruments represent what. This production confuses a learning tape with a ballet. Aside from the distracting narration, I found the photography very disturbing. Instead of letting the viewer see a dance in its entirety the camera jumps around from instant to instant so you can hardly catch one single movement from its beginning to its conclusion. Worst of all was the constant clipping off of the tops of peoples heads, sometimes even the eyes. I recall that Fred Astaire insisted that the camera always show full body shots so people could really experience the dance. Whoever edited this film should learn from Astaire. For me the DVD was very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The fragile bonds of friendship","review":"This movie, believe it or not, is not about how much pot you can smoke, how much alcohol you can drink, or how much sex you can have. It's about testing the limits of oneself at a point in life where everything is unsure. Are your friends right for you? How far should you go to protect and love them?

This a cultural critique of a system of thought which has historically oppressed every indigenous group it has come into contact with. To call it racist is to miss its point entirely. This is the groundwork for deconstructing the Western worldview for African peoples so as to enable the reconstruction of a value-system more in harmony with life and human dignity for all peoples.

But consider this: if, say, a Chinese author wrote about how black people are more soulful and don't let \\"artificial\\" constructs like reasoning and logic get in their way, would that be offensive?

This one is TOTALLY different from the others in terms of taste and texture. They are not as chewy as the others, almost more like a gumdrop? I'm not even sure how to explain it. Others may like this texture, but if you are expecting the standard Haribo chewiness like I was, you might not like this either. The texture just ruined it for me..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing...","review":"I'm surprised Haribo allows their name on this product. It's nothing like their more traditional fare (Golden Bears and the like). It's something that I would expect to see from Brach's. I won't eat it (and neither will my grandkids). As it's said, live and learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing mix that is even hard to find at candy specialty stores","review":"If you love the white grapefruit Haribo candy as much as I do you wont be sorry when you purchase the Fruit Salad.

Seriously, this bag is a no-brainer, you will not regret your purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Texture and taste are far better than most gummis","review":"These are closer to the old Sunkist fruit gems than they are to normal fruit slices or gumdrops that you get in the grocery store bags.As for this particular bag - the candy was just a bit stale, but considering the price and source it wasn't bad - no one else but me seemed to notice - probably because most of the time this type of candy just borders on stale no matter the source.I have this on subscribe and save and plan to continue to purchase it. It's a favorite at work, more popular even than good quality orange slices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Candies","review":"If you want the best value. This 5 pounder is the way to go.Combination of their rubbery and less rubbery gummies. Each one is coated by sugar shaped granules but is not as sweet and not as messy that it scatters everywhere. A single piece is a good bite size; certainly much bigger than their gummy bears.Nice combination of flavors. I don't think they taste quite extraordinary; but nevertheless decent candies coming from the world's leading maker of gummi bears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haribo Fruit Salad","review":"I ordered the 5 pounds of Haribo Fruit Salad and it arrived on time and packed in good condition.

I read so many good reviews on this so decided to give them a try. I've always loved Haribo for their chewiness and flavor but was disappointed by these.

They were a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my taste, I prefer the grapefruit flavor.","review":"These are just not for me. I am sure they are well received by children.

I was so excited to find it online, as I remember it being so good, but I was a little disappointed that it was sweeter than I remember. Also, the inconsistent textures within the bag didn't bother me, but part of the bag had soft (fresh?) gummies and part had hard (old?) gummies. Lemon is better than the common candy-lemon flavor, but orange tases like orange soda, but grapefruit is really the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Harbio candy out there","review":"Finest Teutonic gummy candy.

When my sister lived in Germany she would send boxes of various European snacks and candy and would always tuck in a small bag of Haribo something-or-other. Their Fruit Salad is one of my favorites. One thing I've noticed in comparison between American gummy candy and European made Haribo, is the European flavors are stronger, sweeter, and just all around more intense. I'll put it this way, if you like the sweet-tart taste of say Starburst, Now and Later, Jolly Rancher, Airheads, etc. but prefer a softer, jelly candy then you'll probably like these. For some reason people seem to expect fruit slices to taste more like watered-down Kool-Aid than actual fruit. That being said, you may want to try a small bag of Haribo Fruit Salad before you take the 5 lb. bag plunge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not as good as other options","review":"First things first, don't make the mistake I did and order these in the Texas summer, they were mostly melted.That being said, I have been able to enjoy these. The flavors are what you would expect if you have had the Haribo gummy candy in the past. I love it. I would recommend, however, the two grapefruit flavors and peach over this group of flavors. They are very good, I particularly like the lime, but those others you must buy separately are superior.If you don't like grapefruit at all or peach, however, this might be the thing for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Animals","review":"Tape is in great condition.

Dr. Dobson has some good material, but he needs to re-do the series and not refer to statistics from the 1970's!!! (Good Lord, we are dealing with children born in the 21st century now!) The information is so outdated, that there is no mention of AIDS when he talks about venereal diseases, and he makes reference to names no one calls their kid anymore, like Suzy and Marvin. His voice sounds hokey, and he takes way too long to tell his stories. Today's kids needs to hear things in shorter sound bites, and need you to get to your point quickly.Don't get me wrong--- I wish I had heard a lot of this material when I was growing up. It may have prevented me from making some of the mistakes I did. But my poor son was in pain trying to get through this series. We finally wound it up early. I decided in a year or two, we may try Passport to Purity. I did some searching and found out that alot people recommend that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adolescence","review":"Adolescence is hard and Dobson has put all this on his CD pack for parents to share with thier kids.

I had gone through them 6 years ago with my older son. They are still great! I can't say enough how I wish I had listened to these before I entered 7th grade! Frankly, the CD's would be a good listen for most adults as well. There are 2 or 3 dated examples, but an 11 year old would not care about that, and the point is still crystal clear.Please note, this is a growing up series; not an abstinence series. The CD's are about issues that kids will begin to face in middle school. While sex is discussed, de-mystified, and abstinence promoted; that is only one part of the series. The first CD, on self-esteem, should be required listening for almost everyone I know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Preparing for Adolescence","review":"This product is a MUST for any parent with pre-teens.

This book reads like an eighth grade term paper. Examples are poorly developed and the writing is trite and substandard. I can't believe Adams Media has the audacity to publish this tripe and call it a book. Books are for learning.Some of Michaelson's brilliant insights include: \\"An inefficient victory is bad, but not as bad as losing -- which is extremely inefficient\\" and \\"In every game there has to be a winner and a loser.\\" It's almost like Michealson went to the Dan Quayle school of quotes.

Michaelson applies Sun Tzu's ancient theories on the strategy (Doing the right thing!) and tactics (Doing things right!)to the dynamics of corporate business today.Michaelson has condensed much of the previous good information he passed in his earlier book, \\"Winning the Marketing War\\".I would recommend this latest effort by Gerald Michaelson to all young Americans entering the competitive world of business. As a former Marine, I would place it at the same level as our \\"Small Wars Manual\\" and the \\"Landing Party Manual\\", and these manuals equated to the Bible as far as I was concerned.

It has very complete coverage of various gambits, along with some analysis. The analysis is questionable in some lines (for example, e4 c6 d4 d5 e5 c5 in the caro-kann advance schiller claims is good for white, whereby most sources (gm nigel davies for example) say black has full compensation for the pawn).This is best used as an idea book, and for gambit players who need such a work, I guess it's not bad. Yes, it's a database dump, and yes the analysis is probably pretty sketchy (the author is only a NM), but there are not a whole lot of other gambit resources out there, so if you need something of this nature, than this is probably your only choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock & Roll.","review":"I'm sure some might disagree, but for the new fan this is pretty much Velvet Underground 101.

Human's Pain, their previous album for me, set a new standard of technicality, brutality, speed and creative songwriting. Genocide is an excellent follow up album and contains the same supreme musicianship found on Yattering's first 2 albums. The drummer of this band sounds like Neil Peart on crack! The guitarwork is atonal, melodic, dissonant, and extremely brutal all at the same time. There is so much going on in the songs that I would not reccomend listening to it all at once. Listen to this band's music in small lethal doses so you can absord the complete brilliance of their music and not miss anything. Each time I listen to this band's music, I hear something I didnt' hear before. I wont even go into describing each song because they ALL KICK MAJOR A. If you like technical Deathmetal this album is an ABSOLUTE MUST HAVE.

It's more of a cute girl doing boxing. Erika Eleniak looks to be in great shape for the movie. It's too bad the script is really boring that you can't get more into it. Even with Erika in great shape, she's no boxer which becomes quite apparent during her training and fight sequences. Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy. As always, they choose a real female boxer as an opponent but don't spend enough time training the star to complement the adversary. About the only good refreshing thing about this movie was the coach and his gym. It was interesting to see a young coach and his bviews about boxing and training. Don't know if that's enough to carry this movie for some. It wasn't for me. Nope, definitely can't recommend this movie unless it goes to deep discount, and you're just bored at 12 AM."},{"rating":"2","title":"All I expected, and more","review":"I researched grills, the Weber, was always rated at the top, Amazon had the best price, shipped free, and it delivered 4 days early, on a Friday.Had it cooking the same night, easy assembly, great taste.

And since this is the only recording of it, it is worth getting before the CD goes out of print.The disc also features the very short piece A Lonely Ski Trail, which isn't anything spectacular, but very atmospheric.And then there's the world premiere recording of the complete score to Swanwhite, incidental music to the play of the same name.

The plot is horribly disjointed, the characters were never thought out, and there was obviously no research done on the culture or politics of the area. It is just sad that a book featuring an eight-year-old girl with several DOCTORATES could be published and sold. I bought mine from a bargain bin at the local bookstore and threw it into the garbage. So I say again, please choose a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"save yourself the trouble - please read something else","review":"I trusted the \\"professional\\" reviews and took a chance on this book. Boy was I disappointed. I bothered to finish it because I started it but I regret the time I spent on it. I have not read other Dale Brown books and I will probably never pick another one up. This story is not well thought out. There are unrealistic technologies in use and the plot is terribly simple. The problems and solutions the characters go through seem too much like a fairy tale. I will say it was a fast read because I was desparate to finish it so I can move on to something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Ain't Safe No More","review":"This is a pretty wack cd. Compared to his past albums (especially the first), it lacks some creativity. Busta relies on the Neptunes production to much on the album, and for some reason, his flows dont seem to be as strong as the genisis. I recommend the new Nas cd \\"God's Son\\" instead, or the new GZA cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed..","review":"after listening to the genesis album and hearing his single with mariah carey, i was really excited to get this album....but now i've heard it...i have to say - i'm disappointed. perhaps it's coz i aint been a fan 'from the beginning' but i only REALLY LIKE two tracks on here: 'i know what you want' and 'together'...8.99 for the two tracks? oh well...i suppose the TWO songs are worth it...:-S"},{"rating":"1","title":"DAmn this is just sloppy work","review":"wow!

It provides tight tracks, great lyrics and creates a nice party mood. There are few albums that do this well.

After being spoiled by \\"Genesis,\\" which was an incredible album, I was a little surprised by this one. But after giving this CD a full run through, I found that it is extremely better than I thought. Busta always comes through with something different and exciting, and it is the same on this CD. A few of the good tracks include \\"I Know What You Want\\" with Mariah Carey, \\"Riot\\" and \\"Hop.\\" This CD is a must have for all you Busta Rhymes fans out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Busta's Sixth album...very good but not a classic","review":"I can't believe this is Bustas sixth album! It seems like he just dropped Genesis on us and now It Ain't Safe No More comes outta nowhere!. This album is great but its no E.L.E or not even Anarchy. If you can forget the horrible intro on the album you will love it.The tracks that shine include Call The Ambulance,Riot, Taste It,Make It Clap(and the remix),and I thought Struttin' Like A G.O.D was tight.Although most of the songs are good on this album a few of the tracks were pretty weak and it seemed like Busta didn't put much effort into this album like 2001's Genesis which was great but still suffered because of the wack songs toward the end.Now I think Call The Ambulance needs to become a single and maybe this album won't sell as bad as Busta's classic Anarchy album did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good...but not as good as ones before","review":"This cd only has two good songs: Make It Clap (featuring Spliff Star) and Make It Clap - Remix (featuring Sean Paul & Spliff Star).

GREAT BOOK....IF ONLY SOMEONE COULD FOLLOW AN AUTHORS WORDS IN PRINT EXACTLY. THAN YOU WOULD GET THE TRUE MEANING OF HIS MESSAGE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great restoration, weak film","review":"I'm not a movie buff, so I'm not as enamored of this as some. Taken strictly on its merits, it's an old-fashioned sci-fi '50s style, with extremely wooden acting, ridiculous costumes and a troubling religious bent. Even so, the Technicolor restoration is awesome. Details are crystal clear. You feel transported back to 1952 LA in some scenes. The acting leads are pretty bad. In fact, there is no good acting here at all. The special effects are ok, by 1952 standards, I guess. They used the same look of the Martians for the newer Tom Cruise remake. The end is abrupt and somewhat unsatisfying. At one point, they drop an atom bomb on California while people watch like a Nascar race. Absurd, considering that radiation poisoning was well known then, seven years after Hiroshima. The rubes who discover the space ship are just dumb, annoyingly so."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOW MUCH?????","review":"I would buy this movie, But these people selling this item would be called GOUGERS at any other time, My god nearly 70 dollars for an old movie.

These MORONs who are releasing all these movies in a 1.33 formate should stop and find another job if they cant do their job correctly by releasing the movies as they were made. As my wife says \\"You only see half the Movie\\" That is correct.

Beautiful technicolor. The commentaries and extras are interesting too. Had to laugh when Ann Robinson commented on the Gieger counter reacting when pointed at her \\"left bosom\\"...kind of noticed that myself). Wasn't looking for the wires that are holding up the Martian ships, so didn't see them, (until I watched the making of extra) But have to ask, why would you WANT them digitally removed? That's one of the things that makes 50's sci/fi so great! Paid 10 bucks for this dvd. Great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real classic","review":"Great to see this classic movie again. It's a real jem and the quality is excellent. If you remember the movie from the past (and liked it) you should add it to your collection. You will not be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"I am giving this a 5 star rating because you have a copy that obviously has been cleaned up because it looks clear sharp and the colors are so rich. This version has two commentaries which is amazing if you think about it and it is a must have for fans of this kind of film. It is so different than modern day films in terms of special effects but that is part of its charm now. It probebly wont scare anyone anymore but it still entertains. Just like I wrote in my When Worlds Collide review that there is something about these 1950's films that gives off a comforting feeling. It seems like in many ways the world was not as cruel as it is now. I am sure that someone could argue that but at any rate while I am watching it with the lights down curled up on the couch with my blanket and some hot liquid to sip on I am happy and feel safe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the best","review":"This has to be the best made ever notwithstanding the limitations in special effects relative to now. The Tom Cruise remake was entertaining but did not capture my imagination as did this Gene Barry version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Classic","review":"What can one say - the wildly original and effective SFX still blow away most of the ho-hum digital tinkering so widespread a half-century later. The meson-neutralizing skeleton beams are waycool; look for the wires holding up the alien ship models.Update June 2010: Interesting to compare this fine period piece with the Tom Cruise remake, which trades the cold-war paranoia of the 1950s for 21st-century family values, Hollyweird-style."},{"rating":"2","title":"The War of the Worlds (1953)","review":"Overlooked because it came out two years following the release of The Day the Earth Stood Still and three years preceding the release of both Forbidden Planet and Invasion of the Body Snatchers, this film adaptation of H.G. Wells' classic novella (which would be remade several times--three in 2005, including Spielberg's version with Tom Cruise) is one of the better films to come out of the '50s, specifically in the sci-fi genre. It won an Academy Award for its special effects achievements, which, despite looking dated and hokey now, were unprecedented in 1953; and was a cornerstone in igniting Hollywood's spontaneous blast of enthusiasm for science-fiction pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still an all-time classic!","review":"Excellent movie, excellent price. Some reviewers have mentioned that the quality is so improved that now you can see the wires holding up the spaceships. This is true - and who cares!?

Don't pass this one up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"alien invadee","review":"Amazon made it very easy to find the version I needed for my spouse's birthday gift.

Words cannot express the emotion I get when I see this classic. I know there's a black and white version out there somewhere from England and if anyone out there can tell me where I can find it on video or DVD I'd appreciate it.

This movie encompasses the original theme when Orson Welles frightened all of America Halloween night October 30th, 1938. The acting is superb. The suspense will keep you on the edge of your seat. The special effects are awesome for the time when this movie first aired. The remake pales in comparison. This is a must see for science fiction enthusiasts and for those who treasure true classic movies at their best. This movie is one of those classics you will want to watch again and again. It is one that the whole family can watch and enjoy. Not recommended for young children as it is very intense.

It created enough interest in me to inspire the reading of this and other H.G. Wells works. Seeing this film on the big screen again as an adult, did not dilute the fascination for me. Everything about this flilm stands up against modern technology driven film making. The Tom Cruise, Steven Spielberg version was without story, and even made it difficult to cheer for the \\"good guys,\\" with completely wasted special effects. No such problems here in a completely story driven look at earth's first invasion, supplimented by Oscar Winning Special Effects of the day. If you're from a different genration, and have not seen it, you will be delighted. If you saw it years ago, check it out again in this special edition. You won't be disappointed, and will be reminded of a time when films leaned on more than digital effects, to draw an audience into the fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"War of the Worlds - Outstanding Movie","review":"My whole family loved this movie. It is great for family viewing. It is an outstanding choice for any family library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining but..............","review":"I am a big sci fi buff. The film is entertaining but as usual does not do justice to the writer H G Wells. Wells was a hard line atheist and the movie does not do justice to his beliefs. Besides, the stereotypical good guys and bad guys, religious overtones, and scientist gets girl is typical drama of the 1950s. The message of the movie is also lost metaphysically....who is the better creature? Man or the Martians? We have wasted the Indians, many cultures, all in the name of religion. The Martians where simply trying to survive. No different than humanity has done to itself by killing. God saved humanity? Please let me know if God did not create the Universe as many believe. God is taking sides now? Please. In the vastness of space and the universe we are insignificant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"This film is a very naive and sloppy adaptation of the novel by H.G. Wells. Martians are attacking the world and all our defenses are useless. The earth is going to be conquered after the total destruction of humanity. But a miracle happens : these Martians are not immune to or protected against the bacteriae that have been our plague for centuries, to which our bodies have adapted their natural defenses, and which have been conquered by modern medicine. Fear of the outside world. Fear of extraterrestrials. Fear of outsiders and foreigners and even strangers. Practically no attempt at communicating with them, and anyway the rare attempts are defeated by the absolute aggressivity of these invaders. Primitive reaction and attitude. And by far too many discrepancies to make us suspend our disbelief with any kind of effectiveness.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"rating":"1","title":"WAR OF THE WORLDS","review":"WE PLAYED THE DVD AND IT WOULD STOP IN THE SAME PLACE OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND WE EVEN TRIED TO PLAY IT IN ANOTHER PLAYER AND IT STILL DID NOT WORK.

The FX for the time is great but the story and plot are such stinkers the film simply fails. It is cold war updated and I am sure to the dismay of Wells full of religious overtones which added nothing to the story. To have this poor thing rated with Sci-F masterpieces such as \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\\" or \\"2001\\" is a sham and an injustice."},{"rating":"1","title":"RED SCARE!!!","review":"This movie conceals Wells's atheistic socialistic and utopic views with religious fervor of prayer. The book is not meant to show that God is merciful and will bring miracles. The book was meant to show that society is corrupt and the only way for a utopia to be built is if the current civilization be destroyed in its entirety. The book is the journey of one man not a Adam/Eve couple. This man thought he was one of the few who survived and created his own utopia out of one of the ruined suburbs outside of London.

The collector's edition DVD contains a number of special features the origional edition didn't contain.Some reviews have complained about the religious angle the film takes (especially towards the end) but I thought it actually improved The War of the Worlds (people who have read the novel will quickly notice just how differently George Pal and H.G.

This story was made famous by Orson Wells on his Halloween special on October 30, 1938 when he reenacted it on a CBS radio show as if it were true, using actual street names and place names to make it more realistic.

What's the point? I guess I expected more, like maybe the use of coconut flour? And many of the recipes use ingredients like kombu, umeboshi paste, hijiki, wakame, sunchokes, fresh lotus root, quinoa, etc. Where does one get this stuff????????? Not where I live, that is for sure. These recipes are very unrealistic, not difficult, just not realistic. And many of them use soy. So if you are on a SCD, grain-free, or soy free diet, pass this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wake Up Call for Bright People Everywhere","review":"I ordered two copies of this book the minute I heard of it: one for myself, and one for the public library where I select the non-fiction titles. If I could afford it, I'd sent one to every intelligent person I know, for not only is Furedi dead-on in his assessments of the impoverished state of intellectual life today, his plea resonates with those who should be contributing to public knowledge and debate, but don't.After ripping through this short but poignant volume, I felt giddy with inspiration, as did every single other person I suggested this book to. If the author sought to fill those empty cafe chairs, he has succeeded brilliantly."},{"rating":"2","title":"You may be surprised.","review":"For me, this was a challenging read. What most concerns the author is too easily dismissed or missed in our thinking about art, literature, discourse, politics and even technology. It was difficult for me to keep from agreeing with the points of view of those the author uses to illustrate his belief that the Philistines have taken over the work of the mind and its value for its own sake. You, too, may be surprised by the pathways you find yourself following as the author explores where the intellectuals have gone. I enjoyed it, and recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome game, didn't install","review":"1701 A.D. is an awesome game. Having played the board game on which it is loosely based (Settlers), I found the game play easy, strategy engaging and the graphics and sound both enjoyable and entertaining.Sadly, I had to copy the entire disk to my drive, as the key code would not work on any of my three PCs, as long as the game was in the drive. I have found, in the past, that installing games from a directory on my drive would eliminate the software protection errors I have received in the past. Certain schema for copy protection have errors when attempting to install games using a number of CD, CD/RW, DVD, and DVD/RW drives. I suspected this was the case and copied the disk to my HD before installing it on my gamer PC system. Once installed, the game was a blast to play."},{"rating":"2","title":"great image","review":"I played this on my Mom's computer when visiting....use to have 1601 version...very addictin, great graphics"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now this is a game","review":"Not overly complicated, but complex *enough*, with updated graphics. Zoom out for a wide-view, or zoom in to count the freckles on a woman in the market; you can see highly-detailed activities everywhere.

The replayability factor is low for me simply because of the fact that I had long since worn out the previous two titles.While someone new to this series might be enchanted with the way this game is presented, anyone who has spent time on the previous two titles would be better off spending one's money elsewhere. Even at $24.95, I feel I overpayed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointment","review":"I have spent hours upon hours playing 1602AD and really looked forward to playing this new game.With 1602 everything was easy to use and clean cut.I was really let down with 1701AD.Altho the graphics are awesome it was very different and not at all as easy to do all the things you need to do to have an enjoyable game.They have you in a fog-of-war mode from the start unlike 1601.Plus smaller maps and just not as much fun to play.The fog-of war should have been an option and not just the state of things.My advice is do not waste your money.A total let-down for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needlessly complex","review":"My favorite games are empire building... This games had and may still have promise if the company entirely reworks it. There is a good premise behind it but the interface is overly complex and the game world is too small.

This stupid game, wroten by some mentaly seek idiots, helps you to find the shortest way to mental house. I wouldn't even list all nonsenses in this game, because it's nothing but the pack of such senseless nonsenses. Besides, you gotta switch almost all video effects off (unless you have some $10000 machine with the dedicated power plant to feed it), otherwise the game will be converted to plain slideshow...

Great fun for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fan of 1602 & 1503 A.D.","review":"I was a big fan of 1602 A.D. and 1503 A.D. These games were more fun than 1701 A.D. Sure the graphics are much better and game play is improved but the joy of balancing the economy is almost gone. Most of the hard building is done for you.

However, I had to give up because of the way it was written. The author continually broke up lines of dialogue in the middle to explain how the character looks in a particular direction, blows a puff of smoke, or some other unnecessary action that should be saved for after the line is spoken. She also has the narrator switch between past and present narrative for no particular reason. The story doesn't flow because of these things and became unreadable because of it. If you can overlook such things, pick it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read!","review":"This book is soooo good! She describes the life in Cuba so realistically.

It is even funny, at times. However, it is nothing more than a \\"half-azzed\\" attempt to understand the complexities of an island in transition.

That's this movie. This movie is well filmed and directed by Ridley Scott with great performances by Michael Douglass, Andy Garcia, and Ken Takakura. The believable feel of the movie and the dark mood contribute to the atmosphere, which pulls the viewer in. The story is very well constructed and it really got me frustrated and anxious at times. I was definately participating mentally with the events of the movie. Ridley Scott deserves much more recognition for this film, and a Special Edition DVD. I say, forget Hannibal, and give this movie some more attention. Recommended to any moviegoer and Ridley Scott fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Good Movie - Very Bad DVD Transfer - Do Not Buy It","review":"I enjoyed this Ridley Scott outing but will not recount the story here. As a potential buyer, the message you must get is that the DVD transfer is a total let down and allows no viewing pleasure. Paramount have messed up with a grainy poor quality transfer with sound below par. I have an average VHS tape copy which is superior on all counts.

In this movie, Michael Douglas teamed up with young stud, Andy Garcia, both cops in battling a Japanese syndicate who is involved in counterfeiting money. Packed with action and motorcycle stunts, this movie depicts a difficult alliance with both cultures in battling crime, but in the end comes a common understanding of putting the bad guys behind bars. Subtitles in english is not an option although they are shown when japanese is spoken. nice flick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly American","review":"If ever a movie personifies the stereotype of the arrogant,self absorbed \\"Ugly American\\" this is it.I frankly could not believe the way that Micheal Douglas carried on in this film yelling, cusing and throwing his weight around. Essentially acting like a loud mouth. Why the Japanese did not cart him back to the US within the first hour was beyond me. They certainly did not have to put up with his tirades and temper tantrums. He just became more obnoxious by the minute.As for the movie itself it was dry and forumulaic with not much suspense beyond the usual violence. I also found it annyoing that with the exception of a few scenes there were no subtitles where the Japanse spoke and I had not a clue what was going on.A very disapointing film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Rain DVD","review":"I love this movie.

I think the film is just great and all the stars really make this film Douglas and Gracia really have a bound in this film, and Hans Zimmermusic is fantastic.. If you every come across the bootleg soundtrack of the film since the CD released does not come close to what was written for the film is really superb, what i really liked what's been missing from any other version I have of the film is the extras about the making of Black Rain..

Surprising coming from Ridley Scott who has only done some of the greatest films of the 20th century (Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator etc) Although Michael Douglas does a decent job portraying a NYC cop nothing really stands out here. Even his character is too trite and clich��, divorced, fighting for custody etc. The movie thrives on post 1980's style ie mullets, motorcycles and leather jackets, complete with an always 80's pair of aviator sunglasses. Could have been good if it was set in the future, say 2020 for the sake of 1989s vision (like 82s Blade Runners vision of Los Angeles in 2019)"},{"rating":"2","title":"a deep film","review":"Black Rain may look like just another high testosterone thriller but look again and you will find that we are being given something much deeper than that.

You end up swallowing the candy half-chewed just to get it down. And I bought the 5lb bag! I would not buy this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gastrointestinal Armageddon","review":"When I got these, I couldn't contain my excitement and I ate about a quarter of a bag. Scenes from the movie 2012 could have been filmed inside my gut. There would have been less pressure to make two winning free throws in the NBA finals than for gas to escape my bowels. After a few hours, I had an EXTREME build-up of gas with no relief. All I could do was lie on my bed and pray for a fart. That might sound funny, but when you've eaten something that has basically turned you into the blueberry girl from Willy Wonka, you're pleading for relief. Well, the farts came and I lived through it but I not only had a visit from the fart fairy, but the sales rep from Montezuma's Revenge stopped by and gave me a FULL demo of their services as well.In retrospect, eating over a pound all at once wasn't the brightest thing I've done (but it also wasn't the dimmest). If I go back and finish the bag off, I'll probably leave a suicide note."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tastes great, makes you fart","review":"These taste just as good as the sugar ones to me. The best part is that it gives you tons of gas, which is really fun when around friends. Just make sure you don't eat these before a job interview or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made me sick","review":"They're delicious, but after I ate a few handsful, a couple hours later I started to feel really sick. I spent the whole rest of the day suffering painful gastrointestinal distress. I believe this is an occasional side-effect of the sugar substitute (branded Lycasin(tm)). If you don't have a problem with Lycasin, go right ahead and munch away. If you don't know, I'd try them in small quantities first to make sure they don't cause you any problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Learn an Important Lesson","review":"Last night I ate a handful of the Gummi Bears that I got for Christmas. A couple of hours later, I was in excruciating pain and passed enough gas to inflate the Hindenberg. Of course, I didn't make the connection between the candy and the pain. Today, I brought the candy to work. My co-workers are chowing down big time! And I've eaten another handful. I don't know why, but the little voice inside my head prompted me to check out these sugar-free bears on Amazon.com. OMG! They ARE the culprit!! Now I have more painful gas to deal with. Should I warn my colleagues?...The lesson learned: Check things out on Amazon.com BEFORE you eat them..."},{"rating":"1","title":"great taste, just be ready for it to come out the other end!","review":"I guess I should have read the reviews before buying this for my sister. Just like all these other poor sufferers, by sister, her boyfriend and my mom all had severe diarrhea and stomach cramps just a few hours after eating some. This item should have a warning label: \\"Do not eat more than 10 in one sitting unless you you are constipated and need a quick and easy laxative.\\" Too bad they taste so yummy. I'm going back to the sugar ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"taste great, after effects HORRIBLE!!!!","review":"I tasted these and thought they were the just as good as the sugar ones, THEN,,, about an hour later I was running to a bathroom. My stomach started cramping and making all sorts of noises. I'll leave the rest out. I only want to say, try a sample before you buy a big bag of these.

Sugarless Gummy Bears Revenge!!","review":"Should have read the reviews on these Haribo Sugarless Gummy Bears before I ordered them. I've always loved the \\"Haribo\\" brand, and have purchased the regular ones in nearby retail stores. When I saw these sugarless ones on Amazon, I immediately ordered them thinking that since they were sugarless, they would also be less calories. They arrived yesterday, and after consuming only a few I developed severe abdominal pains within a very short period of time. I had a feeling that the cause was from these gummy bears. It wasn't until I finally read the reviews on this item that my suspicions were confirmed. Since there is a \\"no return policy\\", this bag of Haribo Sugarless Gummy Bears is headed to the trash. Yes, I have learned my lesson, and that is to read the \\"reviews\\" before I purchase a food item. I hope Amazon will read the reviews for this item, and remove it before any more of their customers suffer from the \\"Gummy Bear's Revenge\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great taste! Horrible Stomach issues","review":"These taste really good and I couldn't even tell the difference between the regular and these sugarless. I don't know what they use as a substitute (mine came without any ingredients listed) but whatever it is gives you really really bad gas, and sometimes diarrhea.It was very painful too.I tried eating them twice and both times the same results. The Gas i have to say is the worse of the two, it lasts for hours and hours and it's extremely embarrassing. I would not buy these again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laxative if you need it!!!","review":"It gives you the runs and is the worst sugarless candy I have ever eaten in my life.

I never saw this in Germany and the runs are probably why."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as the sugary version","review":"For a low-carb or reduced sugar diet, these are excellent! I know this because coworkers who routinely knock sugar free food will visit my office to eat these all day long. They are almost indistinguishable from the sugar version. But BE CAUTIONED about the laxative effect - like most foods containing indigestible sugar alcohols, eat more than 10 pieces per hour and you will be running for the toilet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Gastro Problems","review":"Really recommend that buyers beware - I too ate no more than a handful of this product - about 2.5 hours later, I had minor stomach pains - another hour after that, I was in umimaginable pain. It took a good 3 hours of severe pain and bathroom trips to be able to walk upright or consider any other behavior. Twenty-four hours later, I was still not 100%.

These are very chewy, better than their regular gummies. They have staying power.Flavor - Delicious.Stomach - These have a minus with a small plus if over consumed they can cause cramping at least I had some if I ate to many, though my son said it just gave him gas. Small plus - It did keep me from eating to many at a time.Calories - Though they are sugarless they have even more calories than their normal gummy bears per serving so these are not for dieters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Natural sweetener content high","review":"While there is no sugar, the natural sweeteners are high.

The flavor is poor, hardly any flavor at all. They are so hard you can chew them w/o risking damage to dental work. I can imagine anyone wanting these..

DONT WASTE YOU MONEY THEY ARE AWFUL ALL THE WAY AROUND."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK taste, BUT...","review":"I must say I was excited to find sugarfree gummy bears, but these offer nothing less than a gastric frenzie and hangover to boot. My head pounded for hours after eating these, not to mention the gas. I did read the other reviews, but thought perhaps they consumed too much, or were just sensitive to the sugar substitute. I must say there is no exageration in their claims. The taste is ok (not great - there is an aftertaste), but having one handfull can make the rest of your day miserable. I threw mine out and wished I had bought a smaller bag to try first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Artificial sweeteners bothered bowels","review":"These gummi bears caused my wife and I terrible gas.

Digestive Nightmare Though","review":"I, like some of the other reviewers, had a nasty reaction to something in these gummis, I'm going to assume it was the sweetener. I ate a couple of handfuls over the course of a couple of hours and shortly there after I wound up with severe intestinal distress which lasted a good six hours. Beware these gummis if you have any reaction to alternative sweeteners.Aside from these I have very much enjoyed the other Haribo gummi candies and will buy the other varieties again, just not the sugar free ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"these should NOT even be considered a food..","review":"getting stabbed in the stomach probably would have been more pleasant than what happened to me a couple hours after eating a handful of these. like others have mentioned, the horrible side effects that come from eating these are due to a synthetic sugr substitute called \\"lycasin\\". they may be tasty but you will be in a world of hurt if you eat any more than a few of these gummi bears. i ate some last night and spent half the night experiencing severe gastrointestinal pain which eventually led to gas, diarrhea, and vomiting. i've seriously never been in more pain in my entire life..and as a result, have had to spend the entire day in bed, still feeling dizzy, with mild stomach pain and unable to keep down anything except water. basically, if you want to induce flu-like effects and spend at least 6 hours in excruciating pain, eat these with reckless abandon."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"Actually no stars. Very good price for 5 pounds, but that's where the good news stops. The taste just sucks. Not sweet at all, more like sour but not a very strong flavor, just weak.

Just saying........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Less is More","review":"These sugarless Gummi Bears are a great snack item for my wife and I.

It is not for everyone, but, if you can listen to Early Autumn, for example, without a thrill, I can't help you.For other jazz styles by Renee, see Dark Divas or I Thought About You, for example. She soars, she croons, she scats, she swings, she does it all. Her work on Round Midnight is as fine as you might ever hear.

I first listened to this sitting out in my car during my lunch break under some big trees with the birds singing and the sun shining, it worked well in that setting. Haven't listened to it any other way yet. I have been a fan since 1972, and other than the sad mid 80's output Neil has always been there for me. I was, like many, tiring of the Crazy Horse bashfests of late, so I was really glad to hear that this one was going to be laid back.Best songs (to me) are Daddy Went Walkin', Glad To See You & Buffalo Sprinfield Again.

I realy do like it all except, \\"lucky thirteen\\" what was he thinking? This album touched my soul as most of neils work doe's but it just didn't draw me.If you like Neil young you'll dig this album.If you are new to his music try Harvest or After the gold rush.What kind of fan would I be if I didn't own all the mans work anyway?

This is the Neil Young that I love so dearly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to see you, good to hear you again!","review":"As a listener of Neil Young's music from the very beginning of his career, I've pretty much been disappointed with his totally electric music, but I have always marveled at his mostly acoustic music. While this album is more of a musical cliche, it does contain solid music that does harken back to \\"After the Gold Rush\\" and \\"Harvest\\", two of my favorites. In my opinion, Neil Young's best work always had a bit of a bite to it; driven by a little anger, tragedy, or disappointment. This album is very good, but it is in the middle of his pack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neil Young - Easy Listening","review":"It's always a pleasure to hear Neil Young without Crazy Horse. This is an easy listening Neil album with a real nice sound - soft guitar with a great percussion. My first time through, I thought the album was a little better than average but the more I listened to it the more I liked it. Too bad Neil wasted a great song (\\"Looking Forward\\") on that dreadfully awful CSNY album. Neil's tracks from that album may have pushed Silver & Gold into the five star category. What a waste - but I digress.Neil fan's will be delighted by \\"Buffalo Springfield Again\\",\\"Silver & Gold\\" and \\"Good to See You\\" and the catchy \\"Daddy Went Walkin'\\". For what it's worth (no pun intended), my wife has become a HUGE Neil fan as a result of this album. She likes the easy listnening side of Neil ala \\"Comes a Time\\" and \\"Harvest Moon\\". So, if you like these albums Silver & Gold may be for you. If you are looking for the Crazy Horse sound you'll have to look elsewhere.

This album is more and more rewarding every time I listen to it. That said, it's no \\"Zuma\\". It's very mellow and of a piece with the quieter parts of \\"After the Goldrush\\" with a more hopeful and experienced perspective. It took me a few listens to come to this conclusion, but that often seems to be a mark of great music, not having the full beauty strike you the first time out. Once you start listening, you may find you have trouble removing this album from your cd carousel. NICE job, Neil, keep it going, it was worth the wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"The spark isn't there","review":"I loved Harvest & Harvest Moon. Bought Neil's new CD with the hope of more of these type of projects. Not a lot of new \\"old\\" guys out there. It is a flat CD because there are not strong melody's or exciting musical points here.

In sound, it's somewhat reminiscent of \\"Harvest Moon\\", which I thought was easily superior.The problem here is simply that the songs aren't very good. All are originals, some have been played in his stage shows for years without going on to CD, but I didn't find even one to be moving or memorable. This is a bland recording by an artist who has done far better; I would recommend it only for hardcore Young fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neil is just too happy.","review":"I receive each new Neil Young issue with great anticipation and am almost never disappointed, until now that is. Where is the acerbic wit, the energy, the creative genius that has characterized his great body of work to date? It just isn't there. Sorry to all you fans, I too am one. But I have to say it like it is. Neil is just too happy. I am happy for you, Neil. It is the rest of us, your adoring fans, who suffer and now must wait until a little crisis enters your life. Not that I am wishing you ill. If mediocrity is the price we must pay for a little happiness and contentment in life, so be it. You deserve it. You have given us so very much. It is okay to be happy. Just don't try and sing about it, okay?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disc skipped","review":"The disc skipped it couldn't play. Additionally, the item was in a clear plastic CD case with no album cover pictures or album art."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my OLD Neil Young","review":"No one loves Neil more than I do -- Comes a Time is the reason I became a songwriter. There was a time when Neil challenged his listeners, but there's none of that on Silver and Gold. No challenge, no edge, no inspiration. And this is the same guy that gave us Tonight's the Night, for god's sake! Oh, those were the days. It's obvious he's been hanging around with rock's Holy Trinity of Mediocrity (CS&N) lately and it's rubbed off. If you're looking for a musical challenge, try Dan Bern -- you won't find it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neil on heavy medication","review":"I'm a big fan of Neil Young when he is on a roll, but he has put out some lousy material over the years. This CD was almost physically painful for me to listen to. It didn't sound like he had anything to say, so he spent forty minutes not saying anything. I liked Comes A Time and parts of Harvest Moon, but this just struck me as a very lazy effort. I also object to new CD's being this short in duration. I realize that great music and length don't necessarily go together, but anything less than fifty minutes just seems like a rip-off given the price of CD's these days. I guess Neil couldn't stay awake long enough to go any further."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Absolutely nothing on this CD caught my ear. I'm a Neil Young fan, but this sounds so quiet and generic I might as well be in an elevator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listening for a keeper","review":"I've listened to this CD each time hoping that even one song would grow on me and become a favorite. I'm sadly giving up as even \\"Nice to see you\\" leaves me flat. Most of the lyrics seems forced and the tunes all seem familiar and never special. After Harvest Moon, I thought Neil was reaching news heights and certainly this CD would follow. It doesn't - I think this one will gather dust on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"ho hum.......","review":"This album presents a shadow of the Niel Young I have listened to for years. The lyrics feel contrived and pointless. Save your money. I wish I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is'nt it better to burn out than fade away?","review":"As a long-time (25 years) fan of Neil Young, I must say that he should follow his own advise. After listening to this CD a few times, I thought I was going to need CPR to revive me. This collection is as mellow as Harvest Moon, but fortunately not as melancholy. On a Neil Young scale of 1-10 this is a 1 or 2. But compared with most music being released these days, it is still a 9 or 10. Somebody please wake me for his next release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is this and what did they do with the real Neil?","review":"As a hard-core Neil Young fan since my freshman days at college when 4-Way Street was popular, I must admit that Neil has suprised me once again. One of the great things about anticipating a new Neil Young album (CD) is that you never know what you'll be listening to when you get it home. Unfortunately, this reminds me too much of Harvest Moon, a snoozer. Better luck next time. I have listened through it 3-4 times now and its not getting any better, unlike most of his work. Maybe this is the \\"kinder and gentler\\" Neil. For me, I'm still waiting for the next \\"Live Rust\\". I remain a true fan, but this one will go to the bottom of the large pile of Neil works in my stereo closet."},{"rating":"2","title":"prime acoustic neil","review":"Neil Young has brought to the table some of his best stories ever told.SILVER AND GOLD. This recording will be stand the test of time like any Beatles recording during their career. Give a close listen to RED SUN and RAZOR LOVE (a song played live over the years) finally issued here in studio form. Simply a strong recording by Neil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Young continues to go his own way","review":"Neil Young has always gone his own way. The reason his fans continue to respect him is the fact that he listens to his own muse vs. the current trend in music. Silver & Gold represents Young in trim, fighting form and recalls After The Gold Rush in terms of its style.Some of these songs are quite old while others were composed shortly before recording began. What's surprising is how well they fit together. There's a continuity to Young's music that makes a strong statement for his artistic vision. There's hardly a weak song in the bunch( Buffalo Springfield Again is about the weakest song in the bunch). While not all of Neil's albums from the past ten years have been keepers, there have been more than a handful to keep the faithful around.This happens to be one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to his solo acoustic roots","review":"A Harvest-like feel to this album. Young's haunting voice, introspective lyrics, and smooth melodies. This is the mature version of Neil in the early 70's, pre-Crazy Horse. Very nice. Best he's done in a long while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Golden Album","review":"Neil Young has had many a hit albums, but many that have flopped. Luckily this one is a success in my mind. This is Neil's album, he did it, and he's not trying to please anyone but himself. The first half of the album is ok, with good songs \\"Good to See You, The Great Divide\\" but the other three are mediocre. But, when you hear the second half, you will be completely blown away. Neil's voice and lyrics are a great pleasure, even if you took the beautiful melodies away. Together, he will paint a picture, a wall, a mural, in your mind. Razor Love has wonderful percussive instruments, Without Rings is moving, and Red Sun gives me beautiful images. Horseshoe Man brings back a floodtide of memories, and Distant Camera is just a beautiful song. It may not be his best, but it sure is way up there. Something about his voice just soothes and calms me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neil Is Back","review":"Having apparently decided that it's better to grow old gracefully than to either burn out or fade away, Neil Young returns with the album few thought he still had in him. An increasingly vocal segment of his fan base has grown tired of Crazy-Horse-by-numbers geezer-grunge (e.g. Broken Arrow, Year of the Horse and Mirror Ball with Horse-surrogates Pearl Jam). But leave it to Neil to take his followers to the point of despair and then come up with one of his very strongest collection of songs. Melodic and lyrical powers are out in full force with such tuneful ballads as the title track, The Great Divide and Razor Love. And don't believe the lazy critics who are droning on about somekind of Harvest trilogy. This is immeasurably superior to Harvest and its awkward follow-up, Harvest Moon. Neil,it's good to see you again."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"I am a huge Neil Young fan. I own most of his releases and have been at many of his concerts since the 1980's - most recently his solo accoustic.For several years, I have been hoping for another accoustic Neil Young release. My wish came true with Silver & Gold. If you like Neil's accoustic style sound, you'll love this release. It is so soothing with intelligent, thoughtful lyrics. Think about this - with this release, this artist has had major hits in 5 decades (60's, 70's, 80's, 90's and now, 2000. Incredible. When many artists loose their touch or inspiration (not to mention their voice), Neil Young still sounds awesome. A must own!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New Under the 'Young'","review":"There really is nothing new here from good ol' Neil. Just more of the same harvest, with sappier songs which, I believe, didn't require much effort on his part to pen. Do yourself a favor and buy the debut disc from the Beachwood Sparks. You'll thank me for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everybody knows this is Nowhere","review":"Another Neil Young album. Well you just have to buy it don't you because it is NEIL. Well yes but I wished that I had not. The songs have no real bite, some of them are older than my kids and the album is short, but not sweet. Where have all the cowboys gone asked Paula Cole. Perhaps Neil should have called this one Treading Water."},{"rating":"1","title":"writer's block?","review":"Compared to similar albums (Harvest, Harvest Moon and Comes a time) this is easily the least inspired. After a string of beautiful albums starting after his work on American Dream in 1988 with Freedom up to 1994's Sleeps with angels Neil Young in my opinion suffered some serious writier's block. Not essential and not very rewarding i.m.o."},{"rating":"2","title":"The comfort of Neil","review":"Another great Neil to touch your soul. He writes to each of us, personally, with a plaintive, at times tear-evoking clarity. Not music to dance down the street to, rather sit in silence and explore who you are and where you need to go instructions. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Young at his mellow best","review":"You have to spin this CD at the end of the day when you have forty minutes to relax. On the whole, these songs are beautiful and gentle, with Ben Keith's steel guitar softly singing behind Neil. It's also a true album -- after listening to it, you'll feel like the songs have melted together. The best tracks -- if I can even choose -- are \\"Distant Camera,\\" the title track, and \\"Good to See You\\". \\"Buffalo Springfield Again\\" (a song that's better than you'd expect from the name) has a great little acoustic riff, too. Don't expect this album to floor you, but it's so simple and beautiful that I find it impossible to resist. More solid than Harvest, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harvest Moon it ain't...","review":"Okay, what a boring record this is! And given how good Neil's work with country-folk can get, that's not good at all. Several songs (\\"Good to See You\\"; \\"Daddy Went Walkin'\\"; \\"Red Sun\\") sound like campfire singalongs. You know, the kind of things most people cut from their albums, and leave in the vaults until they put out an odds-and-sods album: he also embarrasses himself with the nauseating \\"Buffalo Springfield Again\\", a tribute to his old '60s group. Another song with embarrassing lyrics is \\"Distant Camera\\", a metaphor about life being a photograph. Entertainment here sadly comes in bits and pieces, unlike Harvest, Harvest Moon or Prairie Wind: the simple beauty of \\"Horseshoe Man\\"; the modest, unpretentious title track and \\"The Great Divide\\". When you take everything into account, though, this is clearly one of Young's lesser albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Neil at his mellowest","review":"ALERT! DIE HARD NEIL YOUNG FAN HERE! COULD BE BIAS UPON THIS REVIEW!Definately a great album if you enjoyed his past albums such as \\"Harvest,\\" \\"Harvest Moon,\\" and \\"Unplugged.\\" It's not Neil when he performs with Crazy Horse, nor is it when he's with Pearl Jam. But there's definately the great Neil Young songwriting spirit alive here.To go even more biased here, I recieved the CD the day before my grandfather passed away, so now all of the sudden \\"Good to See You\\" becomes the song that I associate with my grandfather. Then again I'm sure all of you will find someone to associate this song with, whether or not it's someone you lost recently or someone you just see once in a while.Down to the final song where he sings the lyric \\"my software's just not compatible anymore\\" still gives you that NY sense of humor that we've grown to love over the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Man is Back at It Again","review":"I grew up with Buffalo Springfield playing in life's background. CSN&Y thrilled me with DejaVu. Neil's Harvest was just about the best laid-back LP I ever had. I was disappointed with Neil's grunge period LP's and cds (just not my style of music?). I was very glad to listen to this CD and enjoy that more mellow Neil Young sound again. He may not have the most mellow, the easiest on the ears kind of voice, but he spoke to us then and continues to speak to us, over all these many years. I recommend this CD to anyone who liked Neil in his \\"Harvest\\" years. For us in the over 50 crowd, this may be a pleasant trip back to a gentler sound. To my 26 year old son, it's a good sounding CD that he now wants for his collection. Well done Neil!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Shipment, not upsetting to stomach","review":"Taking this product on advice from a natural-path for a problem I have, will keep you posted on whether it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have looked closer....","review":"This is NOT a book.

I tried it a second night, but added melatonin (which I've used successfully in the past) and a calcium-magnesium supplement. I managed to get to sleep that night, but still felt my heart racing. Woke up with churning thoughts and in such a bad mood that I couldn't stand to be around myself. My kids were grateful to leave for school to get away from me that morning.

I am probably unusual that I am allergic to L Theanine which is in green tea.I gave the product one star to due the label not providing amounts for the the three indicated items.

The texture is perfect...chewy but still soft, and they don't cling frustratingly to your teeth. This was my first taste of Haribo candy, and I am very impressed.

I've found that most of the Magellan products have a fairly similar control/interface setup. It is easy for people of all ages to learn and enjoy. The maps aren't very detailed but I find they are detailed enough. If you are looking for something that will show you city streets in detail this is not for you. However if you still want a little bit of adventure give it a try. The backlight is great you can use it well after dark and still see perfectly. The battery life is fairly standard and the satellite lock is great. The only thing I don't like about the model is the joystick in the center. I find the unit often thinks I'm pressing enter instead of trying to scroll in a certain direction. Thankfully they have put the ESC button right below it. Sometimes this is a nuisance but I am learning and it definitely does not stop me from highly recommending this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a beginner but might dump your memory","review":"A few months in use and my 200 started to dump memory at random intervals.

If you get a 200 that works then I would recommend the unit for beginners but I don't know how common this problem is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good GPS","review":"This was a very good and accurate GPS unit. Sturdy and well made. Batteries lasted a long time and it found the satellites pretty quickly.

I was immediately dissapointed. The detail of the mapping of this unit is horrendous. It's as if they randomly picked streets they thought would be good to put in the device. It's almost funny how few streets this thing shows in my area. Now you're probably thinking I live in some backwoods place that this thing won't map. I live in Charleston, SC. One of the largest cities in SC. I'd say this thing shows less than .5% of the streets here. I bought a Garmin eMap well over 5 yrs ago that had a million times more detail than this thing.

I bought it mainly for hunting, but wanted the background map so it could be useful while driving. I've only found one error on the map, a road is mislabeled, but it is not enough to throw you off track. Once it has a good satellite link it is almost impossible to lose that link. Even cloudy days or cover from trees (or the roof of the car when it sits in the cupholder) it hasn't lost track. Navigation works excellent and the \\"mark\\" button on the front makes it easy to create a point of interest, no digging through menus to find this operation. Just push the button and go. My only complaints are that the heading feature only gives degrees, not the cardinal points (North,South,East,West) and it doesn't record maximum or average speed, something nice to have on trips.

You can \\"play nice\\" or \\"mean\\", too, which can add lots of fun!! The Ark movement is a nice addition for those times when you can't place meeple anywhere, and the temple scoring adds some suspense and at times, means tough decisions if you want to ensure winning the points.Overall, this is a good addition to the Carcassonne family and is as much fun for 2 as it is for larger groups."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so grateful for this album","review":"Check out the side of the casing, where the distributor, or whoever is responsible, has spelled \\"gratitude\\" \\"graditude.\\"That about sums up this album.There's one good track, the rest isn't even worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Power Metal","review":"I ordered this album, and received the Deluxe Edition (a nice bonus!)
