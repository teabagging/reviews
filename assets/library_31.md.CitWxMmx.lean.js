With so much of the focus on Nirvana and Pearl Jam, AIC quietly recorded some of the best music of the ninety's. Layne Staley's awesome voice, along with Jerry Cantrell's great guitar and backing vocals led the way. This CD is a pretty good example of how they were not only a great studio band, but an awesome live act. It is a good blend of the more well known AIC songs mixed with classics known more to hardcore AIC fans. My only complaint is the ommission of two of my personal favorites, \\"It Aint Like That\\", and \\"Heaven Beside You\\" Of course this is only my opinion, and you probably don't give a damn, but I would've liked them included. That's not a reason to pass this one up though. Not perfect, but close enough for hungry Alice In Chains fans.

The live versions of Bleed the Freak and Them Bones are the best tracks though, one listen to Them Bones and you can hear how great of a guitatist Jerry Cantrell is. The only downside is on the later tracks (from Them Bones to the end of the disc), you can hear that Layne Staley doesn't sound as good as he used to due to his drug addictions. It's a damn shame, because Alice in Chains was a great band, and this is all we have left of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I understand that this bath salt used to be natural.

Her actions, shrouded in mystery, orphaned nine children and left the small town of Bedford, Kentucky, in a state of shock. Lauren Rose knew that the events leading up to her grandmother's suicide played a major role in her mother's mental torment and abusive behavior, but it wasn't until a vivid dream of her own death that she found the courage to seek the truth.Hoping to find forgiveness that had eluded her all her life, she ventured into the tiny Kentucky town for the first time. It didn't take long, however, before she realized that more than the living were willing to help. A ghost story and mystery, Pearl is the true story of three generations of women whose love transcended rape, murder, betrayal and even death."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love these poems -clear images, insights, humor, and tears","review":"This collection of Turner's poems shows his exceptional ability to create in all forms, traditional and free verse. He takes the eveyday, the mundane, the familiar and allows us to subtly go along on this journey with him, finding humor, insight, sometimes pain. By directly allowing me to see into his own core - bumbling \\"On The Burlington\\" , experiencing feelings \\"For Mother\\", considering the Japanese approach to kissing \\"Kiss o Kudasai\\" - he gently helps me to look at myself, at others and at the world. And it is a look I like, curious, intelligent, hopeful, spiritual, conveyed in delightful images that shine through even the saddest of content. My favorites? Many!

Most lexicons try to give you a feeling for the different kinds of meanings that a word might have, then point you to examples which illustrate each meaning. To really understand them, you have to digest the examples carefully. This lexicon gives fewer examples and more complete definitions, which makes it much easier to grasp the meaning quickly. It also lets you look up words in English and translate them into Greek, which can be useful for exercises that require you to write Greek. To use this lexicon, always start with the second volume and look up the word in the alphabetical list. If you don't, you will never figure out how to use it. For more reviews on lexicons, grammars, and textbooks, see \\"http://www.mindspring.com/~jwrobie/littleGreek.html\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Misleading","review":"As one review already noted, Volume 1 is useless without the supplement.

It gives a more detailed meaning of the word according to how it is used in the passages. It has enhanced my study of God's Word especially when it comes to defining a term of word in a passage. It allows me to present a more clear, concise lesson to the class of students. This is one purchase I highly recommend to those who are interested in grasping the definition of biblical words.

It misses the mark, though, and hits neither a truly jazz oriented stride nor the island feel one might anticipate. Mr. Shimabukuro is obviously talented, but those talents go to waste on a go-nowhere album. If you are looking for HAWAIIAN music, and want to feel that flavor once you're back home and missing those lovely islands, pick up Keali'i Reichel's 2-disc set, \\"Kamahiwa\\" and get ready to feel some true yearning.

I have no idea what anyone else is listening to when they give this album high marks."},{"rating":"1","title":"pin girl says it all","review":"read pin girl's review. hit it on the head there pin girl! if there's anything more annoying than whining, thom does it here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"aptly titled... this album would be worth more as an eraser.","review":"i know i'm not the only one out there who thinks radiohead has gone off the deepend musically. if you can stand kid a, and \\"hail\\" and thom yorkes meanless meandering vocals, then by all means, buy this...this album goes nowhere, and fast. by the end of track one, you have already wasted more time then necessary in trying to figure out this disc. thom yorke, i don't get you.. go back to making decent music, instead of trying to reinvent the wheel with all your recordings. i'm not impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"OK I got this one cheaply at City Disc. I am glad about that. While I am not such a big Radiohead fan, they have produced some great stuff but this here is simply pretentious drivel. While the Radiohead records make sense globalyy this is really just not that good. A big snore really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds Like Amnesiac","review":"the wonderfully artistic album Kid A came out in 2000. It was so good that they took more songs from the same session and made \\"Amnesiac.\\" Usually these type of albums are very good (aka Oasis, Nirvana, Green Day, Smashing Pumpkins). Radiohead's was a bitter disappointment.so.........................................I wouldn't be terribly surprised Eraser is made out of C-Sides from this session with the solo name of Thom Yorke stapled onto it.Suggestion-either get any other radiohead cd or tell Thom Yorke to make an accoustic cd.Viva Radiohead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow - What a Surprise - I love this album","review":"I think electronica has been too overrated. Too many weak dj cds out there trying to pass as music. If anyone proves me wrong, it is Thom Yorke. WOW. I love this album. I'm a huge radiohead fan but I feared this would be a weak album given slack by everyone as 'experimental'. It is not. It is creative and moving. The songs are hypnotic. Thom's vocals and lyrics are wonderful. I can't get the beats and melodies out of my head.My favorite track is And It Rained All Night. Really, all of them are quality, but my other favs are Black Swan, Harrowdown Hill, Skip Divided, and Atoms For Peace (in that order).Give this album a shot. Listen to the song snippets on amazon or itunes and you'll hear just a glipse, but that should be enough. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"awesome album from the start to the end if your a radiohead fan you should definitely check it out favorite song would have to be harrowdown hill"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better luck next time, Yorke","review":"I'm sorry to say this, but this album has me shaking my head. I paid $9.99 for this NEW on the day it came out, with it's terrible packaging and all. \\"There must be good music in here,\\" I thought to myself. I popped in the CD to get droning, repetitive elevator music with random blips and blops. Where is the talent? Thom Yorke's voice sounds monotonous and whiny on nearly every track, the exception being Atoms For Peace, the album's only redeeming song, where he hits some high notes pretty well. The Radiohead fanboys will eat this album up because, you know, it's Thom Yorke, their hero. Actually, that statement might not ring true. Even Pitchfork gave this album only a decent review, who are known for their rabid Radiohead fanboyism.Donate your money to a good charity instead, or save it up and buy the new Radiohead album when it comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected a bit of Radiohead in here.","review":"and it doesn't sound like Radiohead at all.I like Yorke's voice and it works with Radiohead but falls flat here.Its now hitting cutout bins where it may be worth a try at a good price.It might have helped to have lyrics but none are found in the flat cardboard packaging of a plain black and white line drawn landscape.Its like all the color and life has been 'Erased' get it????This music is a an old black and white copy of a slice of life in a depressing flat world.Enter at your peril....."},{"rating":"1","title":"i love radiohead; this, however, is WAY self-indulgent","review":"blips bleeps more bleeps assorted blips yawns double-yawns scratchy samples of crackling record grooves plaintive yelps blips blippingtons tones scattershot ersatz poetry bleeps bleepings blah humbuglove, hamburg"},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-indulgent drivel.","review":"This has to be one of the most un-listenable CDs I have ever had the misfortune of owning. Whining over annoying computer generated noise may be his right as an artist, but to actually sell this junk is shameful. Anyone remember Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glitch and groove","review":"This sounds like a solo album. I immediately felt the empty spaces in the songs where I would normally expect the band to kick in. Still, if I had to judge this album without imposing Radiohead's standards on it, I would say it's a 5 star album. It's still a very creative sound, with interesting hooks, quirky lyrics, and best of all, Thom Yorke's seductive voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"Amazon's review of this is bewildering - sometimes sounds like demos? What planet are you on? It was produced by one of the best producers around today. Whoever wrote that doesn't know much about music production. This album is tight, concise and superbly layered.It's also way more melodic than anything Radiohead has done since OK Computer, which was a shock to anyone expecting an electro beep fest. And what melodies! They're just beautiful. Thom Yorke's incredible voice has simply NEVER consistantly been this forward and clear on any album released by Radiohead.Unless you're determined to dislike it (cough, pitchfork tired of being accused of fellating Yorke, cough), you can not fail with this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"So, THIS is what Thom Yorke has been up to.","review":"For loyal fans of Radiohead, fans who watch each band members every move, this is a no-brainer. Get the album, enjoy it, love it, etc.For everyone else? Give it a try. It really is nice.Thom's lyrics are excellent, certainly some of his best. The underlying music and beats are great considering they're very much computer produced.My one and only complaint is that a couple songs had sounds similar to other Radiohead tracks. \\"The Eraser\\" had some bits that sounded like the song \\"Down is the New Up\\" that Radiohead debuted live on their latest mini-tour. The final vocal part of \\"Cymbal Rush\\" sounds similar to \\"There There\\". Perhaps I just look too much into it.My personal favorite songs are \\"The Eraser\\", \\"Black Swan\\", and \\"Cymbal Rush\\" and my recommendation is to definitely buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome vinyl","review":"This vinyl is a great buy. The artwork on the cover is awesome and the music is in my opinion amazing. What a deal! Loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eraserhead","review":"Thom Yorke's \\"The Eraser\\" is not \\"Kid B\\". It's a sublime, introspective, somewhat self-indulgent creation by a bright and talented guy with access to a lot of electronic gear and a studio. Highlights include the title cut (built around a beautifully scratchy Jonny Greenwood piano riff), the most Radioheadesque piece \\"Black Swan\\" replete with signature Radioheadesque guitar, bass, and drum riffs and a hypnotic muse that includes the not-so-subtle-yet-wonderful chorus (unbound for airplay) \\"This is f#cked up\\", and the mesmerizing and angular \\"Harrowdown Hill\\" in which Yorke cries, \\"We think the same things at the same time/We just can't do anything about it\\". If you're looking for Radiohead, it's here in skeleton only. If you're looking for dark, cogitative electronica, it's all here. In spades."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mainly forgettable","review":"Thom Yorke's solo album THE ERASER sounds mostly like home demos of rejected songs written for a certain famous band that he's in. The musical material is based on electronic loops and a few piano parts. There's a certain lack of polish, and only the first three tracks are really memorable: \\"The Eraser\\", \\"Analyze\\" and \\"The Clock\\". That leaves the bulk of the album pretty vacuous, and I find that the song \\"The Eraser\\" works much better in its remix by Sasha onInvol2ver.I'd recommend THE ERASER only to Radiohead completists. As decent as the first three tracks are, there's much merit to the claim that no one would ever look at this album were Yorke not the frontman for such a famous band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent.","review":"This album will probably take more than one listen to fully understand.Not to say that The Eraser isn't a good album, because it most definitely is, but without Radiohead, Thom Yorke sounds surprisingly dull. There are a few songs that, no matter how many times I try to like them, I must skip through everytime I listen to this CD.Definitely a good album, but nothing great, and definitely mediocre compared to any Radiohead album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathing room","review":"It is evident, after Hail to the Theif, that Radiohead has indeeed changed directions. After finding their sound through -Ok Computer, KidA and Amnesiac and seemingly finding stability in their craft, Hail to the Theif offered a sparce recording - a sheading of layers; a search for the same things that made the 3 albums after the Bends the watershed moment(s). Just the same, in the same vein, it is with The Eraser that Thom Yorke, secure in his abilities, set out to do a simmilar thing: manifest (in as polar way as possible) his ideas - not radiohead's - an with this, find that thing which the 3 albums mentioned before have. This recording is a good view into someone who creates for a living without any idea of consiqueces, good or bad. It is perhaps a bit arrogent, but this seems like the type of album he would have made in his bedroom and never released. Worth a listen for anyone who wants to listen to music that is rough-hewn and on the cusp of something great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to Radiohead....","review":"Unimpressive. Leaves me wanting more RADIOHEAD!!! Its more electronic than most of RH's albums, which is fine since I love electronic music also. But Bjork can pull it off, Yorke (solo) can't, in MY OPINION!! Save your money... and wait it out for Radiohead's next release which should be coming out soon...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thom Yorke erased any talent he had with this bucket of poo","review":"The album is typical moaning and whining. If life is that bad than thom should just go ahead and kill himself. An irish wake has more cheer than this dredfully bad album. The songs sound like they were aranged by a group of schoolchildren high on a pepsi and chocolate binge. I would just go download the tracks for free if I was you because the cd will only be good to stick a cold beverage on after one listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"eraser not good","review":"the first tune sample sounds like Thomwas rubbing one out with a tape-recordernext to him...Radiohead are great though..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yorke goes Bjork","review":"But sadly it flops. The electronic music has promise but it's not strong enough to help the terrible lyrics and vocals. One or two songs are half way decent and that's it. The packaging is awful! I don't really see the need for a paper holder that folds out to a 2 foot long art project. Maybe drugs are needed to enjoy this CD. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst DJ","review":"Music is at its best when it makes you feel something. Whether it makes you feel happy, sad, or like bobbing your head, music should be powerful in some way. Thom Yorke's CD and Radiohead seemed to forget that instruments make music, not computers. The only positive about this CD is Thom Yorke's voice, which is the only real instrument on the cd. This CD targets those who embrace apathy as if it were virtue. The CD as a whole is unmoving and emotionless. To see this in concert would look more like a man playing a computer game than actual music. Yorke used to play rock. What a shame. I gave up after 2 songs, but I'm sure there are plenty of you out there that will force yourselves to love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This album did nothing for me. Frankly, I don't know what people see in Thom Yorke-he is weird, his voice is annoying, has no range and the songs on this album aren't even that musical. A lot of self absorbed droning and whining."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT RADIOHEAD, SO NOT GOOD","review":"This a good example of what's wrong with todays music.This guy is on such an ego trip he doesn't realize he can'tmake a successful album without his bandmates, one who made a very good instrumental solo album. He has absolutely no sense of melody and just seems to know his way around his laptop. Oh, he will have some fans who might feel sorry for him and some will enjoy the \\"f\\" word showing up. but count me out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"When was the last time this dude got laid?","review":"Thom Yorke is the most boring person in rock right now. Zero charisma. He's sooooo uptight! Does he even know how to smile? Truth is, this album is not only overrated, but it's already selling CONSIDERABLY LESS than his albums with Radiohead. Anyhow, Justin Timberlake has a hot new single, \\"SexyBack\\" on the radio now. It will be available for digital download real soon. Get that instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"breathtakingly beautiful","review":"I have a feeling that if another (read unknown) artist had released this album last year, it would have been hailed as the best album of 2006.That being said, music is in the hear of the beholder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Album by a Brilliant Artist!","review":"It's pretty hard to deny that Thom Yorke, despite how increasingly challenging his lyrics and Radiohead's music have become, is one of the most innovative and creative minds of the century. This album doesn't prove that he can stand on his own without his bandmates, it only accentuates his raw talent as an artist. The beginning track, The Eraser, is beautiful and one of my most favorite songs on the record. Analyse, The Clock (his live version of it is awesome!), Atoms for Peace, And It Rained All Night, Harrowdown Hill, and Cymbal Rush are great moments of \\"The Eraser\\" in my opinion. His vocals are stronger and more vibrant than ever. The man is brilliant. His voice moves me and so does his music. Check it out and BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The more you listen, the more you will love it","review":"Agreed with other reviews about finding it a bit difficult to appreciate at first, but after a few listens, you'll love it...

This album is almost entirely electronic , and minimalistic in it's approach . Sufficed to say , it is destined to alienate the casual listener . However , if you enjoy lush , ambient electro-soundscapes with emotive vocals ( and you are not a card carrying member of the A.D.D. generation ) then you may like this very intimate and personal album . Essentially , this is a stripped-down Radiohead . Thom Yorke seems to have a re-newed sense of purpose , he isn't just going through the motions like on previous -RH- albums . This is his most inspired work in years ."},{"rating":"2","title":"The return of the Kid A/Amnesiac Sound","review":"If you liked Kid A and Amnesiac , the experimental Radiohead albums, so you will loved this solo effort, and I mean it. For me looks like Mr. Yorke has the need to continue the electronic beats and new sounds left on the Kid A/Amnesiac sessions (and goes far away), and he found the best way to do it, a solo album. And , because of the worldwide preasure coming from Radiohead fans to return to the old fashion rock and of course mixed with new sounds, he made it alone.Excellent Cd, excellent Nigel Godrich production signature too, who else can understands the complicated and experimental sounds of Mr. Yorke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yorke should not go Solo ever again","review":"If you are expecting a sound from Thom Yorke as good as the band he fronts, you will be disappointed. I do not believe this album is close to the quality of any Radiohead album. T.Yorke is too experimental with his solo debut. I am not impressed. \\"The Erasure\\" has glimpses of the brilliance of 'Kid A' and 'Amnesiac' but doesn't come close to matching either of Radiohead's most recent releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Meandering Thom","review":"There are a few shining moments on this CD but as of the last couple of years, Mr. Yorke and company have veered so far away from what they are truly good at: writing good songs. While I appreciate the detours this band has taken to broaden their sound, it's depressing to see a band this great forge ahead in such aimless ways. Mr. Yorke compounds the problem here. Some good songs but overall this CD is a bore. Nobody is asking him or them to duplicate The Bends or OK Computer, but this isn't working in the slightest any more and one would seem to think that they would want to get back and just write some good songs. Not everything in the world is disaffected and disassociated and Radiohead and Mr. Yorke seem hellbent on staying in that very rut."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointed","review":"Being a Jeep fan, I was disapointed in this video. I was expecting vintage footage, and a nice history. Instead, I got advertising footage from the '80's on the XJ model. What this video contains, is little more than a list of models made by Jeep. I would guess that the target audience would be someone who is interested in learning the basics of the jeep history, not someone who already knows any of it. The driving instructions might be interesting to someone who has yet to venture onto their first dirt road, but not much there for a veteran."},{"rating":"2","title":"Being old and physically fit","review":"The book provides good information and ideas on being or staying physically fit as you get older.

Cooper, formerly of Royal Hunt. This, their second release, was a significant improvement over their first, and an outstanding CD by any standard. This band's style is melodic metal, with some progressive and neoclassical influences. Most of the songs are in a metallic style, with a complex interplay of guitar and keyboards creating a wall of sound. The vocals manage to be both intense and tasteful. The lyrics are quite melodramatic. There is also an orchestral suite in the middle, with lyrics about Ancient Rome. The song melodies are always engaging. This is one of those rare CDs that is consistently strong from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silent Force continues in aggressive fashion....","review":"This is Silent Force's second release & MAN it is down right AWESOME! Yes it is power metal that you've heard before but it is well written & executed & it's definitely one of my favorites! (I hear a lot of similarities to Kenziner & Primal Fear in this release.) If you are a power metal fan, don't miss out on this release!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hopefully the isn't the last","review":"After Chris Cornell quit making music with the members of Rage, it leaves the door open for Zach to come back. Imagining another singer but Zach leading this band is hard he is so perfect. But if this proves to be the last album of Rage Against the MAchine, it's a good one. This album is loaded with Rage's pulverising covers of songs from Cypress Hill to Bruce Springstien and Bob Dylan. The Highlights on this album are : Microphone Fiend, Pistol Grip Pump, Kick out the Jams, Renegades of Funk, How I could just Kill a Man, The Ghost of Tom Joad, and Down on the Street. The album highlight is Renegades of Funk, one of the best if not the best rap/rock song of all time. Zach's lyrical delivery on this album is more rap influenced than the other albums, the whole band seems to be in overdrive here, from the surging bass,to the loud, pounding drums, time the out of this galaxy guitar by Tom Morello. I hope this is not the last album from them."},{"rating":"2","title":"...And So Departs One Of Best Bands In The World","review":"I want to take this opportunity to write a few words about RATM. It is fitting that since this is their last album, to sum up their work over the years. I have all 4 albums and all I can say is \\"WOW\\" everytime I listen to their music. In a time where all rock music sounds the same, this band just created waves of tsunami proportions with their unique style. Morello's guitar skills are unsurpassed. The guy plays his guitar like a DJ with a turntable. Zack de la Rocha raps with enough fury to complement the band's fast music, and not go over the top. Brad and Tim do a fantastic job with bass and drums too. Listening to RATM is pure pleasure. Ah, well....although I am sad that these guys broke up, I am happy they went with a \\"BANG\\" rather than a whimper. RATM's music will be something you will appreciate 10,20 even 30 years down the road."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finally they will STOP...","review":"Rage Against the Machine should go down in history as the band with the most rediculous song lyrics ever. They just sing about taking down the government and stuff...they are a bunch of pathetic socialists. Problem is, under their desired socialist system, they wouldn't even be allowed to say the things they do. They just talk trash about a government that protects their right to say what they want. What is their problem??Not to say the music itself is much better. All they do is play the same guitar riff the whole song while their terrible singer spits out rap then starts screaming like a tortured weasel. Not to say their riffs are bad, they are kinda catchy, but it is over and over until you get sick of it.My advice to you is to avoid this and if you're looking for real heavy music, go get yourself a copy of Linkin Park's debut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why??","review":"Why Zack??? All Rage albums are great, but this one is different... its Zack's last album and the album its integrated by different versions of old songs, rage makes a whole new interpretation of the songs that are included in this record, just listen to Street Figthing Man, Maggie's Farm or Pistol Grip Pump. I mean all the album sounds like rage (Beatiful world is the exception). This collection shows what is the meaning of Rage, the attitude, their message, their background. Maybe they should have included F**k the Police, wich its another good cover. In my opinion this is Rage's best album, you wont get the classic anger-hate-lyrics of zack, but shows Rage as the great band they are:Timmy, Zack, Tom and Brad at their best. I hope that we can hear a new rage album soon... Hasta la victoria siempre!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST OF THE BEST","review":"I bought this cd yesterday.I have listened to it four times and i must say that it is the best Rage Against The Machine album i have ever heard.I have all their unreleased and rare albums aswell as the official albums nad this is really the best album i have bought this year.They have done a good job on this cd and Zack De La Rocha couldn't of gone out in a more triumphant bang than \\"Renegades\\".All five stars have been given.If i could give it more i would."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"Rage has always been tight musically- producing funky rock with a hard edge- this album of covers is no different. While not as powerful as previous albums, I was pumped to hear RATM cover MC5's \\"Kick out the Jams\\" and Cypress Hill's \\"How I Could Just Kill a Man\\". They did so admirably with additional gems like \\"Microphone Fiend\\" and \\"Pistol Grip Pump\\" leading off the tracks.This shouldn't be your first Rage album- but its a nice addition."},{"rating":"1","title":"booo","review":"rage against the machine is one of my favorite bands, but this cd was really dissapointing for the people who like the rock side of rage then the rap side of them. this cd is mostly concentrating on zack's rap skills, which are awsome, but i really like morello's riff's. if u wanna get a rage cd, stick with thier first album, it is the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disillusioned fan","review":"How did Rage go from making milestones in music history, to making a cover album? I don't understand, and it's too bad. The way I knew rage before \\"Renegades\\" was as incredibly original, politically charged rap rock with amazing impact. Tom Morello's surgical guitar work attacks after Zach whispered \\"Anger is a gift,\\" and then screamed powerfully, \\"FREEDOM, yea RIGHT!\\" That was the kick ass band I knew. In \\"Renegades\\" he spits rap cliche's more than white boys in the suburbs. Why would they ever do a cover album? They're the band making the original music. Why copy? They're the band that seemed to have a real politcal message. They're the band that critics use to describe other bands. I for one think Rage was far better off writing their own songs. This album is a distant departure from they're other amazing albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Renegades of what? Funk? If you say so.","review":"Boy what a treat. Another Rage album thats completely reliant on their first release, a sound that never evolved and instead, like a chewed up steak I keep feeding to my grandma, just gets less tasteful year after year.

I mean, it is just a matter of time before greed catches up with any hit artist these days, but I thought Rage would be different because of their passion against corruption. However, I was wrong and I've witnessed rage play to the masses with the same stagnated style and even try such publicity stunts as supporting known murderer Mumia to sell records. Anyway, this album is no different from their last two, even though I was hoping that it would instill the fire that their first self titled album did. I wasted my money.

This CD contains a few cover songs, but that's okay, its a good album anyway. I can't wait to hear how the new group Audioslave (with three remaining members of Rage and Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell) sounds. Hopefully, its not a Rage rip off.

The book is about someone who had it drilled in his head that he had to be a certain way. Its about someone who struggled to suppress something they were taught to ignore. Innocent people where hurt in the process, but this struggle is all too common. He is not the first or last gay person to try and fit into what is considered \\"normal\\".

The book highlights an important and often untouched lifeline for new principals- mentors.

In Keller, Block creates a unique blend of innocence and evil, a hitman that is credible, creepy and endearing all at the same time. How DOES he do that?It's inspiring to see a writer like Block, who has been prolific for many decades, continue to get better and better. This is one of those books that transcends genre. Recommend it to your literary friends. I'm definitely staying tuned.Oh, and btw, does anyone else see Mick Ballou of the Matthew Scudder series as the percursor to Keller?"},{"rating":"2","title":"no ending","review":"I really like Mr. Block's writing - especially the Scudder series. This is my first Keller book - so I will try another before I pass judgement. This book really is well written and will hold your attention. I am just not sure if someone like John Keller really exists - although I don't know why I doubt it for a moment in this world we live in. I just hope no one I love runs into this guy anytime soon. Mr. Keller sure is lucky that no one has spotted him coming or going from any of these crimes huh???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"I enjoyed the previous John Keller-Hit Man books by Lawrence Block, who has been one of my favorite authors for many years. But this one fell kind of flat. In the earlier books, Keller has a certain charm, despite being a professional killer. For some reason, in this outing Keller comes across simply cold-blooded and inhuman. I think the author took away Keller's formerly interesting personality and all of his charm. This book is not really a novel, but rather a series of short stories about various hits Keller is hired for. Perhaps this is why Keller's character suffers this time out. I am hoping for a much better book with the latest Keller novel, HIT AND RUN."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who would have thought a hired assassin could be such a dull guy?","review":"I've read several of Block's novels but this was my first exposure to his hit man character, Keller. None of these stories (each chapter is a separate story) are, well, very interesting. There is very little suspense or anticipation of what will happen next. Before you can care one way or the other about his victims, they're dead. Not much build up or background - they're like cardboard people that we don't get to know much about. Even the methods Keller uses are mundane.I was expecting more of an edgy personality in a profesional killer. Keller is just a boring guy whose obsession is stamp collecting. The more interesting sections are his interactions with his agent, Dot. However she's another flat character. If Block had dug a little deeper into the lives of these two, he might have captured my interest more. I just never felt engaged by either the characters or the stories. It was a disappointing read from a talented writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deadly Boring","review":"I check out this book on Friday evening from the library and took it back on Monday morning.

There's no irony, no suspense, no humor, no truth - the Parker series, Richard Stark (Donald Westlake) is the real deal on criminals as heroes, or at least taut, fascinating reads. Don't mistake me, Block's Scudder novels are maybe my favorite, for the writing, the character, the ambience and city - but these Keller books - and I've tried to read all three - are a major yawn.

In the fiction market it's rare to find even 1 book that dares to step outside the usually well-defined boundaries of 'the usual' and when you do find such a rarity, it almost always misses its mark. The Keller mysteries not only step outside the usual boundaries and hits the mark but it does so with aplomb. They are a delicious telling of what it would probably be like from the hitman's point of view. Added to this is the fact that Keller simply isn't that bad of a guy. He just has an unusual job that he happens to be very good at."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthwhile read","review":"This book mostly reads like a collection of short stories in that each chapter or two can stand alone--but there is a more or less continuous thread connecting them. This is a must-read before getting to the latest (? last) of the Keller stories, Hit and Run. Block is always a good read, sometimes a great read, so I recommend it highly to all his fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funk Bass","review":"Hm. It's Okay.

Another thing is yeah there's drugs there, but that's why you have to be smart and say no!! And it makes the scene look bad by centering the movie around acid!!!! Because there's not always that at shows, and now some dumb teenager is going to go to the shows because they watched Around the Fire and said \\"Wow there's acid there!!!\\" It's all about the music!!I gave this movie 2 stars because Devon is hot, and Tara Reid is pretty cool too.

Even those with serious drug problems have better sense than to don a mullet!! This movie is CHEESE!! Sure this may be how some kids experience shows, but it's just done so poorly. I thought it would be a somewhat decent movie after reading these reviews and especially since there was a real actress involved, but I was just so annoyed most of the time while watching this movie and I was also embarrassed to have brought it home.

My husband and I have spent a lot of time playing with it (our daughter is too young yet). The tone is much better than I expected.

We can play \\"Mary Had a Little Lamb,\\" \\"Joy to the World,\\" \\"Three Blind Mice,\\" and numerous other songs with the limited number of notes.My only gripe with the product is that the cord from the xylophone to the stick is too short. I'm sure it's that way due to safety concerns. However, it's very difficult to play the instrument with that cord length. We simply replaced the cord with a longer one, and are very happy with that choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Order another xylophone","review":"This xylophone's cord which connects the stick is insanely short.

This book gives a great concise summary of all the material you need to know for the AP test in May. The information was great in picking out the important stuff from each section in history. Even on regular class tests, with just review out of this book and various sights on the Internet I was able to score A's on basically every single test I took. After taking the practice tests (6 is more than any of the other books) I was so well prepared for the test and several questions from this book appeared on the test in a different format. All my friends purchased various other books and I read those also, but it came no where in matching the information in this book. For every question on the practice test, a complete reason for the answer is given and is so helpful when learning from errors. You can't go wrong choosing this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helped me, maybe you too","review":"I found the AP US History Review book very helpful. The review was especially helpful - it was clear and concise. And the practice exams - \\"forget-about-it.\\" The trick is that you have to already know what you are studying before you use the book because afterall, the book is just a review. It should only remind you of what you already know. The book is just brief enough to not cloud your mind and confuse you and is just comprehensive enough to get you everything you need to know. All said and done, I would definately recommend this book to anyone who wants to pass the exam, but beware, you must study too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Test Prep Book","review":"I bought this book with two weeks to go until the May 2000 test date. It helped me remember a lot of the material before the progressive movement. I would recommend you purchase this book at the beginning of the year because it will help you review early on and aid you on your unit and chapter exams. It is the most detailed and comprehensive review out there. Much better than the Princeton Review book. Without this book I wouldn't have got a 5 on my test."},{"rating":"2","title":"damn good stuff","review":"i took the test in may 1999. i breezed through it. these books are great. the review is awesome and covered stuff even my 700+ page textbook didn't. needless to say i got a 5 on it. one last note, though--the review is good, however, the tests they give are much much harder than the real thing. don't feel bad if you bomb their tests, cause the real thing is not that bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this! (or at least don't buy Barron's)","review":"I didn't actually buy this book, but several of my friends borrowed copies from the library and it was extremely useful in preparing for the AP.

I found the storyline (kind of tedius) and characters (most annoying) quite substandard (for a writer like Lindsey!) .... I had to push myself to finish the book! This is NOT a book I will find myself reading ever again.I expect after reading some of Lindseys other novels I am used to a much higher standard of writing: thus, in three words my comment on this tale is \\"one of disappointment\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the ending i wanted","review":"Reading this book, I felt sorry for Sheena and I wished that she could have someone better. Sheena almost dies because of Jamie's temper, and I was annoyed by how Jamie is angry after he believes that Sheena slept with Jameson. He wants his wife to be a virgin, but he's slept with many other women and has not married them. It was also annoying how every time Jamie touches Sheena, she gives in. I don't like that in this book or any other book, because this is the character's weakness, and I don't think that having a man touch a woman would make her will become the same as his in real life. Everytime Sheena is angry with Jamie, he touches her and she gives in. I would not recomend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"a simple, but sweet love story","review":"This novel has the most beautiful heroine and she makes the story shine! Another thing I like about this novel is that Jamie and Sheena are in the same age group. I only wish the book was longer. It would be interesting to see what these two characters are like in ten year's time. They both have such fiery tempers! I wish there were more fighting scenes because those are almost always the most fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gental Feuding","review":"Very exciting! Could not put it down until I finished reading it. Wished for an epilogue. Love happy endings always."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible heroine","review":"This book was very difficult for me because I found no redeeming qualities in Sheena. Was she feisty and willfully or was she a timid mouse afraid of the boogeyman man? Her anger and fear were so unjustified at every turn that I found myself hoping some horrible disaster would befall her. Disappointing because Lindsey has so many other wonderful books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Classic, great story","review":"I really enjoyed the weaving of this story and the historical setting, as usual its neat how the writer always ties in all the details."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"This was such an easy read.

What I like: durability-this bag is made of very sturdy material, meaning you do not have to worry about it getting ripped when your bag falls off of the cart and tumbles/drags on concrete; heavy duty zippers; plenty of space for the seat-means no wrestling to get the bag to zip and unzip (to verify with the ticket agent that it is a carseat and that you are not trying to smuggle luggage for free); carrying handle (seems mintute, but was better than having to put it on backpack style to move it short distances); easily adjustable backpack straps. No dislikes. I can also tell you that I noticed a fellow traveler admiring my travel bag over their own (one of the cheap ones that got ripped in transit)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked like a charm","review":"I was very pleased with this backpack, as it served it's purpose to keep me hands free in order to juggle the 50 other things when traveling with a little one. It was easy to stuff the seat inside, due to the two sided zipper which allows you to access from the front. It held up great through bag check and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a travel solution for your car seat. I have the Britax Roundabout. It is a little akward with the weight distribution, as mentioned in some other reviews, but well worth the $$."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great travel car seat travel bag","review":"We purchased this to use on our first flight traveling with our 16 month old. So glad we bought this bag for gate check, especially after witnessing the airline personnel dragging the bag behind him after unloading from the plane to bring up to us. The bag survived with minimal damage, the seam ripped 1in horizontally exposing the padding, but the car seat incurred no damage! The backpack straps made for easy and comfortable transporting through the airport. All but the front flap have padding to better protect the car seat. If you are looking to travel with your car seat, this should be the travel bag you purchase. I gave 5 stars even though the seam ripped. Not a very big deal as it is most likely not made for dragging on cement. The rip is easily repairable and did not rip to expose any of the car seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Title","review":"I have only used the product once and did have problems with one zipper but there are 2 and the second one worked just fine.

My wife was having to travel by herself for the first time with our 6 month old. Since she was renting a car where she was headed to, she wanted to take our car seat instead of renting one (read the horror stories online!). This fit perfectly and was comfortable to wear (as comfortable as a 40lb car seat stuffed into a bag could be). Highly recommended and it will be getting plenty of use in the future! A must for any parent traveling with a child that needs a car seat at their destination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits First Years True Fit C670 Premier!","review":"We own a First Years True Fit C670 Premier which is a very large seat and I had concerns that it would not fit this carry bag, but it couldn't fit more like a glove if it was custom designed for it. For the price of this bag and really is a no brainer. Nothing nicer than being able to travel hands free and there is plenty of space on top of the seat to hold a small duffel bag of the baby's clothes and assorted items. The quality is better than to be expected for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"The bag broke on the first use","review":"We bought this for a trip to the Caribbean to hold our daughter's car seat. It held up fine on the way there but on the way back it burst at the zipper. When we went to baggage claim, the empty bag came out first with baggage tag then our car seat came out several minutes later. I'm surprised we got both back. I returned this to Amazon for a refund. It is a shame since it seemed like a very well constructed bag with heavy duty zippers and material. It may just be that we got a defective bag. I may try another one in the future (maybe they'll improve the zipper issue or I'll get a non-defective one)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped After First Flight","review":"I read all the other reviews, so I knew it was possible, but this bag tore on the bottom (not near any of the handles/straps as I expected) after my very first flight.

We have the Britax Boulevard (one of the largest car seats on the market) and it fits perfectly. There is also ample room to stow a booster seat and a pack of diapers. My brother has the version with wheels - which is also great - but we prefer the backpack (with padding) as our hands are usually full pulling our luggage. The material is sturdy. Our stiching around the zipper did break - but I really suspect it was the baggage attendants and not necessarily a defect. I called customer service and a very nice and professional woman took my call. She explained how to submit a claim through email along with photos. I promptly received a reply after the photos were reviewed. They immediatly sent a new bag. It is rare to find such an excellent product with such excellent customer service.

It does zip up but is impossible to carry because it jabs you in the back. A rolling bag would be a better choice -- wish I could find one! Anyone know of one that does fit? I wish someone would've posted this review so I didn't buy it.Once again -- DOES NOT FIT ORBIT BABY -- good luck finding one that does!

This bag gets the job done. We've flown with it several times and so far it's rip-free (not the case with our Baby Jogger bag for our City Mini stroller, which has endured the same flights/abuse). It's huge enough to accommodate our big mama Britax Marathon with ease, yet it's still light when empty. The zippers are not fabulous quality -- I feel like a good yank might break one of them, so you have to be a little bit careful. This is a very minor point and one that will probably only apply to a tiny portion of travelers, but if you use this with the GoGoBabyz wheelie device for your carseat (which is AWESOME, by the way), the bag is about 1 inch too small to get that thing in, along with your carseat. Again...very minor point but just an FYI for other savvy travelers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Britax Advocate CS Travel Cover","review":"I contact JL Childress to see if any of their travel bags fit the Britax Advocate CS and the Britax Advocate CS is one of the largest car seats on the market and is unfortunately too large to fit in any of their car seat travel bags.They do offer a custom car seat travel bag that is specially sized to fit the Advocate and is manufactured in the USA.

For the amount that the item cost, I really wished the quality was better. I bought it based on the great reviews but was disappointed.

Airport personnel always tell me how great it is, especially when we check it holding the car seat; no need to worry about a dirty or damaged seat (my older child is big enough to use the CARES system). We often put additional items in the bag with the seat, so it's multi-purpose. Holds a Graco Snugride and a Britax Diplomat, although my husband says the Snugride is far less comfortable. On the older bag, both zipper pulls broke right at two years old. Not a big deal, it still works fine.These are big on your back, so always be aware of your surroundings so you don't take someone out or break something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit Evenflo Symphony","review":"We purchased this to make carrying the car seat while flying easier. While the bag is huge (wide, and very tall), the top portion was not deep enough to fit the headrest of the car seat. We tried everything, but could not even get the bag zipped up over the car seat. Had to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zipper doesn't stay zipped- never even got to use it","review":"Put the carseat in the bag tonight, and the zipper won't stay \\"together\\" when I zip it up around the seat. Terrible quality on the zipper - cheap plastic. We read all of the rave reviews, now here we are leaving tomorrow for the airport and this bag is so cheap, we can't even get the bag to the airport. Yes, we should have inspected upon receipt but it's something you don't know until you uninstall the carseat from your car and try to zip up. What parent of a toddler really has time to do this? You buy something and expect it to work. I would recommend others to buy another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bag!","review":"We love this bag for traveling. It fits our Britex just fine. The last time we just carried to the gate and checked rather than with luggage. We did this so it wouldn't be thrown around too much, because of a few reviews of the zipper busting and we had this happen when we borrowed a friends and checked with luggage. Just think of what your luggage looks like after being put under the plane! A bit if a pain to bring through security since you have to unpack the carseat to put through the xray machine, but so nice that it's a backback and leaves your hands free. I would recommend this to a friend and buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"extremly helpful","review":"We just returned from our trip and I have no complaints about this product. My husband was embarassed to use it when we first arrived at the airport, but he admitted it was necessary since we were pushing a stroller and carrying two diaper bags. We gate checked the car seat travel bag to ensure the car seat would arrive with us at our destination. The bag survived without any damage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful, with one big flaw","review":"I haven't read the other reviews recently, although I did check them out before deciding to purchase this car seat carrier. Overall, we were happy with the product - it is bulky, but fit our Graco Comfortsport convertible seat with room to spare. The main flaw though is that the backpack straps don't detach or tighten down for checking the bag. We checked the car seat at the counter and I was surprised that it wasn't damaged when we picked it up at our destination. Before purchasing we had borrowed a carrier with straps that removed and I didn't even realize that was an optional feature.Long story short, it worked, but I'd look for one that has a compartment to tuck the straps into if you're planning to check your car seat at the counter (instead of just using this to transport the car seat to/from the gate)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy","review":"The car seat travel bag is great. My car seat was so much easier to carry on my back, leaving my hands free to handle suitcases and my daughter. My car seat was nice and dry even though it was raining when we landed. An added bonus, if your suitcase is a little over the weight limit, you can pack things in the seat bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken zipper","review":"What an amazing product idea! Too bad the zipper broke within the 1st hour we used it. Not sure if exchanging it will result in a better zipper as it seems poor quality"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase","review":"Just returned from a trip where we used our JL Childress Car Seat Travel Bag for the first time. We used it with our Cosco Scenera seat that we purchased for our 19 month old son to use on our flight. The travel bag is very large and roomy. The Cosco seat is not that big so I was actually able to fit several other items in the travel bag as well (such as my coat) which was helpful. The straps are well padded and comfortable. You do feel and look sort of silly with such a large item on your back, but being that it isn't that heavy, it's not that big a deal. It was very easy to unzip and take the seat out once on the plane and then roll it up and fit the bag in the overhead compartment. We will also be using it in our garage now to store the carseat when not in use. This was a little pricey to buy but I think it was definitely a great purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Taken this all over the world","review":"We travel a lot. My husband is usually in charge of carrying the car seat, so I can't say much about the weight factor. However, this is a backpack and honestly probably better than the ones with wheels because who needs one more rolling piece of luggage, to drag through the airport? We have a Britax Boulevard 70 CS and it is a very tight fit! We have to tug on the sides of the bag to pull the zipper up but the inside of the bag is padded and has protected our carseat on every trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"J Childress Ultmate car seat travel bag review","review":"Good product. We used it on one round trip (with connecting flight). Our chicco keyfit 30 car seat and base fit in the bag with no problems. The back pack straps were useful adn functional. The bag does look beat up after the trip, but I'm sure the baggage handlers were tossing it around without caution. There are no tears or rips so far. I have no complaints with this product. It performed as i hoped and fit our carseat/base which was my biggest concern since I couldn't find any reviews about car seat bags for the keyfit 30."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring a sewing kit!","review":"We thought this bag would ease our cross-country plane trip with our infant. But the strap snapped as we entered the airport. After finding a sewing kit in the terminal, we were able to sew it back together.

Would definitely recommend it for travel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands free.","review":"We purchased this for our Chicco Cortina Key Fit 30 car seat and base. We gate checked our car seat and base. It kept our car seat and base clean and scratch free. We like that this bag is worn on the back. This way you are free to hold other things. Caution when using this on your back... it's large, so you need someone to spot you when you walk about airports... otherwise you could hit someone with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice case, but concerned about long tern durability.","review":"The Recaro car seat BARELY fits in this thing, but the seat is freakin' huuuge. It seems very well made, but, and this is a big but....After one trip, there is significant wear on the bottom corners. I was planning on using this thing for at least another year, and I usually fly with the kid 2-3 times per year. It may not make it in one piece. I guess that it is sacrificing itself for the good of the seat. I will probably end up putting some reinforcement patches on the corners. The backpack straps work well, but you kind of look like an enormous hunch back walking through the airport and getting in to elevators with this thing on can be funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very cheap material - not durable","review":"After 1 flight there was a tear near the seam on the bottom. I don't expect I'll get more than a few uses out of them (I bought 2). Also, the positioning of the handle on the top makes it difficult to lug more than one bag. The shoulder straps are nice, however if you are only carrying 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"hands free","review":"This holds the car seat really well with some room left over. It is great when you have lotsa luggage and kids while traveling. The only issue is the zipper. It is cheap. It should be better quality, the same one for a winter coat. I used it twice and have to replace the zipper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1","review":"i was scared that our Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 would not fit .. it did and still have room cant wait to take it on the plane .. i rated it 4 n not 5 cause i have not tried it out yet.. but i put a picture of my husband with the bag"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"Please note the other reviews for this product are old! We ordered this bag and literally, as soon as we opened it and unzipped it, it broke. The zipper does not work, and the padding was damaged. This product is of awful quality. Find another car seat bag as this one is terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything we exepected!","review":"My toddler's car seat is a Graco Snug Ride - slightly deeper than the Brittax equivalent. The travel bag fit the car seat perfectly. We tested it out on a recent trip and the bag worked like a charm. The material is sturdy and durable (like the rip-stop nylon found in better back packs). The car seat remained clean and untouched over several airport transfers, too. The straps are the travel bag's most convenient feature. I considered buying one without the straps but am relieved I paid the extra couple bucks for this model; it left hands free to pull other luggage or push the stroller. This bag made our air travel much easier. I hope it lasts years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit Recaro Pro Sport Car seat","review":"This looked like a sturdy enough bag so was very disappointed to find that it didn't fit the Recaro Pro Sport Harness to Booster seat.

I checked my Chicco infant car seat with base and both arrived unharmed.The backpack feature was helpful to get up and down my 3 floor walk-up. I didn't carry through the airport this time but I'm sure it will be great on our next trip this summer.Super helpful purchase for our first air travel trip, well worth the money to keep my car seat safe and secure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works just like you'd expect","review":"Fits the babyseat we have perfectly and the build quality is nice. The straps fit well and aren't too uncomfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Construction","review":"My husband and I just finished our second trip using this bag. We bought it to protect our Chicco infant seat so we had plenty of room to spare as it also fits larger convertible seats. Well, not only did the zipper break on this trip but one of the straps broke off while my husband was carrying it through the airport. We have barely used it and it is already completely useless. Please don't waste your money on this one, research some other brands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it","review":"I flip flopped about whether or not we needed a carrier for our car seat for soooo long. Mostly this was because many options are expensive. After seeing many other positive reviews, we took a chance on this Ultimate Car Seat Travel Bag. We'd planned to rent one through our car rental company for a recent trip, but for a 3 day trip, this bag was cost neutral. It just barely holds our Britax Marathon, and I can see how the seams would rip on the upper sides if the bag was tossed around some. It seems that this would only be an issue with larger car seats.Otherwise, the carrier is surprisingly comfortable to carry. Definitely worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"So easy for carrying our huge carseat!","review":"We have a Britax Boulevard G3, and that thing is BULKY and HUGE. It fits in here no problem, with plenty of room to spare. After Christmas vacation we came home with much more than we went with, and we were able to cram lots of extra things in here. Southwest doesn't count this as a bag either, and we checked it when we checked our other luggage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have spent more","review":"The quality of this is absolutely horrible.

We have a britax advocate."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING - Does NOT fit the new Britax Fontier 85 SICT!!","review":"We bought this product based on the good reviews by other customers, but now realize that those reviews were based on previous models of the Britax Frontier. The new Frontier 85 SICT is wider at the top, and the bag won't zip around it unless multiple people stand on the carseat to cave in the SICT pads, and have another 2 people on hand to struggle with getting the zipper to barely close. I had to use it for a trip because I had no time to return it beforehand. It took 3-4 people to get the carseat in the bag on both legs of travel, and I definitey can't use it again (the seams around the zipper are already ripping from the strain). Probably good for older models or other brands, but was a total waste of money for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"zipper broke during first use","review":"I will be returning this because the first time we attempted to take it on vacation the zipper broke in the airport- nice start to the vacationSInce the entire point of the bag goes away with a broken zipper I can only give it 1 star"},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"Britax Advocate 70 cs owners do not buy it does NOT fit no matter how hard you try!!!! do not buy if you have a Britax other wise made really well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"We are returning this car seat travel bag. The zipper broke during the first leg of the trip. I just happened to be sitting by the wing of the plane watching them load luggage and saw our car seat sticking out of this bag with a broken zipper. Then I had to worry for the rest of the trip if the car seat would make it to the our final destination as we had a lay over and transfer. Not cool! FYI- The airline was unable or unwilling to alert the luggage carriers when I spoke to the customer service rep during the layover. This product was too expensive for this kind of stress!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit Britax Advocate CS","review":"Let me first state that JL Childress does NOT advertise that the Britax Advocate CS will fit in this travel bag. However, a review I read shared how excited they were that it did in fact fit! I don't want others to have this same false hope we had...it does not even come close to fitting! In doing a little more research, I discovered that JL Childress does offer a custom car seat bag.=) Their customer service can provide all the details."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still in perfect condition","review":"I bought this in April 2011 and have used it for five round trip flights and it still looks brand new.It has served me well!One thing to consider: when I bought this, I had actually wanted the wheeled one but it wasn't immediately available. And after traveling with a baby in a stroller and two wheeled suitcases, I am glad I had this as a backpack instead of as another item on wheels.It fits snug ride 35, britax marathon & britax boulevard with no issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked Great for Us!","review":"We used to have a car seat bag on wheels, but by the end of our first trip it completely fell apart and the straps were painful to use for carrying a heavy car seat.We bought this one after reading the reviews and it worked great for us. We were able to fit our Britax Marathon carseat along with the booster part of our Graco Nautalis 3 in 1 in the bag (the cup part had to go in first and it left about an 8 inch section unzipped). It is a huge bag, but really sturdy and I didn't worry about it tearing or breaking. It has a strong zipper too. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't do without","review":"This was one of the best purchases I've ever made. People at the airport ask me about it all the time.

There's a little more experimentation on this release though. The intro to \\"The Mad Arab\\" is different. This isn't a bad album in places, but it doesn't really offer anything new. The musicianship is good as usual, it's just that the songs aren't very enthralling. I actually give this two-and-a-half stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Concert Ever - Bad DVD","review":"Why, oh why couldn't this DVD be given anything more?

I don't remember the details concerning the plot, just so you know, but I do remember that the story is quite a leap from what we normally see from this author. I have a thing for love stories where the love is a little desperate a little raw. I remember during a certain scene from this novel giving a little gasp at the bittersweet horror presented by the author. Anyway I remember really enjoying the story. The loves scenes were a little hot and the emotional level was soaring. Just like all of her novels. It had the same feel as Chain Lightning and Dark Fire and most of her newer novels, but in an historical setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good mix of historical and romance","review":"Redwood Empire is a saga created by the husband and wife team of Ann and Evan Maxwell. I wasn't sure about this one, having read some of their other joint efforts but they seem to have gotten the right mix on this one. Ann also writes as Elizabeth Lowell. I found Redwood Empire had more substance than some of her other early romance ventures. A fast read as desire mixed with betrayal ultimately leads to tragedy. I'm not sure how accurate the historical parts are but you get a good feel of the time period, region, and just how much our attitudes have changed about the timber industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Old Elizabeth Lowell Book","review":"I bought this, as it was an early publication of Elizabeth Lowell.The characters were one-dimensional and inspired no emotional involvement of this reader.Unless you are an avid Elizabeth Lowell, Ann Maxwell, A.E.

Its kind of stupid to think, the car just sitting alone in the drive way, a camera crew on a street that is not busy, surrounded by houses, no one around, as Xzbit looks at your car. Where is the person? standing in there house? The show is preplanned, and the reactions are just faked abit.

As the years passed, though, I began to wonder if Son Volt's first album might end up their best, that is, until I heard \\"Okemah And The Melody Of Riot.\\" Like \\"Trace,\\" much of its beauty comes from its winding tonal mood, but - and I can't believe I'm saying this - the songs are even better. The boys rock, and rock hard, with the kind of wrung-out crucified guitars that remind me of Neil Young or Springsteen at their best. And speaking of Springsteen, Jay Farrar strikes me as the one American artist most able to rise to that level of committment and delivery. High praise, for sure, but I have a feeling that Bruce would agree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wets my Tear Stained Eye","review":"It's so good to have Jay back! I love this record!

The songs are bland and boring and many of them sound the same especially following son volt's masterpiece wide string tremolo (one of my favorite cd's ever) and Farrar's excellent solo cd's. If you could find a bad song on any other Son Volt cd it would be better than anything on this disc. I just hope there are better things to come.

Son Volt now goes into the category of Starbucks - places to boycott."},{"rating":"2","title":"To everyone who doesn't like the copy protection...a suggestion","review":"Why don't you quit whining about the copy protection and buy the record on iTunes? Then, you can easily play it on your PC, download it onto your iPod, or whatever else you want to do. Don't tell me $9.99 is too much to pay again for this masterpiece. Plus, this way you have the CD as backup for your digital files. Get a grip."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's the voice","review":"I don't know why Farrar changed his singing voice after WST, but it ain't working for him. In fact, it is downright annoying. Not only that but the high, whiny tone is affecting the songwriting, because it's getting weaker with each new album. Listen to him on pre-solo and that is the voice that made him a great singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spare us the futuristic multimedia stuff","review":"So far I have not even listened to this disc. I listen to everything on my MP3 player and computer, and have not even been able to get my computer to recognize it as a CD, much less burn it into mp3s.I find this type of thing extremely annoying. I did not buy the disc to have an adventure in the future of new media, and I don't give a crap about videos and DVDs. I just wanted to listen to the music.Concern about this type of thing happening actually kept me from buying an MP3 player and ripping in a library for a couple years. It's disturbing to see Farrar, who postures as politically radical, at the forefront of some kind of corporate, consumer-screwing protection racket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"Farrar has returned with an excellent new line-up.He's in prime form...if you're a Farrar / Son Volt fan, you'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Don't deny yourself the opportunity to buy both this CD and the first part of the concert, \\"Barbados Cool.\\" Jazz doesn't get much better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sims 2 Seasons a Nice Addition","review":"I didn't purchase this expansion pack until Sims 3 had already been released because I haven't been playing Sims 2 for a while.

LOTs of cute items."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the last expansion pack!","review":"The Sims 2 franchise is back on track with this latest expansion pack that lets your Sims experience seasons, as well as the activities that go along with those seasons. My Sims are having great fun gardening (and eating the results!), playing in the snow, raking leaves, fishing, having water balloon fights, sliding into the pool on their brand new waterslide... The list goes on. There is a lot of new content in this game, and yet it doesn't slow down my computer like the Pets expansion pack did (I uninstalled Pets before installing Seasons, and the whole game runs more smoothly).There have been a few minor glitches, but all in all it has been a lot of fun. I'm addicted to my Sims again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sims 2 Seasons Expansion Pack Review","review":"Cool, fun & worth the money I paid for it.Love this game.

Some stuff wrong but it was okish"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoy the weather","review":"I believe this is the best expansion pack EA has put out for the Sims 2, with a few reservations. I love the farming and fishing aspects, the different skill and relationship bonuses tied to each season, and the graphics. BUT - there is always a BUT - the season graphics can really slow down a system. My laptop is well above all the system requirements for Seasons, but when winter arrives, my system can barely handle the constant snowfall. Also, some aspects of Seasons build upon the previous expansion pack Open for Business; if you don't have OFB, the farming and fishing won't be as lucrative for your sim. Overall though, I highly recommend getting this expansion pack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Fun!","review":"I have been playing The Sims from the beginning and thought they had done just about everything but, The Seasons expansion pack is great fun. I love that they change into winter clothes and can have snowball fights and make snow angels. The new greenhouse and gardening skills are fun as well.

I bought this EP before I bought pets. Both worked fine when installed out of order (i think they should have come together, but that is another story...) but my point is I could play game w/o those annoying pets, but cannot even think about playing w/o seasons. Gardening, fishing, weather, seasons (redundant, i know) changed the whole landscape of the game (literally and figuratively) and the way I play. Just like mostly everyone else said, it is one of the best EPs date."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my favorite Sims 2 expansion so far","review":"For years Sims fans have been clamoring for weather. The Sims 2 Seasons expansion gives it to them.This is an expansion pack that enriches the game no matter how many other expansions you have. Weather follows your sim whether they are at home, running their own business, partying downtown, or on vacation. The weather related-actions, such as playing in puddles and making snow angels, are adorable. Growing produce is also really fun, especially for retired sims."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sims 2 Seasons","review":"It is great being able to make a snowman or rake leaves and play in them.

She does like this book, not as much as the Sesame Street or the Dora. She does sing along with each frame.The only problem with this book is that with the lights in the unit they distort the colors a bit when you are looking at the screen, so identifying the colors is not always as easy as it should be.

A true spiritual path is also a path toward becoming a mature human being, which may not be terribly exciting to people seeking spiritual fireworks or wanting to promote egoistic aims. This path is one of selflessness and the strengthening of attention; both needed in an self-centered world suffering from an ever increasing attention deficit disorder. Steiner only speaks of what he has experienced personally. He is not a guru and expects no one to take his word for the truth of what he says.

If you like good, snappy dialogue, this movie is for you. Dreyfus is very believable, and is supported by a great cast. (No pun intended, if you have seen it!)

While listening to it, I found myself comparing this trio to Los Panchos. Not a good idea. The style of Trio Paraiso although similar is not quite up to par of the successful and talented Panchos. The voices and octaves do not blend to give the songs an almost unison vocal semblance that is characteristic of Los Panchos.The two very familiar tango cuts leave a bit to be desired. A bit too \\"sweet\\" as compared to authentic Argentinian style.All that said, though, I would still recommend this CD because the lyrics are hauntingly beautiful and memorable.

I enjoyed the witty dialogue and funny, yet realistic story lines from his previous work. I expected the same in the new novel. I don't know if the author was hurried by his publisher or if he is running out of ideas, but I was rather disappointed when I finished the novel. The plot was weak and the characters just seem to sit around like they were waiting for the author to tell them what to do. The story never seemed to go anywhere and it just sort of ended. In some cases, I was confused as to what was going on. The book seemed hurried and I felt it could have used a little more proof reading.

Batteries were fine since I could see all the other data displayed (date, time, et.) on the screen.I thought it was just bad luck and returned the phone to the store in exchange for a 2nd one of the same kind.Same thing with the 2nd phone too...I am returning it to the store today and will definitely not buy from this brand again.BTW: I have caller id on other phones in the house so the problem is not from the service being installed or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, this is a \\"call-out\\" not a review....","review":"Hi, Sorry this isn't a review for the book.

Back-in-the-day her voice soaredover the airwaves. As a teen-ager she took you up, she took you down. She kept you on the edge and you felt that you had shared some of the same romantic feelings that she conveyed. I don't know what happened but in this release Mary does not seem to go about this with confidence. Many cuts are off-key and the band also cuts in and out inappropriately and also off-key. Bad sound and production. The audio sounds like something that you recorded in a \\"Put the dollar in the slot\\" for a recording of your voice and a personel CD for your boyfriend. I feel bad writing this.I was hopeful for so much more from Mary. Maybe next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I have found my paradise","review":"Mary Weiss. Name don't ring a bell? How about: The Shangri-las? Okay now I got your attention. Bad birls, chewing gum - a girl group, but with the long-straight hair look. Not bouffants. Maybe black leather. And not New Jersy. No, Staten Island. Dark eyed girl children of the damned that paved the way for...oh.. I don't know...let's say The New York Dolls. Mary Weiss was the singer. And she has come back. Little Steven [of Little Steven's Underground Garage] hipped me to this one. Enter a pool parlor of youth. Racing nights. Figuring out the rules of love. Wondering about Juanita and saying why not. It plays: My Heart is Beating. Big chords and castanets. Brill Street beckons. But this is now and that was then! Got a buzz guitar. A doo-wap chorus bit sound. Her voice has the same plaintive tone. Her teen self sings through the filter of adult pain. It could be the Shangri-las. The important thing is this sound has not aged a bit. It's a hit in my blue heaven in 2007."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Tough","review":"Thanks to a pal of mine I found out the lead singer of the Shangri La's headed back into the studio to record her first album in about 30 odd years. I'm so glad he told me and I'm so glad I bought this.Her voice is a bit deeper now but it's still that sass a frass Mary behind the mic. She even does a cover of \\"Heaven Only Knows\\" an old Shangri La's hit, and the music is very much in the vein of her former band, but with some added attitude and a few swear words here and there. I just can't believe she's waited this long to record but where ever she was hiding it's worth it, cause she sounds amazing and the songs are all really good. Just listen to some of the songs and you'll be hooked like it's a brisky day in 1966."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elevator Music","review":"I was expecting the original themes (such as Name of the Game, Mannix, and Banacek).

One after another. I never could identify with either hiker. I had no image in my mind of what they looked like. Too many flashbacks I didnt really care about their past experiences.

A real survivor is a grandmother on food stamps, taking care of and loving five grand-kids, in a roach motel, with no vehicle and a greedy landlord.Or a woman with a double mastectomy, who finds out she had bone cancer and decides it is time to learn how to drum because she has wanted to all her life, and knows each 3-month check-up might be her last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not my favorite book by Childs","review":"Subtitled \\"a true story of ruin and survival,\\" The Way Out is an account of Childs' and his good friend Dirk Vaughn's mid-winter crossing of a convoluted wilderness area along the Arizona-Utah border. During their sixteen day adventure the two men face not only the challenges of the broken, primeval terrain, but they also deal with their own inner demons--Childs' anger over the psychological damage inflicted by his late alcoholic father; Dirk's memories of the persons he harmed (including one man he killed accidentally) during his career as a policeman.If highly detailed description of a multi-day exploration through a maze of canyons carved out of Navajo sandstone, including flashbacks to earlier traumatic experiences, is your bag, this is the book for you.I, however, was almost as tired of the duo's adventure as they were by the end of the book.

True, I'd be exaggerating to say I look forward to the next time I'm confronted by a lock with no key, but I now know I can overcome such an obstacle.On a related note, shortly after reading the book, I read a fascinating article in my local paper (Reno Gazette-Journal) on the author.

But one week later, my 3 year old nephew came over and somehow ruined the microphone. Since my nephew is 3 and does not have a slobber problem from teething or anything, the micorphone should have been able to handle it. Since it can't even handle a 3 year old, I wonder how long it could survive a one year old who was still teething.

It's very durable, with him dragging it by the microphone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good times!","review":"Great sound and lots of fun except that the string from keyboard to microphone is not nearly long enough.

He's not old enough to be coordinated with it yet, but he loves the lights and constant music/noise. It is only because he seems to love it so much that I haven't thown it out the window.If you're looking for a piano for your child, get a different one. This isn't a piano as much as it is just a music machine. If nothing else, for your own sanity get a different one!

When the girls figured out that there was no sound coming out of the mike they were very heart broken but they still play with it because it is very fun and entertaining.

I found them to be well written as well as thought provoking. This work, however, does follow in this pattern.First of all, contrary to the clever marketing, the vast majority of it is not written by Schor at all. It's basically a Schor tribune book. A bunch of far lesser known scholars put forth their theories on consumption in a sort of reply to what Schor has said in her previous research.Further, what these other scholars have to say is just not that interesting. It doesn't fill a void in our collective knowledge the way that Schor's original work did.Overall, I think this book is a pretty shameless attempt to cash in on Schor's popularity. However, there are a few interesting points and for those most interested in consumption research, it may be worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual, but exceptional, Asia","review":"This may very well be Asia's greatest music.

Although not as an accomplished book, Icefields is engaging and a wonderfully worthwhile read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great expectations in the beginning","review":"I had great expectations in the beginning of this \\"novel\\" It reads more like a first draft that has gleanings of a masterpiece, but that needs a bunch more revisions. Some readers found the author's convoluted style exhilarating, I found it troublesome. Still Wharton's language is beautiful, and he uses a variety of interesting techniques, but he switches back and forth between time periods, characters and settings entirely too quickly for my tastes. I recommend it for a challenging read that evokes the haunting surreal qualities of a glacier."},{"rating":"1","title":"He can write, but this is not a novel!","review":"Thomas Wharton has talent as evidenced by some of the most beautiful passages of original prose I have ever read. But what a disappointment Icefields is for the lover of true novels. The word \\"novel\\" stands for something and we novel readers are entitled to the fulfillment of certain minimum expectations. This is a convoluted, plotless diatribe that reads less like a novel and more like the badly edited journal of a writer lost in the wilderness. Match Thomas Wharton's innate talent up with a terrific story idea and I think you'd have a great novel. But Icefields is an example of why good writing just isn't enough.

Tunes such as Faydeaudeau and similar just go to prove how under-exploited their talent is -for the greater part, the other songs just make me cringe in agony as the inevitable 4/4 beat kicks in, delivering with it, a solid boot to the face of any hint at quality that dared submerge its dainty features during the opening seconds or minutes. Mektoub is a prime example of this, a beautiful and moving soundscape laid to waste by their blatant lack of effort to even attempt something new or accomplished. As it stands, practically every song is a lazy and predictable affair, leaving me sour, gagging for my daily dosage of Orb, Sun Electric or Thomas Fehlmann."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bore-o","review":"This album is the most boring album I have ever bought.

It is very different from Shelley's book, but it manages to capture the main ideas of the Romantic movement - that science sullies nature by making it understandable, and that the life of reason promised by the enlightenment would not lead to happiness. Even today as we have our lives improved and extended by technologies unimaginable at the time of the film (let alone the book), the entire world still struggles with these issues. Will we return to the simple, short, and technology-free life of the middle ages or move forward to the wonders still promised by the enlightenment?

The next scene or so sees Dr. F-- in his lab with the creature, and get this, he spills the beans of what he's about to do. It was at this point I stopped watching. Did the producers of this film actually read the book? Also, the acting is heavy handed and overwrought. Really, almost unwatchable. How did it ever become such a classic?

I decided to look up my mother's horoscope, and hers was also excessively negative to the point of being hurtful. The ONLY thing that I liked about this book is that the pictures for each planet's goddess/fairy whatever were really beautiful. I plan to cut these pictures out and most likely frame them. The rest of the book I may use for a doorstop. Sorry, astrology fans, this is not a good book to work with.

The practice exams are nothing like the actual SAT II; they are instead geared to judge how much you remember from the book's review section.

In the first chapter he states his premise clearly: \\"There was a time when committed Christians were known as God-fearing people. This was a badge of honor. But somewhere along the way we lost it. Now the idea of fearing God, if thought of at all, seems like a relic from the past. That's to our detriment. The fear of God is actually as relevant today as it was in bygone generations\\" (1). In the remaining fourteen chapters he defines, describes, and illustrates what it means for Christians to individually and corporately to fear God in their lives. Chapter titles include \\"Beyond Measure, Beyond Compare\\" describing God's greatness, \\"Transcendent Majesty\\" describing God's holiness, \\"He Is Lord\\" describing God's sovereignty, and \\"He Is Worthy\\" describing how essential the fear of the Lord is in our worship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fear God? Yes!","review":"The joy of fearing God is such an alien expression to many of us. It was to me before reading this book. The expression \\"fear God\\" is all over the bible, and yet I thought of fear of God in negative terms. Not anymore.In this book Jerry Bridges digs deep into the bible to prove beyond a doubt that our greatest joy and fulfillment can only be found in a healthy fear of God. It does not mean that we should always be cowering waiting for the smiting hand of an angry, celestial father who delights to abuse his children. Bridges thesis rests on the fact that God is so huge, awesome, holy, and other than us that most of the people who encountered and loved Him in the bible were brought to their knees in awe. We have lost this awe. Bridges sets out to show us why that is a bad thing and how to solve the problem.Read this book for an often missing perspective that is sorely needed in the Church today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jerry Bridges does it again!","review":"There isn't a Jerry Bridges book that I haven't read.

It can kick up a lot of dust. To reduce the dust, just wet the floor enough, so that water flows into the cut groove. I found that the dust is significantly lower or virtually none, if the floor is wet enough, then cut the line going backward instead. Water will flow into the cut line and keep the dust from flying. With the direction of how the blade rotates, this works out better. Another way is to have someone spray a small stream of water at the cut while cutting.Make sure to plug the saw into a GFI outlet when using water to keep the dust down. A dust mask is a must even with wet cutting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!","review":"I bought two because I was sure one owuld not last but was I surprised.

At the same time, two women who are searching for their identity come back to the reservation. One of them is a movie star who has been adopted and who feels that she was born on the Arapaho reservation. The other is Father John's niece who comes to him with questions about her paternity. There is the usual tension and undeniable attraction between Father John and Vicki, and also the presence of Vicki's ex-husband Ben to contend with.

He needs to find out if he was the intended or victim or was it Father Keenan? This mystery takes him back to 1964 when Father Keenan was a young priest on the Wind River Reserve. Vicky and Father John end up working together again to try to unravel the tangled skein of clues. These characters are so realistic that you will find as you read, that you think of them as real.

I have these paired with E30 sats, E 250P sub, E N24WII for surround and a Yamaha RX-V767 AV receiver/amp.Highs are detailed, clear and crisp, Good punchy midbass and clear midrange, mid highs are a little bright and slightly over powering; imaging good not great. This speaker can play loud (Sensitivity 91dB) and with the bright mid-highs the E C25 might be just as good of a speaker for the lower price.This speaker is great for movies - the detail is awsome. For music (7 channel stereo) I turn this off becuase the mid-highs are too bright and over powering.Bottom line - this is a great speaker for HT systems especially for the price you can get them on amazon.

However, despite what ASUS says on their website, the product does not have WPA security built into the software. At the ASUS website, one can download additional software for WPA security functionality, but it is a third party program (Odyssey Client) which is not compatible with the ASUS software, and whose instructions are less clear than income tax forms instructions.

After 3 months, the second one is shot again. The motor is too weak to support the primary funtion of this tool, which is to mix oil, a heavier liquid than vinegar, so when you mix your vinaigrette, it's putting too much pressure on the GIZMO. The invention is a great idea, but it should be plugged into an electrical outlet. APPLICA, which supposedly fixes these - doesn't anymore - I was told to get it recycled, end of story.

Reading it, I get the feeling he *had* to write these PSU football articles because he worked for the local newspaper. Some of Mr. Bracken's articles have historical information which may be useful, but overall it's not very entertaining or interesting, even for the fans. There are many books on PSU football, some of the best are written by one of its biggest fans - the coach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of Helpful Advice","review":"Human Being is a very well constructed book full of the helpful kind of advice your grandmother would give you if you hadn't sent her off to the nursing home. Seriously, I love this book. It is organized into four main sections as implied by the subtitle. Then each of those sections is subdivided into numerous small articles. Each article gives insight into specific human problems, asks relevant questions of the reader, and offers helpful advice and activities to help the reader work through the problem. This book is as interactive and multimedia as a printed book can be. It is also my best friend when I have no one to talk to."},{"rating":"2","title":"100% In Power With This Handbook","review":"I have only been in the Veterinary feild for just under a year, and this book has saved me more than once.

The pages of the section, \\"The Most common questions for small animals\\", has become a bit worn. We love to snatch this book up when we do not have a direct answer for our clients, if the Doctors our unavailable (which is often), or if we are just having one of those days.

However, I think it would be a good source for someone just starting out in the veterinary field. This book may also be useful for an experience person starting at a new hospital as the book contains worksheets for the reader (a.k.a. the new person) to fill out regarding hospital policies (for vaccines, lab testing, surgical appts, etc.).

Several chapters are devoted to the history and politics of late-medieval Germany, and they provided wonderful context for the overall story.I learned a great deal from this book, however, the writing style was slightly annoying. Man, the author, tries to chat with his reader, and while it was interesting some of the time, I felt it was overdone, and that the book began to suffer because of it. Sentences like \\"So: Here we go\\", do not belong in a history book. Other than that tendency, I really did like the book. I am very interested in the History of Books, and this is one of the few sources (in English) written about the father of modern printing; so for that reason, I value it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable !","review":"My 8 yr. old daughter loves this book, she reads it all the time.

I feel it is inspiring to children by sharing a message that starts with God and yourself.

I recommend to share this book with your children as a simplistic way to talk to God."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautifully carved damnation","review":"This book got me, by the way it's simply written, yet strongly portrayed. It's a very intelligent piece. It goes to show how imperfect the world would stay because of the scattered attitude of being a dimwit human among us. The twins have grown with power and strength, stripped of emotions, which is the very meaning of life. A war could trigger such fear and defense for two young kids to develop into perfect, rightful robots. I just hope my professor could read this book so he'd stop failing his students, and see how far a capability of a single person could go, if given a chance to face a crisis, killing and destroying are only starting options."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the first volume","review":"While some of the songs from the first volume may be found in this volume, i personally find this volume to be better than the first.Here are the song titles in order:1.

I picked it up and, like most of the other reviewers, I just kept reading. I'm not a big fan of poetry (it's an art form I have not understood or embraced), but his writing vacilates between wonderful imagery and monologues to fairly pedestrian dialogue. He would mix incredible poetic cadences with wooden and stilted writing that, I don't think, the two always married well from the \\"novel\\" point of view (even though the story is autobiographical). Nonetheless, I really enjoyed the book. I got a sense that by the end of the novel, he was still searching (hoping?) for the picket fence.

This book offers a refreshing view of Black manhood and the Black family. The vivid pictures he creates in his story move like the book is playing on the big screen. How about it HBO? A story that shines the light on amazing men who love and cherish their families and women. We certainly could use more of these kind of films to even out the ones that portray Black men in a negative light.

With a fresh voice and inimitable style, Datcher steers readers' minds through the murky terrain of life for brothers in America. The true beauty of this concise, poetic masterpiece is that it captures the essence of a societal aha moment familiar to African-Americans: From Ph.D. to GED, the struggle for equality continues.The communal Black Experience envelops Mr. Datcher from Indiana to California, with great tidbits and revelations along the way. This is definitely a must read, a keepsake for bookshelves across the country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"I also found Datcher's work inspiring, his description of african american life was AMAZING, growing up in an all white town, wanting to know more about diversity-this book said it all.

Boy am I glad that I did.This book was deeper than I expected. It helped shatter stereotypes of the black community, explaining in a way that is accessible to blacks, whites, and I would imagine other minorities as well. As a biracial person (black/white) raised in a predominantly white environment this book forced me to confront some preconceived notions I held concerning race, but was very thought-provoking in terms of religion, community, love, etc, in addition to race. Although I enjoyed James McBride's THE COLOR OF WATER, Michael Datcher's book keeps that memoir feel but challenges the reader more with its ideas.RAISING FENCES should be read by anyone who is interested in racial relations in the US today. It is also of interest to those interested in family and churches and communities in America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've read in awhile","review":"This book speaks to anyone who is at the margins of society and has felt the anger, fear and hurt that comes along with being a racial or ethnic minority. While this book describes the struggles of urban black men in life and love, many others can relate to the experiences of the author. It is also a touching love story that revives hopes of true love and soul mates. The poetry throughout the novel is moving. This book is honest, inspiring, and well-written. I would recommend it to anyone ready to truly enjoy a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reading, but disappointing ending","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Datcher's style of writing...the chapters alternate between childhood and adulthood....he allows the reader to connect the dots (so to speak) between how his childhood experiences moulded his adulthood life. Mr. Datcher does not insult the reader's intelligence....he allows the reader to use their imagination, i.e., he doesn't spell everything out. However, I was disappointed with the ending...it seems like Mr. Datcher had to meet a deadline so he had to wrap it up quickly and not go into depth in the final chapters....or maybe I was enjoying the book so much I was disappointed that it came to the end...I'm still trying to decide....a definite read for young African-American males."},{"rating":"2","title":"Si, cinco de las estrellas mas grandes","review":"Most bands are born and then die, never coming close to Los Lobos' lesser works, much less the Masterpiece which is Kiko.

If you liked \\"Monster Head\\" you'll probably like this too, so give it a shot; but if you remember the fabulous sounds of Los Lobos from \\"How Will The Wolf Survive\\" and \\"By The Light Of The Moon\\" you may find their newest release a disappointment, as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completes the best rock trilogy of the decade.","review":"Third in a series of nearly undefinable masterpieces from Los Lobos, \\"This Time\\" is, like \\"Kiko\\" & \\"Colossal Head\\" before it, an album of a sort that we've never really heard before, but that is too good- just too confident to call experimental. With songs like the title track, \\"Oh Yeah\\", & \\"Corazon\\", the album is full of that unforgettable, frustratingly rare type of song that at times finds its beauty as much in what the artist doesn't play as in what he does. At it's best, the music of \\"This Time\\" picks up the thread first uncovered in \\"Life is Good\\", & \\"Kiko and the Lavender Moon\\"; cascading upon the listener w/ suggested grooves, while it's sparse lyrics stay with us by merely hinting, letting David's sad or Cesar's sly tone reveal the spirit of the song. It is in this way that Los Lobos has been positioned alongside the likes of Hendrix & Robert Johnson ever since Kiko. \\"This Time\\" is a fine, fine work."},{"rating":"2","title":"the wolves strike again","review":"if one reads ty7777's review below, one should beware. ty knows not of what he/she speaks.this disc is another wonderful addition to the los lobos catalogue. although not immediately accessible, repeated listenings reveal it to be a true treasure. los lobos is a band that demands close attention to detail. buy it, listen to it, study it, love it.for other los lobos albums in a similar vein, try 'colossal head' or the magestic 'kiko'. for more traditional albums from these boys, try 'wolf?', 'moon', or the wonderful new 'good morning aztlan.' for more mexican-american fare, purchase 'pistola'or 'just another band from east l.a.'for a near-perfect overview of all facets lobos, immediately purchase 'el cancionero.' if somehow you are disappointed, seek medical attention immediately, for you have no heart. or soul, for that matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"This is one of the best clamps I've used, but when you calculate in the low, low cost, it's hard to believe!

It is very dry and hard to read. It is muddled and the point is often lost. The authors often use strings of studies without bothering to tie them together or suggesting what real information we should be getting from it. Out teacher stopped using half way through the semester.Here's a paraphrased example from the book.Study x sort of shows y.Study c sort of shows the opposite of y.Study w shows nothing related to y, but somewhat related to x.Overall, that is how flooding works.Lets talk about PTSD for no reason for one paragraph at the end of the chapter.Oops we spelled \\"comorbid\\" wrong.

Just read through the first chapter to get an idea. Not only does this make the book highly unprofessional, but it also makes it nearly impossible to learn because one is constantly distracted.In addition, while I realize that this isn't the fault of the publisher or authors, this book is not suitable for the graduate level.

The story reveals much about the characters personalities with the exception of Vishnu. I wanted to know more and more about him and felt such compassion for his life and his being. The glimpses into his past, his family, and his love affair with Padmini made him all the more real as people of the building stepped over him as he slept on their front step. Vishnu, born to a loving mother who wanted him to be great, and the reality of his life as a homeless servant evoked such compassion for him, a man with a story that could only be known by himself. Manil Suri wrote a book that unfolds its story so delicately and with such depth that you'll be thinking about it long after you finish the book. This is a great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Spiritual and the Mundane","review":"This is a wonderful first novel which expertly mixes the material and spiritual, using characters which are comical yet all too human. Mr. Suri writes with a style and understanding that is subtle and nuanced, yet achieves great depth. Despite its complexity, The Death of Vishnu is like a delicate perfume, light and provocative. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb comedy of spiritual manners","review":"A superb comedy of spiritual manners set in an apartment house in Bombay. An astonishing achievement for a first novel and the best thing I've read (in the genre) since Jane Austen. I am looking forward to more from Prof. Suri. The best fiction written in English today is coming from India, and Mr Suri has provided one of the best examples to date of this new body of literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thoroughly delightful book","review":"When is this fine author going to come out with a second novel? \\"Death of Vishnu\\" was an absolutely delightful read.

None of the characters had any redeeming values and it made me not really care what happened.

I was also disappointment by the rather poor understanding of the mythological basis of Hindu beliefs that formed the underpinnings of the novel. I read somewhere that Mr Suri is learning Indian mythology thru Penguin translations. This is not the way to do it. These translations are literal, they don't capture the spirit behind the originals.-Sam"},{"rating":"2","title":"A remarkable first novel","review":"This is the kind of book you discover and tell your friends to read. It is the sure-footed, funny, and heartbreaking tale of the inhabitants of an apartment house in India. But it's also much more, an examination of spirituality and ethnic conflicts. Entertaining, lyrical, and moving, this book is a must read, enjoyable and richly literary at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkward Frist Novel","review":"I could not wait to finish this novel. Suri has a very interesting concept behind his book, but I do not think he pulled it off. The characters all had colorful backgrounds, but the flashbacks into their past felt more like a historical dictation and less like storytelling. Vishnu's past with Padmini is a flop. I couldn't tell you what the significance of that was except that he wanted what he could not have. I didn't understand Mr. Jalal's deal, either, and what the impact of it was, nor was it believable that he was going through a spiritual rebirth. I liked Mrs. Asrani and Mrs. Pathak a lot. These two bickering neighbors who could not get along created some very entertaining conflict. As for the writing, I think Suri tries way too hard to evoke drama, rather than allow the drama to speak for itself. I did not enjoy reading this book, but that is not to say I wouldn't give Suri another try if he wrote a second."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant though not immortal","review":"The Death of Vishnu uses the day the dogsbody on the first-floor landing of a Bombay block of flats is agonising to tell the story of its inhabitants. Recounting their small-time vicissitudes and rivalries, it reads like an interlacing of short stories, though as the novel progresses the actions of one rebound increasingly on the other. Vishnu's last moments are interspersed with older memories and with light Hindu theology and imagery. A Hindu girl elopes with the building's Muslim Don Juan. Manil Suri is masterful at extracting all the pulp from his microcosm's everyday. And since this is India, it involves quirkiness and folklore alike, as well as the inevitable religious strife. The tone remains one of light and insightful comedy, however, and though it may be at times formulaic, this is an engaging novel. Suri writes beautifully, with an exceptional eye for detail; I was surprised to read on the jacket that he has left his native India and is a diaspora writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I'll be brief - started out fairly well.

In short, after the first chapter...it was all down-hill from there.The story of a head-strong girl comming of age during India's partition and her disasterous marriage are simply new clothes on an old empress-how many times have we read this tale? The convoluted Father/Daughter relationship lays the groundwork for the incestuous Mother/Son incident that is (yawn) the pivitol point of the book.The charactors are flat and very few take on a life outside the page. It became clear,after the middle, that the author was having a hard time trying to sustain the voice of a female protagonist. The voice becomes shrill, repetative and whining- a real bore to read and even the son fails to arouse sympathy within the framework of the tale.Better luck elsewhere...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts strong but a HUGE LET DOWN!","review":"I found myself going through this book very quickly, mostly becasue it started out strong, but I am not one for a ridiculous amount of flashbacks and fantasy. I noticed I began to basically speed read the last 1/3 of this book because I just wanted to put it away already! Read something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many vocabulary words","review":"I was so excited to read this book. I thought it would give me some insight into Indian culture. I did get almost halfway thorugh before I gave up. Obviously he wrote for his Indian audience. But for Joe or Jane American, unless you like looking up vocabulary words all the time, it's cumbersome. Mercifully, there is a glossary in the back, but any novel that needs PAGES of glossary is not a joy to read, it felt more like school work--having to refer back there sometimes several times on a single page of text. And several words were not included. After a while, I just gave up. I only hope this is made into a movie...the story was great, just didnt have the patience with all the unfamiliar words...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I love this book, I have a 6 years old and he loves to read by himself.

Its premise (simplified) is that we all have the wisdom and strength within to solve life's problems, but our thinking gets in the way. Through the window of parenting, Dr. Mills was able to introduce this concept to the Modello residents and completely change the community's culture.

(thanks, amazon, for making them available again!)So, I bought it for my son, but I also bought it for myself, to see again the books I once loved.

It's as if no one understands the words or emotions they are supposed to be portraying, including the director and translator. Susanna played by Rossana Potenza is overacting at its worst. Her exaggerated facial contortions and arm waving make it difficult to get through the first act. Particularly difficult to watch if you do historical reproduction, as the sets, props, and costumes all fall short to a critical eye. Hold out for a better version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mary Beth","review":"For those who appreciate and love Maurice Chevalier's musical career, this film is worth adding to your library. The documentary takes you through Maurice's life with interviews from family and friends who were very close to him and his career.

It tells of a young girl's childhood naivety. It shows how, being a young misfit, she yearns to grow up and be accepted. Her wild actions are intriguing. It wasn't very realistic, however, that a soldier would try to pick up a 12 year old girl. But, the talk of her dreams were very realistic. All children dream of running away, but then they never actually do it. It shows Frankie's personality great, though, when she does try to runaway, taking her father's pistol with her. Throughout the book, all Frankie wanted to do was be accepted as a young adult rather than a child, and she goes through a lot to try and prove it. In the end, however, she remains naive."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well-written, interesting mood piece","review":"Readers who are familiar with Southern literature from the mid- 20th century know all too well that many of these books are character-driven mood pieces. As such, the \\"Member of the Wedding\\" accurately chronicles some of the painful situations that all of us experience as youg adolescents.

The author describes all of the scenes very well except she doesnt need to because most of them are the same, the kitchen. It's fine that the kitchen is the main backdrop for the story such as the water pump in the miracle worker. But every time you go into the kitchen it's the same why spend and entire page in your novel talking about the same thing you told us 10 pages ago.

Wix is a great company majoring in filtration. Remember the one arrow that comes on this filter is meaning the direction of airflow. Many other makes of vehicles will have two arrows one saying insert this end first and the other arrow saying something like insert with this arrow facing up. If this filter fits your vehicle the instruction process is not like my example but just the direction of airflow. If you have a question about the direction of airflow of your vehicle it is most likely going down.

Most people who have a reasonable knowledge about his life will recognize this. He couldn't soulve his problems there with a single battle or siege, so he had a series of skirmishes, ambushes to finaly \\"pacify\\" the country.But the author's necessity to present his case against George Bush is so strong that he deliberately paints the war as hopeless from the beginning. But the truth that anyone can grasp from the book is that: Alexander remained in Bactria for just one year, and that was enough. An army of greek veterans (actually, soldiers old enough to be relieved from the main army) which represented only a small fraction of the macedonian army was able not only to control the country for 200 years, but to spend most of this time fighting against each other since other threats were not present."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"Comparing George W.

It was entertaining and got my mind flowing, but I did not remember any of the dreams. It was just hoards of scrambledy written dreams about bizarre personal experiences in Kerouac's life, written with incongruous images and carry ons (as Kerouac often does and this review does) and it is a hard to follow book. It did make me try the same experiment in taking down my dreams, but I was jealous I could not take my dreams down as vividly with as much creativity as Jack did. It is poetic and I like that the subjects of each beginning of the dreams are different and it seems he must have embellished some of his dream chronicles. Uhmm, the writing again shows Kerouac had a great sense of humor about the reality that readers would probably not make it through many of the details of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Must\\" reading for all Jack Kerouac fans and enthusiasts","review":"Book Of Dreams is Jack Kerouac's written record of his dream life, a kind of parallel autobiography of his soul. A writer whose novels, beginning with On The Road, spoke for and to a whole generation of young men and women, Jack Kerouac was a man who, awake or asleep, struggled with the problems that beset all human relationships, and that makes his writings (and his dreams) as meaningful and compelling today as they were half a century ago. This new and expanded City Lights addition is the first full publication of the complete manuscript as Jack Kerouac intended it to be.

The product packaging looked amateurish. The installation was quick. The TV came on bright and like-new. But, it was short lived as it stopped working after 20 mins. I let it cool off and turned the TV on an hour later.. it was working fine again.. but alas, only for another 20 minutes. I realized that this product is made out of cheap plastic and might be causing the issue. So, finally I took the bulb out of the cheap plastic and installed it inside the casing of my Sony original. This seem to work. I've had it for couple of days and no issues so far.Lesson learnt for me.. only buy original/quality product. Cheap knock-offs are...cheap and wont work all the time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dont buy used, from: tech for less","review":"I purchased a used \\"in new condition\\" from: tech for less, and was verry unhappy with the product when it arrived.

However, upon opening it, it is obvious this is not a Sony branded part, but a generic replacement. While the old lamp slides in and out of the tv easily, this one does not. It requires some effort to make sure it aligns along the rails and seats completely inside the old socket. Once that was accomplished (after 5-10 mins), the tv turned on and worked fine. I do not have any red blinking light issues and have used the lamp for about 2 months.

It is not....repeat NOT....a factory item, it was assembled in Mexico and all the contacts will not work on the TV.

Anyway, six months and one day- bought a new TV that doesn't require a bulb to work. This clearly isn't worth the money you pay for it if it doesn't work- yet, the price does keep coming down.

She has fine, long hair. It gets tangled easily and she hates to have it brushed. Safari Detangler works on the most stubborn of tangles and decreases the amount of time needed to pull a comb through her hair. It doesn't leave her hair greasy or weighted down. It also has a very pleasant scent. I was sad to hear Bath and Body Works stopped carrying this brand. Hopefully, they don't discontinue the line elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"stinky!!!","review":"I understand the need to put an irritant in the scent to make you notice the smell, but this product has gone too far!!If you have any kind of allergies at all, don't get this!!

This wonderful little glimpse into the beginning of a R&B master's career contains the songs that made him famous (\\"Fingertips--Parts 1&2,\\" \\"Uptight (Everything's Alright),\\" etc.). Every track on this album is soulful, and the beats range from upbeat and peppy to introspective and full of spirit. I was amazed at the versatility and range of this wonderful artist even before he reached his teens! This album can be enjoyed by people of all ages--from young kids starting out in music to those who have loved Stevie for years.

The cut is too large from side to side and no matter how well you try to tighten this top, it will not stretch tight. Rained the second day I had it and because the top would not stretch tight, the top filled up with water, bowed, and the top was destroyed.Installation was difficult because the front edge would not stay in windshield channel - I have a brand new channel on the Jeep. Once I got the center and rear straps on, I went to secure the side straps. It was obvious this top was not correctly designed to fit the 92 Wrangler. Pulling both sides tight results in sagging on both sides with the center slightly raised.If you want to spend $30 to use a top one time, buy it. If you want a bikini top that actually fits and lasts the summer, you will never find it with Pavement Ends. I learned my lesson the hard way.Don't walk....run away from Pavement Ends products.

I needed to get replacement bulbs for this system, managed to figure it out with the help of a local hardware store. The problem ended up that I needed to buy new wire too, wish they would have told me that as I would have purchased it from them, instead I got it locally. My mistake was buying an old 200watt system, when for a few more dollars I could have gotten a 300 watt system and had more power.

The book also claims that most of these prospective business ideas might be already aquired hobbies...I don't think so. Most of the ideas are far-fetched and truthfully lame, which I'm sorry to say was a big upset. I'm not inspired, just disappointed I have to purchase another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful","review":"Katina Jones writes this book in a concise and helpful manner.

In addition to the rock influence of the 60's and 70's inherent in most music of that time period, as well as the grand \\"Classical Rock\\" influence of Yes, Genesis, Peter Gabriel and other of the genre, Larry Fast includes a strong Middle Eastern/Turkish flavor into some of the tracks.If you'd like to hear \\"classical\\" techno/synthesizer music, this album is a must-listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"One for the ages","review":"The sounds Larry coaxed out of his synthesizers for this album still sound fantastic.

Revealingly, in their litany of consulting horror stories, they somehow missed the biggest consulting disaster of the century: IBM at the FAA. Worse, their simplistic advice for clients considering consulting help is misleading and more dangerous than the company of consultants.

In this sense the \\"Dangerous Company\\" has its merits. However, as somebody who has recently joined one of the \\"big four\\" consulting houses, I think the book missed out on one of the most important trends in the business, namely that consulting is moving more and more away from the classical \\"write the report and run\\" approach and is moving more towards a form of \\"interim management\\" where the consultant is brought on board of the ship to help (instead of just telling how) to steer it for a certain time.

In principle, it is impossible to, by pure reason, justify belief in anything other than our own selves, yet we live by more than just pure reason alone, we believe in the existence of other minds beyond our own because we are compelled by experience to believe, but we are not at all compelled into believing in God's existence. Only to the person who is naturally inclined to belief in God does the existence of God seem obvious, to a true atheist, thw world and our place in it looks like a world without God.

This is another reason I love Amazon - they try to make things right when they're at fault, and even sometimes when they're not at fault.

Sometimes I actually buy on their basis but I'm regularly disappointed. The reviews must be posted by anonymous band members or band friends.A prime example of this is \\"Guilty\\" by The Get Up Kids. I have a rule - I only keep a CD if there are 2 decent songs on it. I could not find 1 on this CD and it will be sold.So why this harsh judgement:1. The production is jam packed with instruments, up front guitars, there's no space, not nearly enough dynamics. Power pop is allowed to have space - go check the early 80's recordings by The Records.2. The songs are not catchy, not hooky. They drone on with predictable chord changes and harmony choruses. It's just so unimaginative. Pop music is allowed to be surprising.Power Pop has been around for 20 years and there is no need to waste your money on this inferior example."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"As one of my fellow get up fans state, this album is the maturity of On a Wire, and the fun and energy of STWHA.

I have listened to this CD through several times hoping to unlock my appreciation for a song or two, but it just didn't happen.

Is that to keep the outside from getting hot, or just for so-called 'looks'? They are very hard to keep clean in any case.Now, after six months, a third problem has come up. It burns the toast.

Why not? Because I gave it away almost as soon as I had listened to it once. I was always wary of buying Solas' material; nothing I heard from them really struck me as having a lot to do with traditional Irish music. Their sound and music selection always struck me as being more in line with a contemporary, American pop/folk band. There is no traditional dance music on the album as I recall, and the songs fall overwhelmingly outside the trad. idiom.I received this album from a local radio station as part of a giveaway and I decided to continue the trend and give it away again. And you know what? The friend to whom I gave it tried to give it back!My advice is to stay away from this album if you are looking for truly traditional Irish music. If you are into the whole contempo-folk/pop sound, then maybe this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The edge of disaster","review":"This is really not celtic music, and certainly does not measure up to their early work. When Karen Casey left Solas as the singer, you could kind of tell by The Hour Before Dawn, which lost much of their Irish influences and tended towards new age and schmarmy cheese-music, that Solas was headed downhill. This album, I think is even worse than Hour. They seem to have no energy in their performace, and the feeling I get from the album is rather apathetic. There are maybe 1 or 2 songs that are slightly redeemable, but most of the songs are to slow. If you are a fan of traditional celtic music, don't buy this. However, if you appreciate Americanized new age/vaguely irish music, then go for it. You have been warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fools!!!","review":"Anyone who listens to this album and cannot hear the amazing talent Solas brings to the Celtic table is a fool! This album is a spectacular example of trad/mod enfusion. Deidre's voice is simple, pure and effortless. Win's fiddle is raw and beautiful. Micks fingers are on fire on button and key. And the diversity of the talented Seamus Egan makes for a power house band - sounds strange to use that term with a celtic band but it works for Irish rockers like the Cranberries as well. I am a particular fan of Solas' interp of Bob Dylans Dignity, their version far surpasses the origional. If you are a fan of Celtic music in the slightest, listen to Solas. Check them out at www.Solasmusic.com too! Drop Deidre an email while your there, she loves a fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Direction","review":"I have been a fan of Solas from their begining and have been apprehensive every time they had a change in their line up. I ordered The Edge of Silence the day it was released and was disappointed the first time I listened to it. I have learned to listen to CD's several times before I make judgement and now I can't put it away. True, it is not traditional Irish, but the roots show. Solas is not a band that will never sound the same everytime but their talents will always be apparent. Georgia Lee is a song that has hit home with me. This CD has beatiful vocals, great arrangements and fine musicianship. Just don't expect the same Solas as their first CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Solas","review":"Yes this is a new direction for Solas. And frankly, I like it. Overall, it is a good album. Most of the material is strong; not every track, but certainly there is much to admire. I think that the transforming of Dylan's rock/shuffle \\"Dignity\\" into a Celtic-styled piece is particularly brilliant. Nick Drake's \\"Clothes of Sand\\" is a favorite. But, IMO the upbeat second track alone is worth the price of admission. I wholeheartedly recommend this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious, Yet Irritating","review":"I used to love Solas, back when they were a Celtic band with some nifty jazz influences.Now they're a jazz/pop/fusion band with occasional Irish ornamentation. They've kept their sound, but rebalanced it completely, drowning out the melody line. Their current material is heavily over-produced; many of the cuts are hard to tell apart. (And almost all the instrumentals are in a minor key, which gets droningly dull after a short time.)Save your money for Altan, or another band that still has some Celtic music in its soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing of value","review":"As with Runaway Dreidel, Ms Newman takes her inspiration for a Chanukah book from Xmas, not a good place to start writing a good quality book for Jewish children.

Mayor's books are really notable for their sense of place -- I can call up clear pictures of his over-grown millyards and sagging tenements every time I read one of his books.Mayor gets the people right too. Even though his is a cop's-eye view, the villians are not simply generic \\"bad guys.\\" They are individuals, with individual strengths, weakenesses and even talents.Mayor's books are procedurals with lots of procedure (he's a real-life Vermont constable) and now and then I lose track of a pawn or two in the bureaucratic chess game just because there are so many of them.

Later, after the student has mastered monkey style, he and his teacher go back to town to fight the gangster-- this fight is excellent, one of the best parts of the movie.This movie is one of the better Shaw Brothers movies I have seen, and it is especially interesting because it displays monkey style.

At first I wasn't sure if it was full size or not, it's smaller than a regulation hoop and I think that is a plus. I wanted a fun pool toy not an huge regulation hoop hanging over my pool. It's easy to put together and comes with a mini basketball. Once you fill the base with water there is plenty of weight to keep it grounded. Another reviewer said the bolts were starting to rust, that review was from 2009, the hoop I got came with stainless bolts and I have seen no traces of rust, maybe the stainless bolts are a new improvement.

Really enjoyed this, even though I am not a sports fan or sports \\"reader.\\" Can't wait for his next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Losing Season","review":"The book that I read was My Losing Season written by Pat Conroy. This book is a story about the author Pat Conroy. Pat was the starting point guard for the Citadel basketball team.As a kid Pat was raised by an abusive father who was a colonel in the marines. Pat overcame all of his problems and was a good player at Gonzaga High School. He received a scholarship for basketball at Citadel. There he was the point guard on his college team. His senior year he went through many ups and downs during the season. In the book Pat gives great detail of the games, almost making you feel like you're there. I didn't really like this book and I wouldn't recommend this book for anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pat Conroy should be a multimillionaire and has had his","review":"books made into movies. He doesn't like his coach. But, his coach seems to be a good guy who is dealing with a bunch of spoiled brats and Pat Conroy seems the most spoiled of all. I agree with the reviewer who said he won't read anymore Pat Conroy books. His themes are always the same and they are all self-pitying. He's become a one trick pony and I'm tired of the trick. Read his two first books and skip the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dribble, Dribble, Shoot","review":"If you love to read page after page of dribble, dribble, shoot, then you will love this book. If you are not interested in the details of basketball, then you better save your money. Pat Conroy has run out of steam and needs to put the subject of his father and basketball to rest. He has gone from an excellent writer to a sell-out looking to make a quick dollar on a book that could have been written on a piece of toilet paper. Sorry, but the facts are the facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and boring","review":"The review of My Losing Season in the New York Times Book Review gets this book absolutely right. That is, the book is just plain awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"For basketball fans only","review":"I own every book written by Conroy. However I am NOT a basketball fan. In My loosing season, Conroy writes play by play, names basketball players, basketball teams etc. Since I know nothing about basketball, it rings no bell and leaves me cold and unconcerned. There's a bit of the old Conroy and his life's struggles in this book but not much. And we never even get a glimpse of his teammates' characters, personalities or inner lives. We only read about what kind of game they played on which night and against whom. Conroy is so good at making us care about people by bringing us into their hearts and souls yet we finish the book without knowing (nor caring) about anybody on his team or in his life at the time. All in all, it makes for a very cold, overly technical and sadly boring read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sla-a-am Dunk!","review":"As a former basketball player who experienced a similar senior season, I was wowed by this book and all the eerily familiar scenes. Throw in the prose and insights by an author like Conroy, and you have a real winner. In addition of course this book has a lot more to say besides its focus on the world of hoops, and even someone who has never been enamored of the game will thoroughly enjoy this unforgettable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pat Conroy Plays Basketball on the Couch","review":"Mr. Conroy's story could be viewed in many different ways. I chose to see it as a story of someone who loved basketball and tried to honor his commitments despite an abusive parent and a dishonorable self-centered coach. If you do not choose to read it as the life of a young man who had a very strong work ethic and desperately wanted to succeed in life and in sports, then you might dwell on the psychology of an individual who seemed to be a masochistic martyr type. That person invited the abuse heaped on him by adult \\"role models\\" and women. It's more enjoyable, however, to read it as sports story in which the protagonist overcomes many obstacles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basketball with Pat Conroy","review":"I love Conroy's writing and have read many of his books. This is autobiographical, not fiction, as he details his years playing basketball for the Citadel. Much that he writes has been already written in his other books and he alludes to some of those books in this one. This book goes into much detail about some of the games--a working understanding of basketball details would probably make some parts clearer. And because this book touches on so many other incidents he has written about with more detail, there is a strong sense of deja vu throughout the book. I prefer to read his fiction--there is more character development and more sense of place. His writing and vocabulary is sparkling, but not so much in this book. Still, I like reading Pat Conroy's works."},{"rating":"2","title":"About life","review":"I am not a fan of basketball. But I found this book to be more than about the game of basketball...it is about life. I'm sure many people can see themselves in this book. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"losing season","review":"Pat Conroy has been a favorite of mine for years, so didn't expect to be disappointed when i order the book, but i also didn't expect to be absolutely overwhelmed with the insight and honesty found in these pages. Pat Conroy is a wordsmith beyond compare, this autobiography puts new meaning in all of his other works. Thank you Mr. Conroy!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hating your Father as Basketball","review":"Having been a college basketball player eons ago, I looked forward to this book. My mid-point, I was forcing my self to read it. In his previous books he tells us how much he hates his father. This book is just another chapter in that process. However, in the end, he tells us his father was revered when he died. Maybe there will be a new book telling us how much he loved his father.I liked the first part of the book, when basketball was a major part of his life. I had felt that once also. But I don't remember all that anquish over losing. Incidently, his college coach was tough, unyielding, and unfair. Conroy's father met his match!In the prologue, Conroy describes his many bouts with madness and that he had crazy spells during every novel he wrote. Well, this novel is another one, written by a crazy man."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most disappointing books from a author I cherish!","review":"I cannot believe that the man who wrote \\"Beach Music\\", \\"Prince of Tides\\", etc. could have written such a boring, repetitive, uninteresting book as this. How can anyone think that learning about every jump shot, basketball move, locker room ranting, past hurt (brought up so eloquently in prior books) could be of interest to anyone? Mr. Conroy, if you ever read this, please return to the man who can capture one's heart and intellect in a single sentence"},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre","review":"This book was mediocre at best. Self-serving at times, Introduced too many characters making it difficult to follow. Like most Conroy novels, reverts back to his abusive Father to try and liven story.I suspect he dramatized much of the story like Bissinger did in \\"Friday Night Lights\\"After this and the convoluted \\"Beach Music\\", I doubt I'll read another Conroy novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop the whining!!","review":"I have a message for Pat Conroy: STOP YOUR WHINING. I read the book on a recommendation from a friend - however, I wish had not wasted my time on it. Mr Conroy did a masterful job of weaving the story of his life into his expereinces at the Citadel. But, personally, I could not take his whining attitude - the tough plebe system at the Citadel, his \\"Great Santini\\" father, his demeaning basketball coach, the reaction from Citadel alumnists over his bashing of their school. This book seemed to infer that he was suffering some inhumane, life-long injustice. Give me a break!! I regret that Mr Conroy's reputation as a great writer and the publisher's willingness to support this project allowed the book to be published in the first place. For anyone paying attention to the rest of the world, this book is a crock...one word of advice for Pat Conroy: suck it up!! Alas, I think it's too late for Mr Conroy. One other note: You would never, ever see wrestler write a book like this!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Do not waste your time on this one. This over written, overly long book would have made a nice magazine article, but as a full-blown work it is much ado about nothing. There seems to be nothing here that sets this team apart from any other of the hundreds of teams every year at colleges all over the country. At the end of the book I did not care one bit about any of the players on the team including Conroy, whose insecurity and self-loathing throughout the book is almost unbearable. If you are looking for a \\"year in the life\\" basketball book, read \\"A Season on the BrinKk\\" by John Feinstein or \\"The Breaks of the Game\\" by David Halberstam. Both are far superior to this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like basketball, but this was too much","review":"This was my first Pat Conroy book, and the last. while I understand all of his books are memoirs of his abuse-riddled childhood, his endless, repetitive self-absorption eventually just wore me down. the first half of the book was engrossing, but the author gave enough signals how it was all to end. the second half was a real slog. boring! get over yourself, Conroy! I am so over you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet again, he writes a book that you can't put down!","review":"This author has a unique ability to capture people who are not readers. I cannot seem to get through two pages of a book without yawning, and by the third page the book is often laying on my chest with my eyes closed. Somehow Pat Conroy can capture his reader from beginning to end and leave you begging for more! This book is about sports, disappointment, insecurity, failure, success and rejection - which we have all felt. He manages to connect with such a broad range of people, from high school students to senior citizens, and all in between. I especially enjoy his writing since I am from the south and can understand some of what he went through. Well done on another great book, I am anxiously awaiting the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coaching 101","review":"Once you start reading Pat Conroy's autobiographical story, you'll find it hard to put it down.There is an underlying theme of family dysfunction from an abuser that sometimes makes you gasp. But the real lesson comes not from the fists of one abuser, but from the words from multiple abusers use that leave deeper scars than any fist could.Everyone who coaches-- especially kids -- should read this book and see how a bad coach can damage not only a team, but individual athletes who don't have the self-confidence to see beyond a coaches judgment.The book proves that winning may not come if you pit players against each other and can't make a team of a group of individuals. The athletically talented players and the mediocre players must gel to succeed as a team. Hopefully after reading this book, you'll never yell \\"Don't Shoot!\\" (or an equivalent, depending on the sport) to a player ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting mainly to himself","review":"Pat Conroy sets out to digest his college basketball career but quickly develops a case of literary diarrhea. The Prologue is interesting and Part 1 sets the tone of his story but the rest of the book is overstated, melodramatic, repetitious, and occasionally unbelievable. Taking the book at face value, I conclude that Mr. Conroy was a better basketball player than he is a writer. His real talent is as a narcissist. If you want to sample this book, I'd recommend you get it from the library, read the Prologue and Chapters 1, 2, and 30, and return the book. The rest adds almost nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE Conroy!","review":"While I love Conroy's style of writing and lyrical descriptions, this book was too much about sports for my taste. OK, that's the point about the book, but it was extremely enjoyable despite the sports theme. The stories and conclusions about friends are excellent. I loved \\"Beach Music\\", \\"The Great Santini\\", \\"The Water is Wide\\", etc. and am eagerly awaiting the next Conroy book. I recommend to all, especially for sports lovers, but also for the non-sports people, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Despite losing, Conroy scores","review":"Although I'm not a basketball player or even a sports fan, I couldn't put this book down. The book is really about the coming of age of a young man, as seen through the experience of an intense basketball season at a military academy. The writing is full of wonderful metaphors, and smooth and easy to read. The emotional journey--like other Conroy books--is intense. The difference here is that the experience is so real. He's describing real people, and the narrator is Conroy himself. The depiction of what goes on at The Citadel may shock you with its brutality. Its amazing that Conroy can recreate his senior year in college so clearly thirty years later. Thoroughly enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Good One!","review":"Pat Conroy is one of my favorite authors. I've worked down in the Charleston area and I'm familiar with the settings of most of his books.

Presents ideas in step by step form. With problems from a physics for physics majors class, the book does not start at the literal ground level for every problem.

This one does not cover calculus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely ok for the money","review":"Good enough for the money. You might get more from a college textbook, but you'll pay a hell of a lot more. My only caution: be careful on the digital editions. I got the Nook version (sorry, it was a gift, I'd rather have had it on Kindle), and and it looks like a crappy scan. There are a *lot* of errors and malformed characters. That's ok if you're already a pro, but if you're just some poor slob like me who's trying to teach himself physics, it doesn't take long to lose confidence in *any* of the answers you read.I hope that's not true for the Kindle version. A better alternative in the Schaum's series that I'd recommend over this one is the paperback \\"Schaum's 3,000 Solved Problems in Physics (Schaum's Outline Series)\\" by Alvin Halpern, Ph.

Don't believe it! By only the second chapter, the author assumes, without any real explanation, that you know what a euclidean field is and how continued fractions relate to matrices. The presentation strikes me as arrogant; there are far too many gaps to be filled in by the reader. Maybe I'm dumb, but I did somehow manage to stumble through MIT with 16 straight A's in my undergraduate math courses, and spent three years in graduate school studying number theory. The author should have taken more time to explain, and skipped a lot of the sideshows and self-promotion. If I could return this book I would. I give it a 3 only because the appendices are more fun than the main text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the faint-hearted","review":"Although the author comes over as arrogant, I am, after several years, warming to this book. With concentration and very careful reading I have found that much can be gained from it. It is humorous, witty and iconoclastic. Reading a page here and a paragraph there, I have learned what Mordell's theorem is, almost understood a single paragraph proof of the prime number theorem, and more maths besides.It is however heavy going and the lectures and notes are in a concentrated form. The cover says the book assumes only one year of university maths. I really doubt this is enough math for this book. So beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither recreational nor instructive","review":"I quite agree with the reviewer from Massachusetts.I bought this book in the hope that I could get enough (indices to the) information necessary to understand Wiles' proof of FLT contirbuted to Annals of Mathematics some ten years ago.The book has simply turned out to be junk for me: it does not provide any enlightenment as to the undestanding of the proof, nor does it offer any recreational delight (supposed? by Poorten himself.) As many reviewers have pointed out, \\"arrogance\\" is the exact word to describe the attitude of the authour.I too would like to have the money re-imbursed.The bottom line is, if you would like to understand the proof, do not buy this book but follow the \\"beaten path\\": study algebra, algebraic number theory, class field theory, modular forms and elliptic curves.

The movie was just fair, and is kind of corney of course. This has all the makings of a low-budget flick. The story is interesting, but not enough to warrant buying this DVD.

To start with, this is not made by Electrolux but by Eureka. They just bought the name. I bought this cleaner two years ago and after about 10 months the left wheel fell off, The wheel is held on by four roller bearings mounted on plastic axles. All four axles broke off. Took it in to get it repaired under warrenty. The repair shop just put it in a pile of the others they had and replaced it with a new one. Well, 10 months later, the left wheel fell off again with the same problem. Save your money.."},{"rating":"1","title":"faulty wheel design","review":"I purchased the oxy 3 in January 2006. Within a few months, the wheel broke off and I took it to the nearest service shop for repair. The repairman stated that this problem was very common and that he had replaced several wheels. Several months later, the new wheel broke off again, so I took it back for an additional repair. The opposite wheel has now broken off, so I will likely find a new vacuum to purchase.The product does clean carpet and hardwood well and it is very quiet, but it's obviously impractical to use with only one wheel!

When I took it to the repair shop, the gentleman told me it was the 2nd one he'd received that week with the wheel that had broken off. It is HEAVY, maneuvers poorly and is frankly a poorly designed machine that is grossly overpriced. I found out that the vacuum cleaner I'd purchased is actually a Eureka--the Eureka company had purchased\\" the Electrolux brand name--but it is NOT the real Electrolux.

Called my nearest authorized service center (1 1/2 hours away) as it was still under the Electrolux 1 year warranty. He said that this is common with this model and in fact said this will happen with \\"all of them\\".

Another month went by and they called and said Electrolux has been having this problem with these vacs and they will replace it. Six months went by and the repair shop called and said Electrolux would only replace it with a different model. I agreed and the thing they sent me is horrible. It is a commercial vacuum cleaner. Heavy, hard to handle, the cord is so heavy I can hardly lift it and it doesn't retract. Is is also ugly. I am so angry with this company I would never buy another one of their products.

The electronic height adjuster is stuck on the high settings (after only 6 month) so I can not vacuum my carpets. The manufacturer replaced it twice and after the third break would not help me. I tried to repair it on my own but they were no longer making the parts that were needed. The vacuum was not even 4 years old. It is pretty sad to own a vacuum that you can not use as a vacuum.

I had thought this was a record by the Japanese progressive-rock group, Mono, and was confused, to say the least, when I listened to it for the first time.Ironically enough however, I thoroughly enjoyed this album regardless. I had been a fan of Portishead and the genre for a good while before buying this, and I can certainly understand the comparisons that other reviewers have made. Very trip-hoppy at times, though some tracks have a more pop-like feel to them. Anyway, just read the other reviews for a better picture of this album. I've only had a couple listen-throughs anyway.

And this harshness does not come from the lack of creativity with the remixes, but more from the added cost of this CD overall; it's just not worth the money.The tracks you're gunning for are 3, 6, 8 and 9. The rest are mere hum-drum (ugly) harmonic experiments with neglect of the original vocals. I liked tracks 8 and 9 -they were remixed with a party-mood in mind. The Mr. Scruff Remix of Silicone (track 5) is okay.The Bonus CD is 10 tracks, 5 of which I liked, so my rating is 2.5 stars.

The Blue Angel flying details seem plausible enough, but that kind of plane isn't my specialty. I didn't have any trouble suspending my disbelief through most of the story.

They used the worms and the cards (just not the apple) along with some therapy putty for finger strengthening. So when I saw it online, I thought it would be a good purchase for her. For younger kids, it's good at teaching color matching, and it works on fine motor skills by pulling the worms out of the apple. My kids all like playing this game, and it's something they can do without much adult help. However the apple needs some work on the manufacturer's part. You're supposed to slide the lever, then something in the unit revolves making the worms pop up at different intervals. But the lever often sticks, and it's really noisy when it does go.

Better get the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Returned This DVD","review":"If you just want a tour of some metalsmith practices this might be interesting for you but those actually desiring to learn a technique like soldering or cutting this DVD offers nothing practical. Except for hammering on a piece of brass the DVD is very lacking in anything truly instructional. I was looking for an instructional DVD but was disappointed with what I got."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Metalsmith Too Basic","review":"The DVD only covers the very basics of metal smith skills. It is introductory and falls short of the expectation set up by the title, \\"The Complete Metalsmith\\". You will not be a Master Metalsmith after viewing this video as it is far from complete. I learnt more about soldering and metal work watching videos that were freely available online."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small business owner","review":"I reviewed the Viking claim that this SIMM was compatible with the OEM (HP) SIMM.I purchased the product, and installed the SIMM in my printer and it DID NOT work as advertised. The LaserJet 4 printer couldn't recognize the SIMM no matter which SIMM slot I used. Resetting the printer didn't help.Advise is to be very careful about purchasing SIMMs for HP printers. Many \\"compatible\\" product are not compatible at all. Problem is, with the small amount of money involved, and considering shipping, it's not worth returning the item.I can't trust Viking again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Boredom Machine","review":"I really wanted to read this book, when I first heard about it, but now I wish I never did. The story is okay, and could have made a good episode if it was filmed then, in the 60-s. Now it feels outdated. Also, it never should be a novel, but a short story, like those James Blish adaptations of original episodes.At least then, with the loss of some scenes, the ending could be more convincing (SPOILER: the characters discussed a biblical scene once in a place where Joy Machine must have heard them, and in the end Kirk described the SAME scene to convince the Machine to turn off).Lastly, I didn't like Mr. Gunn's style and it seemed to me he isn't very familiar with Trek universe. For example, Kirk said that he couldn't help the population of Timshel because of Prime Directive, although the planet is a member of Federation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boldly Going Where Everyone Has Gone Before","review":"Oh, no.It is hard to believe that such a big name as Theodore Sturgeon is partly responsible for this cliche-ridden soup. I don't think there was one single original idea in this book. Technology taking control over a planet? Why not rather make Captain Kirk rescue a planet whose inhabitants are going crazy because their internet connections have stopped working! Even that would be a change.The characters don't have any memorable personalities, and the Trek regulars could be replaced with anonymous paper dolls. A reader would not notice anything because he is already fast asleep.Don't waste your time with this joyless novel, not even if you otherwise have an obsession to possess all things Trek."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy it for a Laserjet 1100","review":"I guess you get what you pay for.

This is *not* the same as the HP C4137A DIMM module that HP specifies.(1 Star is being generous!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cherry raisins both good and bad","review":"I love cherries but hate raisins, and that is the one drawback of this product. There is a lingering raisin taste that hangs about the cherries like a grey pall. However! The chewy goodness and the cherry tartness far outweigh the small disadavantage of the raisiness. And...As I plowed through my first eight bags I was in terror of finding a pit. Fear of gnashing into a pit and breaking a tooth lingered, until one day I found one. I bit the pit, it didn't hurt, and all was fine. I've probably found three pit, or pit pieces, in fifteen bags. Fear not the pit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious","review":"Delicious sweet dark dried cherries.Not as juicy as I expected, and a lot of pits to watch out for.Love the little pkg for quality and portion control.Do they help with appetite control?Seemed to be a side effect I didnt expect when I would have them for a snack in afternoon and evening.Be nice if you had better control over so many pits included.

Personally, I do not believe that this is due to the fact that the fruit is organic and unsweetened for I purchase these types of products often.

You have to love the ingredients, 100% Organic cherries. NOTHING else! No added sugar etc. Cherries are a highly sprayed crop.

I will buy these again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasty -Nasty-Nasty------Don't waste your money!","review":"We eat a lot of dried cherries. I purchased these for the convenience of small individual bags. Well, the small bags were definitely convenient, but the cherries were awful. Another reviewer said they were tasteless. Would that they were! These tasted nasty. I don't believe they were spoiled, just bad tasting. I can't describe the flavor they had - metallic maybe. Also, there was no consistency. Some cherries were plump and juicy while others were shrivelled and hard. Some were red and some were white/tan. Don't be fooled by the discount. These are inedible at any price. I suggest Traverse Bay dried cherries. Amazon sells them in a 4 pound package for a very good price and those cherries are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOO YUMMY!","review":"These are so yummy that they do not last for the four servings that are recommended on the package!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love it but beware","review":"I love this bag, I have the smaller one too, lots of space, the option of one large inside compartment or two smaller compartments.

Robert Taylor and George Sanders at their finest. Elizabeth Taylor was never more beautiful. Wonderful supporting cast. A wonderful story. Downside is that this copy is less than pristine. King Solomon's Mines and Ivanhoe came out on the same day and I bought them both. King Solomon's Mines was a beautiful copy and would recommend you buying it if you are a film buff. Ivanhoe, on the other hand, is a good copy but not a great one. I am giving away the copy I bought here because it is only soso. Hopefully, MGM will issue this film at a later date made from a good print. The best I can give this copy is a B-. Its ok at best.

Two of the songs on the bootleg included Steve and I fell in love with not only his sense of humor, but his style, voice and emotion. \\"One Left Shoe\\" is an awesome album and may be compared to Jewel or Sarah McLachlan's albums, but we must remember that everyone has there own style of performing and although, you may not like Sarah's or Jewel's it's impossible not to like Steve's.

There are about 5 songs on this CD that I consider \\"A\\" quality. Usually I'm lucky if there are one or two. The rest is also very listenable. Poltz doesn't have the silky voice of, say, Chris Isaak, but the words and melodies on this CD make up for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ode to a Disposal","review":"The title of the album should speak for itself; traditionally, left personifies oddness and percularity. I would recommend this title--it would best describe the album: One Left The Room.Steve exemplifies an amazing talent of replicatng my kitchen disposal. With this said, this album would be great cracking eggs (Steve seems to like egges, as mentioned in \\"You were meant for me) and grinding coffee beans.If you have an acquired taste in this type of music (low, course, and raspy -- like one's voice gets after smoking a lot of cigarettes),-- and like an aquired taste in pork rinds, this is an album for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"$202.75 for a used 18% Grey Card ! ! ! ?","review":"There has got to be a mistake here or else I'm in the wrong line of work.$202.75 for a used 18% grey card?

While the packaging says \\"acoustic,\\" it does not specify that these are made for a steel-string acoustic guitar, not a classical one.

This is not the case. There is just less guitar on the no guitar tracks. So if you want to play along with a band that sounds just like Coldplay to learn their songs, this is good. But even better for that purpose--- the actual Coldplay CD's.The string by string tuning track is helpful, but that's what a tuner is for-- or just tune to a song.If you own the albums, I would reccommend just buying the full album tab books for Parachutes and Rush of Blood to the Head and playing along with the actual recordings."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOD PRODUCT!!

This book strikes me as uniformed about the culture he professes to be a part of. At times it is very close to even being insulting. It also slams the reader with true immaturity, and a great deal of fantasy. I suggest educating yourself with the true Cherokee story, not this nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much Jerry, not enough Cherokees","review":"I was deeply disappointed by this book. Jerry Ellis takes himself and his so-called \\"insights\\" waaaay too seriously. It is hard to accept his \\"link\\" with his Cherokee ancestors when he had the luxury of clean beds, fresh food, and freedom of choice. It is an insult to their suffering for him to compare his journey with theirs. This book is a \\"Blue Highways\\" wannabe that doesn't make it."},{"rating":"2","title":"tsa la gi we nah juh see yah","review":"ellis' account of retracing the trailof tears deserves praise for his courageand respect for his fortitude in completing his journey. his chronicle ofhardships encountered along the way weretouching yet are miniscule in comparisonto those who originally walked the trailwhere they cried. an inspiration to all who are descendants of our displaced cherokee ancestors and a challenge to each of us to retrace our own personalancestral footprints."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"This book has many serious errors in the problem sections of the chapters. The answers are many times incorrect, and there are no step-by-step explinations for the problems offered nor is there a solutions manual. Learning optics is tough enough without the book confusing and incorrect in many instances. Its hard to trust the book's answers. Our class and our professor have proved several instances of the answers being incorrect. While most of the answers are correct, some of them are not: enough that it keeps you wondering. The diagrams and explinations are sometimes hard to follow. For any professors that might consider this book for their students, I would tell you to find a better book - or get your money back! If I had to rely solely on this book, I would have given up. Luckly, our course offered another book, and the library had many other books that were much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I have read in a long time, or possibly ever","review":"I thought this book was mediocre for the beginning half. The characters were okay, and I read this book because I had nothing better to do with my time. As others have mentioned, the book took a really, really bad turn at the end. I am not really into anything that is slightly morbid, but this book was also just off-the-wall odd. I do not want give away the ending to those who wish to read the book, but honestly the ending made the book extremely unlikable and unrealistic. I am writing this months after I read the book, and am still angry at how awful this book was and that I actually spent time to read it. Clearly, there were better things that I could have done with my time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad ending!!","review":"This book was decent all the way through until it got to the end, which was just disgusting.

Up until the end this was an entertaining read, not great, but fun and with some luscious food writing; I'd have rated it 3 stars. But the end was so disgusting I could barely even skim it, never mind read it.

The only good thing about it was Jasmine March's food descriptions. That is it and even those weren't enough to carry me through the story.

Don't waste your time OR your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful","review":"This is the worst book I have read in a decade. The writing is amateurish; the plot is not believable; the story line wanders all over; the characters are stereotypes. The author states that she lived in Washington, DC, but she gets detail after detail about the city wrong. I am astounded that this book found a publisher. PLEASE don't waste your money. The book does go on (page after page) with descriptions of mouth-watering food (with one exception). If this is what you want, buy a cookbook. As a murder mystery, the only mystery is how this book got printed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What on earth?","review":"Boring. Boring.

It does not include any of his greatest hits, but I enjoy these songs just as much as \\"You Wear It Well\\" or \\"Reason To Believe.\\" The first two songs, \\"True Blue\\" and \\"Lost Paraguayos,\\" on Never a Dull Moment are pounding flames that brighten the day. Great choice for a novice Rod Stewart fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once upon a Time","review":"With Never a Dull moment, Rod starts from where he left off- every picture tells a story, and the result is stunning. More concise and lighter than his previous work, dull moment leaves behind a tight group of songs that stand the test of time. Though a lesser known album in the early canon, dull moment packs a punch right from the opening chords of true blue. Rod moves on easily through various styles and covers, from folk to straight ahead rock. Tracks like Los paraguayos and Italian girls are sure to please the uninitiated, as are the better known tracks. Classics like 'you wear it well' still sound great even after years of radio play. It is a rather short album, but well thought out and seems to touch every area of the listener's palate. Rod is a legend and dull moment demands to be revisted for its rightful place in musical history."},{"rating":"1","title":"the longer version is better","review":"this guy is great. bought his longer version of this subject a long time ago. listened to it so much that i wore the tapes out. it is a shame they have not caught up to the 21st century and published them on CD. seems like alot of publishers are still reluctant to do that for some reason. do they still manufacture cassette players? does anyone even still own a cassette player?"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I am very disappointed with the tapes.

So the large gap makes it so it doesn't do a very good job sucking things up.

Locally the sellers were looking to charge much higher prices than I paid here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special","review":"This heavy duty vacuum is not as heavy duty as it appears. The handle on this vacuum looks like chrome plated plastic, but it may be metal, since I don't want to break it to see. It allows for good suction and the wheels appear sturdy. The biggest complaint we have with it is that it doesn't have any brushes on it. It picks up loose stuff but doesn't brush and loosen the dirt or anything else that may be hugging the pool sides and bottom. My last cheap manual vacuum from Lowes had brushes and did a much better job. Unfortunately, Lowes manual vacuums didn't have brushes on them the last time I checked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design and choice of materials","review":"I ordered this because it looked to be a heavier duty product than the plastic ones. It is flawed by both poor design and choice of materials. When it arrived, one of the metal weights had detached from the plastic sweeper because the screw holding it down had pulled through the plastic. When I tried to remove one of the other weights, I pushed the screw through the plastic with only a light force. The problem is that the weights are secured by a single screw with a small heat which concentrates the force of the weight causing the flimsy plastic to fail. A better solution would have been to put a couple of screws in or at least a washer to distribute the force over a larger area."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does what promised","review":"The product is built well.It is a little bit deeper than I'd like it to be, but overall is very nice.The price is right. When I need a new one, I will order from them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-written, repulsive","review":"I almost stopped reading this book when one of the main characters went mad and began consuming his own excrement. If this doesn't put you off, perhaps you could overcome a natural revulsion and enjoy the author's excellent writing style. I couldn't. Be warned that this book does not end by giving the reader an uplifting feeling. The writing is powerful enough that you won't be able to forget it; personally, I sincerely regret that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short, but powerful and moving.","review":"Mr. Bones has been with his master, Willy G. Christmas, for seven years. In all that time they have never been apart; not even once. Mr. Bones can tell his days with his master are numbered. He can see it in how weak his master has become. He can hear it in the cough his master has developed, and he can smell it on his master.How better to get to know someone than through the eyes of their best friend, even if that best friend has four legs and fur? Through Mr. Bones, we get to know Willy G. Christmas and look back on the life he has led. I love a good character study and that's exactly what Timbuktu is. Not only do we get the story of Willy's life, we also get to know Mr. Bones and what his life has been like. This is a short book, but I found it quite powerful and moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an interesting look at humans from the outside","review":"I thought this novel was so engrossing in its ability to depict the human species from a dog's perspective....so fascinating to see the relationships that were fostered over the years and the dog's part in those stories while still remaining the observant outsider. The characters are developed so subtly and beautifully. Lovely read."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"After hearing a raving review on NPR and then reading the platitudes on Amazon.Com, this book was one of this year's biggest disappointments. Mr. Auster knows how to write, there's no doubt about that but his story tends to lag in places. When Mr. Bones was having dreams, why ever in the world did he have to totally rewrite, almost verbatium, the un-dream again? Being an animal lover, I was deeply disturbed with the ending. This book was definitely not my cup of tea. I would not recommend it to my reading group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweet sentimentality burdened by simple and cliched writing","review":"This book is half appealing and half annoying. Auster does not do any original writing and the first half is particularly cliche driven. Ultimately his character ( the dog) and it's situation are involving but the writing never reaches even a decent level of originality or insight."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Can Only Be Described As \\"Puppy Love\\"","review":"While, I have first editions of virtually everything written by Auster, I resent having wasted my money on this one. It's, at best, a literary exercise in point of view. Honestly, who cares what Auster thinks a dog thinks. The narrator and the human characters were both dull and uneventful."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book that barks but doesn't bite","review":"This is, by far, the worst book ever written by Paul Aster and (I hope) the worst he'll ever write. The question here is: What happened to the man who wrote \\"The Invention of Solitude\\" and \\"Leviathan\\" and the script of \\"Smoke\\"? Answer: I'm afraid he was found roaming the streets by Lulu's Bridge (another big ugh!) and put to sleep. \\"Timbuktu\\" is --literally-- a dog of a book. And, yes, without testicles!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like Paul Auster, avoid this book","review":"I'm deeply interested in Auster's books. I find them alluringly comical, inventive and deep. This particular book is (in comparison) shallow, conservative, simpleminded, goes nowhere and worst of all, does it in a way that is simply boring.I still believe in the author's ability to do terrific things, but this particular work makes one wonder if Auster is perhaps too busy doing other things and wrote this piece offhandedly in a couple of days. Or perhaps he has an 18 year old nephew who produced this work and Auster thought it would be interesting to put his name to it.Auster seems to have decided, deliberately (assuming it really is his book) to have as his heroes a lacklustre dog (whose view of the world is based so much on sight and seems to be all too human), an irritating and boring owner, and a rather grey world, the kind we see every day. That may be an interesting experiment, but the result is drab. It might still work as a short film though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass the Draino","review":"That's it. No more. Anyone ever read Ellison's 'A Boy And HisDog'. You want cerebral (as opposed to conceptual) there are a lot of brainy writers out there doing good, unusual work. JamesSallis is a lot better with his Long-Legged Fly stuff, as far as tec-riffs go. There was a painting won the Turner Prize in London a couple of years ago. The painting was a copy of a paperback cover for a Heinlein novel. The painting was of no value as a paperback cover, but became 'art' through a change in conception. Auster's been pulling this particular conjuring trick off for so long he must believe he's a real writer by now.A shame, when the real writers are out there, unread."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had never read Paul Auster but had heard good things about him. What an immense disappointment this book was. I almost always finish books, but I set this down halfway through and never picked it up again -- and it's only 192 pages!I don't know if Auster wrote this because he lost a bet or if he actually thought that a first person narrative from the POV of a dog was a good idea. It doesn't really matter; the end result is not interesting, not moving, and not worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"re: just awful","review":"I am a huge Paul Auster fan but this book was easily his worst novel. The usual Auster themes are either absent or not sufficiently developed, particulary his obsession with the mystical qualities of the universe."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Voice and the Cliches","review":"As a fan of Auster's works (I liked NY Trilogy, In the Country of Last Things, Moon Palace, Invention of Solitude, Hand to Mouth), I went into this book fearing the worst. A couple of friends told me it wasn't very good, and they were unfortunately correct.The two most detrimental factors that contributed to the failure of this book are as follows:1) The fairy-tale-esque narrator voice. Mostly it's condescending, and very quickly it becomes annoying. I don't know what Auster was thinking, choosing this particular narrative style. It just doesn't work.2) Cliches. There's so much lazy writing in this novel -- just start counting the number of cliches Auster uses. It's criminal."},{"rating":"1","title":"I threw it away to prevent anyone from reading","review":"After I was done with timbukto I felt worse off for having read the story. Rather then donate the book for someone else with different taste in books to find it I decided the best option would be destroy it so no one else would have to suffer.I found the story depressing, without meaning, and void of hope. Rather then continuing on with life you leave everyone behind and go out in the street and play in traffic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wannabe","review":"Paul Auster is a pretentious failed scenarist who writes for Sight & Sound and whose movies are an embarrassment, it's clear he regards the novel as a minor art form judging by his ability to write one. Like Normon Mailer & Gore Vidal and the other totems of the \\"litry\\" establishment who lust after Hollywood recognition they only manage to leave a bad smell behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Needs It?","review":"If your idea of a good read is being led down the path to a really sad ending, then this book is for you.First, I have to say I have never read any Auster before and I wouldn't have read this one if a friend hadn't insisted that I read it -- even knowing how I detest sad animal stories. She assured me that this wasn't sad. Wrong. Taken at its surface value, or taken as a metaphor for, say, life, it is deeply, deeply sad.The canine character is Mr. Bones, a sympathetic creation if ever there was one. He understands almost everything, is loyal and brave, endures the knowledge of his unattractiveness, and the pain of hunger and illness. At the end dies without self-pity or complaint. How's that for a jolly read? Anyone old enough to read this book knows that most animals have, undeservedly, an awful life. This book isn't entertainment -- it is torture."},{"rating":"1","title":"This dog thing didn't work.","review":"This reads as little more than a rough draft from start to finish. The stakes are low as can be. Don't get me wrong - I think Paul Auster's work can be so interesting, particularly The Invention Of Solitude, and his writing can be unsettling [not 'scary' unsettling, but 'I don't know up from down' unsettling].But this dog thing is wack. If this is your first time taking a peek at Paul Auster, skip that dog on the cover and go for the New York Trilogy or Invention Of Solitude.Dogs are cool, and dog interior monologues are cool, dog humor is cool, dogs who chill out with bums are cool - Timbuktu just isn't written very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"The language triumphs over all its other deficits.","review":"Why do I keep reading Paul Auster's books? Because despite the big disappointments in characters and how things turn out, his language just knocks me out. Some of it is just so delicious that I don't know if I could stand it if he actually maintained that level of virtuosity throughout a whole book. Although I couldn't stand how Timbuktu turned out, especially after Willy died, I did read it in one fell swoop. I do wish I hadn't bought it, though, but had checked it out from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"This books a dog","review":"The cover and premise are appealing and the driving sentiment is nice but the writing is surprisingly lame. This reads like a very young writers first attempt at breaking in to the bohemian ranks. Reread \\"On The Road\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well Intentioned, but Poorly Executed","review":"There is no question that Auster is a talented writer, but Timbuktu fails to add anything to his previous work. The word play is common and sometimes embarassingly obvious (as when the protagonist's owner turns Santa into Satan, or Dog into God), and much of the story feels improvised. In more than a few places you have to wonder if Auster knew where he was going at all. Still, much of the story is entertaining, and if you are able to get past the idea of a story told from inside the mind of a stray dog you may very well enjoy this book. For me it was a little bit predictable in its themes (there is more to life than material possessions among others) and felt front-heavy in its pacing.Bottom line: If you are new to Auster, read the New York Trilogy instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is very lightweight Paul Auster material.","review":"I read the Timbuktu reviews before buying the book, so I was prepared for a less-than-stellar Paul Auster novel. I wasn't disappointed. Timbuktu is superficial, marred by many cliche-riddled phrases. At times, the tone has the same sentimentality of a greeting card. The insights of the main character, Mr. Bones the dog, are interesting at times, but lack the profundity of the typical Auster protagonist. Mr. Bones' mentor, Willy G. Christmas, is boring, as are his rambling monologues. Aside from tepid interest in Mr. Bones, Timbuktu lacks characters to keep our interest. Because of the New York Trilogy, Leviathan and In the Country of Last Things, I remain a committed Auster fan. Here's hoping he regains top form for the next Millennium."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the Video","review":"This work is not a book, but rather a weakly written screenplay by an author that has abandoned the art of literature in favor of Hollywood-style movie imagery. Following the downward slide into silliness presaged in Mr. Vertigo, Auster delivers an unfunny and uninspired narrative about a thinking and talking dog, and the characters (no, caricatures) that inhabit his world. The author revisits some familiar ground (for example, detailed descriptions of people who are \\"down on their luck\\"), but with significantly less style and originality than his earlier works such as Moon Palace or the brilliant New York Trilogy. This quota-filler would be considered simply bad if delivered by any other author; coming from a waning talent like Auster, its also sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Strange than thoughtful","review":"Timbuktu is the first book I have read by Paul Auster. Other reviewers have read more of his work and have a good opinion of it. But based on this one book I doubt I will read any of the others. It is just too odd and makes you wonder what is the point. A man who has led a problematic life is about to die and he goes to Baltimore with his dog to find the high school teacher who encouraged him many years ago. He dies and the dog has some adventures. That is about it. The dog expresses himself and acts human-like. Maybe the point is that life is difficult and you have to watch out for yourself. At some 170 pages at least the book is short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book for a Short Read","review":"This is a short but lovely little novel about a dog who loses his master, a Schizophrenic homeless man. It is told from the dog's point of view. The dog, Mr. Bones, must learn to survive on his own after the death of his master/friend. The love the dog has for his master is true and beautiful. I must say that I wasn't sure of this little book when I saw it. It is much thinner than most of the books I read and well the premise sounded a little too much like a novel for middle school students but while it may appeal to that age group, it is very fitting for adults as well. I really enjoyed this book a lot. The perfect book for a quick read. I do wish it has been longer--I really wanted to know more about the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing and unfulfilling reading experience.","review":"As an avid reader of all types of literature, and a true dog lover, I was looking forward to reading this book. While I liked the author's writing style of letting the dog think, feel and occasionally, speak in human terms, a black cloud seemed to pervade every page. I finished the book in the futile belief, that I, and the characters, would eventually be fulfilled. Not in this book. This book is definitely not for a reader looking for satisfying entertainment. It is more a commentary on the misery of a man and his canine counterpart."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor Without His Clothes","review":"A terribly disappointing novel from an author who seems to have gone downhill recently -- afraid, perhaps, to confront his proper demons and opting, instead, to take on a vaguely \\"wonderland\\" mythology that rings extremely hollow. I was very very disappointed. But I will still buy the next Auster book. And will continue to, if only because there is always the possibility with this writer that the magical can occur."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dying gasp","review":"This is a sad book, not because the characters and events in the book are sad, but because it reads like the dying gasp of great writer who has run out of things to say. There is not one idea or emotion conveyed in this novel that Auster has not already shared with his readers in his previous work. The point of view of a dog is nothing more than a cute contrivance, and hardly a page goes by without some tedious cliche being applied to the existential condition. Such a shame, really, reading this novel, after such wonderful and innovative works as the New York Trilogy, The Music of Chance, and Moon Palace. Luckily I only paid a dollar for it at a clearance counter at a used book store. Little did I know that it was there for a reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"I continue to think about the book long finishing it.","review":"A very wonderful book for animal lovers. Auster, as the dog narrator, does a fantastic job of telling this dog's story. Mr. Bones simply accepts and deals with whatever sad hand is dealt to him. And he definitely falls on many hard times both before and after Willie's death. After reading Timbuktu, you will forever communicate with your dog on a more intelligent level! The monologues by Willie Christmas were usually long and boring. Just skip over them - there are the rantings of an idiot under-achiever. All of the people in the book are very real; you will know them all. Read Timbuktu - but take a Prozac before doing so."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Instruction Booklet of Sumatran Dance for Beginners","review":"Very brief overview of Indonesian dances and brief instruction on Tari Piring Sedang Lawas (dance with candles) from Minangkabau, Sumatra. Don't expect gorgeous photos and instructions on Balinese dances. If you already know well about the dance, it may help to dance. If you never see the dance, it would give some vague images of the dance. Instruction of wearing costumes (long Kebaya of Sumatra) might be some use. Poor printing qualities and illustrations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Find!","review":"I heard about this book while traveling in Kenya but didn't want to purchase it there and have to carry it home.

Easy to put together. Very beautifully constructed; however, by the end of the holiday season - the engine broke. Returned it and received a new product. The new product was also broken because it did not play the additional music cartridge with the Calliope Car. Also, as the train moves around the the track it is very LOUD and after a while gives you a headache. The remote works intermittently, in most cases - you need to be within 2-3 feet from the engine for it to work. We were disappointed and DO NOT recommend this product because of the surprising lack of quality and reliability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Under the Tree","review":"Love this train! It is large scale and very easy to place on the tracks (my four year old can do it). The animation is adorable and the music great (also received the Calliope car that added more songs). It does creak a bit . . . but this seems old fashioned to me. Seems durable -- I'm not afraid to let our kids touch it as long as they are respectful. There is a sound control button. This is a train for an energetic household--not what I would pick for setting up a romantic Christmas ambiance. It really is for the young at heart! This train will be a Christmas tradition in our energetic household for years and years to come. Exactly what we had hoped for! Tons of FUN."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice looking, sounds dismal. Not Lionel Quality","review":"I bought this train as a pre-sale special 5 months ago. It arrived this week to a very excited dad and son. Looking at it raised our expectations of Lionel quality. Once set up our hopes were dashed as the grinding gears and loud clicking of the contacts as they passed over the track joints. The train didn't seem to \\"roll\\" on the tracks as much as slide around. This clicking, sliding, metel to metal slide sounds destroy any ambience the train sounds try to generate. Every car truck has the spring loaded contacts which generate the majority of the sounds.VERY DISAPPOINTED, will not keep this set. Not what I expected from Lionel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Lionel quality, VERY loud","review":"This train is not of Grandpa's Lionel Quality of the old years.

Lionel replaced the controller, it still did not work, then the entire set. The second set arrived and out of the box did not work either.

I would not recommed this dissappointment to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"For neurotic moms only...","review":"Frankly I'm surprised at the high ratings this book received. I was given this book by my mother a few months after having my first child - and having nothing to read for a week at a family retreat ended up reading (most of) it. I found most of these \\"lessons\\" more than a bit silly and maybe applicable for a self-absorbed and neurotic mother. If you are the type that needs to make a list to remember to have a heart-to-heart with your partner - this book is for you. Otherwise, if you have the slightest bit of common sense when it comes to yourself, your child and your life - you certainly don't need this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Selfish parenting","review":"I only got a few chapters in and could go no further. I am a new mother and love and lucky enough to spend nearly every waking hour with my baby. It is easy to see why she only has one child. She seems to have a totally warped, painful sense of parenthood, it is kind of sad. She mainly talks about herself. The cover portrays that one may find silly, funny, or realistic antidotes about parenting of little ones, this is not what is in the book. It is pretty much the parable of the burning bush of parenthood, beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"She \\"gets\\" it","review":"I am loving your book!

A terrific book that's easy to pick up and read in spurts, which face it, is about all new moms and dads have during the early weeks and months!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book for over-privileged helicopter moms","review":"I was really excited to receive this book, having read that it would provide tips on how to be more contemplative during particularly challenging parenting moments. Once I started reading-& I forced myself to read the entire book-it seems more appropriate for moms who would love a book such as \\"Eat, Pray, Love.\\" That is, a mom looking for pseudo-spirituality in hopes that her yoga friends and play group moms clique will find her to have depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Professor Digitator likes it!","review":"A wonderful book from various magicians from aroung the world. From to coins to cards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"There are only two songs on this entire CD that I recommned: \\"8 Days of Christmas\\" and \\"Opera of the Bells.\\" 8 Days has a great dance beat, it just makes me wanna get up and dance! Opera shows off Destiny's Child's amazing vocal skills and harmony. The other songs do too, but their just not very good. The other songs I feel as if they're trying too hard to sound good. They should just sing naturally and it would be awesome. Don't buy this, it's only worth the two tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Their Weakest Moment Since Album One...","review":"...is sadly this Christmas release, 8 Days of Christmas. Overdone vocal gymnastics tarnish most of the Christmas classics on this festive album. The holiday single \\"8 Days of Christmas\\" is an upbeat bright spot that leads to some overworked vocals by the talented, but overused Beyonce Knowles. Two of the best tracks are the ones that give Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams a short shot at the spotlight, giving beautiful renditions of \\"Do You Hear What I Hear?\\" and \\"O Holy Night\\". Beyonce, though an extremely talented woman, seems to be the main fault of this album. Diva behavior like her taking a writing credit for \\"Silent Night\\", and her lovely but obviously overused voice that does no good to the afformentioned carol. Song titles switches and subliminal doll advertisements are icing on the cake. Though this release had so much potential, it gets a so-so three, for the few redeemable tracks available here in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bills, bills, bills Mr. and Mrs. Knowles?","review":"Anemic. Poorly arranged. Disappointing. Sold it on E-bay. How many vowels are there in the words peace, silent, and night Beyonce? Pick a note. Why is there this current trend to take a single vowel up and down the scale? Sounds like they are tuning a piano."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Destiny's Child's \\"The Writings on the Wall\\" is one of my favorite CDs so I was really looking forward to their Christmas album. I was extremly disappointed. The first three songs are not bad, light-hearted little Christmas tunes with a funky beat. Things start to go bad though when the girls sing their own songs solo. As a trio they sound great, individually they leave a lot to be desired. I am not trained musically, but I do have an ear for what sounds good and what doesn't. All the traditional songs on this album are terrible, which is unfortunate because Silent Night, O' Holy Night and Little Drummer Boy are some of my favorite Christmas songs. If they had just sang the songs like they were meant to be sang without all the vocal aerobatics, it wouldn't be so painful to listen to. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bills, Bills, Bills Mr. and Mrs. Knowles?","review":"Anemic. A very poor product riding on the succes of previous singles. I bought it and then sold it the next day on EBAY. Beyonce, how many vowels are in the words holy, silent, peace, and night? The current popular trend to ride a single vowel word like a harmonica is tedious and painful on the ears. Pick a note and hold it. I could understand if this were an attempt at Gospel music, but it is just screeching and so painful on the ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, No, No","review":"First, let me begin this review by letting everyone know that I am a fan of DC. I am not a \\"hater\\".I have to say that I was not pleased when I heard this cd. They're a wonderful trio. Each member is blessed with a beautiful voice; that's why I expected so much more out of this cd. \\"Silent Night\\" and \\"Opera of the Bells\\" are my favorite.....everything else is just plain horrible. I understand that they wanted(or maybe Beyonce) to jazz it up a little....update the classics for 2001 and beyond. Whatever the case, it didn't work out. I agree with the Amazon.com review. It seems as though this cd was \\"forced, chilled, and overdone\\". Their version of Donny Hathaway's \\"This Christmas\\" was just horrible. I really felt that had they stuck with the traditional arrangements of the songs, spice it up with a little DC flavor, it would have been a beautiful cd to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I bought it.","review":"I could not believe that anyone could ruin Christmas more than Scrooge but Destiny's Child Christmas CD has managed to do just that. The arrangement of the Christmas classic's are so bad that any attempt to sit through them made me long for the fast forward button on the CD player. Their voices have no harmony for the tempo. Had they done them in the manner they were meant it may have been a pleasurable CD. Instead I'm using it now as a coaster for my coffee table."},{"rating":"1","title":"The world's worst Christmas album by far","review":"This album stinks. The music is poorly, carelessly produced. The singing is lazy, self-indulgent, meandering, pretentious, aimless and pointless. Listen to \\"Little Drummer Boy\\" if you don't believe me.I find it hard to imagine the kind of music lover who would like this \\"music\\"?The album has its uses, however - it would make a great \\"room clearer\\" when guests tend to stay too long or when unwanted relatives overstay their welcome on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Maybe the album sounds profound when played backwards or if the listener is completely and utterly blind drunk."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Tired","review":"I'm tired of Beyonce's shrill whining. \\"Do You Hear What I Hear\\" is the only song worthy of a listen. Sorry, but gotta pass on this one!! Seems like this was thrown together to capitalize on their current popularity. Beyonce's mom, as fashion stylist is awesome; I watch the videos and TV appearances for that reason only."},{"rating":"1","title":"heirtothethrone","review":"DISAPPOINTING. I WOULDN'T WANT THIS CD IF IT WAS FREE! THE SONGS I LISTENED TO SUCKED AND THE SONGS THAT WE ALL ARE FAMILIAR WITH, DID NOT SOUND LIKE THE ORIGINAL VERSION-NOT EVEN CLOSE. I KNOW AN ARTIST IS SUPPOSED TO MAKE SONGS THEIR OWN, BUT THIS IS JUST TERRIBLE. THERE WAS TOO MUCH HIP-HOP IN THE SONGS. THE ARRANGEMENTS OF THE SONGS REALLY SUBTRACTED THE SPIRIT OF CHRISTMAS OUT OF THE SONGS. TOO MUCH VOCAL GYMNASTICS. THIS IS JUST TERRIBLE. I DON'T THINK IT DESERVES EVEN 1 STAR."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm..","review":"LOVE Beyonce and Destiny's Child, and had high hopes for this, but it really isn't up to their usual album standards..Maybe that's why this album isn't so well-known. Didn't love the production..Maybe it's just dated now. It definitely reflects how young in their career they were at the time! Nothing stood out to me, and if I'm not humming anything afterwards, that's always a bad sign. And Christmas albums are my fave..Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"great urban christmas album","review":"However, I felt the spirit of Christmas was lost in some of the songs.

This is absolute garbage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disapointment!","review":"I'll have to admit that, I have not been a listener of Destinys Child. I was watching them perform on NBC while they lit the tree in Rockefeller Center. I overheard them sing Opera of the Bells and was so totally revulsed by that performance that I had to see if the rest of their album was as horrible. It was. It is obvious that this group of performers is quite talented, although they take artistic creativity to a new low. This collection of Christmas music is by far the worst that I heard in some time."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE TELL ME THIS ISN'T DESTINY'S CHILD!!!!!","review":"OK, FIRST OFF I WANT TO TELL EVERYONE THAT I AM A DESTINY'S CHILD FAN, BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS ALBUM IS TERRIBLE!...I RECOMMEND CHRISTINA AGUILERA'S CHRISTMAS CD INSTEAD. I TOTALLY AGREE WITH THE EDITORS REVIEW; THIS ALBUM IS A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Destiny's Child take the \\"Christ\\" out of \\"Christmas.\\"","review":"If these songs are what Christmas is really all about, then maybe the Grinch isn't such a bad guy after all. Man, oh, man: this disc is pretty bad. These women erase the essence of Christmas (the birth of Christ, brotherhood, peace, joy, etc) and in its place sing ditties about crass materialism. That's right, as far as DC is concerned, it's all about the bling-bling--even during the holiday season. More to the point, these songs aren't sung very well. Beyonce is no doubt a talented vocalist (as are Michelle and Kelly), but she oversings every track. This showoffy vocal style is a common affliction amongst divas today. Just take ONE note and run with it! If you're looking for a true r&b holiday album, then get the old discs from Luther and Stephanie Mills or even SWV. This disc is just another lump of coal in the stocking."},{"rating":"1","title":"santa kill destiny child for me a review from kevin f","review":"all these songs suck i hate chirtmas now because destiny child broke my spirt theses girls really need singing lessons and they are really ugly in the cover"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album!","review":"8 days of christmas is a very good album. The vocals and music are all their own. It is very interesting when you have a style that's different. If I wanted to hear \\"silent night\\", \\"little drummer boy\\", or \\"the 12 days of christmas\\" in the traditional versions, I would have bought the original artists albums or recorded them off of the radio. DC did a great job on this CD. I especially love \\"silent night\\", \\"Opera of the bells\\", \\"spread a little love on christmas day\\", Heck I like all of them!!! The only thing that's missing is more songs! Great Job DC!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cringe-worthy!!!","review":"I do like Destiny's Child, but this album is soooooo bad.There is not a single feeling here that evokes anything from the Holiday times. Instead we have Beyonce taking over everything (as usual) lame modernizations of old,simple classics.Their harmonies are also very poor. I'm sorry, bur aren't good harmonies key for making a Christmas album mesh. If you want a good Christmas cd, get Christna Aguilera's \\"My Kind Of Christmas\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocking!","review":"Shocked! That's all I can say. I was shocked when I heard this CD.

This CD is further proof of how much talent this group possess... ZERO!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Style!!!!!!!!","review":"I'm sorry but this album was not what I expected.

I think DC have worn out their welcome and the X-mas spirit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely hideous","review":"This album encompasses everything that is wrong with today's culture--with crass, disgusting materialism outshining everything else on this horrid Christmas album. And I am actually a fan of Destiny's Child (and Beyonce). From the lame album cover to the hideous, hideous remakes of \\"Silent Night\\" (complete with vocal histrionics--WHY??? the title of the song has the world \\"silent\\" in it-get a clue) and the monstrous remake of \\"Little Drummer Boy\\" to the overt materialism of \\"8 Days of Christmas.\\" BAD BAD BAD. Beyonce prides herself on being a Christian, so...this is the kind of materialistic crap that would banish a soul to ETERNAL DAMNATION IN HELL. If you're looking for the spirit of Christmas...RUN! You won't find it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes","review":"I love Destiny's Child and songs like Lose My Breath, but for a Christmas album, this simply misses it.. Save your money and buy Merry Christmas by Mariah Carey and you'll see what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN INCREDIBLE CHRISTMAS ALBUM!","review":"This is an incredible step in the right direction for Destiny's Child. This album separates the group from any other pop or R&B artists. The vocal arrangements are beautiful, mind blowing, and are too difficult to try to compete with. This album shows the talent of all three ladies as well with each member having her own solo. \\"Opera of the Bells,\\" \\"Silent Night,\\" and \\"A DC Christmas Medley\\" stand out as the strongest songs on the album. This album displays the group's talents more than \\"Survivor\\" and may be their best album to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"what NOT to record for a christmas album","review":"This album is jokes, I love destiny's child but this CD is downright cheesy and was made just to capitalize on their popularity at the time with the survivor album. I suggest getting mariah carey's merry christmas or jackson 5's christmas album instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugggghh!!","review":"I can't believe DC is trying to pass this off as a Christmas album!! I mean come on, making a new album is one thing but to put it under the guise of a christmas album... tasteless! Don't waste your money... I didn't thank goodness, listen to the demo's and you'll see for yourself. I'd rather hear my dog belt out some tunes than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"8 Days Of Christmas CD MY OPINION","review":"I thought the new versions of the Christmas songs on the \\"8 days of Christmas\\" were really nice. I mean, sure they weren't like the other one's. But that is one of the reasons Destiny's Child is so cool! They come up with new, fresh, ideas. They ALL have beautiful voices in my opinion(no matter what other people think). My sister and I can't see how any one can't not like them. The CD is Awesome! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.P.S.I don't qualify the lyrics to the 8 days of Christmas song bragging at all. They wouldn't do something like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy it unless you hate yourself, and Christmas!","review":"Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse than \\"8 days of Christmas\\", along comes \\"Platinum bells\\", and the downright unbearable \\"Carol of the Bells\\" (so bad that I couldn't stop laughing through the entire song).Yikes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This album just (...)","review":"This is the most awful Christmas CD i've ever heard! It's just terrible. They absolutly butcher almost every Christmas song and the originals aren't that great either. The song 8 days of Christmas is is catchy and cute but the words are so dumb it's unbelievable. This Cd is so bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money!","review":"That Eight Days of Christmas track really says it all about this shallow,tacky, soul-less drivel. Also, I admire her, but Beyonce needs to stop working on blue jeans and become a better musician. You can always tell a song she's written because her melodies and choruses are limited to the same four repetetive notes. See if the 8 days doesn't sound just like Independent Woman. Seriously. Why is she afraid to use the whole scale?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, the humanity!!!!","review":"How is it possible to completely butcher tried and true Christmas classics? Well, let Destiny's Child take a shot. The word 'subtle' has never been associated with this group and this debacle is a perfect example. Hey Beyonce! Is it physically possible for you to sing a line of a song without having your voice fluctuate 20 times(this affliction also effects Christina Aguilera). She begins to sound like a wounded woodland creature at times. I defy you to sit through their version of Silent Night and not become totally and completely annoyed to the point of hurling the disc across the room. I did, I was just borrowing it though. Thank goodness that I did not waste any of my hard earned money on this nonsense, and you shouldn't either. There are some fine examples of current artists doing the classic Christmas songs, but this is certainly not one of them. Be afraid, be very afraid!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Destiny's Child- Hate this album!!!","review":"I've loved Destiny's Child sice their first album back in 1998. I still love them now- Michelle and Beyoncé's debut singles are excellent. But I can honestly say that this album is utter rubbish. I was mortified to hear how bad DC had done- why oh why did they release this dismal collection?Nothing's 100% original and it all sounds way too sugary and light. Perhaps if they'd done a gospel Christmas album it would of been better.The only song I kinda liked was the 8 Days of X-mas song, but it wasn't on the high standard of the songs on Survivor.I'm sorry to say IT'S NOT WORTH IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Will Review BH&G New Garden Book","review":"Can't say enough about the product and speed of service from GoodWill.

The pot itself is large and has an attractive stainless steel exterior and an EASY clean nonstick interior!!! Yes, the cord is short as previous reviewers noted, but not a problem for us as we used it at a kitchen island with a nearby outlet. But one could safely add an extension cord as the plug connects to the fondue pot magnetically (think Apple computer cord) and holds well, but will detach if inadvertently bumped or yanked.

Heat control settings dial in accurately, the non-stick surface on the inside of the pot makes clean-up a breeze, and the magnetic cord disconnect makes transferring the pot from countertop to dinner table (or even the living room floor if you really want to go 70's!) safe and easy. The stainless finish on the pot and chrome legs make it a smart-looking package, too.:-)Fondue rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought it as a housewarming gift","review":"I bought this as a house warming gift. One of the reasons why I chose this one amongst some other ones is because this one seems more practical and is decently priced. I was looking at this other fondue pot, but then I saw that you needed to buy fuel for it. This Cuisinart one is electric, so you don't need to buy anything extra to heat up the pot. Much more practical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a piece of junk","review":"As mentioned in other reviews, this item is both poorly designed and manufactured. The heating elements are non-linear in their function and heat only a small area of the very bottom of the thin aluminum pot. The sides of the pot only get warm while the base boils the cheese. Worse, the temperature difference encourages superheating of bottom fluid resulting in frequent eruptions of hot fluid being spewed from the pot. While the non-stick surface is a good idea, the metal forks will quickly score it and cause the Teflon to peel off-- a less than delicious food additive. It should have the kinds of plastic utensils usually used for non-stick cookware. While I have two other fine Cuisinart appliances, this one is just a piece of junk. We used it once and returned it-- thankfully Amazon has an excellent return policy and procedure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"Used this for the first time today.

We have now acquired 2 cuisinart cfp-3ss electric fondue pots because they are safer to use than the open flame heaters we have used in the past. We also found that they are more convenient as we no longer need to heat on the stove then move to the table as everything can be done at the table.The grand kids loved it although they loved to talk about the time a few years ago when the alcohol overflowed the heating container and grandpa had to carry the flaming pot to the kitchen sink where it was put out and the shower part of the sink was used to put out the fire on the floor where the burning alcohol had landed. Less exciting but still a wonderful time was had by all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuisinart Fondue Maker","review":"Bought as a Christmas gift for our 31 year old son.

Easy to control the heat and easy to clean. However, the heat settings on theCuisinart CFO-3SS Electric Fondue Makerrange from 1-8 and anything over 2 boiled the cheese. High heat is needed for cooking in oil, but we'll see if there's a low enough setting for chocolate.My BIG question is...where can I buy NON-SCRATCH FONDUE FORKS?? I heard some metal in contact with the non-stick surface and had to fight the urge to say, \\"Hey! Don't scratch my new fondue pot!\\" Anyway, bamboo skewers/chopsticks aren't really optimal for the purpose. Any ideas?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Confident Fondue-ing and Quick to use!","review":"I bought this the day of a New Years party and I loved how EASY it was to use! I read the short manual before heading to the party and prepped the pot. When we arrived I was able to melt the chocolate and ingredients right in the pot and it was ready in less than 5 minutes!The skewer rest works great and the temperature control is easy to use. I love the magnetic cord for safety. After seeing many varieties of candle-burning fondue pots I didn't like the risk of burning the fondue. I was impressed at the control I had adjusting the heat on this electrical pot and I was able to leave it on low which kept the chocolate dip-able throughout the evening. I'm actually looking forward to trying a broth or oil fondue recipe next which I was hesitant to try before. This was worth the extra money I spent and is a perfect kitchen gadget for a true chocolate-lover like myself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"so far so good","review":"Its tradition in our family to have fondue every christmas eve, so this being my first christmas eve away from home, I had to get a fondue pot.

Granted, I typically only use it about twice a year, so more usage would put more wear-and-tear on it. During out last move (military family) a piece of plastic on the temperature gage broke. I was delighted to learn that the Cuisinart website sells the individual parts and the one I need is only $18. That's why I decided to review this product. I've melted chocolate, and made tons of different cheese recipes. This is great for entertaining. I've had friends who used it to heat oil and then fry foods.I love that this product comes apart for easy storage in the back of my \\"seldom-used\\" cabinet in the kitchen. It sits back there with my waffle maker and my punch bowl, waiting patiently for me to remember how much I love it. :) Friends are always impressed when I bring this out, or when I take it to pot-luck dinners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, love, love this pot!!","review":"I have owned other fondue sets before, but I purchased this as my first electric pot a year and a half ago. I chose the Cuisinart after reading many reviews, and I am very glad I did. Yes, the cord is quite short (get an extension cord and place it where it won't be bumped... not hard), but the ability to control the temperature and keep it constant is a DREAM. I can do cheese fondue and keep it perfectly warm... no burning, clumping, or other problems... as well as meats in broth, which used to take forever. While we enjoy the slow pace of fondue and the opportunity to chat, cooking meats with sterno, etc. was a pain. Even chocolate stayed perfectly warm without overheating or underheating.I saw that someone else had mentioned their pot was not heating evenly; we haven't experienced that at all.I can't recommend this pot highly enough. I've told other friends about it, and they've purchased and loved theirs too. Get one. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff","review":"Thomas McGuane is a remarkably gifted writer and here he is at the top of his form. This book captures the beauty and the tragedy of the west, is full of characters who are real and pathetic and loveable and maddening. The territory of Western pathos and failed relationships covered briliantly by Richard Ford, but McGuane in this book brings a consistent over the top humor and sense of the ridiculous which distinguishes him sharply from Ford. Picaresque bar fights alternate with lyrical descriptions of the fishing streams of Montana, the protagonist's series of soulless affairs constrasts sharply with his desperate love for the wife who has left him. The book is fascinating, and beautiful, and terribly funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific stroll through a variety of American styles","review":"_Largo_ takes a simple, but lovely melody and shows how flexible it is when treated like blues, rock, ballad, and instrumental. Each song is independent, but family resemblances exist given the common parentage -- Dvorak's Largo motif. Especially haunting are the songs Cyndi Lauper and Joan Osborne each perform on. Another gem is the application of _The Star-Spangled Banner_ to the Largo theme at the beginning of \\"Medallion\\" before the switch into an original song. Great talents. Great creativity.

In \\"Concerto en ut majeur\\" (RV 558), Jean-Christophe Spinosi (do you know him and his ensemble \\"Matheus\\" (Naive)) was able to gave more surrealistic moments.

They don't care about little squeaky noise it makes when you get on it. We put it on one of our big chairs in a living room. They cuddle on it all the time, nothing seems to be more appealing for their rest now. It really picks up the warmth of the body and holds it. I think about getting something like that for my car seat, would be good for winter since my seats are not heated. Just have to find a right color. I didn't try to wash it yet, they use it for over a month and still looks clean, no odor. Our cats are on raw diet and they don't shed almost at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly Heats At All","review":"I was disappointed with this cushion and will definitely return it.

We have two outdoor cats and I thought this would be so neat to keep them warm in the winter. I ordered two. My cats were terrified of them because of the crinkling like noise they made every time one of the cats tried to approach them. We could not believe that anyone that knows anything about cats would not realize that cats or other animals would not fear a strange noise. We wanted them to work so badly but the cats would walk way around them to avoid them. We put one of the cats directly on the cushion hoping to persuade him. He fleed in terror. We just packaged it back up and sent it back.

Not only does the author (who happens to be German) make totally unnecessary (and very unprofessional!) side-swipes at the British Royal Navy in a book about the US Navy, but when it come down to specific ships I found the information sadly lacking. In one instance, for example, the \\"Service History\\" of one vessel was a mere 17 words. Not enough.In another instance we are advised to read certain magazine articles written by the author to compliment what appears in this book. The fact that those articles were in the German language and were, therefore, published in Germany leaves me somewhat perplexed.These publishers are a leading authority on books about Ships and Shipping and I felt let down by this book. Nevertheless, it is a useful list of most (though not all!) types of US Aircraft Carrier and in many ways I can see how it could well be a good place to start that all-important research.NM"},{"rating":"1","title":"are you kidding me?","review":"Dream Theatre they are not... not even close.

Prior to this release, Threshold established themselves as one of the leading bands in progressive metal. Here, however, they bowed to the dictates of fashion, producing a downbeat modern-metal album. On their earlier releases, Threshold's music was highly distinctive and original, with layers of heavy guitar and keyboards, and soaring vocal melodies. Here, they imitated the formula developed by other bands, with down-tuned guitars, sparser instrumentation and unrelentingly grim vocal lines. Similarly, on their earlier releases, Threshold's music was thoughtful, reflective and often quite uplifting. Here, they followed the cliché of creating an atmosphere of pervasive gloom and foreboding. By comparison, most of Threshold's other CDs are five-star releases. Recommended titles include their 1993 debut Wounded Land, along with the more recent Hypothetical, Critical Mass and Subsurface."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Prog Rock","review":"Wake up U.S... Like previously mentioned, Threshold is an enjoyable listen. The Quality of songs, singer, musicians are as good as it gets.

Thought I had picked up a Danielle Steele novel. Very predictable!! The only thing that was left out was the color of Mack's eyes. The plot was there, but it was not one of Ken's better books. Lizzie came across as a headstrong, too independent, spoiled, rich kid and Mack as her ever-faithful, always there (even in the strangest places), ridiculous hero. Makes for a quick read, but unfortunately not one that is memorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misspellings Don't Work for Me","review":"Loved the book, but was disappointed in the number (25) of misspellings and incorrect word usage.

There is nothing new hear except maybe the name, the plot is so predictable it is sad coming from such a good author. I knew how this book was going to end before it even started.

It's actually less than four hundred. The jacket also teased me with visions of a long epic spanning several decades, as Follett did so brilliantly with \\"The Pillars of the Earth,\\" or as in the style of Michener with any one of his books.As I ploughed through the pages, I kept waiting for a surprise situation to develop. As mentioned by other reviewers, the book is highly predictable, and contains a lot of flat action narrative that I guess is supposed to excite the reader. By the last twenty or so pages, the book had gotten ridiculous and I was skimming over it all just to get it over with.This book is totally forgettable.

His books are well researched historically and the reader can get insights regarding the period he writes about.whereas I thought that the feudal system belonged to the middle ages, I realised from the book that at least where coal miners in Scotland were concerned, the system carried through almost to modern times...There is in this book, as in most of Follet's books, a fair amount of coincidence and the excitement continues right up to the end.

So much so, that I immediately ordered another book of this authors which I am now reading and enjoying just as much. I consider \\"A Place Called Freedom\\" an excellent read.

Furthermore, the kindle edition is poorly edited with far too many typing errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Follett trophy!","review":"On the heels of \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" and a \\"Dangerous Fortune\\", I was somewhat skeptical that Follett could do it again, but he did!

The Pillars of the Earth, Eye of the Needle, and Dangerous Fortune stand out as by far his best.

As I read, I found that there was a lot of history regarding deportation of convicts from England to the colonies in the 1700's that I didn't know prior to this book. Follett is good at this type of historical background. I was sometimes surprised at the storyline; yet, at times it was somewhat predictable, with the backdrop of a Virginia tobacco plantation, and the familiar story of slaves and their treatment during that historical period. But all in all, this is one of Follett's shorter books and well worth the time. Follett also does a good job of discussing some of the arguments that ensued prior to the American Revolution and the division among the colonists who had to choose sides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historically and emotionally accurate novel.","review":"This book seems to be historically accurate as far as the history of England sending criminals over to the colonies.

The images this book gave me were incomplete, simplistic.The plot is poor, the situations created poor in design.The characters were false looking, trying to make something out of young men and women that does not make sense.All these chapters in America are badly plotted. You can already see the end coming.Selling a book with somebody's name (Ken Follett) is exactly what was done here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I could hardly put this book down.

Really good handbook!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE ONE \\" MUST HAVE\\" ROD STEWART ALBUM...","review":"If you could only have one Rod Stewart album, this would be the one to have. It is quintessential Rod Stewart: brash and raucous one minute, poignant and mournful another.This CD contains some terrific songs, and they run the gamut in feeling from the folksy \\"Maggie May\\" to the lyrical\\" Mandolin Wind\\" to the pure, motown/rock refrains of \\"I'm Losing You\\" . It also contains one of the greatest songs ever written by Tim Hardin \\"Reason To Believe\\". That alone, in and of itself, is reason enough to have this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN OPUS MAGNUM","review":"If Rod Stewart had carried on in this vein, he would have been bigger than Elvis now and with his credibility intact, like Springsteen, Tom Waits and the Rolling Stones. These songs are real gems, from the hard rocking Maggie May, Reason To Believe and That's Alright to the more folky numbers like Tomorrow Is A Long Time, Seems Like A Long Time and the deliciously sad but uplifting Mandolin Wind. A perfect blend of superb material and passionate delivery make this a classic rock album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rod Stewart tells a memorable story","review":"Easily one of the best \\"classic\\" rock records ever. I'd put it up there with Exile on Main Street, and that's pretty high. How can a rockin' song like \\"Every Picture Tells a Story\\" have such energy and with only acoustic guitars? Mick Waller, that's how. The drums on this record are so distinct and thank Rod for making them so prominent on the album. Ronnie Wood is equally stunning, playing guitars, mandolin and bass. Some of Rod's best singing ever, every song he interprets (of the 5 cover songs) in a way to make his own. Notable cover songs possibly better than the originals, \\"(I know) I'm Losing You,\\" \\"That's All Right,\\" \\"Tomorrow is a Long Time.\\" The rest of the early Rod Stewart albums, sprinkled with some great songs, pale in comparison to this gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rod's Best album is a Masterpiece - one of the best ever","review":"Rod Stewart / Every Picture Tells a Story: This is one of the greatest albums of all time. Every song here is magnificently done and each song fits together so well as an album that this release has rarely been equaled. This deserves a Sixth Star. This is Highly Recommended.I have the MFSL Gold disc (which is a great CD) but since that CD has become so ridiculously overpriced, you are much better off with this fine remastered CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"every picture tells a story, donut?","review":"This album just gets better each time I listen to it. Hard to believe Rod was once great, but he was and this album is proof.There are just so many great little moments on it, like in the title cut when Rod and Maggie Bell can't wait for the music to sing the line \\"look how wrong you can be\\". They are that into the song, and when was the last time you heard something like that on any album as of late?The real secret weapon on this disc is drummer Mick Waller, no disrespect to Ron Wood. He gets called a sloppy drummer a lot, but he brings so much life to these songs, especailly his thunderous playing on \\"I Know I'm Losing You\\".I have the Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab disc, and if you can find it, GET IT. The sound is unbelievable; you'd swear Rod and crew were right in front of you."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of Rod's Most Important Albums","review":"Every Picture Tells A Story is among the very best of 1970s rock. Rod's razor-like vocals tear up every song on the album and cut right through to your soul. This was definitely one album I'd played the grooves off of back when it first came out, I was relieved when it first came out on cd. It sounds as good today as it did back then. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much more than just \\"Maggie May\\"","review":"Quite honestly Rod Stewarts best and most complete album. From the moment the title track \\"punches in\\" to start the album...you know Rod is at his prime best. This album contains one of the best songs Rod ever penned, \\"Mandolin Wind\\" AND one of the best songs ever penned by anyone,\\"Reason To Believe\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rod \\"unplugged\\" - when it was not fashionable","review":"This album was released in mid-'71 amidst the heavy metal trend which dominated most of the early seventies (Purple, Sabbath, Zeppelin). Rod demonstrated an enormous amount of restraint and maturity for the time with the release of the almost fully acoustic \\"EPTAS\\" and, as a result, the album still holds up nicely after 27 years. In addition, the quality of the songs, original and borrowed, is first rate. Standouts include the title track, the ubiquitous \\"Maggie Mae\\", \\"Reason to believe\\" and \\"Mandolin Wind\\". The songs convey warmth and sincerity without being maudlin. Rod can be forgiven for his later descent into banality because of this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe his best...","review":"This album is maybe the best of all of Rod's releases. It's not pretentious, superflual, or light like some of Rod Stewart's records. This was the album that made me dig more into Rod's music and also into Jeff Beck's and Faces"},{"rating":"2","title":"Indeed, It Does","review":"Gene Santoro wrote that Rod's lyrics were \\"almost offhand, conversational, the kind of rambling talk you might overhear at the table in a bar.\\" That was this album - a good friend, talking to you over (maybe slightly too many) drinks. Folkie melancholy, rockin' and rollin' - with this album you were hanging with a bud. Rod was alternative when this was released - he had instruments that no one else was using, the songs were different, the mood was congenial. Why Rod can't do something like this again, from a different perspective, is still something I can't figure out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't it, don't it","review":"Great covers of Bob Dylan and Tim Hardin mixed w/ Rod Stewart originals and whiz bang, you have a seminal early 70's rock classic. The musicianship's great- thumping bass, clean guitar and a bit of cheesy keyboards fronting a great gravel-voiced Stewart and on occasion, wailing backups by the estimable Maggie Bell.This is is the one Rod Stewart disc you must have---what a shame that he turned into a clown."},{"rating":"2","title":"The right decision after 32 years","review":"The process of my decision making is very strange and ineffective. It took me 32 years to decide to buy this album, although I did know all the time how great it was. In all these years I bought numerous albums that are far inferior to this one. Is it because I didn't like - to put it mildly - Rod's musical achievements after the early seventies?Anyway, this album is really fantastic, as almost all the other reviewers agree. But I think it is not Rod's best album, 'A Nod's As Good As A Wink' that he recorded in the same year with The Faces is even better. The funny thing is that I bought that one immediately after its release in 1971..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rare beauty , amzing choreography , excellent cast.","review":"\\"Moon Warriors\\" is one in millions. Really. I don't know why it's not recognized as one of the greatest HK films ever made. Such gentle hand as Samo Hung's as a director is very seldom seen.

A memorable one , which you will come back to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe the Hype","review":"Moon Warriors was a huge disapointment. The story was terrible, the characters were uninteresting and the action was even worse. Don't let me even begin to start on the killer whale (filler)...

Positive reviewers of this movie are probably guys that have never seen a hong kong movie that they didn't like."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"I gave this movie 2 stars,one for cinematography and the other for nice scenery,other than that this movie hasn't got much to offer.I was dissapointed the most after reading all the reviews about the great swordplay fighting scenes(they were horrid)I don't know what the reviewers were comparring the fights to but after I saw a sword play movie like FIRE DRAGON(a.k.a THE FIREY DRAGON KID) this movie is like watching a bunch of children waving sticks around and calling it action.If you were one of those people who gave this a great review for action than check out FIRE DRAGON and edit your reviews on MOON WARRIORS down a couple stars later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moon Warriors","review":"This is a fine Swordplay movie directed by Sammo Hung. I enjoyed the movie because of its mix of action, romance and exotic locations and costumes. The fight sequences are fast moving and fun to watch. I especially enjoyed seeing Maggie Cheung in action. The romance in the movie is equally strong and adds an emotional element to the action sequences that is often missing from other movies. If you don't generally like action movies because all there is is fighting, you might like this movie. I listened to the Mandarin soundtrack, but spot checks on the Cantonese soundtrack showed that it might be marginally cleaner. The subtitles are white and part of the picture, so they can't be turned off. However they are very clear and I didn't notice any \\"polar bear in a snow storm\\" effects with the subtitles becoming unreadable. This is a movie I would recommend to action fans and superhero fans alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superbly entertaining! Action, laughs and plot!","review":"Great fun and super action. The story is a good traditional martial arts plot, but it unfolds in a colorful and fresh manner thanks to great sets and TRULY UNIQUE and LOVABLE charatcters.

I've tried pushing it and all that happens is a blue light on the back of the power supply turns on. No noticable difference in fan speed can be felt or heard.2) Tied in with number one, it could use a cable to hook to the mobo power fan connector so you can monitor the fan speed. At least I then might be able to figure out what the button does.1/31/2008 edit- Found a person in a forum online that says the Turbo Fan button doubles the fan speed.

Wiebe's complete lack of objectivity allows him to wantonly discredit movements which he sees as too radical or dangerous, as ineffective and laughably incomptent without citing any evidence to support his claims.

The author shows that the USA grew from a series of largely independent, mostly Protestant, small-town communities at the end of Reconstruction, to a more interlocked, diverse, and urbanized society by the end of the First World War. As the USA grew into the world's foremost power, diffuse forces arose to both lead and to give the changing society a sense of order. Those forces included industrialization, professionalism, scientific management, progressive reform, bureaucracy, and urbanization. In short, most elements of modern society. Not that this melding process was perfect - much division, racism, and inequality remained - but the melding process was a powerful and successful one.We studied this book in a college history class and it was one of the best we read; not as stiffly written as some histories and very informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"The End of the 19th Century","review":"This is a tremendous accounting of the end of the 19th Century.

It has a protective cage out front. I gave it four stars because it works great, except that if it's already on and you want to move it around, it would be easier if it had wheels on the base or a handle to really move it safely. I do feel warmer in the basement if I work in front of it, at least three feet away when it's turned on to the highest setting. I did this during a time when it was -4 outside and my basement was very chilly. I've only used one other portable heater, which is smaller, and this one works just as well, but reaches a larger area and has several other features such as anti-tipping and anti-freezing ability.

A space heater should really be inconspicuous; the less you notice it, the better. This heater is the size of the speakers in my living room.

Because they were so short, they did not brown properly on the top.The trouble shooting section was quite good, but it did not help the recipes in the book.I'd suggest Bread Machine Baking for All Seasons by Connie Merydith, if you can get it.

After staining I finished off the piece with 3 coats of Minwax Polycrilic Semigloss (using of course a synthetic bristle brush for that product). This stain did everything I could reasonably expect of it for the low cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great follow-up, a perfect album","review":"I enjoyed Chroma Key's first CD, Dead Air for Radio. I first heard it at a friend's house, and got hooked on the track \\"Untertow.\\" I was eagerly expecting Kevin's second album, and was not the least bit disappointed. I would say that is is in the same vein as of DAFR, but with a whole new different concept. Chroma Key is nothing similar to Dream Theater, and will appeal to a whole different crowd. I am so glad I found that band. If you are looking for a new listening experience, get that CDs. You can download their entire first album, and many track out of the second album on their website...By the way I am not at all affiliated to the band, but I thought you would be interested to know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtle and beyond original","review":"Most people probably know Kevin Moore as the ex-keyboard player and song writer for Dream Theater. Don't come to this album expecting progressive metal. Come expecting a unique musical experience.

Larry if you read this, write me please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly ahead of its time","review":"This was recorded back when synthesizer technology was in its infancy. A cursory listen today reveals that, unlike other early attempts at making synthezised classical music in a rock setting (e.g. Rick Wakeman, Beaver & Krause, and Bo Hansson), this has not dated a bit. It is a testimony to Larry Fast's wizardry with the keyboards that this masterpiece is still as moving as it was back in 1975.Essentially this is symphonic music performed entirely on electronic instruments. This is best appreciated with the headphones on. This should appeal both to lovers of modern classical music, and progressive rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"The original space music!","review":"I remember the first time I heard any of the Synergy music like it was yesterday. It was about 1975 and I was going to see Laserium at the Gates Planetarium in Denver CO for the first time. Blasting from the planetarium's huge JBL speakers in the ceiling was the track Relay Breakdown. The sound was so intense and dramatically, that I felt like I'd stepped into the future. There's nothing corny or contrived about this music. There're no \\"space\\" or special synthesizer \\"sounds\\". The title of the CD (album) was a declaration of the contents and a manifesto of what was to follow. ERFRO pushed the envelope of electronic music when it was released, and twenty years later it is still magnificent."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums I've ever bought.","review":"This album has more life in it than 99% of the others produced since recording began."},{"rating":"2","title":"Larry Fast is Synergy","review":"SynergyElectronic Realizations for Rock OrchestraInstrument: Moog Minimoog/Oberheim Expander Module/ Mellatron 400(with various control functions and signal processors)This surprisingly warm and beautiful album is a true classic in Music history.Highly Recommended.

So many miss the point with this music -- the important word in \\"rock orchestra\\" isn't rock. Larry Fast is a composer for orchestra. Okay, in this case it's a (one-man) orchestra of electronics but there's no better way to understand the music here. All the classical forms are here and the interplay of \\"instruments\\" is very much orchestral music. Yes, the analog sound is dated but so is the sound of a lot of music and that doesn't make it bad, well, not to my ears anyway.On this album Larry Fast was a man with something to say and he says it extremely well through his music. Truly a classic piece of electronic music in any era.

In his book, for instance, he speaks of visiting Halvorsens, an Australian boatbuilding firm, about what it would take to construct a giant wooden ship (Noah's Ark), and alleges that he got an \\"Are you crazy?\\" look. Using the same foolish reasoning, Plimer should visit a modern concrete-making firm and ask how it would be like to erect the pyramids using only hand tools. I doubt if they would be too thrilled with the prospect either. As for those reviewers, and Plimer himself, who fear alleged creationist political successes, they need not worry.

From Pouncey's Freudian explanations of human behavior to the character MacIver finally slipping away at the end, I was left with the feeling that this book could have easily passed as a rough draft for a great novel or could be the results of a creative writing class at a junior college.

For such a small book, it has the impact of a door stopper. Pouncey's language, his descriptions, his imagery is so clear and beautiful that I wanted to visit them all over again. Grief and rage is here - but so is love for people, love for life. A reviewer mentioned being bored by the WWI story. I can't imagine the book without that story and its characters.

Widowed and alone in his house on Cape Cod, historian Robert MacIver waits to die. To give himself a purpose, he writes a story about the trenches in WW1, interspersing his narrative with his own memories of WW2, those of his son in Vietnam, and his debt of love to his wife, a painter. Like the fictional MacIver, Pouncey is a born storyteller, with a vivid imagination, clear powers of description, and above all the ability to penetrate character; there are moments here that bring tears to the eyes. I am less sure of the book's construction. One reviewer described it as contrapuntal, and at its best it is. But I can't help feeling that the loose format, even the device of writing about the art of writing, may be a little self-indulgent, a therapy as much for its author as for its central character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Erroll Garner Jazz Ballads","review":"Wonderfulll !!!!!

You'll learn that it's NOT your fault he's not a Christian yet. This book helps me to realize the right ways to bring your spouse to Christ by being a good example yourself. Pushing him (or her) into going to church with you is more likely to create resentment towards Christianity and towards you.

The tube is flat instead of round making it low to the water. The backrest pushes you to the front of the tube making your legs hang way over. It sits so low in the water that the cup holders flood making them useless unless you like to drink river water. Water also floods the tops of the coolers leting water seep through the zippers melting your ice and making unuseable for drinks. Great concept...pathetic design!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not that great!","review":"I bought this tube after seeing it many times on a river where I tube a lot...I thought the coolers in the side and the storage space was really cool but I didn't like the tube at all and I'll tell you why. First off it sits way too low in the water you might as well just be down in the water and this is not fun when your in a cold spring fed river buuuurrrr! also, the tube lining fills up with water and if very heavy and hard to carry when you get out of the river. you have to deflate the tube in order to carry it. So that makes numerous trips down the river a big job! The cooler also is not very well insulated-Ice melts fast. now this is just my opinion, I gave this tube to my best friend and she loves it.

You're literally sitting on the water, there is no inflation where you sit, so its just a thin layer of material between you and the water, it might as well be an innertube with no bottom. We kept passing this tube around from person to person and laughing at whoever got stuck with it cause they would be freezing and so uncomfortable. Unless you're using this in a heated pool, skip it.

The end of the title is especially appropriate as Borntrager addresses the decline of the NYC and the machinations leading up to the ill-starred merger with the Pennsylvania Railroad.

Most books on Six Sigma are either technical (focusing on the tools and methodology) or are high level explanations of the basics of Six Sigma and descriptions of the wonderful impact it has on organizations. This is one of the few books I have found that focuses on the details of planning, organizing and managing a Six Sigma deployment. It is thorough and comprehensive. I led a corporate-wide Six Sigma deployment for a Fortune 1000 company and can confirm that the advice they provide is right on target.

Let's just say that I knew I was in trouble when I read the help section on the CD and it was talking about the SAT, not the LSAT.

You also had the rather intelligent approach to the lives of married couples, including the psychoanalysis, the \\"getting in touch with one's feelings,\\" and all the baggage that went along with it.In the end, like \\"Bob and Carol\\" or \\"10,\\" the protagonists decide that square dull married life is better after all, and they are the better for it. Along the way, however, get ready for some very adult laughs and a penetrating look at a certain strata of society during a very interesting time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A seminal jazz-funk album","review":"This is the best of Allison's blues piano and composition...and no one explored so much modernity while staying so deeply rooted.

And if the former reviewer knew anything about root blues and slow Jazz chops, he would understand this. Mose writes great comical lines, has an interestingvoice with great timing, has a sensitive piano style, reminisent of Amad Jamal, that came from being raised in the south surrounded by tons of black piano players. He has been schooled throughpout his life by many Jazz Giants and has influenced a ton musicians who have had the sensitivity and depth of understanding his root blues/jazz expression. 5 stars easily!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Mose Allison is not all that great. He's not stupid, but he doesn't exert his mind enough to make his ideas really interesting. He's not really jive, and he's not \\"whitey,\\" but he isn't much else either. His chops aren't too hot, to boot. I guess his appeal is that Pete Townshend of The Who finds himself cheering Mose's songwriting and recorded his \\"Blue Blues.\\". I don't figure. Anyway, his voice is humdrum, and his piano playing is not sharp. I dismiss him as being for freshman mentalities. I am reviewing disc one of the twofer \\"Mose Allison\\" by Mose Allison, which is the same as \\"Back Country Suite\\" (Sides 3 & 4 are his other '57 album, \\"Local Color\\".) I docked the album one star because of obscene liner notes by Mr. Townshend."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rare misfire from Leconte","review":"Le Parfum d'Yvonne is a rare misfire from Patrice Leconte that doesn't really work on any level. The main problem with this remembrance of love lost is the casting: Jean-Pierre Marielle is fine as the archetypal ageing queen and matchmaker-cum-chaperone, but neither Hippolyte Girardot or Sandra Majani bring much to the lovers, leaving us with fragments of a vague relationship between two people we don't care about. Not painful, but lacking purpose and capped off with an absurd ending that seems to be there simply to give the film an exclamation point.Second Sight's PAL UK DVD has no extras but does offera good subtitled transfer in the film's original 2.35:1 ratio."},{"rating":"2","title":"What 1984 is to politics, Doodah is to corporate life","review":"A brilliant, funny, horrifying book. Day by day, inch by inch, our unnamed narrator is sucked deeper and deeper into the corporate culture of his company. Bit by bit his individuality and morality are sucked away until in the end he becomes everything he loathes. I literally could not put it down after the half-way point.Given the growth of amoral corporate giants like Enron and Worldcom, it's more relevant than ever. Get it. Read it.

Surprisingly, the case is made of plastic, making the heater light for its size. This heater puts out a lot of heat, but it's focused near the floor, which is great for heating ankles and shins, but not much else. My biggest complaint about this heater is that it's NOISY. As the thermostat cycles the elements on and off, alternately heating up and cooling down the heater, it makes frequent LOUD popping and pinging noises. Adding to the cacophony is a built-in fan (not mentioned in the owner's manual or product description), which will only get louder as it ages (they all do). I haven't tested the humidifier yet; I may never use it. Unless you must have the humidifier, and can tolerate the noise, I don't recommend this heater. There are much quieter and cheaper alternatives available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great expectations, poor results","review":"I purchased this heater/humidifier to replace a tired unit of the same manufacturer.

His descriptions are so vivid that we experience what Charles LeBlanc is feeling -- both physically and emotionally -- as he seeks to clear himself of a heinous crime. The plot is cleverly conceived; the book, peopled by characters who are life-like in the detail with which Hoffman draws them. Hoffman displays a remarkable sense of place in his descriptions of the novel's settings, which range from Tidewater Virginia to the mountains of West Virginia. Always an imaginative story-teller, Hoffman has woven a story that plays out well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A finely crafted tale of honor and revenge","review":"This is the best I have read so far in 1998. If you like Edgar-winner Thomas Cook's mysterious memory poems, you will love William Hoffman's tale of vengence and deceit. Our hero is a loser, a cranky ex-con who stubborness masks a cunning sense of survival and ability to dope out friend from foe. When he is accused of planting the bomb that takes out most of his blood kin, the fear of incarceration forces our hero to take matters into his own hands. With language both poetic and powerful, Hoffman draws you into the dark, steep mountains of West Virginia toward a elegant solution to a horrible crime. This is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"good read.","review":"This book kind of reminds me of, The Fugitive. The underdog running from the law while trying to prove his innocence.

The first picture (not counting the inside cover shot of their famous toilets) is of The Ramones, and the last shot is of Handsome Dick of The Dictators. In between lies b&w photo after b&w photo of punk and New Wave in its infancy. If you were there this book will remind you of how it was.

With the exception of tracks 3 and 4, the tracks are boring and melodically insipid---and worst of all, have a mass-market radio sound to them.

Initially, the Master Opener worked beautifully: turn the handle 12 times, until you hear and feel the \\"click\\", then use the little tool on the side to lift the lid off. Wonderful. But with time and use it ceased to function. After a month, although the \\"click\\" still occurs, the lid does not detach, and I have to go through another cycle, and another - or give up and use a standard opener.

Or was it just my wistful imagination all along?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The very best of Dusty Springfield","review":"This CD was a waste of my money half the tracks are missing in the middle. Total rubbish is my review of the disc. A child of 5 could have made a better copy. What junk, a complete and utter rip off. I am totally disgusted with waiting 28 days for absolute garbage. I would ask for a full refund but could not be bothered with the hassle, probably have to wait another 28 blooming days for it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dusty, you were the best.","review":"Goodbye Dusty, we are going to miss you. This is a great record, with tons of beautifully over-produced songs on it. You were the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"The very best? of Dusty Springfield","review":"If this is the Very Best of Dusty then what it tells me that she had a couple of good songs which are on this CD. The rest sound like rehashing of the hot sellers. Dusty is a Great singer and I'm glad to reminisce about those days past. But the rest of the songs I surely don't remember on the hit parader back then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dusty","review":"This is pure Dusty Springfield - some of her best hits. It brings back those memories of carefree youth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dusty, a return to yesterday","review":"This cd was all I hoped it would be, taking me back to the days when I looked to dusty to sing my feelings for me in the songs she chose. Well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Collection of Dusty's Best","review":"The songs on this single album collection provide a perfect introduction to one of pop music's greatest voices. Includes her classic songs, I Only Want To Be With You, All Cried Out, Little By Little and the haunting The Look of Love. Anyone new to this great artist should also search out Dusty in Memphis... Listeners will find themselves hearing Dusty's incredible voice well after the CD stops spinning. Blue eye soul never sounded better then this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Book in the Field of Health and Diet","review":"I just finished reading this book and I literally could not put it down. Having read health books for over 30 years, I expected the usual rearrangement of things I already know. However, from the first page, this book drew me in and made sense of health and diet like nothing I have ever read. So now I am writing my very first book review and I am going to the store today to get what I need to eat for balance, energy and weight control. I have no doubt that it is the program that will work for me. Moreover, it seems so simple and do-able that I am excited to get started.The other thing I am going to do today is order a gift copy for each of my adult children so that their families can benefit from this valuable information. I want them to know how easily they can enhance their lives with healthy food as presented by Joshua Rosenthal and Tom Monte. Thank you, Mr. Rosenthal, for sharing your life's work in such an appealing and refreshing way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a powerful and effective plan for wellness","review":"This book combines solid research, practical advice and true insight. It is easy to read, yet very intuitive and powerful in its observations on what we need to be our best. As a certified health counselor, I have given it to clients and used it as a blueprint for my health program, all with consistant success. Not only will you reach your primary short term health goal, you will also create a lifestyle that reduces your chances of chronic illness and brings balance and self-understanding. Joshua Rosenthal is a true pioneer and genius in the field. His plan is creative and effective. No dogma. No extremes. He keeps it all within your reach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Young Inspired Reader","review":"After living with an eating disorder for several years, working with the pricples of this book provided me with a unique perspective as to investigating how my body and mind work together. I was able to drop so much dogma i had accumulated from trying to fit into media molds that weren't parrallel to who I am. This book created a mindset that allowed me to experiment with what works for me and what doesn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST LOVE SONG EVER WRITTEN","review":"this is a slow song that has a lot of body to it. This is a song that is great for couples, friends, and family. It's about a a guy that loves this girl very much and wants to tell her how he feels but doesn't know how to. In the end all he has to do is look at her and she knows what he has been trying to tell her all along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lite and not too smelly","review":"Like this version of an old product. Like the fact that it is Lite and does not have as strong a Smell as the original product. This product is helping to eliminate my excessive dry scalp and to reduce the amount of dandruff that I was developing. My hair is appearing healthier and seems to be growing again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy To Install","review":"I received the High Arch Faucet yesterday and installed it myself. The most difficult part of the process was removing the old faucet. I used the three hole installation with a fourth hole for the side sprayer. The instructions are clear and easy to follow. The hot and cold water are attached via flexible connection or a hard connection. It is your choice. The sprayer is attached via a snap connection which was very easy to attach. It took me less than an hour to install. As I said removing the old faucet was the difficult part. I have only been using it for one day but it I'm sure it will last a lifetime. It also looks nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not receive a 6 pack.","review":"Product description states \\"Pack of 6\\". I received ONE (1)item.

I bought them for fiddler crabs in a brackish tank. They'll occasionally drag pieces up on the \\"beach\\" to eat, but most often just pounce on the chunks under water. The crabs shed regularly as they grow on these wafers. As an added plus, all of my tropical fish like them too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haydn, The Seasons; Bohm, Janovitz, Schreier; 1998","review":"Listeners will enjoy the orchestra and solo sections, however, this is primarily a choral piece and as such this particular recording is most disappointing. Although the verbal articulation is excellent, the singing lacks the precision that Haydn's style demands, on several levels. The ensemble singing is \\"wavery\\" and rythmically messy throughout, with different choral sections entering either slightly ahead of \\"the beat\\" at many points, and slightly behind at others. One had the impression that either they were singing with their eyes on the notes rather than on the conductor, or that they had had too few rehearsals with the orchestra and soloists. The sopranos, particularly, sounded as if they were struggling to keep up with the pace. A logistical problem for choral singers using this CD for practice and home rehearsal, is that the numbers tabulated for the recording do not match those for all published scores."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Character Study","review":"This is a work to be carefully and reflectively read. The story itself is a simple one of a failed rescue attempt from a cavern. The various characters' lives which are written as sidelights to the main story are of what is of interest in the story. Unfortunately, to this reader at any rate, these rich characterazations are all too abruptly abandoned. Each one of these lost characters would be worthy of a novel in themselves. I feel as though the character Dorthy, for an example, is a well-developed character study but eventually is just left hanging. Worse yet, the main protagonist, Isaac, simply runs away. I found this to be most distressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dogs are People too was a great book","review":"Dogs are People too was a great book. Once started I could not put it down. The story is believable. Who hasn't thought their pet could talk to them. I can't wait for the sequel. Parents should take note and try not to force their children into the life they want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth [money] much less 10 times that amount","review":"The problem with this encyclopedia is that it is not encyclopedic in nature. Many topics are not covered (for example, you won't find Hatshepsut's mortuary temple in it), and those that are covered are handled in a very simplistic and abbreviated (not concise, just short) way.I cannot remember when I was so disappointed in a reference book...maybe never."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid & comprehensive reference","review":"This set is about as complete as can be found today. Some can and will argue specific gaps, discrepancies and/or minor points - all perhaps legitimately - but to hold as much information as these volumes have right in one place at any time, no other current compendium exists; especially considering these volumes' publication date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Book","review":"There is a problem here - there is an updated version of this book, available elsewhere, which (i) is longer, (ii)has more color photos, and (iii) is about 10% cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning for flat screen owners!","review":"I'll leave the content reviews to the many others here who have left their opinion.My pet peeve is that there is no warning that you've paid your hard earned money for a DVD in good faith to watch on your big screen TV at home, and then this picture comes on in HALF size. Where do they get off with this rip off? We've bought the largest screen we can afford to maximize our home theater experience and then we see a reduced size picture surrounded by blank screen.I would buy no DVD's with this shortchanging as a matter of principle alone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reality Bites","review":"And so does this piece of pretentious trash! Half-hearted plodding thru a directionless plot by has-beens and wannabe's. The music (what music?) was just as mindless. This movie had so much unleased potential that it was almost torture to watch. I gave it one star for the nice scenery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not my Téchiné préféré","review":"Wild Reeds and Htel des Amériques were wonderful films, but then Téchiné got repetitive, long-winded, and obsessed with Arabs, family discord and to a lesser degree, gays. Though influenced - he says - by Brecht and Ingmar Bergman, the man is obviously not as brilliant as either one of them. A good director, as far as I can see, keeps exploring new ground, expanding his vision and drawing on his imagination. Think of Kurosawa, Carné, Bertolucci... This particular film, despite great performances, is like a bad reality show segment... Lots of drama, endless discussion, plenty of hurt feelings and feelings of victimhood, and endless emotional dissection. The film lacks finesse, nuance or revelation. The plot is linear -- no flashbacks, no dreams, nothing to break up the dogged boredom. Some people like this kind of film. I thought it was trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"short, flat, too familiar. nice photos though","review":"although this full of sharp insights and vivid descriptions, this novella seems to consist only of the scaffolding that houellebecq has used in his other novels - grim, witty 'michel character!, character who is even worse off than michel, pornographic writing -without the depth that made them engaging. There are things to think about such as society's rights and wrongs in allowing sects and violence to flourish (well, not much violence but I couldn't avoid the pun). Overall, 'lanzarote' resembles 'whatever' more than it does 'atomised' or 'platform' in that it leaves you pensive (or confused) despite disappointingly little in terms of events."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Russian soul split wide open","review":"If you have been to Russia or not, this book will touch you in your heart. Edichka, a.k.a Eddie-Baby, is such an endearing character that you can love him even when he is robbing a stalovaya or participating in a gang rape. He is just that lovable. It is his child-like innocence that draws you to him and does not allow you to be repelled by his heinous acts. This book gave me the insight to Russian punk boys that had evaded me my whole time in Russia. If you are curious about what life in Russia is like through the eyes of Russia's youth or you are looking for a story showing the progression of an innocent boy to a more jaded young man, you must read this book! I hope it will inspire in you the empathy and understanding of these punk boys as it did in me. I loved every page!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now 2 is the best Now cd!","review":"I love the mix of sounds and genres on this cd. Every track except for track 11 by the Spice Girls.

Then, I heard about Now 2 and so I decided to get it. It is overall, a good CD. I recommend it to people who like pop music, which I don't like. This one is probably the most rock one of all 5. Now 3 is almost as good. Now 4 and Now 5 are too pop. Tracks 2-9 and 12,14,15,17, and 18 are my faves. All in all, this is a good CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Thing!","review":"This CD was pretty good,especially since I didn't have to go buy a bunch of albums for 1 good song on each of them. A few great ones here are \\"My Favorite Mistake\\", \\"You Get What You Give\\", and \\"The Sweetest Thing\\". \\"Because of You\\" definitely shouldn't be omitted! It's better than \\"Genie in a Bottle\\"! But some tracks on here were unheard of to me. I thought this was a collection of hits. The obscure ones could've been replaced with real hits like \\"She's so High\\" by Tal Bachman, \\"Higher\\" by Creed, or something. Overall the CD was cool,but put more hits on Now 4 and future compilations."},{"rating":"1","title":"i only rated it one because of sublime","review":"alright i'm a diehard sublime fan, and was so mad when they put them on this collection of teeny boppers and sellouts.sublime(i guess jay-z, but i don't like rap)are the only real band on this cd. stop putting sublime on with this bunch of no talent bands and their no brains fans. i don't want 12 year old girls saying they like sublime cause it was on the same album as britney spears(fake chest).it is just another example of people making money off brad. oh yeah they should have put a better song then what i got. sublime had a lot better songs then this.rip brad"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Of the Series","review":"NOW 2 is the flimsiest piece of filth in this musical series. If you have read my review of NOW 6, you will know that I am not a fan of the editing process. FIVE songs get this treatment! If I spend [money] for a CD, I expect to get what the artist recorded. On this CD, the artists featured didn't record much. Whose pea-brained idea was it to put Baz Luhrmann's idiotic \\"Everybody's Free\\" on it?? When I heard this in my car, I always turned to another station. Artists such as 98 Degrees, Semisonic,Robbie Williams, and the Backstreet Boys just add to the mess that is NOW 2. Only a few songs rise above the mess, such as \\"Never There\\" by Cake & \\"My Favorite Mistake\\" by Sheryl Crow. I'm glad the other CDs in the series are better (I think NOW 3 & 4 are the best of the bunch). I hope NOW 7 (which will be out soon, I'm sure)is better than NOW 2...it just reeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"More radio garbage","review":"Why does everyone think that just because songs are popular, they are good.

They shouldn't have made this third \\"Look Whose Talking.\\" It's not funny.....it's bad acting...and the only station that would even consider airing it is \\"The Super Station\\" Save your money, go buy the original two movies. At least they were some what cute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did they make a third one?","review":"Sorry for giving this movie one star but this third sequel has gone way too far. It talks about dogs who talk. They should've stopped at Look Who's Talking 2 instead of making this stupid movie, boy what a total rip off. Why can't they just call it \\"The Talking Dogs\\" instead of having it named Look Who's Talking Now. It's a good thing I waited for this movie to come on HBO instead of wasting my good money to see it in the theater. So if ya'll are planning to see this movie, DON'T!

This time around, the dogs are doing the talking. Voices of DeVito and Keaton add absolutely no humor or life to this faded series of films.See, now you've gone and destroyed my faith in Hollywood.

I've done parts of the first two, and have found inconsistencies beyond belief. There are questions with totally incorrect answers, there are typos all over the place, and they ask some of the most idiotic questions I've ever seen.

This is the pits."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't find a worse book than this","review":"This book's general coverage is too broad. It is not intended for GRE at all. And also there is so much maths work in it that we don't need to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Test Preparation","review":"Almost the entire content of this book is four \\"practice\\" Computer Science GRE exams.

Unfortunately I didn't read the reviews are even glance at the ranking and can only hope others might and save their dough.Typos, worthless and dumb questions, etc. You name a bad way to craft a test and REA did it. One horrible thing was how ambiguous the questions were. I went over 3 of the 4 test before throwing up my hands in disgust. I went over the 1st test in detail with a friend and we found that almost each question with many factors of the question ambiguous or assumptions (incorrect sometimes) that were not stated at all, let alone clearly.I recently took the real thing and this book did nothing outside of practicing picking A,B,C,D or E.A definite DO NOT BUY!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this book like the plague","review":"This book is absolutely horrible.

The so called \\"detailed\\" explanations are esoteric and vague. What makes for a good Computer Science GRE test prep book would be one that goes over the various topics and tries to cover the fundamental to intermediate concepts. This book does nothing of that nature as it simply lists four mock tests w/ brief descriptions to each question at the end of the test section. It seems like a few people got together one weekend and lumped together 300 or so questions from their lecture notes and then divided it by four tests to make a book. Completely useless book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If There's a Worse GRE Prep. Book I Haven't Found It!","review":"This book contains four \\"sample\\" GRE tests.

You can't knock a band because the singer has a Scottish accent. The band is Scottish! Personally, I quite enjoy the accent and think it adds a lot to the sound. So for anyone open minded enough to get over that, \\"Fourteen Autumns and Fifteen Winters\\" is a beautiful album. I first heard it yesterday, and have listened several more times since then.It's simple. If you like good music, you'll like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much of a connection","review":"It's not the vocals, or the lack of melody that mothered me. It was lack of connection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Groundskeeper Willie-esque","review":"I'm sorry, but I cannot get my head around lead singer James Graham's uncompromisingly thick Scottish accent. It's like listening to Groundskeeper Willie from The Simpsons. If it wasn't for his prominent voice, Fourteen Autumns & Fifteen Winters would almost certainly be a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below Mediocre","review":"This album is below mediocre, I wish I never took the time to listen to this rubbish. To buy this album is to buy nice looking coaster (because the album art doesn't offend me).If you care for my advice, do not waste the time buying this album or listening to it...This band might be something else live but they have nothing spectacular in this album. The only benefit in buying this album could be the possibility that it allows them to afford a few more music lessons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uneven but promising","review":"After hearing the first two stunning tracks of this CD for the first time, I started thinking this album might be the Next Best Thing...and it's not. Unfortunately, a couple songs follow that lack melody and aren't that fantastic. At times these guys make beautiful noise, and at other times, well, they just make noise. There's lots of room for improvement, but it's a very impressive debut. And I love the guy's voice! (Yes, I laughed at the Groundskeeper Willie crack below, and there's an element of truth to that, but he can't help having an accent for crying out loud! And I happen to love it and think it makes them sound unique.)At their best, these guys remind me a bit of the James album \\"Laid\\". And I wish they'd go just a bit more in that direction...slightly more melodic and less thrashy. I definitely look forward to hearing what these guys do next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Relative but still not any Good","review":"This movie is painfully artsy. It's very early 90s \\"My So Called Life\\" angst mixed with depression. Plus terrible amateur acting, and moments of unnecessary cliche cinematic affectations. I will probably watch this movie again, just because I relate. On the whole, though, not a good film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite missable- only if REALLY you have nothing else to do!","review":"I guess for its time this movie was really groundbreaking because it was the first film made by lesbians for lesbians. But seeing it now is just painful. Aside from Guin Turner, this movie boasts some of the scariest looking females I have ever seen. The dialogue is contrived and the acting is appalling. I mean I realize they had a really limited budget to work with or whatever, and kudos, but theres really no reason you should waste 2 hours of your life on this film. Get something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"quality acting, diverse themes","review":"A gay friend of mine dragged me (kicking and screaming, I might add) to this film. I'm not gay, but I still got a kick out of this film. It was not what I expected. Tender moments, scenes that make you think and scenes that make you double over in your chair from laughter.Definitely worthwhile seeing. An interesting black & white and often surreal view of a sub-culture within our American culture. An interesting & mind-provoking insight into what makes relationships work, regardless of your orientation. Is it looks, attitude, money?The film is not for kids... this film has nudity, adult themes and some domestic violence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great filmography, horrible acting","review":"I have watched many gay/lesbian films, and I have to say that this is the worst one I have seen so far. It does have some great indie cinematography, and it is not your traditional lesbian story (cute girl finding love where she least expects it... with a homely older woman). But I could not get passed the horrific acting. Guinevere Turner, who plays the lead as \\"Max\\" does well as an actress, but for the most part, the rest of the cast seems to have the acting skills of junior high students performing a play. Dialogue seems obviously scripted and memorized, which just makes it unbelievable and obnoxious. It was painful to watch. If you are just going to rent this movie at your local video store, then I suppose it is worth the three dollars, but if you are thinking about purchasing the DVD, save your money. Show Me Love, Gia, Better Than Chocolate, and If These Walls Could Talk, are much better choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"B&W with no entertainment...","review":"I only made it through 15 minutes of this movie before I decided this was not something I wanted to waste precious minutes of my life watching. It's B&W but there is no artistic reason for it to be filmed that way. The acting is horrible. The dialog ridiculous. The cover has a very nice picture... unfortunately that's the only good thing about this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"the trailer was pure propaganda...","review":"After I watched the trailer online... I HAD to see this movie. The black and white film... the gorgeous Guinivere Turner... I was shocked. Having trouble staying awake, while wanting to at least watch to movie all the way through... it's as if you're watching a first rehearsal of a play. Platonic lines and over-rated characters. I only liked the bizarre, eclectic bits and pieces between the scenes... really, it sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible acting--i swear someone made this in their basement","review":"The reason this movie was so highly acclaimed is because it has some touching moments, a controversial topic, and is funny at times. The idea of the movie is far better than the movie itself. And it has some of the worst acting and lines you've ever seen, and most of it looks like some poor schmuck had kids do this in his basement after giving them 5 minutes to memorize the whole script. And the budget for this movie had to be ultra cheap because the camera and sound quality are poor and even annoying at times. Reminds me of early John Waters films--but his are comedies and the poor quality makes them funnier. With Go Fish, it's just really, really bad. I watched it on cable years ago and my mom walked in and thought I was watching something my friends made up for fun. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatachable","review":"As a lesbian film, a straight film or just a film in general this is just unwatchable. I just dont get the fact this film won awards."},{"rating":"1","title":"has its place","review":"This film is alright as part of queer cinema history, but in and of itself is plagued by innumerable flaws. It is slow moving and boring. The constant skipping about makes it hard to follow. In general, it's just uninteresting and flat. There are many far better queer films out there, leave this one alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did they make this Movie ?","review":"What a pile of CRAP.I saw this movie when it first came out.I watched it twice because I thought Imust have missed something.I didn't !!!It is a self absorbed,self indulgent,BORING piece of crap .It looks like it was made by someonewho new nothing about a camera letalone camera angles.Then there's the idea that a woman shouldhit on another woman who she finds physicallyrepugnant and if she doesn't she should considerherself a superficial ,shallow person.I guess the author doesn't know the differencebetween friends and lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst","review":"Oh...My...God... This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I don't know much about lesbians but when I have my bicurious fantasies I would like to think of them as anything other than the women in this movie. You know, when I look at the box cover I just have to laugh at how easily I was duped by this ridiculous black and white spectacle. Believe me, none of the women in this movie look remotely like the girl on the cover and... I could go on and on. Overall, the movie was terrible, the plot was boring, the acting was ...ill, and just about everything bad you read in these reviews is probably true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Educational","review":"Go Fish, while small-budgeted, is a glimpse into the life of a group of five women in Chicago. The acting may be a little stiff in places and the movie may seem to move a little slow at times, but if you look beyond the surface, you find a deeply moving educational film about sexuality and the norms that are at times forced upon us. At the center, yes, this film is a traditional love story, yet it is so much more. This film depicts gender, identity, and the confusion we experiece in dealing with these personal issues. The black and white film approach emphasizes the restrictiveness of people in accepting difference. This is an important movie - watch it and keep an open mind while doing so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"Great, artsy film about lesbians and the troubles they have in finding love, keeping love, and being judged daily by their friends and family.

Terrible!","review":"Let me start by saying; Two weeks ago, I made a decision to learn as much as possible about lesbian lifestyle as possible through movies. To date I have purchase about 7 films, All pretty good, but this one scared me to be honest. I just did not get it. What this movie did for me is completely understand why professionals make movies instead of people that just might know something about the subject. Ugly; extremely! I don't think you could have depicted girls in any dimmer light. Scary!"},{"rating":"1","title":"twiddle your thumbs instead","review":"the thing about this movie is that it is bad. The only plot is that there are two women, and woohoo! They end up together! I bet you couldn't have guessed that! What the hell else are they going to do - they're lesbians! That is what we want to see! But the fact that there are no subplots, no... anything else to keep anyone watching is just pathetic. Just because it's old doesn't mean we have to hold on to it. Anyone could just as easily make a movie in black and white, have two women cut each other's nails, and it would probably be better because maybe it would waste less of my time. Now, don't get me wrong, I know that many people do like this movie. I don't know why. All I am saying is, if you want to watch it, rent it first. Actually, just rent something else. Go watch the L-word. That is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"For mature viewers only!","review":"I bought this for my 5-year old daughter because she wanted to learn how to play the card game \\"Go Fish\\" and I could not remember the rules.

My husband Randy and I watched it later hoping to spice up our love-life. But the woman are pretty bad looking and one does not even shave her legs. We re-gifted the DVD to our in-laws, there was nothing for us.

Gay or straight (or anyone else) don't waste your time on this vapid movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrid...horrid...horrid...","review":"There was nothing about this film I liked.

It's amateurish in every sense of the word. To describe the acting as cardboard would be to insult the charisma of shipping boxes. However, it's watchable despite its non-existent budget, condenscending script, and extremely untalented cast.The plot: Pretty Gwen Turner finds happiness with a woman who looks just like the \\"Stork\\" from \\"Animal House.\\"Word of warning to guys cruising the video store for lesbian soft porn: Do not be fooled by the cover of this video. It's not lesbian soft-porn, but a black-and-white, pseudo-art film. Also with the exception of Ms. Turner- the rest of the cast, all female, are extremely unattractive.

I'd proceed from here with details and well thought out reasons except that this movie was too boring to put that much effort into.All those characters and issues and what should have been interesting insights and even humor, and yet i found it extremely boring.

I think it was the smartest move I've made in my entire life because this movie turned out to be, not only the worst lesbian movie, but probably one of the worst movies ever made! The reviews I've seen for this movie are way too generous I must say. Believe me when I say that I am not a strict critic...I can be easily entertained by the corny ones. But this one could not be salvaged, and one star is much more than it deserves. The fact that is in black and white can be overlooked, but the bad acting, and pseudo-artistic scenes reminded me of a film made in middle school. Unfortunately, my girlfriend and I were unable to get through the first 30 mins, so I am unable to rate this movie wholly. All I can say is please rent it at least!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst lesbian movie I've ever seen","review":"My and girlfriend watched this movie and we hated it.

I agree!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bold and Vibrant --- von Otter captures soul","review":"The anonymous review is really a non-review. In fact, one wonders if it should even be posted --- seems a bit thin on content. In any event, I find this collection a brilliant sampling of this fine singer's work. What I particularly enjoyed was the sampling of Korngold --- this is a little known composer that really deserves more attention. von Otter's voice brings a deep richness and soul to the Korngold pieces. Furthermore, she has such a versatility in her colour --- from light, scurrying passages to deep, moody textures. Absolutely wonderful!Another interesting note is the CD packaging. It really is informative for those who want to better acquaint themselves with the \\"rare Diva\\".

So I do my research and if I can do it myself for a fraction of the cost then I go for it. The filters for my Honda were super easy to replace with the help of a You-Tube video. It took me maybe 20minutes but that is because my 2 yr old daughter wanted to help me out. And I like to let her, I figure she needs to learn how to do this kinda stuff anyways. lol.Anyhow if you are looking at saving money and getting a decent cabin air filter set (because not all come in a pack of 2)then this is the right item for you. We can already notice the better air flow/air quality in our Honda civic. It was easy for me to replace. And it saved us a good chunk of money. When I took my car in for an oil change they wanted to charge me $25 for the part & then another $25 for labor, this was not including the oil change! No thanks, I can do this myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"When all else fails... keep re-releasing the same material.","review":"Who needs another Greatest Hits/Best of compilation?

I was hoping to get a better sense of what decision making criteria were used to justify various investments and left severely disappointed.Where is the industry going? Again, no real insights here...As someone stated earlier, if I wanted a historical perspective on the VC industry or a who's who in the industry, there are many, many sources on the internet for this information.Try Ruth Ann Quindlan's book for better insights into the decision making that goes into dealmaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well made- kids love it!","review":"We just purchased this set for our pool.

But, I got paid, until the last invoice, which was never paid.The L.A. Times did a story on him, and all they could find was a fight in a bar, and a few other lower crimes. He never spent those days in the jail hole with rats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spare Yourself","review":"I don't know where all the 5-star reviews for this book originated from, but I guess everyone is entitled to their own particular opinion. For me, this book was a massive waste of time and paper. Sonny Gibson has been pretty convincingly exposed as a con-man and charlatan, so I suppose some of this might work as one man's self-aggrandizing fantasy of what he imagines the Mafia is like. (...) Most of it is just ridiculous and/or boring. If you want Mafia fantasy, stick with books like Puzo's \\"The Godfather.\\" Better yet, read a book that deals with the reality of organized crime, written by an author like Nicholas Pileggi or George Anastasia. What it comes down to, for me, is this- there are so many good books out there to read and only a limited number of hours in a lifetime to read them, so why subject yourself to works like this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"True Story ?","review":"I have since found that this story is a fraud. If you read it, it will become quite obvious that this is so. This story is obviously concocted. Annd who remembers dialog in such detail years later?

This novel, is the third installment of a trilogy about a traveling jazz band that is presented in letter form and has an off the wall weird mixture of music, myth, etymology, and surrealism. Unfortunately, for readers like me de-emphasis on story and character is always a serious handicap. It seems that Mackey is most interested with proving to his readers that he's an intellectual. Perhaps I just misunderstood this book, and maybe I would like it better if I read it again, but I just f ound it overly pretentious and ultimately unapproachable.

Claude Raines, who was hot in the 1930's (Invisible Man), was quite the eccentric mathematician in this low budget Italian attempt at star wars. A mix of both Italian and American actors produced some entertaining voice overs to keep it in english. The acting is pretty rigid and the military emphasis is rather stilted. The film was shot in color for the earth scenes but the shots of outer space are all black and white. However, once they reach the \\"Outsider\\" planet and enter into its core, some fairly interesting color schemes emerge. I only paid [$$] for this one. I guess you get what you pay for!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius of Claude Rains","review":"I saw this movie when I was much younger, and it's stuck in my mind as one of the best performances Claude Rains ever gave. (Another one worth searching for is \\"Crime Without Passion\\".) He plays a scientist-mystic involved in an alien encounter, a man who holds the earth and its population in contempt, but in the end is only too willing to sacrifice his own life for a glimpse of truth which he'll never be able to share. Unapologetically hostile, out-of-touch with his times, and surrounded by idiots (aren't we all?) he carries the film single-handedly. The purity of his character makes me forget all about the cheesy acting, bad color, and hokey special effects with which he finds himself surrounded. The \\"Outsider\\" theme song will haunt you, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battle to stay awake...","review":"Boring Italian flick dubbed into English starring the great Claude Rains as an eccentric scientist charged with saving the Earth from the mysterious \\"Outsider\\", a rogue planet full of flying saucers on a collision course with our own. Rains does his best to carry the picture, but he doesn't have much help. You would think such material wouldn't lend itself to boredom. Until the final scenes within the alien world, somehow the director and cast pull it off. Some accomplishment. The effects are fairly laughable, even by 1961 standards. For those wishing to see an Italian science fiction movie from this era with an engaing story and good acting, look no further than \\"Assignment: Outer Space\\".

His characters (particularly Charlie's Scottish father) are absolutely hilarious and deliver plenty of memorable one-liners.

Alan Arkin does a wonderful cameo, Phil Hartman is a riot and (I'm afraid I don't know her name) the actress who plays the mom is a joy to watch. In my opinion it's a cult classic. The wanna-be beat poetry is pretty good too. Is this Casablanca? Well, no--but it's dang entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie doesn't work after first time. :(","review":"So as a fan of this movie since it came out, I upgraded to have it on Blu-Ray and watch it in high definition on my 52\\" screen, as my old DVD is sorely dated.#1 0 special features, that really sucked, couldn't even put the trailer from the first DVD on there?#2 I can't get it to play again.

I can not imagine anyone not liking this movie. Buy it today!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious from beginning to end","review":"Mike Myers and cast did an outstanding job in this comedy. The appeal comes from Mike playing his own role and that of his dad as well.

I love this movie and give the movie five stars. However, this new re-release is NOT a special edition. There are no extras at all. Not even the trailer for the movie. It does offer several trailers for other movies and an anamorphic widescreen transfer, but that's nothing special and is standard on most DVDs. If this movie is a special or deluxe edition then every DVD is a special or deluxe edition and we need a new name for DVDs that include such things as audio commentary, documentaries, featurettes, still galleries and trailers. Calling this release of \\"So I Married an Axe Murderer\\" a special edition is false advertising and the marketing hustlers at Sony who are responsible for selling this hoax should be called on this and be held accountable.

The reason I give it 2 stars is that it contains Sixpence None The Richer's version of \\"Dancing Queen\\" instead of ABBA's. Sixpence None The Richer's version is fine, but not particularly inspired. It's a carbon copy of the original. What's the point?

Very warm and very very roomie!I would for sure recommend this sleeping bag for couples looking to do some camping in below freezing weather in close proximity to their vehicle.

If needed we could easily fit one of my little guys into it as well. The only reason I cant give it a 5 star rating is because of the weight. It is atleast 30 to 35 pounds. I originally bought this bag with the idea of using it for me and my wife backpacking instead of being confined into individual mummy bags but its just to big and heavy to fit into anykind of a backpack......we do plenty of regular camping though and will make great use of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Built for a Queen","review":"No one actually related to the size of this bag in standard terms. It is VERY close to a queen size bed in width and probably a little longer than a standard mattress. Perfect for two larger adults and a child and for more emergent situations could less comfortably accommodate 2 adults and 2 smaller children. The cushion is enough to sleep reasonably good without a pad underneath and this thing is super warm. Also dries quick from tent condensation do the synthetic liner (also stays cleaner than the flannel liner type) Don't be fooled though, even when compressed to the max its too large to be used as a trail bag.

On one occasion we have ended up with my 16yr old nephew in the bag as well when our tent started leaking. All three of us were able to be in the bag with it mostly zipped all the way. This bag was way worth the money!!!

This will deffinately hold 2 adults and a child.

The weather when we bought it was down in the range of the bag however by the time the camping weekend came around it was much warmer (low 70s at night) but the bag was excellent even at those temperatures by just unzipping the sides. It sat perfect on top of a queen sized air mattress and took away all the feeling of being on an air mattress and made it feel more like a real bed (a very comfy bed). The sleeping bag like others have stated is not hard to get back in the bag if you just start stuffing it in, getting started is the hardest part. I am looking forward to our next use of the bag and hope to get some cooler weather but it is definitely worth the money and the best sleeping bag I have owned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very warm and cozy!","review":"I do a lot of camping in very cold weather and I'm not exactly a tiny person. Neither is my husband. We both fit in this tent very comfortably being the size we are and in 22 degree weather we were VERY warm in this sleeping bag. It was well worth what we paid for it and then some. Before we got this sleeping bag, we didn't sleep well camping because it would be so cold we would shake all night, but this time other people came out of their tents saying they didn't get a good nights sleep because it was too cold. And we got good sleep!So, this sleeping bag is wide enough for bigger folk (200+) and warm enough for REALLY cold weather.Another cool feature it has is this piece that you can pull over your face and head if you want to, and it has this slight indention to where you can still breath, or tunnel as I call it. So your nose and mouth doesn't freeze."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful family sleeping bag","review":"This is a great sleeping bag if you don't mind the size and weight of it when it's packed up.My husband and I fit comfortably in it with room to toss and turn.

The only drawback of this bag is that it is huge: folding and putting it back to its carrying bag is a two person job, I did not even bother to do it at the camping site, just threw it in a car and then fought it in clean environment of my living room. I would not consider it for any backpacking: even when folded, it is huge and heavy. But when you take your family for camping by car, it is just awesome. It kept warm my two year old, my wife and myself sleeping in underwear while it was below 40F outside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm and cozy","review":"This sleeping bag is very warm and is a great size. We slept 2 adults (with a dog curled up in between us, on top of the sleeping bag) very comfortably. If one person gets hot they can unzip their side of the sleeping bag and not bother the other person, which is nice. The bag is very big, bigger than our queen-sized air mattress. The lining is very soft and comfortable. While we didn't test it in 0 degree weather. It was a chilly October night, around 40 degrees and I was nice and toasty.The bag is BIG though. As in, even in it's stuff sack it is huge, and heavy. This really is only for camping that you drive to the camping spot. I wouldn't want to lug it anywhere. Also, the only way to get it into its bag is to stuff it.

But, I have no doubts it will perform as anticipated. Being a lrge person, I have difficulty sleeping in a standard size bag. This bag has plenty of room to sprawl out in and I have no doubts that it will keep me plenty warm when camping.It's not for backpacking; way too big and heavy for any trekking.

Everytime I try to stuff it back into the bag I am sweating and panting by the end and have usually inserted my entire body into the bag to try to push it all down. It does not come with straps so you cannot roll it either. I have tried to find some straps but no success thus far.

Oh, it has this nice flannel lining that my wife finds to be especially snuggly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Warm Bag","review":"We bought this for a late December camping trip to Big Bend National Park. The average low temperature was probably mid to high 30s and this bag kept us really cozy. I shared it with my husband and two-year-old child and there was room for all of us, although it would have been more comfortable if we had a double mattress as well. We had two single mattresses (about six inches high), so someone inevitable fell into the middle. It was difficult to pack it back into the bag, but I appreciate that it's necessary to store it as compactly as possible. It takes up a lot of room in the car and in storage at home. I'm not sure how I'll wash it since it's so big, but overall we are very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't be happier","review":"My boyfriend and I use this on climbing trips for car camping. We spread out a crashpad, and put this on top. It's HUGE. It's so big, it fills up all the cracks and spaces in the car where there is no padding making it actually comfortable to sleep in the car.On top of that, it's warm. We spend a lot of time camping in the desert in Utah in the winter (where it's routinely 0 degrees at night), and we get too hot. Which is a nice change from thinking we're going to freeze to death.It does take up quite a bit of space, but we can get it back into the stuff sack with a minor struggle and compress it down a bit. For those of you who said you couldn't get it back into the sack: stop trying to fold and roll it. You have to stuff it in haphazardly starting with the bottom of the bag. You also have to shove, push, and stand on top of it like you're going to wear it, but it does go back in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising Title - Disappointing Treatment Of It","review":"On the surface this book held a promise of giving a balanced treatment of this subject.

The Egyptian priests that gave Solon that date (he passed the story on to Plato) also cited 11,200 BC as the date of their first dynasty. Spanuth puts it all together. The challenge with this book is not its intellect, it is a fascinating read, it is psychological. This is not what we want to find out about life on planet Earth.

After reading Trinny and Susannah's book \\"What Not to Wear,\\" I was determined to find stretch calf boots. And Rieker heeded my need--these boots are so incredibly comfortable. There's enough of a sole to feel like there is foot support, and while the shaft is flexible and stretchy enough to come up my calves and stay there, they are not so tight that they cut off circulation.

I read it (42 year old mom) to get a feel for what they are reading.The main character (a middle school girl) reminded me very much of my daughter - lots of drama. Gives a nice insight into that young brain we all used to have and the story resolves in a positive way.My daughter liked the style of the book -- written in letter (or email) form.

However, I would not call it a good book. The life of the main character, Rosa, is caught in a downward spiral until she reaches rock bottom and discovers that, in the end, she will always be alone, because everyone she cares about or loves will leave her or die. This is the MOST depressing book I've ever read. If you are clinically depressed or have ever had suicidal thoughts, you should stay away from this book. (This last comment is not intended for shock value -- I truly feel this way after reading the book.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I had read the author's second book, Pink Slip, first and loved it, so I eagerly anticipated this novel.

Ms. Ciresi has a knack for writing about the most gross of bodily functions ad nauseum. Thank goodness Pink Slip was an improvement over this book, and that I read this one after it.

I used a Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) meter to measure the water quality. Tap water said 260 ppm, and filtered water said 264 ppm.

He looks like he'd rather be sitting at home with his feet up in front of the fire.The extras are pretty cool too.

Men and Other Mammals tells the story of Scott Barron, a bestselling author and toast of London. His life couldn't be better - that is until his girlfriend leaves him and his third book doesn't reach the same success that his previous efforts had. To make matters worse, he's begun to envy his younger brother's life. Hasn't it always been the other way around? After all, Jes is a struggling writer with an average life. But Jes, unlike Scott, is happily married. Is love the one thing missing in Scott's life? There are some fun twists in the novel.I know critics have put lad-lit writers through the Nick Hornby test. (Oops, I've said it!) But Keeble has wit, insight and self-deprecating humor all his own. I for one look forward to his next effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful, hilarious and pithy","review":"This book made me laugh until I cried and even moved me to tears. 'Men and other mammals' seems to be the U.S. Hyperion title for 'My Fat Brother' by Penguin in the U.K. If you have ever wondered what London, fraternal love and life look like from the perspective of a 30ish (often drunk) British male, this book will give you some insight. Add a bum, a father who ran away, and a Gentoo penguin, wave the magic Keeble wand and voila - you have a wonderful tale. The story is written with sensitivity, warmth, lots of creativity and unquenchable humor. The pace is quick, the language uncomplicated and the story highly entertaining. The encounter with the penguin had me rolling on the floor. Despite the fact that I am neither 30ish, male, or British, I greatly enjoyed 'Men and Other Mammals' and look forward to Keeble's next book. I think you will enjoy it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-stick Stickers!","review":"I do not recommend this product.

Read his 600 pages and you will not be the better for it. You never get a sense of Chekhov the writer, or how Chekhov, the son of a failed grocer who beat his family daily, made himself into a man. Sure, other biographers are less frank about the sex -- but who cares, really? I recommend Henri Troyat's biography of Chekhov instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb biography!","review":"This is a book that grows and grows on the reader. At first I was put off by the book's clumsy style and by the brutality (really unforgivable) of Chekhov's father Pavel. Then I got \\"hooked\\" on Anton's fierce ambition joined to his extraordinary sweetness of temper; until, when he contracts TB and finally marries Olga Knipper, I was wholly sympathetic to him, his milieu, and his struggle to create masterpieces like THE CHERRY ORCHARD. A friend said of him, \\"Why are such precious contents locked up in such a frail vessel?\\" (p. 581). The author provides little interpretation of personalities and events; rather, he uses letters (thousands of them) to create, like a mosaic, the rich beauty of Chekhov's personality and the flowering of his genius. Highly recommended. -- Michael Squires, Ph.D."},{"rating":"1","title":"MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING","review":"If you really have nothing to do or nothing to read you may thumb through this thoughtlessly collected biographical information about one of the greatest Russian writers known for his brilliant sense of humor and innovative approach to dramatic genre. You will lose nothing except for your time and money. You will gain nothing, either: the entire book is much ado about nothing. I wonder what kind of ambitions drove the author to write about something for which he had no feel and no understanding. If he wanted to share his knowledge about the facts he consumed once he would better publish a bibliography instead.

I've tried to read this book twice now. It's lyrically written, and the premise is fascinating. However, each time I've tried to read it, I get a ways in and then find myself closing the book in annoyance. Maybe it's just me, and maybe I've been misreading it, but the split that results between Janey and (I've forgotten his name now) is based, in my mind, on a pretty weak fight. The split is obviously necessary to propel the story forward, but I found the reason for the split to be so juvenile and unbelievable, given these characters' depth and personalities, that, as stated before, I've tried and failed twice to read the book. I am however reading Moonheart and think it's wonderful, and fully plan on reading more of de Lint's books. Perhaps one day I'll be able to finish The Little Country.

In this book, Jeffrey and Naomi lead us on journeys into other worlds through their photos, stories and recipes.Even for a life-long rice eater, like me, the recipes provide new ideas. Sometimes I'm inspired to explore for new ingredients, an adventure within my own city. When I want comfort, I retreat to the familiar, maybe trying a new accompaniment. Other times, I use the book as a starting point, and do what cooks all over the world do, including the authors: work with what's on hand.The crisp black and white photos entertain and educate as good photo journalism will.

One of the previous reviewers who noted that nowheres near all of the recipes in this book actually _include_ rice was correct--they don't. But the authors talk in their introduction about how their book is meant to be a cookbook for those who eat rice at every meal--how you go home, start cooking rice, and then decide what to eat with it.

Must-try recipes include Thai sweet rice cakes and Chinese-style summer stir-fry (to eat with rice)."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favourite cookbook","review":"My family and I adore this book -- the information, the travel narratives, the photos, and of course the recipes.

Oxford doesn't have four teaching terms a year, the colleges don't award degrees, Exeter College isn't adjacent to Balliol...He doesn't even know that the pound sign precedes the amount.

Although there are some interesting \\"facts\\" in this book, it is largely not credible. I believe Grotta used questionable resources in compiling this biography which Tolkien himself refutes in many of his letters. i.e. Grotta writes of Tolkien's garage work shop on Sandfield Rd., which in \\"The Letters of...\\" Tolkien himself states that he \\"...had never written any literary matter in it...\\" and that the room was only used by his secretary. Grotta was clearly perturbed at his lack of \\"access\\" and seemed to want to portray one of the most prolific writers in history as a \\"lazy\\" individual.

The first impression is that the author did not really have anything new to contribute to an understanding of the life of Tolkien, instead relying on humorous anecdotes, rehashing of Tolkien's relationship with CS Lewis, and materials found elsewhere. The second impression is that the author bears a serious grudge against the Tolkien family for not permitting the access to family papers that was accorded to the authorized biographer, Humphrey Carpenter. This grudge is manifested in snide asides about Tolkien's literary executors. Finally, I must criticize the author for his excursus into the politics surrounding the Nigerian civil war. What this has to do with Tolkien is unclear at best.Money is far better spent on Humphrey Carpenter's biography, and his edition of letters (especially the letters). It is in the letters where the spirit and genius of Tolkien best comes through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glossy coffee table book","review":"This glossy coffee table book, with uncaptioned Hildebrandt illustrations in apparently random locations, provides interesting tidbits about the background of Tolkien's environment.

He makes consistent errors throughout the book with regard to Tolkien's world (such as mixing up Moria and Mordor and claiming Luthien is Thingol's sister), which leads me to wonder if he's even bothered to check up on his other facts. I get the impression that his critique of the Silmarillion is based on the reviews he's read and not having actually read the work himself. As others have noted, it's obvious he had some problems with Tolkien's survivors, as the venom towards them is apparent. Do yourself a favour and pass this one over for Humphrey Carpenter's authorised biography and The Letters of JRR Tolkien.

That means I sunk well over a thousand dollars for these three monitors and they've completely gone out, and it was too much to box up and send back for repairs for $250 + shipping each to manufacturer, only to have them go out again soon I'm sure.I WILL NEVER, AND I MEAN NEVER, BUY SCEPTRE BRAND MONITORS EVER AGAIN!!I don't mean to be harsh, but I sure feel this brand has been harsh on me, sorry folks."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book should scare the American Dietetic Association","review":"What a great book!

But nearby people of every country and nationality who had begun eating modern foods (preserved by canning, using white flour and sugar...) had developed serious health issues and had terrible dental problems.The photographs, in particular are striking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"valuable but old information","review":"The information presented on nutrition and physical degeneration was interesting, but old.

The plot was \\"tired\\", the Characters lacklustre and the villians were weak or non-existent. I think a better conclusion in Rage of a Demon King and let the series end there would have been better. I read this book hoping to be gripped by the usual twists and turns in the plot which is the hallmark of this great and talented author. What did we get? Not a lot. Nakor has great potential for a spin off series. he is a mysterious character and his life prior to his appearance in the Riftwar saga would I'm sure be of great interest to readers. If you compare this novel to the heavy weight \\"Empire\\" series which you just could'nt put down then it was very lightweight indeed. I do hope The author has'nt \\"lost it\\" because he can tell a riviting good yarn and of all the Fantasy writers I consider him to be one of the most talented."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is far below what i've come to expect from feist","review":"while it was definately a good solidly written fantasy novel the quality of this book is lacking"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story That Ends Too Early","review":"Shards Of A Broken Crown was quite a magnificent book in most ways!The way Feist builds up the story was really interesting.It was as if you were by Eric's side while he fought towards Hawk's Hollow and participated in the numerous arguments between Pug(very wise person) and the idiotic Prince Patrick(you really feel like punching the moron.He acts worse than a child sometimes.) Sometimes I really wonder how King Borric could have had such a stupid stupid son. Sighhhh! The royal line has definitely mellowed since Prince Arutha and King Lyam. Now those were REAL examples of how royalty should be. The one fault in this book(to me) is how the major battle (between Pug,Tomas ,Miranda and Nakor against the 'Dream' ) ended so simply.There just wasn't enough details on the creature and the Mad God. Still this book was quite marvelous and i now wait in anticipation of the DarkWar Saga books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointment","review":"i will never read feist again! his work on this series had started out with a bang and ended with a fizz...if anyone disagrees wih me, i would welcome a debate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done Raymond!","review":"An excellent end to the Serpentwar Saga....and enough to make up a whole new series. Hopefully, Pug, the new Black Sorceror will play a prominent role in the new series. A nice conclusion too, with new roles for Dash and the way open for Jimmy. Excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Could be improved","review":"The story plot has far extended itself with too many characters that leaves many with a superficial role. Take Jimmy and Dashel, surely there must be some compelling events to shape them to take on such diverging characters later on. The premature death of William and Arutha would be sorely missed. I just hope that Feist would stick to a manageable number of characters and develop them. Just in Magician, the character Kulgan was so well developed that his shadow still lingers in Pug's character in the later books."},{"rating":"1","title":"IM VERY DISSAPOINTED!!!!","review":"I havent read the book but judging by the comments... pug sleeping with Miranda? While Miranda is sleeping with Calis? We might as well also include the Jerry Springer show in the book. That doesnt seem at all like the Pug I knew in the earlier novels. The Pug I knew was kind and caring and cared for his wife Katala. But Miranda replacing Katala? please dont make me laugh. Pug is the powerfulest magician in the world and you would think he would be a wise man. But for him to snoop this low is truly degrading. I hope Raymost E.

Not the sorcerer gone pimp."},{"rating":"1","title":"FEIST PROVES THAT ONE CAN INDEED WRITE 4 F LOPS IN A ROW!","review":"ARGH!

Heroic people do heroic things then poof! Pug just tells everyone to go home. You get the impression that Feist had written as many words as needed to fulfil committment to publisher. The problem with creating supermen is that the acts of the people around them are meaningless. Very few authors can make superman anything but a comic book and Feist is no exception."},{"rating":"1","title":"Engaging story, very poor editing","review":"While the story was enjoyable, I had a real problem with the editing (or lack thereof). Not only were there a lot of typos throughout, (\\"then\\" instead of \\"than\\", \\"this women\\" instead of \\"this woman\\", etc.) Feist couldn't keep the characters straight. The brothers Jimmy and Dash had a surname \\"Jameson\\" in the previous books *AND* in the cast of characters in the front of this book. Then throughout this book the name was changed to \\"Jamison\\". In a scene late in the book, Jimmy was rushing back to Krondor to help hold against Kesh, but all of a sudden, it became Dash who was attacking the Keshian supply train. Dash was in the city!!! Also, Feist referred to Manfred (Erik von Darkmoor's half brother) as the one who raped Rosalyn and got her pregnant, but it was actually Stephan who did that!!! Feist needs to get better editors in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why ?","review":"...how do I feel after reading this book, pretty miserable, 'bout the same as the state of the characters and kingdom we have come to love.... I feel David Brin owes us another book to tidy up the horrible mess he has left everything in, and someone pleeeeease give the book a better cover !"},{"rating":"2","title":"I agree with Aaron from Sydney","review":"After developing such a high expectation from Feist, I must admit to finding his magic not being wove to the artistic endevour that he wove in earlier books. I think there seems to be too many characters and having to develop their characters too quicky, and from this a lack of identification with them. I find that this doesn't allow me to feel what the characters are feeling to the same level, and lowers the overall experience that Feist so ably offers. Nice story, needs that more of that Feist magic to be wove into it though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, no more books of \\"Midkemian Boredom\\"!","review":"I'm currently reading Faerie Tale, which our local library has just bought, and I'm really enjoying that novel, while the \\"Serpent War Silliness Series\\" is boring and confusing me.Here's an idea: Why doesn't Feist liscense (did I spell that right?) out his world of Midkemia to some some young and eager fantasy writer, who could perhaps show a little more enthusiasm and creativity for this potentially great fantasy world?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book !!!!!!","review":"This book is just great!!!! Although i hope that in the following saga more on the magician Pug and his wife !!!! Just hope that I would be informed of the next book if it comes out!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great succes","review":"Again I think Feist has written a great book. Though i feel he shouldn't always concentrate on the same time period. On the other hand he comes up with new ideas, for which he receives praise. All in all a great book, that also convinced me to buy his other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here. Seemed like a filler.","review":"I will admit that the three books of the Riftwar saga, are some of the most original and imaginative works out there today. The subsequent books, however, failed to live up to my expectations. \\"Shards of a Broken Crown\\" basically destroyed my interest in Feist's novels. It was, in a word, boring. The continual cleaning out of present characters to create room for new ones drove me insane all throughout the series especially because many of the new characters were boring and the good ones had very few parts in the story. There were no really evil characters. Some of the plot turns made me throw the book down in disgust. Is there no good that can happen to the characters? Does every one have to die or get totally screwed over? I can only handle so much dispair in a boring book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feist fumbles the end of a terrific series.","review":"Having been an avid reader of Feist for many years, I snatched up the last book of The Serpentwar Saga with fervor. Unfortunately, what started out as a wonderful series ended with a flop. The editing was so bad, the book read as if the author was tired of the series and just ready to finish it. The characters of Jimmy and Dash were not well fleshed out, and the battles were won too easily. Eric and Roo, the series' main characters, are not given much time, and Feist succeeds in killing off many of my favorite bit players. I loved the first book of the series, and wished that he had kept the same tone throughout. But Shards of a Broken Crown just does not measure up to the rest of Feist's books. I'm hoping that his next book is a step up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Was a great book beginning to end. Kept me wanting more. cannot wait for the next book or series!!!!

It is time for something new Ray, let Pug & friends find their rest now."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read, but not up to the quality expected of Feist","review":"The depth and texture of his characters set Feist apart from the rest of the fantasy field, so it's a shame that this last installment is so similar to the attempts of other fantasy writers. The characters are flat, and rarely have the engaging personalities that makes the riftwar series so compelling. Even current characters like Eric, Nakor and Roo that once carried the story are sideline participants so that this \\"epic\\" tale can be told. The scale of this story has become so large, and the cast of characters so confusing, that the personal nature of the story is lost in the attempt. Still, Feist is an excellent writer whose mediocre stories are better than 90% of the best submissions by others. Only Julian May can weave a better story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Midkemia/Serpent War Saga","review":"Like a lot of \\"Final\\" books in a series. There are so many loose ends to bring to conclusion; however Mr Feist does an extremely good of doing this. Without getting boring. This a book that will be read straight thru, as the action seldom falters from cover to cover. It does however, leave openings for further books which gives us Midkemia fans hope for a new saga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Praise for an outstanding author and his work","review":"Like most everyone who has commented on this author of magnificent fantasy sagas, I am in total agreement. His books are well written and totally engrossing. He started me off in the world of fanatasy novels. The only thing I have a complaint about is the wait for each novel to come out. It always seems like an eternity to wait for his next book, especially when you really want to know what happens next and find out that you have to wait another year or so. It's worth the wait though. I would recommend his work to everyone who has an interest in fantasy or not.

Her clothes are cute and she smells great!I bought this doll in particular because I thought the accessories would make it a better gift. Though the box was showy, I don't think the particular items - little blocks, a rattle, and a blanket - have gotten any use at all.

Well, while using the rocker, I about fell onto the floor when the back came apart. Now the chair has come apart in several sections, and it does not do any good to try to tighten the screws back down. This chair should be considered to be dangerous.

His clumsy narrative and cliché-ridden dialog are obstacles one would have had to overlook in order to enjoy what might have at least been an interesting story.It wasn't. Instead of a potentially involving drama about the problems of preparing for a trip to Mars, we're force-fed the all-too-familiar personal problems of a cast of predictable movie stereotypes.This book reaffirms the irrelevance of a book's \\"best-seller\\" status to its merit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected more","review":"The CD has a few good songs, but all of the songs sound the same.

For timba fans, this is a must-have featuring former Bamboleo singer Haila, with guest appearances from Paulito, Maito (Van Van) and Changuito. If you're new to Cuban music, you couldn't find a better place to start. You may find some of the songs familiar to you as most of them were popularized by Celia Cruz. But the arrangements go way beyond anything Celia ever did. Pure delight for anyone interested in the hot instrumental music being created in Cuba these days.Much credit is due to the arranger on this one. Not only does he manage the typical hard-hitting timba sound of contemporary Havana, but he also shows a very personal touch by bringing in some horn arrangements reminiscent of the Machito era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Que Bueno","review":"Haila is definitely on her way to become the next Queen of Salsa. I saw her yesterday in NY with Isaac Delgado and she was simply amazing. Her voice, beauty, stage presence and energy are all top notch.

Overall, it is a decent film without any break through performances. The movie is the story of Fausto, an orphan who becomes an apprentice to an established tailor. Fausto, however, has dreams of becoming a fashion designer, particulary for women. Fausto's friend in the film provides much of comical relief, and is the only character who seems to have any depth.If you have a couple of hours to waste and need a good laugh, then you may want to watch this film.

However, it was the internal, more subtle subject matters that brought me satisfaction and reading pleasure - and which I connected with ....I imagine other readers might find themselves also taking a moment to reflect upon themselves to imagine how THEY might relate (to the story line and the internal subject matter).So many funny one-liners and situations.

I sent in the dead 6315 and found out that it would cost $250.00 in addition to the $50.00 to fix. The reason was system failure. I wouldn't recommend this Ipaq to anyone unless you can get one (with accessories) for under $100.00. HP should test failed units for free, heck I paid over $500.00 for it and the accessories and I got two and a half years out of it.

The problems are literally too many to list completely, the phone locks up, the bluetooth connection is flakey, dialogue boxes don't always close, and the latest fun thing on mine was for it to continually try to get a GPRS connection. This latest issue required a hard reset to solve, erasing all the data on the machine (I was travelling at the time).So, unless you don't really need to use it as a phone, are prepared to do daily soft resets and regular hard resets, buy something else.Oh, and don't look for support from HP.

The entire tone of this book is helpful, he will section off the book as to an entire meal, including wine and dessert. Mostly his style of eating the food, savoring the wine and dessert (all complimenting each other) makes it simple. Most of the ingredients are found by anyone who is proficient in the kitchen. He captures the spirit of enjoyment in fine dining...something Americans need desperately!!!

Granted this early material is worth having, but not totally what I was expecting when I purchased this CD. Other than that, this shows what Quo was like when they first started playing the head-down power-chord boogie that they are now known for.

There is virtually NO odor from the litterbox anymore!With two cats, we were cleaning the Littermaid three times a week and it would have been better to do it every other day. Now, we only need to add a scoop of litter to the box every two or three days and change the bag every TWO weeks!!The only bad thing I can think of to say is that it makes the litterbox more prominent in the room as the littermaid and cabinet sits about 3' high. We live in an apartment.

I have a cat w/a potty issue (he liked to back up and potty in the tent and not the box, I believe aiming for the litter recepticle) that is now fixed.

I have been raving about it for years and even though I had it on vhs I waited until they were a little older to appreciate it when I knew it was going to be released on dvd.

In that one the criminals never seem out of control, and their calmness makes them more disturbing. Robert Shaw's performance is particularly chilling. Travolta is tightly wound and regularly explodes which becomes annoying. Denzel Washington is good as Garber but not as good as Walter Mathau. The earlier version also has a better plot.

This detracts from a decent movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Good Movie Totally Trashed by Hollywood","review":"If you don't mind the absolutely unregenerate language, you may like this movie.

I thought the plot was creative, and the twists were credible. There's quite a lot of violence, but I have seen worse. Well worth an evening.

It's truly style over substance. I mean really, John Travolta plays a psychopath, John Tutturo is an abrasive a-hole and Denzel Washington is mild mannered. How new and groundbreaking. Just incredibly inane. You should either read the book or watch the 1974 version, where although the only A-List actor in it (at the time) is Walter Mathauw, the supporting and character actors put on class performances where you really get the feel of NY Grit."},{"rating":"1","title":"highly successful at being utterly boring","review":"John Travolta's character shouting gets tired real soon.

The terrorists, led by John Travolta, want $10 million.Washington is calm and detached, but becomes decidedly more \\"attached\\" as the story progresses. Travolta plays a difficult character, who is a genius one second and a homicidal maniac the next. For Travolta, this just doesn't seem to work. There was just no role for Travolta's smile in this film, but you got a lot of it.And for a crime that was planned in such meticulous detail, the final getaway seemed very amateurish.HOWEVER, the action kept me wondering what was going to happen next. There was a very real tension throughout as I kept waiting for terrible things to happen. So if that was the director's goal, then the film was successful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't make sense","review":"Plot made no sense.

There was absolutely no tension and you really didn't care about any of the characters. Also, there's almost no action up until the very end, and then it's not what you'd expect. Most of the time the train is sitting still in a tunnel underground and the two main characters are just talking back and forth. I guess the closest thing I can think to this was the negotiator, but Travolta and Washington bring not even the tiniest bit of drama to the screen, unlike Spacey and Jackson who you really cared about by the end and their performances were award worthy. Also, you actually started to care about the hostages in the negotiator and Spacey and Jackson. Plus, there was 10 times the amount of action in the negotiator even though it took place on a single floor of an office building for most of the movie. You'd figure about a train that was hijacked would have more action but you'd be wrong. I would not recommend this to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"3, 2 & 1 Star Reviews Spot On","review":"Almost all the 3, 2, and 1 star reviews were fairly spot-on so I would add the following to their reviews:(1.) I would say that all the acting except for Travolta (for the most part) was insipid, scripted, unbelievable and forgettable.(2.) The directing and camera work captured your interest in the beginning but soon grew wearisome.(3.) Most of the movie resorted to the same old formulas: Such as car chases & crashes; speeding trains; gun waving hostage takers that use obscenities in place of acting.(4.) The only creative changes in this remake were a few techie toys (e.g. laptop).

Denzel Washington's talent is completely wasted, and I was horribly saddened to learn that it was scripted by the same sreenplay writer of LA Confidential and Mystic River??? Those are 2 modern classics, and some of the dialogue in this movie was just laughable. How many times can Travolta call the authorities motherf-ers? And 'Bunghole'???!

The new version is tedious, boring, with a lot of vulgar dialogs, and pretentious acting. Luis Guzman, who is one of my favorite character actors, is totally wasted in this film. The musical score is inappropriate and doesn't match the action scenes at all. Note that at the end of the film, a police officer gives Denzel Washington a Walther PPK pistol for his protection, which he puts in his coat pocket. Later on when Denzel Washington pulls out the pistol, it is totally a different handgun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Terrible","review":"(Spoilers, though there isn't much to spoil) I've not seen the original but this movie is just awful. Have you seen the previews? Oh, then you have seen the movie. Bad guy gets train, innocent bystander stops him and ends up hero in end.

There are no comparsion what so ever between the two movies they both great in their own rights. That was then this film is now. I am bit byious and gear more towards the new version of The Taking Of Phelam 123 for the mere fact that I had the opportunity to be in the film I played a Newyork cop towards the end of the film this was an forgetable expereience and it was a blast to work the great actor Denzel Washington .Purchase you cant go wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rated T for Torturous Travolta","review":"This movie should have been rated T for torturous.In the excellent 1974 thriller, the hijacker, magnificently played by Robert Shaw, barely raises his voice. Shaw created a deliciously mysterious villain. The wretched remake serves to showcase John Travolta's painfully annoying talent for reaching piercing decibel levels. Travolta's idea of dramatic effect is to assault the viewers with endless shouting. The entire film seems to be an assault on the viewers' senses. Denzel Washington's professionalism isn't enough to save this cinematic tsunami."},{"rating":"1","title":"pelham123","review":"I like the movie but when I went to redeem the digital copy it expired.Not to happy with that.I wish i can get another digital copy so I can download,that would make me happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better...","review":"Both Denzel and Travolta did good work, and it's not their fault that they are not Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw. So the problems fall to the Producer and Director. Why sandblast the original screenplay so bad? SPOILER: I really liked the Airborne hero bit, but why do you have to make Travolta a corrupt, racist and crazy Roman Catholic? Is there some secret club in Hollywood that requires you insult the faith (and from the looks of it, lose sales)of over a billion people on this planet? Couldn't he have just been a scary crook?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 on Blu-ray","review":"The movie is fantastic! It is so clear in Blu-ray that you feel like part of the action."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"Even disregarding the fact that I think the original production was superb, this remake was a *huge* disappointment. For starters, it seemed like every-other-word uttered by John Travolta's character was \\"f--k\\" (uh; slightly gratuitous?). Secondly, there was no fleshing out of the characters (including Travolta's) - and, in fact, the two hijackers who spoke some other (indistinguisable) language just seemed to be there as window dressing and there was no explanation of their connection to the others. For that matter, all of the passengers - except for the young guy with the laptop and the mother with a young son - were essentially irrelevant. There was also very little sense of NYC in this production and therefore it basically appeared to be a Hollywood stage set. The only moderately interesting character was Denzel Washington's (Walter Garber), but I wouldn't exactly call this one of his better roles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately Forgettable","review":"This version of Pelham did feature some interesting interaction between Travolta and Washington. The Blu-ray looked and sounded good, but the movie was missing something in script-writing. Maybe it was too much off-color language (replacing needed parts of the script)? I'm not sure, but only a few hours after watching it, I'm already starting to forget. Its probably worth a rental, but not a purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great action thriller","review":"The taking of pelham 123 is a great action thriller.Have not seen the original this remake has been done very wellby director tony scott.His vision is superb filmaking and photography having filmed entirely in New York.John Travolta played an excellent hijacker,his portrayel of his character is very cunning and chilling.Denzel Washington also played an outstanding hero type character, there were some humor in this movie i like about and the action was very good.I would recommend this film to anyone who loves action suspense comedy.THANK YOU"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a quick movie...","review":"The movie starts out fast paced and you kinda have to figure out what is going on at first, but I felt like I just didn't really care what was going on. The idea is to create mystery, who are these people and why do we care? The problem is the movie does it too well, I really just didn't connect with the characters. Although the actors are top notch, it feels like they just told them, \\"hey you're this crazy dude who took over a train.\\" The end, so the film lacks depth, but it is decent for just a night when you don't have anything else to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Remakes: How do I Loathe Thee?

I hate it. I hated it from the instant, about two minutes in, when I saw the tattoo on the side of John Travolta/Ryder's neck, which of course references Charlton Heston's subversive declaration in front of the NRA that no one will take HIS guns away except \\"from my cold dead hands.\\"Well, Mr. Heston is dead now, and while I regret the passing of a Hollywood legend there is nothing that could make me happier than to see this mockery of a fine film littering graveyards everywhere, and preferably pet cemeteries.Why pet cemeteries?

If you find something appealing about that then by all means go find a rabid dog to play with, but don't waste a moment of your life watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pelham 123 is a very poor movie","review":"What can't I say about this dog of movie One good thing is I did not pay good money watch it since I have a DVD/sat service and it was on a late viewing so I recorded and sorry I even took the time to do that. Dialog was full of profanity F this GD that MF ect. I think I counted at least 325 Mr bad guy John used one or the other. The other bad guys all they did was look around and act like a bunch of stiffs and gun tooting crazies. Mr Washington was just as bad he must and was not right guy for this role.

Method and Mary make an incredible team. Every painstaking, heartfelt emotion is captured on this recording. Meth's plays his role as an imprisioned street soldier to a hilt while Mary's devoted sistah-in-waiting is extremely well placed. Mary's melodious melodies compliment Meth's husky tones to perfection. A truly bravura performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"#1 LUV JAM","review":"This song was dedicated to me by my first love, so I might be a little bias, but I love it!!!

It includes brief discussions of writing a paper and avoiding plagiarism, but the bulk is (rightly) on the intricate matter of citing references. There are lots of examples, clearly identified, and a couple of sample papers so you can see how everything should look. The spiral binding lets it lay flat, which is handy, but it has a lightweight cover that tends to buckle if you try to hold it in one hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Handy","review":"I go to school online and therefore all of my materials are online.

It is not however to be confused with easy listening. The work isn't accessible per se, but it certainly isn't unaccessible either. Let's just say that it is a splendid piece of music that will require a little effort on the listener's part, but hey, anybody reading this review is probably willing to put in the work. I think you'll enjoy it greatly. Mutter's playing is quite notable too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metamorphosen","review":"Well, what can you say about this recording other than it was fantastic. No doubt about it, this was a flawless recording. I have been listening to Penderecki's works no for some time, and this is one of the best. This isn't just because of his excellent writing for the solo violin, but the way he blends the violin with the orchestra. Unlike a lot of violin concertos, which sole purpose is to show off the skills of player, and secondly to make good music (so it seems), this recording is more like just a symphonic work with a featured violin solo, as a wind or brass instrument would have solos. In other words, the orchestra is not merely a background and support group, but instread is an entity in itself, that, at times, is the most important unit, with the violin accompanying. This a masterpiece of new music, which deserves more credit than it as gotten already. I highly recommend it, not only to violinists, but to those who appreciate great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Luke and I","review":"A non-traditional view of baseball's Lou Gehrig.

However, it turned out to be not as \\"air-tight\\" as I'd like it to be. Feels a bit soggy and fluffy. Also, it lacks strong black sesame taste! In general, strong aroma is lacking, not to mention that it's on the pricey side. I wouldn't recommend this product if you desire a strong, solid taste of black sesame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"This book reads well and has lots of of things of interest to say about this great, but flawed Englishman.

Since I have 24 packs of them, I will give it a few more tries before I give them away during Halloween."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Taste, Healthy Snack","review":"These apple chips are really crunchy and delicious. But one thing about them is that they include part of the core, so sometimes you see those hard parts or even seeds. They are a little too sweet so if you have a taste for some sourness, the Granny Smith Apples may be better. But if you love sweeter flavor, then the Fuji Apples are the way to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed.!","review":"I was very disappointed in the taste of these. I found them very unpleasant as I usually like dried apples as a snack on WW but these aren't sweet or crunchy at all. Dosen't even taste like apples .It is more like a chore to eat these.

I would not recommend this brand at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crispy Green's freeze-dried apple chips tasted much better","review":"Amazon also carries Crispy Green's freeze-dried apple chipsCrispy Green's Fruit Snack, which tasted much better than this bake-dried one. Also freeze-dried keeps 90% of the original nutrition, while the bake-dried burns most of it. As a health product I would prefer the former. The only problem with Crispy Green's apple chips is \\"Good but Expansive\\" as one of its customer review puts it. As far as I know freez drying is very energy consuming. Now I found another product dried by a new drying method tasted just as good but the price is only half of Crispy Green's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only ONE Ingredient - WOW !!!","review":"I ordered two cases (48 pouches !) during the recent sale. Luckily, I like the taste of it very much. It's not crispy like some \\"fried\\" apple chips. It's a tad chewy but it tastes like REAL FUJI Apples. I checked the ingredient list and it only lists ONE: Organic Apples. It has No preservatives or added sugar - Gotta love that ! My only complaint is that yeah, some are not cored properly but I can't complain since I got such a great price on a top-quality product. My kids seem to like them too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reall Tasty and Good for You","review":"I'm not an organic food freak but I appreciate that this snack is not loaded with chemicals, sugars etc. It is just apples without any added flavoring, preservatives, or chemicals.All of this would not mean much if it tasted like typical health food: you know, cardboard! No, it is a tasty snack."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real slog","review":"I know H. James is considered one of the \\"Greats\\" of American literature and I question my taste for hating most of his writing. With few exceptions I think he is a pretentious purveyor of obscurantism. I read Wings of the Dove many years ago in the days when I would not allow myself to set aside books I did not enjoy. I recently picked up a collection of his short stories and remembered why I disliked him so much. Now in my old age I had no pangs of conscience when I happily closed the book before finishing it. If more of the stories had been like Daisy Miller I would have proceeded further but unfortunately much of the writing reminded me of Wings. I am currently seeking relief from Henry's turgid prose by reading Hemingway. I'd trade in a Henry for an Ernie any day. It's also difficult to like Mr. James' snobbish, shallow and unsympathetic characters. The more sympathetic ones were obscured by his heavy hand and my impatience with his style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exhausting","review":"I'm a seasoned reader of the classics and have enjoyed other novels by James. This book took me four months to read and nearly killed me. After having read great literature almost non-stop for 10 years, I took a year's break from reading after this book. Enough said. I spent time reflecting on it - surely the hard slog was worth it? What was I missing? Other reviewers seemed to find depth to the book...But no, I wasn't touched or transformed, I learned nothing from the characters and felt no sympathy towards them. I felt empty and exhausted at the end. Perhaps that was the intended impact of the novel? If so, I give it 2 stars for achieving at least that."},{"rating":"2","title":"difficult, but worth it","review":"James' style is indeed difficult. I found that reading some sections of the novel aloud helped me keep my focus and enhanced my enjoyment of James' language. Also, I read the Norton Critical Edition and the critical essays that accompanied the text help me get a lot more out of the story than I would have been able to on my own - Milly, the American innocent vs. the mercenary and dehumanized Kate Croy; Densher as typical Jamesian hero, charming, goodwilled but morally indecisive; self-consciousness or self-knowledge as characteristic of James' greatest heroes and heroines."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought this book was the novel but NO it was not","review":"I could not believe I was blind sighted by this book. I quickly ordered the novel because it was a book club selection and needed it tout suite.

Today is the Day is a machine running on equal parts evil, indiscriminate hatred, self-loathing, alienation, perversion, paranoia and chaos. They are life once you stop believing in happy endings. There is simply no other band like this; no conventional musical categorization can do them justice. Steve Austin, Bill Kelliher and Brann Dailor play as if they have seen the Apocalypse firsthand. This album is psychotic, precision-calibrated madness; in a word, severe. Their live show is the musical equivalent of staring directly into the sun. This band is for everyone on earth.

After listening to it a couple times, I wasn't entirely sure what I thought of it. Eventually I came to appreciate it more for it's novelty than anything else. It most assuredly will take anyone at LEAST a few full listens in a row to begin to like the whole CD. Once I finally accepted it into my collection however, I would find myself surprised at how good it was every time I listened to it. Even if you don't love corrupting your soul, you have to like the full-force, driving metal of TITD. It also makes you have to scoff at the many wannabe pop bands who think they're dark and menacing.

The poems too often have subject matter of social class division, whipping or beating \\"bad\\" children or adults, and animal cruelty. In addition to this, the layout and typography of this edition are terrible! It is actually difficult to read the text, not a good thing in a book meant to be read aloud. I understand that this edition is based on the 1916 version, but on reading these \\"original\\" versions of the poems, in their \\"original\\" layout, I am convinced that there is good reason to update this material.

I felt the pedal feel was a little less, but my wife didn't think so. For me, I think the slightly softer feel was better than the factory ones that had a race car feel (too touchy AND way too much dust). Wish I replaced with these years ago, prior to the pads actually needing replacement. Again, better peddle feel, quieter braking, and that annoying dust is gone (factory pads left the wheels filthy in 1 week, and hard to clean). Only negative comment is the fitting of the pad sensor, but this may have to do more with the sensor (used the original ones). The sensors didn't come off too easy from the old pads and did not lock into the new pads, so I used a quick setting epoxy to secure them. Excellent price through Amazon. If you have brakes that are sooting up your wheels, don't wait any longer, just buy these (quieter, smoother, CLEANER)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Bought this product to edge around flower beds.

This book is not just sexy reading it comes right out with heavy facts and then continues to back up every thing that he says. It isn't a easy reading but every American needs to read this book!! I believe the T.V. news has not been able to tell us the whole truth and the news we get is very slanted. If you hear what the Presidents men say over and over: after a while you can even believe that he is an inocent man. This is not written by a republican but by a independent author who no longer dares to live in the U.S. The other way to get the real news is to listen to TALK RADIO AM. Radio like RADIO FREE DC. Read this book to know and understand what is going on. It scares me to know that this man has put these people in public offices and has changed the whole F.B.I. one by one the same way he did the travel office.

The only thing that kept me from giving the book a 1 was the entertaining nature of the charges. After a while, you just have to laugh! What truly strains the author's credibility is the assertion that President Clinton is directly responsible for everything from the Oklahoma City bombing to a teacher in Arkansas' foreclosed mortgage. If he's really THIS powerful, people like the author, Aldridge, and Limbaugh would have been shut up LONG ago. If you enjoy anti-Clinton conspiracy theories and STILL can't accept the election results, then you'll probably LOVE this book -- and I guess buying it is better than sending the money to the militias.

The next 122 pages deal with the Vince Foster investigation - all reported by other authors and in the press. The rest of the book covers various Arkansas characters, also pretty well covered elsewhere. There is a little about Paula Jones. In conclusion, this book is a rehash of information covered elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, well argued book.","review":"A very interesting book that should be read by all Americans. It is written by a highly respected UK journalist who worked in the US. It will be very difficult to dismiss this work as some part of a \\"vast rightwing conspiracy\\". The arguments are well presented and argued. If half of the material is true, the US is in serious trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Work","review":"I just read this book for the second time after having read it a few years ago. It's amazing how time dulls the memory. I had forgotten about all of the scandals and crimes associated with the Clintons and it is chilling that after all of this time the Clintons still have not been held accountable and at this time Hillary is even in the running to become our next president.Ambrose Evans-Pritchard has written a well-documented and well-researched book from years of investigation and interviews. He has meticulously laid out the evidence for the Clintons association with the Oklahoma bombing, Vince Foster's death, the sad murder of Kevin Ives, the \\"Dixie Mafia\\" and even Paula Jones.I can understand why those who are enamored of Bill Clinton will not like this book but in typical left-wing form those who have given this book only one star and complain that it is filled with lies offer no facts to refute those supposed lies."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's obvious the Friends of Bill are frightened by this book","review":"Whenever folks start crying,\\"Foul!\\" we should all look long and hard at what's bothering them so. The truth hurts much more than \\"conspiracy theories\\" and the cries have started, as well as the smearing, right here in the reviews. Evans-Pritchard lays out a well-documented, well-attributed laundry list of crimes committed by and for Bill Clinton and his various administrations. The book never contends that bombing Ok City was Clinton's idea; it never even says that covering up the alleged bungled sting was his idea, but, as president, Clinton is responsible for the actions of Federal law enforcement officials. This book will, at least, make you think differently about some of the things our mainstream media has said concerning these events. I think we will hear many more cries of, \\"Foul!\\" from the Left."},{"rating":"2","title":"Credibility of the author must have Washington scared","review":"Washington is attempting to sabotage Ambrose Evans-Pritchard with a radio campaign designed to discredit the author. Gave new credibility to the book.The author's point that he has no political bias makes this book shocking and scary. One comes away with the feeling that we most certainly should reopen investigations that have been considered closed. Are they?A must read for everyone. Even the most loyal Clinton supporters should be able to judge for themselves if the man in the White House is who he says he is or if he is a giant scandal going some place to happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another anti-Clinton book","review":"This book doesn't even deserve a \\"1 Star.\\" Another book with no substance or truth.

If you believe Bill Clinton is Satan, you're going to say \\"10! 10 plus!\\" If you have any capacity for rational thought and skepticism, you'll discard this book like a used tissue. Let my sacrifice of brain cells not go in vain -- pass this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pot calling the kettle black","review":"Oh, the horror! Read about all of the awful things Clinton did. Of course nothing any worse than pretty much any other president has done. Maybe Clinton ran over the author's dog or something, but the very nature of the book seems to imply that Clinton was somehow unique in the corruption of his office. Not even remotely so. For a real comedic follow up perhaps the author could write of the pristine and angelic terms of Reagan and Bush."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun covers","review":"Ah, I was thrilled to find this soundtrack again. Although, not having seen the film, it qualifies more in my mind as a Various Artists compilation, and one that is packed with fun, clever cover versions. Among the highlights you have Dave Edmunds rockin' through \\"Run Rudolph Run,\\" Modern Romance with a sleek version of \\"Band of Gold,\\" Midge Ure doing a first-rate \\"The Man Who Sold the World\\" and my favorite track on here, Banarama turning the \\"No Feelings\\" by the Sex Pistols into a joyful danceable ditty.

Morshead, was first published as vol. 8 of The Harvard Classics in 1909. To my eyes, it's unreadable, full of pompous syntax and jangling rhymes, replete with archaic language that alludes more to Medieval epic than to classic Greek. It has been re-issued as a Dover Thrift Edition at giveaway price; to be blunt, it should be retired forevermore. Any poor reader who encounters Aeschylus in this form first will never be tempted to look at another Greek drama.See my review of Robert Lowell's 'adaptation' of the Oresteia for some thoughts about the original.

On the other hand, I put my sleeping bag in it's compression sack in the bottom just to gauge the size of the pack (it looks small when you first get it) and the colored so-called ripstop material tore about 8 inches just putting the compression sack in the bottom which took no force at all I'm not sure how it ripped so easily nor will I purchase more Teton \\"ripstop\\" material bags."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I was worry, because a need a cover rain, but this great Backpack comes with rain cover! realy usefull. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"I bought this pack because of the price and the size. I am a novice backpacker that tends to pack more than I need. This pack was more than adequate for what I needed from it. The only con for me is the water bottle holders are a little small and the straps don't keep tension. I use stainless steel bottles and they stayed in, but as soon as I set the pack down they would easily come out. I am 6' and found that the length could have been better, but I am satisfied with the overall workmanship and how the pack sits on my back. I do wish it was a bit lighter, but I am used to carrying unstable items in awkward positions.

The sleeping bag compartment is good size and my bag fit with little ot no fuss. I am 5ft 11inches and I used the highest shoulder strap setting. I padding on the back is good to better than some I have seen and the hip belt was nicley padded. I took this on a one night in the mountains on about 12 miles and it held up well. Side pockets did not look deep enough though I had no issues with them. It does have plenty of adjustment straps and extra external places for items (one under the pack and two in front as well as the side straps). One thing it could use is a pocket or two on the belt. I had about 45lbs in this and it did well as I think I could put more in the main compartment and still be comfortable. Did not use the rain fly but I did see if it would fit and it does as long as you don't have big items sticking out of the side.

A plus for me. For longer treaks I want a lighter pack though. However this will carry me through this season again. I got mine for little over $50. with free shipping so money well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Large Pack","review":"For those of you who are just weekend hikers, this bag is great. It has plenty of space, many pockets and is quite versatile. For anyone that is doing a longer hike I suggest against this bag. The bag weighs 6 pounds by itself and to anyone hiking long distances or for a long period of time that is too much. You really don't need all that room if you are attempting to hike ultralight. The bag material was durable and the zippers are large enough not to constantly break as with other bags. The rain fly is not large enough to cover the bag when full. The padding was beyond adequate and I never had a problem with sweating on my back. The adjustment system for the pack was convenient to the pack to just the right size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functional and Cheap","review":"I bought this product to take on a trip to Thailand for carrying luggage. (There were no sidewalks to roll a suitcase.) It was great. The bottom compartment worked well for shampoo and contact solution, and other toiletries, while I used th emain compartment for clothes. One thing is that you can't access the top compartment except from the top, so if you end up repacking everytime you want to get something out of the bag. The shoulder straps were comfortable. This is a small bag so it would be better for a woman or child. (Women, watch out for the top shoulder straps that go across your chest. Mine were never uncomfortable, but the bag was definatly not designed for those of us with chests.)All in all I think it was a great purchase and I will use the bag again for backpacking and overnight hikes. I may also use it for a suitcase again if visiting an area with limited concrete."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bag for the money","review":"The backpack is a great value for the money. There are only 2 things i dont like about it... the main internal part of the bag seems small compared to the size of the bag and the weight is a bit on the heavy side.

The bottom outside pocket is great to put shoes in or anything that is wet.

You either need to have a lot of work to do, a lot of spare time, or insomnia to fully appreciate Times of Grace. It's a concept album about inspiration, and how one accepts changes in the world and grows as a person. Because of this, there aren't really any outstanding songs; they all sorta fit together. Listening to this CD requires much patience, as the songs slowly morph from one musical atmosphere to a completely different one. If you like progressive music, and are patient, you will enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album !","review":"This album is amazing. It's dark and evil but at the same time beautiful.

I am a fan of all avantegarde stuff(Mr.Bungle, Fantomas, anything by Mike Patton, ect ect.) It is very atmospheric and melodic. The only drawback is when the \\"singer\\" actually tries to sing.

You really have to appreciate their old stuff in order to understand the progression that they have made to the new album. I have yet to get the new one but I've listened to it. Its left me hooked once again holding my breath in awe. The true power of neurosis comes in their live shows with all the multimedia they bring along with their music which just seems to blend right in. I cant wait to see them live with this kick #@! set of destruction. Do not procrastinate to pick this one up like I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different and Diverse","review":"Neurosis continue to be a band that does what they want, and not what everone expects from them. The write the kinds of songs that make them happy, and the only people they have to impress is themselves. That is why they are such a great band. And that is why people either don't understand them or say that they suck. If you like mindless music for the masses that sounds like 20 other bands riding the latest trend, don't buy this, go get your band of the moment that is popular on MTV. But if you want an original band with their own sound and their own vision, check out Neurosis, they do not disapoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift","review":"I purchased these earrings for my 10 year old niece.

I'd classify Nolan's writing style as lean and concise. Pulp sci-fi just doesn't get any better than this. The amazing thing is that Nolan and George Clayton-Johnson wrote the first draft of \\"Logan's Run\\" in three weeks!While there's a special place in my heart for the 1976 movie, the book is so much better (as is often the case). The universe that the authors created is bigger, more challenging. And the ending is very cool (and TOTALLY different from the movie, which really disappoints in this regard).Also worth searching out is \\"Impact 20\\", a collection of Nolan's early short stories. I believe a small publisher is putting out a collection that contains some of these stories in 2002."},{"rating":"2","title":"This should of never ran out of print.","review":"When I bought the Logan's Run books I was afraid I would like the first book and not so much the other two.I was wrong.I liked the first one and loved the other two.The books are different than the movie or the TV series but in a good way.William F. Nolan wrote the second and third books by himself. He reminds me of Robert E. Howard's Conan series because he has the ability to take complex scenes and distil it down to a few sentences.The books flow so well that they are done before you know it. In other words they are not boring.The first one he wrote with George Clayton is good but drags in one scence Logan and Jessicia are running away from Francis and they hide in some civil war reenactment. I felt it was boarderline silly.The ending of the book was cool with the reverse chapter numbers.Is there and chance the rest of the books could be in print some day because they are supposely been written.Great book series.We need more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heard it all before...","review":"Yep, Glen Benton and his God-hating cronies return once again to bash our brains with more monotomous blast beats and horrible vocals.I'm not saying there's anything particulary wrong with this album, as they are all very talented musicians, however its nothing new.Every song sounds the same, and features Benton grunting on about how much he hates religion and how he worships the devil. OK! We get it! You dislike Christians! Change the story! Funny thing is, he acknowledges Satan's existence but not God's. You can't have one and not the other Glen!Anyways, if all you want to hear is blast beats from start to finish, the same guitar riff over and over and some idiot screaming away like a toddler on a tantrum, then waste you money on this.If you want some decent death metal/grindcore, listen to PIG DESTROYER, CANNIBAL CORPSE, ANNOTATIONS OF AN AUTOPSY, JOB FOR A COWBOY, DESPISED ICON, ALL SHALL PERISH."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Again,same as last CD","review":"I just heard the samples of Icons of evil.

This one, however, is a refreshing change and shows why she has gained such a following over the past 35 years or so.There is a good mix of Caetano Veloso classics (\\"Ciume\\" is the best version of this I've heard), bossa nova, and samba. A very listenable album, and highly recommended if you want \\"um bocadinho\\" (a small taste) of her range of talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing creative singing and arrangements","review":"Good but not groovy arrangemnents.Good repertoire but just for Gal Costa's fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"An utter waste of my time and my money","review":"Dark Fantasy better describes this bitterly sexist diatribe. Science Fiction it is not! I enjoyed Patricia's Cold Allies and Brother Termite. Those two titles amused my mind and stimulated my thoughts. However this book left me with nothing. If you get your kicks reading about violent homosexual conquest, bloody incest, and indulgent female self-torment then knock yourself out. If you want Science Fiction you will be frustrated at the lack of answers, the lack in fact of any extrapolation of what promised to be a fascinating exploration of anti-gravity and its effect on society after the first chapter, and the overwhelming anger against males that this book portrays. I place this in the same category as those hack-n-slash horror films that are advertised as so-called Science Fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muddled, uninspired and offensive...","review":"One day I have to figure out how to give a book no stars 'cause I feel horrible about giving \\"Cradle of Splendor\\" a star since it deserves none. This may be the worst book I have ever read (and I've read a lot of books). Let's just get it out in the open: this is a bad book. Bad writing, moronic storyline, and annoying characters. Bad enough I had to put up with cliched writing and a asinine plot but I couldn't understand half of it! I'm still not exactly sure of what happened. Some kind of alien/sex-thing..not that it matters. And let me just say that this book is very offensive to Brazilians. Throughout the book she describes Brazilians as lazy, dirty, incompetent, violent and stupid. She describes Brazilian society in the worst way possible and at the end thanks a Brazilian family for hosting her. I wonder what they would think of the beautiful way she depicted their country...don't buy this book. Please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Anthony's best books","review":"I have to be honest here--this is the one novel by Anthony that I just couldn't finish. I had absolutely no interest in the plot, characters or narrative voice used. Don't get me wrong, there are things to admire about the book but admiration doesn't mean it's a great novel or even a good one.There are enough recaps of the plot here so I won't go there. Let's just say this is the least appealing of her well written books. Someone commented that it had moronic plotting. I don't think that's the case, it's just not a compelling or interesting story. Everybody stumbles. We sometimes race along at such a pace that we don't pay attention to the cracks in the sidewalk or the uneven pavement. Here Anthony fell in love with the concept of creating a novel around her beloved Brazil. Unfortunately, the concept is much better than the execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complex, with Good Characterizations","review":"Brazil is attacked when spies discover that its government has acquired advanced technology. There are many characters involved in subterfuge in independent plots. Characterizations are good, though none of the characters are very likeable or easy to identify with. The book reads like a Quentin Tarantino movie: a rapid sequence of highly visual, often violent episodes. I'm not motivated to read more of her books, though they have won awards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfulfilling","review":"Reading this book was like going to dinner at friend's house and smelling something wonderful in the kitchen. Yet when the meal was served it was something totally different and unappetizing. It starts out with an interesting idea but then spends the rest of the book hinting around it while venturing off in some pseudo-spy story with unwarranted and disturbing sexual overtones. One is left with a lot of unanswered questions about the activities behind what the author wrote. Her notions on international relations was simplistic, at best. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising beginning, disgusting finale","review":"I'm giving this book one star, only because Anthony's writing was compelling enough to keep me reading until I had finished the entire book, whereupon I promptly threw it in the trash and wished I had never read it.

I can honestly say I wouldn't recommend this book to my worst enemy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sparks Creativity!","review":"I purchased this toy for my grandson's 3rd birthday.

Second, another 4 tracks are taken up by a competent if uninspired jazz combo along with 1 from French ingenue Edith Piaf (\\"Les Flons-Flons du Bal\\"). That leaves 9 instrumental Enya tracks of which nearly all end up resembling the interludes of G.E.

They are light enough to wear in the hot summer months and help keep the creepy crawlies away. This particular pair was 6 inches too long. I think they must be \\"seconds\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY comfortable","review":"These sweats are light-weight and very comfortable. I wear them around the house and they're great for spring walks when shorts don't cut it."},{"rating":"2","title":"They are light weight cotton; as described by another","review":"They are very light weight cotton; on the order of T-shirt weight fabric; if just a cover up and you're in Warmer climate, they should be fine; if in a colder climate might not be enough warmth. And, if you run a warmer internal core temp, it might be not enough, too. Comparison, I have thicker weight Russell Athletc bottoms and they're just a bit too warm for me...but in San Diego. the temp. now is 61 deg F. and I'm sensitive to heat so have to adjust attire all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"My review","review":"Well lets start with this,I did not like the sizing of these pants nor was the thickness acceptable to me.In the past Russell has made the highest quality jogging pants on the market, these I bought was just to thin for my tastes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkward.","review":"Awkward fitting pants here. They seem more like balloon pants than sweat pants. I would not buy these again. They are soft, but the fit is too big in the mid areas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy at all","review":"In my opinion the pants are too bulky and hang loose enough to look and feel really baggy. The weight is just not what I expected of \\"sweatpants\\" that I am used to. Altogether I'd not recommend these to anyone and I'll probably just throw mine away and learn from the bad experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"Low quality all around. Thin flimsy fabric and lightweight elastic. Plus sized wrong, ordered XL, item tagged XL but was at least 2X or 3X. Amazon did do a prompt refund.Better deal is theChampion Mens Closed Bottom Jersey Pant- lower price and better quality than the Russell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pants, Great price.","review":"I was in need of a nice breathable pair of athletic pants and this product fit the bill perfectly. Totally worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sizing Problem","review":"I try to buy only 100% cotton sweats. For that reason I ordered these in black which at the time was the only color available in 100% cotton. The material is fine. I ordered large based on the sizing guidelines. It was too large - especially in the length. Since 100% cotton is hard to find I decided to wash them in hopes of them shrinking. They shrunk a bit, but not much. I then ordered a pair of mediums. They are also too large, again especially in the length. After washing, the large and medium are of almost identical size. So the sizing of these pants seems very sloppy. However my primary complaint is with the elastic waist. The elastic is not strong enough to hold the pants up. It does have a built in rope, but it's not elastic and therefore not comfortable. I give it 2 stars only because it's 100% cotton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paper is thicker","review":"I thought I choose thicker of several pants. I was wrong. These pants are very thin cotton. I will buy next pair from brick and mortar store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I wanted","review":"They were not a sweat pant that i\`m use to, I thoughtthey would be alot heavier. I have not wore them yet maybe I will change my Review then"},{"rating":"2","title":"I keep losing my pants . . .","review":"I bought a blue pair and a black pair. My husband claimed the blue ones, my father got the black ones. I'm hiding these. I like them because they're cotton, and roomy, and comfy for chilly nights around the house. I didn't want fleece. The fabric is like a good quality, thick t-shirt. I like the elastic at the ankles. It keeps them from crawling up my legs if I sleep in them, and I don't have to worry if they're too long - the elastic keeps them around my ankles, but isn't binding or tight. I also bought a similar pair of Champion brand. These are better."},{"rating":"1","title":"chep","review":"The sweats i got were not as they looked on the ad. They are very the almost like pj's.Very Very disappointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"The pants are perfect for hanging around home either inside or outside. I wear them for quick trips to the market or liquor store. I am not a fan of shorts so these pants are good for me. They look nice, are cool and so far launder well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a better description","review":"I searched sweatpants and this came up. Even in the photo, you can't quite tell that these pants are thin t-shirt fabric material. Bought it, it showed up and it was definitely NOT what I expected. Who would even wear this? Definitely will be returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much thinner and larger than expected","review":"These are fine pants, don't get me wrong, but I had to return them because they were too thin for the season I was looking for them to be worn in (more geared for spring) and larger than another pair of Russell sweatpants that I also ordered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sweat pants, Very thin standard jersey material pants","review":"These pants would be nice on the hotter weather when you want a pant that's not too bulky or insulated.The material is a typical jersey cotton so it feels more like a tee shirt than a sweat pant material.my husband didn't like them since he likes a heavier traditional sweat pants.So in all they're not bad but more so on a light weight cheaper feeling pair than anything appropriate for winter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun but lots of crash bugs","review":"My son loves this game but multiple times per session he is asking \\"daddy why is the computer frozen?\\". There is a patch online to make it work with Vista and another patch for crash bugs but after installing both the product is still VERY unstable. I expect a lot more from LEGO.There are cut scenes with guns, but no killing, if that is a concern."},{"rating":"1","title":"would not buy again","review":"CD is for windows 98 even though it says XP on the cover, also requires a patch which has a lot of problems installing and I am an IT professional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it doing anything?","review":"This product was easy to install, and when I turned my computer back on - Wow!, I had 128 more megabytes of memory.Unfortunately, except for the readout on my computer about more memory, I have seen no other sign that this product is working. My computer is not any faster, I cannot open any more programs at the same time, and some computer games which could not be opened because I didn't quite have enough memory, still can't be opened.I phoned to get help from Viking, and they were friendly, but said the readout on my computer that says I have 128 more megabytes of memory may be the only sign I have that the product is working.

It was not at all what I expected: boring reading and no useful advice, just opinions(I only read a bit and returned it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"after all these years...","review":"The Transformers in the 1980's were probably the most important toys to the boys ages from about 5 to heck about 18. When Tracks came out he was my favorite of all time, he was easy to transform, he had an attractive look.My mom gave him to me when I was in 4th grade (I'm 25 now), I had him for only 3 days or so when my *ahem* \\"wonderful\\" teacher took him away from me and I never got him back at the end of the schoolyear.And now probably 15 or 16 years later, I have him back. Thanks to Toys R Us and Hasbro.And by the way, I bought the last one in the store, heh. Great toy, The Transformers still 0wn all other action figures in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning the plastic feels cheap and easily breakable if you attempt transformation.","review":"Don't know if all the original Tracks are like this or the other reissues. The foot snapped off on mine then I returned it for an exchange. Shortly after while I was transforming it, I was sliding one of Tracks' hands out and one of the sliding side pegs that held the hand in place snapped. It resulted in the hand coming off. A great while after that a peg that held the whole upper car rear on back snapped off completely while I was transforming him. The toy is cool but the plastic is too cheap. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"How bout it shiney one?","review":"Hay everyone. im reviewing tracks. Tracks forms into a sports car. He looks kinda weird in his robot form. becareful with his wings they seem too come off pretty easly., but they attach back easly. He wasnt my faverite in the show. Appered in the second season. He is a great toy too add too your collection, i recommed him too all autobot fans. He is called a Lousy earth-lover by his autobot friends. thinks they are jelous of his good looks. thanks for reading hope this review was helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Curse of the Crimson Altar(The Crimson Cult)","review":"Curse of the Crimson Altar(The Crimson Cult On Netflix Instant stream even though the other name shows up when you press play.)Christopher Lee is a superb actor as is of course Boris Karloff as you can see by their roles in this film and the surprise ending,however the film is just a bunch of hippie AND writer H.P.(can't stand his stuff) Lovecraft mumbojumbo occult/pagan matters,there were so many of these films made in the 60's and 70's,this film is a bunch of fruitcakes in s&m garb and some bizarre witch along with a plot that does not make sense.Lee/Karloff are the only reason to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of theory, less practical","review":"I bought this guide to enhance my suncluster3x knowledge. It's a good book, but with more \\"designs\\" and practical battle-camp examples it could be a great choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maumeetroutbum","review":"Perfect, exactly what I was looking for. Fits perfect in my gear bag and meets all my criteria. Service was excellent. Will buy from Backcountry Edge again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful lamp","review":"I have two of these lamps. One in my house and another in my workshop. I use them once or twice a week to remove splinters from my fingers, reading small print to working on hard to see projects. You don't need to be old to have a use for this lamp, but the older you get you will find yourself using it more often. I bought this for my daughter as a gift for her 45th birthday. I knew she would be using it.I have looked at lamps costing 3 times more than this one and they were almost identical or the very same in principal with no better benefits for the extra price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strike Two on this one","review":"This lamp was almost impossible to set up, and the design is really bad. The bracket to attach to a table is PLASTIC and I had a feeling the light could not support the weight. The first one I bought had a power cord split in two pieces like someone took a sharp blade or scissors and just cut it in half (very dangerous) . I returned and asked for a replacement, which I received the next day (good customer service, product not so much).The second one was a disaster from the start, but it did have a power cord in one peice. The design gives you basically one way to hook it up. It was ok - until I the turned the light toward the table and (I was right - did I mention the bracket was PLASTIC)?. This bracket broke and the lamp hit the table and my head. It weighs enough to bend the metal housing on the end of the light. I am glad I had my airplane model in another area to dry - I was a $30 model and it would have been toast.I'm just saying....."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD LAMP! GOOD MAGNIFIER!","review":"well I ordered the lamp and got it 3 days earlier than expected. That was great!Its a quality lamp for a good price. Its bright not blinding and the magnifier is good for the price.The only thing I don't like is that it will not clamp to a pole or post. The online description says that it will but it doesn't. The clamp itself is flat and will nothold on to a pole. Otherwise its a good purchase for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"I wish there would have been other poor reviews of this movie prior to my purchasing it. It is my opinion the positive reviewers must have been reviewing the recent theatre version of \\"Bridge to Teribithia.\\" The storyline in this PBS version was very lack-luster and slow-moving. It falls way short of the promises on the back of the cover. The imaginary world of Terabithia is never seen as more than a nice little wooded area where the main characters go to play. There is very little reference to what they imagine while there. Character and plot development are sadly missing from this big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TO A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!!","review":"The reviewers above had just said what I felt. We went to watch a kids film, and left the theater with a feeling of a hole in our chest and surrounded by astonished sad kids and crying moms and dads. What a horrible experience is watching this movie. You really have to be masochistic to like these kind of stories. No fantasy or imagination film whatsoever, just a brutal movie that leave as if you had been to a funeral. It is really cruel for the producers of this film to advertise this as a kids film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't do the book justice!","review":"I read this book with my sixth-graders. We were enthralled with the book, and so excited about the movie- boy were we disappointed! The movie leaves out so much of the storyline. The acting is not especially superior either. Read the book and don't waste your time on the movie! Let the imagery Katherine Paterson creates be your movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Was HORRID!!","review":"My class read \\"Bridge\\" for a reading book. When we got to watch the movie in clas I thought that it was the worst movie EVER. I thought the acting was EXTREMELY terrible. They left out alot of things that make the story the way it is. They never even had a rope for the 2 to swing across to Terabithia on. [In the book Leslie says that the rope is the only way to get into Terabithia] They just use the branch that's there in the beggining. The branch, in the book, doesn't come in until the last chpter or 2. Another thing was that they cut out 2 of the sisters and Leslie looked like a boy way too much. I hated this movie. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON THIS PEICE OF JUNK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unabridged to Terabithia","review":"Since I reviewed this movie after the remake, February 2007, I was very disappointed watching the original. More so because in the 2007 version the parts that both Jess and Leslie imagined were very well animated. Also, there was not as much character development in the PBS version; so the viewer is not as drawn into the emotion that Jess feels when he loses his new best friend, Leslie. This story was supposed to be a tragic but revealing experience for a young pre-adolescent who has to deal with death. I was not moved by this version of the story. I believe that a talent of Annette O' Toole's stature was wasted in this Production. The film was just too short, very low budget and not developed well at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Complete Work","review":"Having very little actual knowledge about the Chakra system, but a fair grounding in Western psychology, I was absolutely blown away by how readable and valuable this book was. It is not one to speed-read because every page, section and chapter contains gems you won't want to miss. Not only did it give me a comprehensive understanding of the Chakra system and it's relationship to Western psychology, it provided useful and applicable exercises for working in and healing imbalances in each Chakra. I have found it both personally useful and relevant and have shared its wisdom with clients, friends and family members."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating insights","review":"Gave me a new way of looking at the physical structure and presentation of myself and others."},{"rating":"1","title":"good quality, received in timely manner, informationally junk and not on anything foundationally sound","review":"I got what I wanted, but didn't know it was junk until I read it. Wouldn't bother reading it except I had a class on it. Wouldn't have taken the class if I knew it was garbage with no foundational structure. It sucks people in and makes them appear intellectual when actually it is illogical and nas no truth to it. I wouldn't want my kids to read, or myself... instead of selling it online so some other person would be exposed to its hypocracy- I will just throw it in our fire and keep ourselves warm while it is still cold- and prevent others from being sucked into it as well. It really is trash, honestly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inner Wisdom to Burn","review":"This book goes far beyond just stating what they are. This book explains how each functions in your body, mind, heart, soul & life. Fabulously complete it weaves the practical with the mystical beautifully. And for those who are looking for a new way to work with client's beyond strictly following a medical model this addresses and still stretches that fixed paradigm.\\" An absolutely seminal work and a thorough treatment of the subject. You won't be the same after you engage these ideas and let this let this wonderful teachers brilliant wisdom seep into your soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eastern Body, Western Mind","review":"This is one of the most clear and comprehensive books on healing in the 21st century by returning to ancient knowledge of energy and the chakras, linking this view of health in all its manifestations to Jungian psychotherapy and cutting edge metaphysics. I am not a lover of non-fiction books (read too many in the process of becoming an MD!) but the writing is lyrical and pulls you along. Also, \\"Eastern Body, Western Mind\\" is well organized to be a practical reference book. I can't say enough positive things about this book and that is something coming from an Western trained academic internist, geriatrician, and researcher."},{"rating":"2","title":"healing the energy body","review":"I learned a great deal from Anodea's book. Her writing is very clear. Then I went to Kripalu and took a workshop from her and Lion Goodman. They are a dynamic team. The book was extremely helpful in the healing process; then the workshop brought it all into daily living."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly comfortable!","review":"I read previous reviews on this product and decided to give it a try - and I'm so glad I did! I have a small pool and this is the perfect size! Great for floating and reading a book - or just floating and relaxing! Adjustable straps help \\"customize\\" the fit. Will also be easy to pack and take on trips - love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Water Chair Lounger","review":"I'm 210 lbs. and this float works great. I have had terrible luck with every plastic float I have ever had. This float is very durable and well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the greatest lounger!","review":"Original review 6/28/11 -- I am 6'1\\" and over 300lbs so I've had trouble finding a comfortable lounger. This lounger is so adjustable that I can adjust it to my body with quite a bit of room left over for further adjustments to make it even bigger. I liked it so much that I ordered a 2nd one. It doesn't have a cup holder and that is the only drawback I find with this lounger. I do like that my head is supported when floating. If you are a larger person, you've got to get this lounger. You won't be disappointed.Updated 1yr later 3/28/12 -- I just ordered 2 more of these loungers. Both that I bought last year still hold air and are usable, but the fabric is fraying after being in the pool all last summer. Gotta love that Texas heat! I still say this is the best lounger that I've found for a large person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"Used this chair only once, and just like another reviewer stated when I went to take it out today, the nylon material around the inflatable tube was all shredded at the seam. Very disappointing as others reviewers stated it was the best lounger they ever had. It was very expensive to fall apart at the seams. I am sending it back today for a full refund. Although the chair didn't meet my expectations, Amazon is great for sending a return label to send it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Water Chair Lounger is great","review":"Easy to inflate and use. Very comfortable for lounging in the pool. Not big and bulky. Appears well made. My wife and I love relaxing in the pool without a care in the world. Try it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I absolutely love this product and I am going to be ordering a couple more so that everyone in my family can have one to use in the pool at the same time these things are so comfortable I've never been on a more comfortable float."},{"rating":"2","title":"realy i like it","review":"i got this item with me to Dubai & Barcelona. its great, realy great, my weight are 99 Klg !! and its get me.:)))"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too impressed","review":"I wasn't impressed with this chair AT ALL The first time it was inflated, the seams burst! My husband blew it up and I used it in the pool for about 30 minutes. I left it on a lounger overnight and the next morning all the seams were shredded. It took several days for all the air to get out so I could return it. Not sure that I would purchase anything else from this manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth 1/2 the price they are asking here","review":"Don't waste your money it's just an inflatable it is so not worth the $100. The material rips and most inflatables rarely last more than a season anyway. If it was made with a thick foam and better material I could see the value of it but this seems like a major scam here."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed/water chair","review":"Received this promptly but it has four places that must be filled with air and this is not an easy thing to blow up..... stuck it back in box and figured I'd garage sale it out ...who wants to sit at beach or on boat blowing up this thing for an hr."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love these!!","review":"A friend told me this was the best water chair she ever bought. When I looked at it it didn't impress me at all, but I took the risk and because they were cheap I ordered two. WOW. So glad I did! With just one inflation (we used a compressor) I was sold. You can sit straight up, recline, even lay on your stomach. I spent hours in this chair over the summer. The only thing missing is a cup holder. Great buy and highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointed","review":"the product was described as \\"worn package\\", but when it showed up the package was covered in years old mold and decay..i threw it right in the garbage due to its ridiculous state of decomp. would not buy from this seller again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't listen to the people that say its good.","review":"This band is ingenius, if you hate talent that is.

There are clever, complex rhythms thrown in and lots of Ozzy-esque vocals. \\"Unsung,\\" for example, would be right at home on a Sabbath album. Helmet defies categorization in an industry that seems to want everything neatly defined."},{"rating":"2","title":"Role models.","review":"This 1992 debut is one of the better alt-metal albums of the early 90's. It's not the best thing I've ever heard, but it's still pretty solid. \\"Unsung\\" is easily the big song here, very good, very catchy, but the rest of this rather short album packs a punch as well. If you've heard them on soundtracks like \\"Jerky Boys\\", \\"The Crow\\", or \\"Judgment Night\\" with \\"House Of Pain\\", and want to hear more, this is a good choice. It will go great with your \\"Tool\\" and \\"Fugazi\\" cd's."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest CD Ever","review":"Without a doubt, Meantime was a monumental CD that changed the way people think of heavy music. A full out assault on the listener, Meantime uses dropped-D tuning to perfection. Their tight, quick riff patterns in different time signatures have been used by a multitde of 90's metal bands (see Deftones, Pantera, Limp Bizkit, etc.) Every song on this album is amazing. It is one of the few CD's I can listen to constantly. Unfortunately, Helmet never received their due praise from the mainstream, mostly because people couldn't label them. It's not metal, it's not hardcore, it's not alternative. It is a captivating album that will stick with you forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes Indeed.","review":"Yup - that's all I can say. The drums on Ironhead alone warrant the purchase of this CD.

It is cheaply made, and obviously will not last very long. The vinyl is thin, tears very easily. But, worst of all the bolt/nut design is completely wrong. It will no tighten enough to keep the seat in place. When we sit on the damned thing, it tries to move out from beneath us. It's like riding a green colt for the first time.If it wasn't such a hassle to return it, I would, and tell them to shove it where the sun doesn't shine."},{"rating":"1","title":"White hardware on a black lid? Really?","review":"It is soft but the hardware is cheap white plastic making it look crummy if you have a black toilet. Just silly. I will end up throwing it out. Wish I could find just a nice black padded cover. At least you could sit on top. Bolts on with plastic bolts that have a long slide hole so should fit any toilet. But that also makes it tend to slide around on top while attached.Back to OEM lid and putting a towel on top for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"title","review":"This a good product, have purchased it before and will again if necessary. It gets alot of wear and tear from the kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never received with no explanation","review":"I received a refund on my bank statement, but I never got an explanation as to why. I never received the product. Which made me pretty sad. I love this fregrance, but I guess this company is not how I'm going to get a refill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corn-fun Poems","review":"Once again, James Stevenson has united a variety of short poems that range from ryhming, to free verse, and always include a twist of one kind or another. The poems are accompanied by small watercolour and black pen sketches, or laid out in different patterns and orientations in ways that relate to the poem's subject. Varying the text size and font as well create visual images simply with just the words. While not as popular as the rhyme and simple humour of Jack Prelutsky or Shel Silverstein, Stevenson's own work is something innovative and new, introducing children to non-rhyming free-verse. Although the humour is not the type that makes you crack out laughing, with a little extra thinking, it will definitely make you smile. The layout of the book is simple and consistant, with page numbers and titles at the top, and then the poem spread over the page or mixed with illustrations. Overall, the book seems to be a nice hidden gem filled with amusing quirks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get In Car, Go To Woods, Come Home","review":"My title for this review is more than a synopsis of this film, it is the film. I would give this an \\"A,\\" as a student film, but a definitive \\"F,\\" as a DVD purchase (or rental). Two guys take a drive to the woods and come home. Along the way there are lingering shots of creatures and things: a crow, ants swarming, wedding ring on finger, and a slug. This attempt at symbolism seems contrived and accomplishes nothing. Another reviewer said that this film is 'beautifully nuanced.' A nuance is subtly evocative. This film has no fragrance. I'm sure the filmmaker worked hard on this and had the best of intentions, but I just can't get behind this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope.","review":"I'm all for quiet, comtemplative films that are all about mood and atmosphere. That and the great reviews are what made me want to rent this. Wow, what a snoozer, and not in a good way. Nothing much happens, the dialog is mostly superficial, then it's over.

Nothing much happens in this picture. It has been praised by many critics as a great work of art. I think that's the same mentality that calls a blank canvas a great work of art. This film has good acting (considering they didn't have much of a script to work with) and the photography is beautiful. The main problem with this picture is the total lack of conflict. It seemed like I was watching a 90 minute home movie of friends on a camping trip. The reason good movies keep our interest is the conflict. Without it we may as well just sit and watch the fish swim in an aquarium. This is the kind of film you can go out to the kitchen several times for snacks and make a couple trips to the bathroom without pausing the DVD. You wouldn't miss anything important, anyway. What a shame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbearably stiff and dull.","review":"My wife heard good things about this movie. We were not initially impressed - painfully slow, very dull, stiffly acted.

Overrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"The praises of all the positive reviews about strained relationships and feelings explored are entirely true.However, I think any adult is capable of understanding those aspects and extracting all this film has to offer in the first twenty minutes. If you picked a conversation out of the middle, you could probably cut that to about five minutes.It's a story far too mundane for a film and should be avoided - just like the relationship it portrays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Joy gives No Joy","review":"This movie struggles to give some meaning to a lost hippie relationship. It is superficial, stilted and unworthy of mention as drama. The dog is the best actor in the movie, engendering more sympathy than either of the leads.Usually I can find some shred of value in a film, but this one is a total loss. There is no credible story, no theatrical tension, and no denouement.I knew that there must be an exception to 'De gustibus non disputandum est\\".

It took persistance to get the parts replaced.Once in the parts department, they were unclear as to the pieces I wanted. THeir system did not corelate with the lettered system on the instructions.It took over 2 weeks for the repoacement pieces to arrive. Even those had minor imperfections to them.The ladder was tricky to assemble. Once assembled, I am less than satisfied with the \\"fit\\". Many of the shelves do fit squarely with the outer frame.

With 14 and 15 year old players we will no longer pitch without a screen. The only weak spot were the wheels. They actually were hit by hard ground balls and broke right away. I simply replaced them with a rubber wheel I got from the hardware store. The screen has functioned perfectly and does what it is supposed to do, keep the pitcher from getting hit. The fact that it easily breaks down and can be taken to and from the field is ideal. It is lite weight and easy to carry.

Gina and Flint are thrown together when he is brought to clean up a trouble from Gina's department of her family's company.

This book is steamy and hot, so get a fan and some iced tea ready for your reading session."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable","review":"Martha Manning has long been one of my favorite authors, and though she'd probably protest, she's someone I admire more than words can express. The way she writes is lyrical, almost poetic, with every sentence full of meaning and emotion. Yet her descriptions of life, death, love, feeling are so real and tangible that I can't imagine anyone not being touched by her words in some way. This book is about friendship, as the title suggests, but also about life and it's struggles. It's about death and about recovering. About depression and also about joy. This book, her words and her life, can make you both laugh and cry, sometimes all at once. This, along with her other works, is a must read by anyone who loves someone - anyone - and feels life passionately. Another brilliant work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vomit, stupor, wheezing, and drooling","review":"After my one cat has these, I find him staring off into space, wheezing, with drool hanging from his mouth, he is barely responsive, and does not acknowledge me unless I try to move him.

And the end was stupid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleak and Dreary","review":"A bleak, dreary and much too lengthy film of contemporary life in criminally ridden Naples, Italy. This is an unsuccessful attempt at cinema verite. There no real excitement or dramatic involvement--the characters are much too shallow or unsympathetic to really care about. The lighting is frequently much too dim, since a lot of the \\"action\\" takes places in dark hovels and basements. Although it may be of interest to sociologists and social workers, I don't think it will hold much appeal for mainstream moviegoers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely incoherent that makes it very difficult to follow and enjoy., August 31, 2009","review":"It's so incoherent that makes it very difficult to follow and enjoy. It tells different stories of different people and they do not intersect with each other.The only good thing about this movie is it terrifyingly exposes the brutality and the effect the Camorra crime syndicate has on everybody. They kill anybody including children. They sell drugs and collect taxes from all business such as waste disposal, etc. They recruit children to work as lookouts for their drug business. They corrupt people with money and death threat. The list go on and on.The book is more gripping and terrifying."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Ain't No Goodfellas","review":"This film failed on so many levels that it's hard to summarize its shortcomings. Suffice to say that lack of cohesiveness OR character development resulted in a totally unsatisfying film experience. I'm stunned that Scorsese was willing to lend his name to this production (though interestingly you WON'T find his name anywhere on the DVD case/notes). The reviews I read suggested this was a greater showcase of the \\"reality\\" of the so-called mafia, and that may be true...the real mafia likely consists of uneducated thugs with little to look forward to, and absolutely no sense of the value of human life. Unfortunately, such characteristics do NOT a good movie make. I'd pass on this one, and wait until Scorsese decides to make another \\"unreal\\" crime flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"a film about an Italian gang rivaling the mafia","review":"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.Gomorrah is a film about the real life Neapolitan organized crime organization, Camorra, which while unrelated to the mafia, shares some of their traits. The film shows the lives of several people who are affected by the group.The film is quite violent but not as much as many other films are. I found the film interesting as I never heard of the group depicted in the film. The supplements mention the group has rivaled the mafia in both membership and the number of people killed. The film is candid about their activities and the author of book the film is based on, Roberto Saviano, has been living under non-stop police protection.Supplements on Disc one are a theatrical trailer.Disc two has a documentary on the film's production, an interview with Roberto Saviano, interviews with selected cast and crew, and deleted scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"NETWORK rules!","review":"An Australian two-disc edition feature length is five minutes shorter than originally advertised here (132 min instead of 137), which, probably, left something outside the reviewer not catching all the summit of others appreciation at a movie of modern Calabria webbed by a local traditional mafia with correlation on migration processes.Nevertheless the extent to which this story of Italy's ordinaries trying making some living reflects a reality, it is a very moment of truth for those looking for professional jobs as far as in Australia surely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visit Sunny Naples!","review":"...or better yet not. This film is real but depressing. I agree with some of the criticsm here that the stories within this film are a little disjointed when you first see this. And if you know nothing about the problems with organized crime in and around Naples then some of this may not make complete sense. But for the most part this film does not romanticize the mafia like so many American films do. And for that alone this is an interesting film to see.I waited a long time to see this. It took quite a while to be released on dvd in the US and in the US format. The bottom line is that this is raw and sometimes hard to watch because of the random, heartless and very real violence... but it is something that you will probably want to see again because the performances are very unaffected for the most part and after seeing that horrific real Naples hit on Youtube this seems very realistic.This does for Naples tourism what City of Lost Children did for Rio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waited too long to check it out!","review":"Unfortunately, the DVD would not play in my system.

If you have read Less Than Zero or even The Rules of Attraction, this book is old hat. If not, I suggest you skip Less Than Zero and read this.

There are better writers on every block of Manhattan than Nick McDonell. Absolutely pathetic. Great to know that his godfather published the book, though, and his dad got it promoted.Joan Didion came to my school a few months ago and gave a talk. At one point, during questions afterward, I asked her point blank why she gave blurbs to books that it seems hard to imagine she could have had any respect for whatsoever. (I didn't mention Twelve by name, but I haven't noticed her name on many other books, and certainly none as wretched as this garbage.) There was a pause and then she sighed and said, \\"You get trapped into it. Old friends ask, and you don't want to put a sour note in decades of friendship because you wouldn't write a sentence or two.\\"Joan Didion is old friends with Nick McDonell's father."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hype over substance","review":"The most disturbing thing about this book is all the hype around it. Yes, the kid was just a teenager when he wrote it and that's definitely an accomplishment, but there is no way this book would've gotten published had it not been for all the industry connections he had. Morgan Entrekin, his publisher, and owner of Atlantic Books (Grove is owned by Atlantic), is also Mcdonell's godfather. I mean the book is okay, but there isn't really anything original here. There's no new voice of sorts and the content is old-hat teen druggie stuff, so I can't see how everyone's calling him the New Hunter Thompson, or the new B.E. Ellis. He hasn't had enough writing experience to pull off the hard-fought prose of those who have earned their merits."},{"rating":"1","title":"prep school fantasy","review":"TWELVE isn't the worst book ever, it just isn't very good. It's a prep school fantasy by a boy who was good at english and felt that there was something apocalyptic or at least meaningful in the teenage parties and consumerism that surround him. The upper east side is full of young ironists who quote Veblen and Ellis, sadly McDonell is not one of them, otherwise he would have known better.If you want to read about spoiled rich kids, LESS THAN ZERO is the classic, it's short and funny. The sequel, RULES OF ATTRACTION is pointless, but it should be mandatory reading for anyone thinking of going to an eastern liberal arts college.Ellis borrowed much of his style from Dennis Cooper. If yoou want to read something \\"shocking\\" TRY is a much better book about missing love and prevalent drugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twelve","review":"Please note that of all of the reviews, the highest ratings were given by 13-year-olds who spell recommend with two c's. That said, Twelve is a predictable adolescent novel with a ridiculous ending that turns what could be interesting characters into nothing more than caricatures: the pretty, but snobby girl, the angry teens, etc. If you want a quick read that won't leave you caring about its characters or plot, go out and buy. If you want to learn something new about NYC's teenaged elite, this is not the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all about the Benjamins","review":"In this case, the book in question is a pretentious, boring, affected, self-indulgent novella bloated to nearly 250 pages. Its themes are passe, its plot familiar, its characters DOA, its dialogue laughable. I'm 16 years old, and I'm all for celebrating young talent... but this isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"That was four hours of my life I will never get back....","review":"The editorial reviews for this book are good. I thought they may be a little optimistic - trying to give a new, young author a little boost. I wanted to like this book for that same reason. I was sorely disappointed. I found the story to be choppy and rather pointless. Completely without value. Am I being harsh? Probably. Given the number of outstanding, average, and mediocre books out there, I resent wasting even a moment of my time reading a truly horrible one.So, I say to the professionals who reviewed this book: What about the rest of us? It is nice of you to give this young man a little ego boost, but based on your reviews, hundreds of people wasted their valuable time and money. Send me a list of books you liked so I know not to read them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, The Irony!","review":"A pampered rich-boy complete with silver spoon uses his wealth and privilege to get his first book published, a book about the evils of wealth and privilege.

Few, if none, have the connections necessary to get their books published. After reading Twelve, I am convinced that that is a good thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twelve","review":"This book is of average worth. I don't think it was anything special. Any well educated 18 year old with some time on his or her hands could have written it.

Well, it isn;t. It's made up to disguise a lack of imagination and talent on the author's part. oh, and the writing is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"trite rich kid junk","review":"this book didn't deserve to be published. perhaps it had something to do with the fact that the 18-year-old author's godfather is president of Grove Atlantic, the house that published the book, and his parents are famous authors and magazine editors--you think?the writing is pathetic--every single chapter starts with a character's name. this is freshman writing 101. the author has no idea what he's writing about, either; the book is rife with implausibilities (an utterly unconvincing drug trip; a kid who buys machine guns from a corner store; a pampered white kid sent to a NYC jail and finding out that it's 'not so bad'--HA!).The characters are poor, too--it's impossible to tell them apart, to tell who's who. Important character info is lazily withheld until late in the book (the protagonist is a bird enthusiast? what?), when the author was running out of things to say and needed to take up some pages. don't waste your money on this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"as useless as the characters","review":"This book went nowhere. Yes it was a fast read, but so are comic books, which is essentially what this was without the pictures. It's a teen fantasy that ends with what a juvenile mind cant get past: everyone getting shot up by some kid who supposedly walked off the street and into a store and bought a machine gun (and I assume tons of ammo with his spare cash). This rich kid who wrote the book needs to learn a lot more about writing before he should start duping people into buying his swill and fattening his wallet even more. If you're going to build something up as much as this book has been built up, you better have the goods to back it up, and this book just doesn't. It's few poetic exchanges are barely worthy of a raised eyebrow and its over-contrived methaphores reek of obviousness. Save your money. If you want violence and drugs with no plot, turn on the evening news."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bright hype big ...","review":"I too fell for the hype, and even enjoyed the excerpt in the Paris Review, but unfortunately this book epitomizes the notion of overpromise / underdeliver. Some good character ideas, expecially White Mike, but nothing of substance is done with them. The book is written with the subtlety of a bull in a china shop, with none of the many potentials used to any worthwhile measure. While looking for books about adolescent adventures, I tried this, and the next on my list was Trinity Fields, the first two pages of which have thankfully washed Twelve from my memory with its brilliance. Skip this one, and hope that McDonell spends more time developing his inevitable follow-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"book review Twelve","review":"The novel \\"Twelve\\" written by Nick McDonell is about the life of teenagers from the upper eastside of manhattan. The plot is very exciting and because of the fresh and bold spelling the book is very easy to read.The varying aspects give the reader a good insight of the intellectual world of the different characters.Also the shown problems of the teenagers are good to comprehend and the reader can refer them to him-/herself.The book stirs to reflect about the happenings in the story even in real life.I would advise this book especially to younger people who can in my opinion better imagine how the characters feel and can specific learn about what drugs can achieve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than \\"An Expensive Education\\" but not by much","review":"I read \\"An Expensive Education\\", which I thought was terrible. I decided to give this book a try because of all the rave reviews. I only have two positive things to say about this book. Number one is that it was short. I started it on my commute home on a Thursday and finished it on my commute in on a Friday. Secondly, it was a more familiar subject for the author, wealthy Manhattan teens, so the situations and characters made more sense than the ones in \\"An Expensive Education.\\" Overall, it was a snoozefest. Nothing interesting happened and the characters were shallow brats. I hate that it was made into a movie. It is also no surprise to me that the author's godfather was the publisher. hmmm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Straight Garbage, With A Helping Of Nepotism SPOILERS","review":"One of the major problems with this book, I feel, other than the fact that Nick McDonell is a talentless brat, is that it reads like a childrens book but deals with real problems.And the plotholes? Claude, used to do \\"blizzards\\" of cocaine and then kills everyone? What is that? If we apply that logic to the real world, then we'd have there'd be a lot more dead people around.And the chapters? Seriously, dude? One sentence and you're done with the chapter? Take a couple of classes and learn how to write.This kid better count his lucky stars because if his godfather wasn't the head of a publishing company, his \\"manuscript\\" would have gotten laughed into a garbage can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aww poor little rich kids!","review":"So, like we're like totally supposed to relate to these heartless, \\"suffering\\" affluent teens? Hardly. And why does Nick Mcdonell constantly add those cliche \\"teenager\\" words..for example, \\"like...totally...etc..\\" I heard he was an excellent teen author, but if he was he would know those words are quite unnecessary and help to get few points across except that people are dolts. I don't know, it just seems like \\"Twelve\\" lets the readers down. There is little plot, except that perhaps race means more than it should and that money corrupts. Wow, like we didn't already know the latter comment before we read this book.The book seems as if it wants to invoke sympathy, but doesn't quite hit its mark. Instead, I almost felt resentment that people with so much can do so little with it. What a waste--in more ways than one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I have ever read in my life.","review":"I apologize for not being impressed that a 17 year old can publish a book.

This is a book that has one interesting character and he's a bum. That's too bad, since this book is about non-descript rich kids slumming during Christmas break. If these New York City kids think they have it bad because there's too much pressure to spend too much of their parents' money, maybe the should write their angst down in a college-ruled note book and give it to their shrinks instead of begging their fathers to get them to publish the dreck they scribble. No character development, no plot, no emphathy, and no style and up to a just-above-unreadable book. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's amusing how...","review":"...of the reviews that are posted for this book, most of the positive ones are from teens who say \\"I loved it! It was wonderful! I couldnt put it down!\\" and never discuss the merits of the book, while people who hated it tend to get down to details, like the horrible sentence structure, poor plot construction, tendency of the characters to blend into each other and be indistinguishable, and pathetic mimicry of Bret Easton Ellis. Oh yeah, and the utterly ridiculous ending. There is not an ounce of originality in this book. Save your money--don't support bad writing OR nepotism. (Or necrophilia for that matter, but that's a story for another day.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"So so","review":"McDonell himself said in THE OBSERVER, \\"It's like I'm on top of this monstrous mountain of nepotism.\\" Which is true. His father has been an editor of top magazines, his mother is a novelist, his godfather OWNS the company that published TWELVE, and the quotes on the book jacket are all writers who are family friends. This book would not have seen the light of day without those connections. The book is well written FOR A 17 YEAR OLD. But one should not make accomodations for age when laying down money for a book. It's puerile--as might be expected--and half-baked. And contrived. And the writing isn't great, only good. McDonell has been compared to Bret Easton Ellis (another rich kid). I never liked Bret Easton Ellis, either. So if you like him, maybe you'll like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of talent meets sicking nepotism: whee!","review":"As a college student, I felt embarassed for my generation when I read this miserable book. There are better writers on every block of Manhattan than Nick McDonell. Absolutely pathetic. Great to know that his godfather published the book, though, and his dad got it promoted.Joan Didion came to my school a few months ago and gave a talk. At one point, during questions afterward, I asked her point blank why she gave blurbs to books that it seems hard to imagine she could have had any respect for whatsoever. (I didn't mention Twelve by name, but I haven't noticed her name on many other books, and certainly none as wretched as this garbage.) There was a pause and then she sighed and said, \\"You get trapped into it. Old friends ask, and you don't want to put a sour note in decades of friendship because you wouldn't write a sentence or two.\\"Joan Didion is old friends with Nick McDonell's father."},{"rating":"1","title":"very average","review":"reads like a pieced together collection of standard-issue angst - watch the lost manhattan boys and girls flail about - tra la la"},{"rating":"1","title":"At least I finished it....","review":"I'm the only one I know who picked up this book and read the whole thing. While White Mike is interesting as a pro(?)tagonist, this book is a Jay McInerney meets Brett Easton Ellis meets Tama Janowitz nightmare. While the author demonstrates a nice grasp of language, his characters are superficially drawn (as well as being superficial) stereotypes that wander through a book until its complete cliched, trite, ridiculous, cop-out ending. American youth needs a voice, but this guy isn't it. All he does is show what the parents in the Nanny Diaries produced, but at least the Nanny Diaries is entertaining.

Oh yeah, I remeber Connections!","review":"Though this book could have been promising, my skepticism was confirmed even more than I had expected. Being a 19 year old aspiring author who has been writing all through high school and now is majoring in creative writing in college, I only feel more bitter towards the little rich kids who want ot publish a book so they get daddy to hook them up with a sweet deal and plenty of false promotions. When I first heard of Nick McDonell in a magazine, I thought:1) Child Prodigy?or2) Spoiled Brat!This book is a confirmation of the mediocrity that is realeased into our culture through power and money. It saddens me to think that some frustrated prep school kid could get his book published when the rest of us writers no matter what age have to go through hell just to get somebody to read it.In short, I feel sorry for those who bought this book hoping to find something special.

The critics are right when they call this book \\"relentless as acid,\\" I mean c'mon! This book gave me those chills up and down my spine just thinking about how \\"rich\\" people live their lives. I STILL hate some of those characters even though i don't know how hey look.

His knowledge obviously comes from story upon rumor upon and upon (etc), for if he were really \\"in the know\\" he would never have written such a tale published by his GRANDFATHER. This book is the \\"coming of age\\" equivalent of last week's People magazine.From a girl who has been there, but oh-so-sadly missed the bloodbath ending, I recommend you wait for the next magazine article (like last fall's \\"W\\") that claims to have the inner \\"scoop\\"- atleast that will have pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read.

It's hilariously padded out to almost 250 pages, but in reality it should be about 90.

This writer would have done better to turn his back on his parents' literary connections, let life toss him around a little, learn everything he could from the masters of living and of writing, and sit down in front of the computer maybe 10 years from now -- then maybe he would have had a story to tell, maybe he would have made something of his obvious talent.As it is, he'll be a tremendous sensation for the next 10 minutes.

I didn't like this book much at all. For a start, McDonell created characters that I didn't care about... something that is probably the most important job for a writer. If we don't care about a character, why should we care about their story? People say that this book is brilliant because it expresses \\"the vapid, materialistic society which we grow up in today. The sheer lack of emotions and depth is what represents many people\\". I would argue that yes it does do this, but it doesn't make this book brilliant. I think these elements could be expressed in a much better way.The ending.. well, I wont ruin it for you, but I don't think it was shocking enough, or whatever effect McDonell was trying to create.

The solutions are full of typos. The problems are in no way indicative of the ones that appear on the actual GRE, which does not allow use of a calculator. The review at the beginning is not particularly helpful. I can't believe this book is still in print.Stick with the official ETS book, even though it doesn't have solutions.

This is terrible","review":"Typos, answers that are simply wrong, and questions that do not represent the actual exam (thankfully.) If you value these types of things, then this is the book for you! Their review of physics is lacking in most respects, and in some places it seems that the writer didn't really know what they were talking about. Their problems were far too arithmetic than the actual exam, and in (a few) cases didn't even do the physics properly. My recommendation is for you to get the ETS guide, whose tests are actually representative of the GRE. The ETS guide doesn't have a review, but you should be using your textbooks anyway (For example-- \\"Foundation of Modern Physics\\", Tipler.) So, stay as far away from this \\"guide\\" as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS!","review":"I would like to reiterate what's already been said.

The tests are written poorly, with numerous misspellings and mistakes. One of the questions had as choice A \\"constant\\" and as choice E \\"unchanging\\". What is the difference?! Stay away from this book!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A lofty title for a worthless book","review":"As you've probably read in the other listed reviews, the physics review given in this book is worthless.

Also check out www.physicsgre.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"This book is a waste of time. As others have pointed out, the review is less than ten pages of useless physics, while the problems come nowhere near what the actual physics GRE is like. To actually prepare for the physics GRE though, I recommend reviewing your textbooks, working additional problems from there, and getting a few Schaum's outlines, which have tons of solved and unsolved problems and a good review. Then take the actual ETS tests timed to get used to the strategy of fast-paced multiple choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"dreadful","review":"I can only echo everyone else's sentiments. The questions are totally unrepresentative. I got in the low 600s on the REA exam and 950 on the real GRE. So it's useless as a diagnostic: looking at these exams will distract you from what's actually important for the real test. And it's useless as a review of physics, since its poorly written and riddled with errors.I'm in grad school now, and it seems like everyone knows about and dislikes this book. Even my research advisor bashed it.For test practice and diagnostics, get the ETS's book--used if you have to, since they seem to have stopped printing them. If you feel you need to review the physics, get Halliday Resnick or something similar. Do NOT buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is absolutely horrible","review":"this is my first and probably last review.this book is a _waste_of_time_. the problems are interesting, but are too time consuming, tend to be esoteric, and worst of all have almost nothing to do with the physics gre.the review section is much worse. it's characterized by bad, unconventional notation, wrong definitions(!!), and very incomplete coverage of important concepts.don't by this book, it's worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Believe all the bad reviews, horrible GRE prep. AVOID!","review":"I figured for only a few bucks I could risk ignoring the bad reviews and go ahead and get this book. Horrible decision! The practice questions are NOTHING like what's on the test--they require much more derivation and calculation than is feasible in the actual test. One of the most important things in prepping for the GRE Physics is learning the tricks of the test (dimensional analysis, order of magnitude, etc) which this book is useless for. Only potential saving grace is a somewhat (but not really) helpful few pages of review, but even that uses labeling so obscure that it's more hassle than it's worth. I've talked about this book with several other people, and they all agree it's a completely useless book. Do not waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal.","review":"As many have noted: riddled with errors, and irrelevant in so far as an actual GRE test goes.

In addition, the review material doesn't correspond well with the practice test material. Most of the questions are pulled from material not found in the book's review. The author's thought process is not at all easy to follow when examining problem solutions. It's nice to have \\"your own way\\" of doing problems, but for crying out loud, you've written this book to help others, and it's not doing that at all. I doubt that many of my professors could've earned a passing grade on these stupid tests.I don't know where the \\"Spotlight Reviewer\\" got his credentials from, but this book is absolutely useless, and the amount of dissenting opinions here should make that abundantly clear. I will greatly enjoy burning this book after I successfully pass the Subject Exam *without* its help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, is this a bad book.","review":"It must be the only people who buy this book are librarians or other people who don't look at it before they buy it. I took a \\"sample exam\\" about 2 month before taking the physics GRE. I got a 510 on it. On the actual exam I got a 940.This book misrepresents the GRE questions to such an extent that a person using it can only be hurt by it. The questions in their \\"practice exams\\" fall into 2 categories: 1)rote memorization (what are the magic numbers, e.g.) that is hardly done on the actual exam, and 2)questions that take a lot longer than the 1.7 minutes normally allotted for the time per question. Only a few questions on the actual GRE are like that.Somebody needs to sue these people. They are getting away with theft.If you want a decent review, get the ETS' edition. It's not perfect, but at least you know the questions are representative. If you want a solution to a question you don't know, go ask your prof--that's what I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless Book","review":"The only concievable use for this book is to maybe use it for a general review, since the questions are absolutely nothing like real GRE questions. Most GRE questions can be answered without a complete calculation, whereas the questions provided require calculations.And, as for using it as review of physics- it is incomplete, unclear in places, and uses terrible non-standard notation.Simply stated, it is not worth buying. Thankfully, I got my copy free from the department."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book annoys me.","review":"I can point out many reasons why this book must never be bought. The main two are. The review is ridiculously basic. At least, here in Brasil, every high school student knows 70-80% of everything that is written there.. There are lots of errors through the tests. Sometimes the questions are wrong, sometimes the choices are wrong, others the resolution is wrong. And believe me, there are cases where all three are simultanously wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the best book.","review":"Having gone through the rigors of being a Physics undergrad required to take the Physics GRE to get to grad school, I would not reccomend this book as a good study aid. With all due respect to the author(s?), the tests are simply not on the same level as the actual Physics GRE - the problems are way too involved (too many steps and too many numbers) and require memorization of some facts that need not be memorized for the real exam.A much better course of action would be to purchase the book published by the ETS. I would also get the newest edition of Halliday, Resnick, Walker as well as a good modern physics book to use as study materials. A complete mastery of the content of those texts, coupled with a VERY rudimentary understanding of higher-level E&M, classical mechanics, and quantum mechanics can get a student into the 70th-80th percentile."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not that good.","review":"This book is not that effective in studying for the physics GRE. Most of the problems would NEVER be asked on a GRE (~70%). Only about 30% of the problems are useful, and I would say that the physics review is not even that good. To put things in perspective, I found the ETS book to be FAR more helpful, even though it contains no solutions and 3 tests. (As opposed to Molitoris which contains 4 tests with solutions.) Also, the solutions are filled with mistakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"There are many other reviews saying exactly the same thing, so I'll keep this short and to the point. This is useless as a preparation for the GRE Physics subject test. Many of the questions require a calculator, which of course means they aren't very close to questions you can expect on the actual test. Some have argued that the book is still nice because it gives a concise summary of major topics which will be on the test, but really all it gives is lists of formulae. Assuming you've taken physics courses, you should have all this material in your textbooks and course notes anyway. There is absolutely no reason to spend your money on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I disagree with Vishal","review":"It was very useful for me to study from this book,I studied from Resnick, Goldstein etc. and thanks to this books I realized that I was studying a boring subject,the problems from this book are boring and not a big challengeso I decided to move into math.Now I am preparing for the GRE math test and I am happier than before.Thanks to everybody, I found the light at the end of the tunnel,"},{"rating":"1","title":"serious daddy issues","review":"i thought it would be more about her sex life and the author getting down and dirty...instead, this book was dedicated to the author trying to explain her sick daddy issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"cover","review":"the cover was not the right one for the case and it had been cut in half and you could see what it was from the edge"},{"rating":"2","title":"pillow","review":"I love my jolly rancher pillow but i would not get it for little kids because sometimes they break and the little microfibers fall out"},{"rating":"1","title":"Happy Customer","review":"My son wanted this for Christmas.

Much of what Cairnes says is absolutely true and historically supported. Some of his contentions are subjective and can not be proven in fact or historical reflection. The introduction of the recent edition, written by Mark Smith, points out numerous errors and inconsistencies that crept into the work in 1862. John Cairnes, himself, is very redundant.

I enjoyed reading about her differences with David, and was especially intrigued by her decade long stay in Russia. I do wish that May would have fleshed some of her story out more in some instances. For example, when she says on page 41 that the Dauphin died under mysterious circumstances, this is much less a mystery. He was terribly abused, and mention of this would have made our understanding of the famous painting that much more tragic. I also would have liked to have a better understanding of how she ran a salon and painted portraits at the same time. On the other hand, May includes many interesting details about her escape into Italy, penniless with a young daughter in tow. I also enjoyed reading about her amusing effort to paint Germaine de Stael in an attractive manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously Disappointing","review":"This book is seriously disappointing.

A total waste of money!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to clean","review":"I purchased this back in April and I've been very happy with it. Its very easy to clean--the front grill comes right off, I rinse it when I rinse the prefilter. Prefilter dries quickly, just roll it in a towel to dry. I have heard others comment about the noise, but I welcome it and would consider it white noise which helps me sleep better. Would recommend purchasing this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WELL MADE","review":"After about a month of casual use the fan became very loud even on low, severely limiting the usefullness of the product.Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfied","review":"My wife was having a lot of trouble sleeping every night because of the dust and allergens in my house. She would constantly wake up in the middle of the night, sit up, and complain that she couldn't breath.I got one of these for the bedroom, ran it on high the whole day that I got it, then turned it down to low and left it on ever since. She has seen almost a complete turnaround since. She sleeps all night, she says she can breathe easily now, and we both get a great night's sleep. Even I have noticed better sleep in myself, and I wasn't even having trouble before getting it. I never noticed the smell in the room before, but she claims that it took that out of the air too.The filter is very easy to clean, just pop off the front and vacuum it out. I definitely recommend getting one of these. I plan to get one for the livingroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bang for my buck","review":"Nice and small, it's compact enough to keep above a chest of drawers and powerful enough to keep our entire 2nd floor (it's a converted attic, approximately 10' x 30') free of that dingy, dusty scent that seemed to plague it. A bit noisy on the highest setting, but if you only use it during the day when you're not home, who cares?Works well at the 2nd highest setting, also. And this setting is much quieter and less distracting."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked great for only 3 weeks","review":"I bought this filter about six weeks ago. I have allergies and asthma, this filter allowed me to sleep threw the night and not wake up with an asthma attack. It was alittle loud but I like the white noise when im sleeping. When i used it in the living room i had to turn the tv up a bit. It also left a black ring on the table i usually had it on but it washed off pretty easilly. After abought 3 weeks of use it pretty much stoped filtering the air, and my asthma attackes returned. It also doesnt run as loudly anymore, or suck up as much air. I took it apart and cleaned it as recomended, and no change. So it worked great for 3 weeks but thats kinda a waste of money if it only lastes 3 weeks. So now i have to buy a new one this time i will spend more money and hopefully get a better product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't leave it on for too long","review":"If you're the type of person who is allergic to almost about anything whether it's mildew, mold, dust, or dander, then this is the product for you. I got this for my room and it made me breath much better. I had a hard time breathing sometimes because of the thick dirty air (?). However, I would warn you that if you keep it on for too long, you start to realize the air is getting a funky smell - sort of like plastic. I think that's when the ionizer has been left on for too long. I say, only turn it on for like 30-45 mins everyday or every other day. Otherwise, this is a great product for a bedroom!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for what you pay","review":"This tiny little filter was my first buy and an attempt to stop the consant stneezing in the office as well as cut down on the dust/pet dander that kept clogging up my desktop computer. It seems to work well: no more sneezes! It's very easy to get going and fits nearly anywhere. My only negative so far has been that trying to get the front grating off to clean the various filters is quite painful on the fingers. Otherwise, a great product for a small area."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for small, personal air purifier.","review":"I have it running in my room, and it seems to clean the air well. It is a tad noisy, but I may relocate it away from the bed. It is NOT for large rooms, it is small. It can also be for someone who cannot afford the more expensive air purifiers. I give it an 8 out of 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good product.","review":"It works..and I think that's the whole idea. It makes noise because the fan is moving air, but I don't think it's excessive or annoying. Good solid unit that helps get airborne allergins out of the air. If your air is making you sneeze and nose run, then try this. It helped me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for me!","review":"I read the reviews on line and was a little hesitant, but ordered it anyways. It's designated purpose is to clear a small basement room where smokers coverge. I must say, it doesn't immediately clear the smoke but when left on overnite after a crowd of 4 smokers, the room smells fresh in the morning. It is a bit loud-I don't think i'd want it running in my bedroom, but for my purposes it's terrific."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Noisy!!!!","review":"I was excited that this is small enough to place on top of the entertainment center in our living room and also that it has a permanent filter. Other reviews describe it as \\"quiet\\". Well, the one I have is VERY noisy!On the low speed, I have to turn the TV up to hear it over the sound of the air purifier. On \\"med\\" or \\"high\\" it is too noisy to focus on any other sound in the room! I don't even run it anymore (after a month) because it is just too noisy.I have another large air purifier as well as an ionizer in other rooms, both of which are much quieter than this machine!I took a chance on this machine as it had overall good reviews and a low price. I am VERY DISSAPOINTED!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grinding/Clicking noise coming from the fan area!","review":"I have purchased two of these items. I liked the first item so much that I purchased a second one. Unfortunately, when I opened the second one, it immediately had a HORRIBLE clicking/grinding noise coming from the fan area. I returned the item for a prompt refund. I thought it might have been a fluke, but that appears not to be the case.I really hoped that the first one would continue to work well, but it too is now beginning to show signs of the same clicking/grinding noise only a couple weeks after we set it up. While it is bearable at this point, I have a feeling it will get to the same unbearable point that the other one did.If you decide to purchase this product, I suggest that you keep the packaging for the 30 day return window, just in case you have the same problem I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"NIce, quiet but bright","review":"Great unit, compact size. Small shipping box. Runs quietly and efficiently - a little loud on the maximum setting. Great for master bedroom. Noticable increase in air quality after one day of operation. The ionizer when activator turns ona green nigth light kinda thing. Really bright, like I cant sleep with that light on bright. Part of the units night light feature but annoying when all you want is the ionization.For the price/size/filtration its a great choice compared to lots of others on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy","review":"Unit was returned because I thought was too loud. In addition I tried it for 5 days in a room where I keep my cat litter box. Left it run 24 hrs. and didn't help the air at all or dust. Filters did not look like they were picking anything up at all. The room size is a 10x10, 100 sq ft. so I'd guess partly my fault since the specs say room size 85 sq ft. Still doesn't explain why filters not even picking up though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too noisey","review":"This is the third air cleaner I've purchased.

Can't speak of the efficiancy; didn't have it long enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"loudest purifier ever","review":"Not sure if i got the defect product or what, this purifier is extremely loud and it whistles. The whistling noise becomes louder and stronger when it's set on the lowest level. I'm fine with the white noises (have 3 purifiers at home currently - the type that needs to replace the filters) but i just can't stand the sharp whistling. I tried for one night and it drove me nuts, so i had to return it. The return process with Amazon was wonderful. I didn't even have to take it to the UPS store. Amazon had UPS picked it up from my home. Love Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far I think it's great","review":"I've owned this about a month now. It's small and meant for smaller spaces.

Loud. and my place needs cleaning... nothing in the filter after 2 weeks of running. Blah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too noisy to use; washable prefilter","review":"It's nice that it's compact, but even the quietest setting is unbearably loud.The filter light is constantly coming on. I've replaced it with a different filter in the room, and there are other filters in the house; none need a prefilter fix as often as this one days.Taking off the cover, washing the filter (I've come to expect carbon prefilters, so a washable filter that stays in the machine seems strange), waiting for it to dry, putting it back together -- it's a pain when it indicates it wants it done every week or two. Especially when it's not even dirty.But the noise factor alone makes the thing useless. It's ridiculous. In a small room, that noise is the only thing that exists. It might possibly be a good filter, but if I can't even turn it on, it's a never-used, useless filter."},{"rating":"1","title":"air purifier","review":"Works okay but a little large and not quite strong enough except for just one room. Still use it daily but have purchased a larger one for the house"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big deal!?","review":"I just don't get what the hype is about. It's done absolutely nothing for us. I bought this for our bedroom while my Husband is going through chemotherapy and I don't feel that it's improved the air quality at all.

I would return it, but being overseas, it's not worth the cost, time, or trouble. I found a unit that was almost identical at a thrift shop and brought that home. I put the nice and clean filter from the honeywell into this new unit. It didn't last through the night, running on 'high'. Both fans are dead in the exact same way. The motor doesn't start, turn, hum, anything. It acts like it isn't getting any electricity. I've taken it apart and nothing seems wrong. I think the motor just burned out. So I'm going to call this one a loss. Now to look for a filter made by someone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid room air cleanmer","review":"Good table top air cleaner.

The thing is totally not working. Anyways, if youare like me, looking something for your allergy, this is probablynot the one."},{"rating":"1","title":"All parts would be nice!","review":"I couldn't even tell you how well my air purifier works.

I purchase from Amazon quite often, good customer lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works better with HEPA filter removed.","review":"At first this purifier worked ok, but after a while it lost airflow.

I am now looking for another air purifier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"Ok, I tried this and I can say I don't like it. I got a vacuum filter and a flashlight to test this. I got the air purifier blowing in my face and created some dust in the air. I could see the dust blowing into my face and it irritated my eyes. The only reason that this got two stars, is because it made white noise that helped me fall asleep. Overall, good white noise maker, bad air purifier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"We ordered this a few months ago, and it's great.

I smoke in my room, as well as have 2 dogs, and after plugging it in, after no longer than 5 minutes could I tell a difference. My room tends to be dusty, so I'm hoping it will help with that. It's not terribly loud, but if you can't stand white noise, this might not be for you. I like it cause it helps me sleep. Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept me healthy","review":"Every year for the past 5 years I have gotten bronchitis every september/october. Not this year! I had the air purifier running in my bedroom 24/7 since I bought it this past August. I could smell and feel the difference in the air when going into my bedroom from the living room. Even having it run 24/7 with the ionize feature on the filter stayed \\"clean\\" until May 28th. A simple cleaning of the filter and it is ready to go again! I am very pleased with this purchase.On a side note it does make the perfect amount of white noise, and I do love white noise when I am trying to sleep, so for those who do not like it be warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noise is louder than expected","review":"After reading the reviews I was psyched to have this awesome air purifier with a \\"white noise\\" kind of sound.

But I'm hoping I get used to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"irritating noise","review":"The best experience is when I turn it off. The noise, even on the lowest setting, is heard in other rooms.

I'm usually not sensitive to noise but I can't sleep with this machine on medium or high. Low is bearable but only because I don't mind the white noise.Also, I bought this thinking it would help my allergies in the morning by cutting down on the mold (I live in an old building) but it hasn't helped at all. It's possible it would work on high, but then I wouldn't be able to sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"good machine","review":"It works well. It is quiet to use.

My husband has a website and spends lots of time there, and as a smoker, and also with a woodstove and 3 dogs, I was tired of washing the walls and windows in the winter.It's saved my walls and windows, along with another larger unit in an opposite corner of our main room. Easy to clean and wash, no expense for filters like my 600.00 model (which is now in the bedroom and pretty much worthless). The noise on medium is certainly tolerable and not offensive in the least, and draws all smoke directly into the unit. Honeywell is certainly the best of all the units we've had, or experienced in our construction business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Odor Emits from this brand new purifier","review":"HelloWe purchased the Honeywell HHT-011 Air Purifier a couple of days ago. Ran it for about 2 hours, then had to put it back in the box as the black pre-filter emits a horrible odor.

It was almost impossible to remove the front cover to install the filter to begin use. Called customer service and they could not help either. Finally yanked it off and installed it with the idea that if it comes apart the next time I will just throw it away.Filters the air in an 11 x 12 foot room okay but is almost as noisy as a leaf blower in doing so. I would not buy this product again and would not recommend it at any price over $10.00."},{"rating":"2","title":"WORKS GREAT","review":"I purchased this air purifier because it has a permanent filter. I have owned several air purifiers but they all required replacment filters, and even though the purifiers themselves were fairly cheep ( about $20) the filters were not. Replacment filters for a cheep purifier tipicly cost about $7 to $12 but they need to be replaced every month. So after a couple of years I finally started paying attention to how much I was actually spending and I realized that I could have bought several higher quality purifiers like the \\"honeywell\\" for what I was paying for replacment filters. The Honeywell HHT-011's filter is easy to clean and it catches a lot of dust and polin, and it has really helped my allergies. The fan is not as quiet as advertised but i'm one of those people who cant sleep unless I have a fan running and I really enjoy the white noise it creates so it actually helps me with two problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Noisy but good","review":"i was a little disappointed at the amount of noise this little guy makes. i usually like white noise when i sleep, but even on the lowest setting this thing wakes me up multiple times after my rem sleep (usually 4 or 5am). a noisy devil, but works well and you cant beat the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad.","review":"I read a lot of reviews about how loud this thing is. I would agree about the high setting being a little loud but not unbearable. Medium is fine and low is hardly noticeable. When you have the Ionizer on, the light is as bright as the \\"Night Light\\". Which is a little bit of an overkill to add to the product but whatever. So far a week of using it has me liking it overall. It does the job, and for the price--unbeatable. I'm using it in a bedroom and notice less dust in the air. Shipment was fast and arrived in good condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vibrates constantly unless placed on a towel","review":"It does work well, the room air seems cleaner and fresher but the unit is very loud, I was unable to get used to it in 2 weeks at the low setting due to a low thrumming and vibrating sound, at medium speed the vibration lessens quite a bit if the unit is placed upon a towel while it is on the dresser.It is definately NOT quiet at all, on loud settings I can actually hear it from downstairs with the bedroom closed and I doubt that anyone with decent hearing could sleep with that much noise.I usually put it on high when I am not home and then I put it on medium while I am sleeping.I quit using the ionizing feature as I feel it made the room smell odd.I would not purchase this again, I would purchase a higher quality more expensive one.Not sure if I can still return this after 3 months but if I can I certainly will as it is making more and more noises as time passes."},{"rating":"2","title":"rock steady","review":"while not great for large rooms, but for a bedroom, it works really well. i use it weekly. and the fan is strong enough to work on a room about 100 square foot bedroom and clears it in a couple hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"too loud","review":"Its too loud.

My husband was looking for a smaller unit that he could take to his office at his work. However, once he set it up and turned it on, he got several complaints right away about the noise. His office is approximately 8 feet X 10 feet. He brought it home and I tried it in our home office that is about 10 feet X 12 feet. I also thought that the purifier was too noisy. Finally we decided to try it in a bigger room that was 17 feet X 34 feet and it was still too noisy. So that was three strikes and we returned the unit. This was all at the slowest speed. There was no reason for us to try the medium and highest speeds. We tried to get it to work in 3 different rooms, but when its gotta go, its gotta go. We have other purifiers that are much, much, much quieter even at their higher speeds. So back to the drawing board we go.

It was not a deal breaker for me though. As for it's main job, clearing the air, it works very well indeed. However, even though I knew it would be loud I didn't think it would be that loud. Wow. Even on low it would be too loud in to watch tv I think. I have it in my computer room so that's ok. I haven't had it long enough to clean the filters yet, but it looks fairly straight forward. It cleaned the air in my computer room, that's all I was after."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is NOT QUIET!!!!","review":"HHt-011 is a bit noisy for any reviewers to call it \\"quiet\\" even on LOW setting.

I wanted to buy another one but the price of 300 dollars blew away my budget.

When it was working properly, it gave out a good white noise. When the rattle starts in, it is very annoying.I have called for the warranty, and they want me to ship it back, and pay a $10.00 processing fee.

It worked pretty well for that time and we were happy with the purchase. However after a few months the change filter light came on & stayed on even after several cleanings & we had been keeping up on cleanings before this point. There is a warning with it that if it runs while dirty it becomes a fire hazard so we had to toss it out not knowing if it was just a defective light or not. We smoke & my guess is it became gummed up internally & the white color was also not smoking friendly as it quickly became discolored so I can't recommend this for smoking homes. I like the idea of a home air purifier & will probably purchase a heavier duty model in the future but for now we just decided to keep the smoke outdoors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this one.","review":"At least based on the one I bought it's a wate of money.

I have plenty of fresh air elsewhere in my condo from windows that I can open, so the bedroom had become something of a dead air space.The Honeywell HHT-011 makes the air in my bedroom smell fresh and sweet.

I recommend - especially for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Results","review":"This is a terrific little air purifier. I have asthma, suffer from chronic broncitis and my husaband also has chronic sinus problems. This Honeywell compact air purifier has really made a difference each night in our master bedroom. We love the subtle white noise and have really noticed a difference in the morning. No coughing, less congestion. Did I mention that I have a cat sleeping on my pillow with me? I am amazed how much better my breathing has been since we started using this air purifier. Our dog has even stopped sneezing too. (I think he's allergic to the cat.) Highly recommend this product. Great value. Easy to clean the filter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little Air Purifier","review":"This Honeywell Air Purifier is small yet capable. With removable, readily cleanable filters it also saves you money on replacements. It's quiet with a long cord and sits easily on an end table. A good buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"LOUD","review":"I've had this for over a month. I put one in my daughters' bedroom and one in their toy room. The toy room one broke within 3 days. A piece of the fan flew off. The one in their bedroom is so loud that they constantly complain. Worse is that I do not feel it's effective, even in their small bedroom. I have other purifiers in the house and this one doesn't compare. I wouldn't buy it again. I'm actually looking to replace it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets louder the longer it's on","review":"I was happy with it the first time we used it. Low speed was very quiet, for the first few days. Compact size that fit on a shelf. However, before too long it got llouder. It starts whisper quiet, but after a few hours it's too loud and we had to turn up the tv. High setting is like a loud hair dryer, by the way. I'm feeling too lazy to return it because of its cheap price, but we have to turn it on when we pollute the air, then in a little while, turn it off again. Rats. It works pretty quickly to clean the air even in a big room."},{"rating":"2","title":"A s described","review":"My mom smokes over a pack a day. She is old and stays in one room. This purifier cleared and cleaned all the smoke that builds up in room. For a little product it does a great job. I think people.get carried away with noise. The purifier makes a constant low noise that cant be heard when tv is on. Just rinse filter once a month. Great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets the Job Done but Loud!","review":"I bought this Air Purifier for use during spring time while I was in college. During the spring and summer time, pollen counts were high where I was living at and I would always be sneezing or have runny nose.Since I got this unit, I basically left it on when I'm not in my room, usually for about 8 to 10 hours. After leaving it on for first the day, I started to notice improvement. Less runny nose and the air felt cleaner. However, why would I only leave it on while I'm gone? Well, the unit is quite loud, especially too loud when I sleep.Overall, this unit gets the job done, but it is quite loud while in use. It's good for the price, but minus 1 star for it's loudness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Filters and deodorizes the air well.","review":"The filters are easy to remove and clean.Nightlight is just bright enough, and is useful.Ionizer switch also has a separate light when turned on.The product works. The air feels cleaner after using overnight. The ionizer deodorizes as well.I would purchase this product again, and I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"took care of allergies-but very loud","review":"My wife has various allergies and before bed,it was a miserable time for her with sneezes,etc.I got her one of these air purifiers and in only a few days,the allergy symptoms disappeared. These are very effective at cleaning the air.The only drawback is that they are rather loud;so much so that we both turn the unit on \\"high\\" as soon as we get home from work and leave them on w/ the door closed until bed-time. So,be warned,they are good and inexpensive air purifiers,but are pretty loud. Some may have no problem w/ leaving them on at night but that didn't work for us.If not for their loudness,I'd give them five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost too good.","review":"Bought this product because I live in a one bedroom apartment with a husband who smokes. I was looking for something to clear the air so I could breath and not have burning watering eyes. This purifier is so good that I can't even smell my glade plug in anymore. On the down side it is a lot nosier then advertised. Not super noisy but if the bathroom exhaust fan bothers you then your not going to like the sound of this machine. As a purifier it is excellent!!!!!! Almost too good. I miss my scented candle smells."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"This is a nice little unit. I put it in my bathroom because my husband insists on smoking in there. We leave it running all day. Its a little noisy on the highest setting, but seems to be fine on the second. It also has a little blue nightlight to see if you need to turn it on at night or find it in the dark. The cord is a little short. I havent tried to clean the filter yet, but that should be interesting with the smoke. Our towels are not all yellow and neither is the shower so its definitely working!! I wouldnt try to use it in a large room though as I notice that it takes a bit of time to do the job. Great product for the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect for my needs at a decent price","review":"I am using this in my daughter's room. She has allergies (dust mite,danders, grass, ragweed etc.) and had been coughing for months. I have noticed a great improvement in her sleep, far less coughing. On high speed this is a little loud, but not as loud as an a/c at all. Medium speed sounds like a fan and low is just white noise. My kids like sleeping to the sound of a fan...so medium speed is perfect for us. The fact that you can wash the filter and do not have to buy replacement filters is what drew me to this purchase...not a lot available at this price point that have washable filters. Very happy and back to buy a second for my son!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Noisy but works well for cigarette smoke","review":"We have been using this for about a week and aside from the noise we are happy with it so far.This is definitely noisy, but we keep it in the room of our apt. where we smoke and it definitely gets rid of the smoke smell and it sucks up the smoke too if you are sitting close to it, which is nice if it is cold outside & you have to keep your windows closed.Unfortunately it is pretty loud, but if you don't mind the noise it's a good value.(imagine the sound of your average, inexpensive box fan on the high, medium, and low settings - that's about how noisy this air purifier is in my opinion)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I decided to try it!","review":"I read through all the reviews and almost didn't buy it because of all the complaints about noise, but I decided to try it anyway as its features where the best within my price range. I am so glad I decided to give it a try! I plugged it in and Surprise! Surprise! it sounded like a fan. (major eye roll moment) Do people really expect that an item designed to move large amounts of air through a filter wouldn't sound like a fan?? Like having a fan running during the summer it quickly becomes background noise. I've only had it plugged in for a few hours and I'm already sneezing less!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but LOUD","review":"PROS:-Easy to maintain.-No filter replacement needed.-Compact size.CONS:-VERY LOUD.-Nightlight is a joke (very small)Basically, if you use this consistently and constantly (like I do), you will find that on LOW it sounds about like a fan. If you are looking for something quiet, this is NOT the right choice. Besides that it's ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy little fan filter at a crappy little price","review":"Honeywell generally makes good products (I own another Honeywell that I really like) but this model is very cheaply made and noisier than it should be for its size. The only advantage this model has is that the prefilter can be cleaned in the sink and the HEPA filter can be vacuumed (you do have a HEPA vacuum cleaner to vacuum the HEPA filter, right?). I hesitated before I bought it and wish that I had followed my gut instinct. You don't have to spend hundreds of dollars to get a good HEPA filter, but you do need to spend more than $40."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Durability","review":"After two weeks worth of use, the motor start making grinding noises so I had to return it. Worked pretty well up until then though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud","review":"So I bought this air filter for our son's room after we had purchased the hamilton beach one for our daughter's room. I just thought that both were so similar that I'd like to see how this one compared. We were immediately disappointed. The quiet setting was rather loud and at a pitch that was irritating to our ears. The only option is for this to sit flat, not stand up, so that was a minor disappointment also...it's nice to be able to stand the air filter up. The ionizer made it smell funny...needless to say, we packed it up immediately, shipped it back and got another hamilton beach one."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"The sound is too noise.I just need to turn on when no body in the room.When we sleep i must turn it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's kind if loud.","review":"I have only owned this purifier for a little over a month.

It remove's odors quite satisfactorally! No complaint's here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap for a reason","review":"This air purifier works decently well for a little while. I bought it because one doesn't need to buy additional filters. It says you can clean the one it comes with. You can.

I live under several large trees that dump lots of pollen and other particulate into the air. At night I used to be able to see thousands of motes floating on the air.I purchased three of these little units, one for each section of my tri-level home. The air becomes perfectly clear after only a few hours of operation - no motes visible.I'm not sure how to analyze the ionization function - I use it, but I'm not sure how to tell what effect it has.The night light is actually helpful.The filters are permanent - just vaccuum them out and you are good to go.The Bad:I purchased three of these. One of them has a problem with a bearing and has become quite loud. I'll have to replace it as the noise is intollerable. The other two remain very quiet on the middle setting.The unit has a light that is supposed to come on when it's time to clean the filter - as far as I can tell this doesn't really work."},{"rating":"2","title":"could have been worse","review":"i didn't notice any change at all for the first couple days, but once it got everything out of the air i started to notice a change. i did have to the door closed to the room it was in and the room was smaller than what it said it could handle. i wouldn't use it on a room any bigger that what it is ment for.worked great in a closet to take the musty smell out of my marching uniform though"},{"rating":"2","title":"My nose feels better.","review":"This was the latest addition to my allergy free zone (aka my bedroom). Along with washing bed linens weekly, employing mattress and pillow protectors, dusting, and never letting our pets in the room, this HEPA filter has helped me and my spouse breath easier at night. We both snore a little softer, and wake up with less crud in our noses & throats. The room the filter is in is slightly bigger than the recommended dimensions, but it seems to work okay. It's a HEPA filter... so it's noisy... but it does have three fan settings as well as an ionic option. We use the \\"quiet\\" fan at night... which drowns out soft snoring and heavy breathing. On that setting, the fan is more than loud enough to hear through the ear plugs I sleep in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work for smoke","review":"I got this specifically to help with cigarette smoke.

The product worked great and the noise was gentle enough for a baby to sleep (if you like background noise such as white noise) My son's runny nose went away quickly but after just a few months, the motor quit working. YEsterday the machine started making weird noises. This concerned me as an electronic fire risk in my child's room! I unplugged it, waited a few moments, them plugged it back in and the machine completely stopped working.While I think this machine used to be great, the fact that it stopped working within a few months is a big let down.

Turned it on and it made a horrible sound. It sounds like it is rubbing against the fan or something. You could move it around turning it on its side and the sound would change.

Sure, my living area is much better than Honeywell recommends using it in. We have a smelly old couch, dogs, and smelly cooking. But, I still noticed that this air purifier reduces the smells in there really well. I usually turn it on high in the living room and leave it overnight, and turn it on low in my bedroom.I've vacuumed it out in the week or so I've had it. Didn't see much dust in it.

I cannot read, concentrate, play (acoustic) music or sleep. I wonder how people can ever keep this ON while in the same room, which is meant to be small. Since I invested already, I decided to keep running loudly while I'm off to work and turn it off in the evening. To give you some idea how loud this is when it is at the lowest setting, it sounds like a work-horse (say 2.5-3 GHz) tower computer with cheep (e.g, ones that come with the pre-built desktop without upgrade) fan(s). I can hear this running from the other end of my flat condo of 800 sqft with mid to high setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good!","review":"It seems to be working great, be sure to read the directions! It is kind of loud, but I'm using it for my bedroom and the white noise doesn't bother me.

Been using it for a week about 12 hours a day and I'm satisfied, noticed a reduction of dust in the air.Update: It provided a service light, so I removed the filter and cleaned it but the light remains... it still runs but I am going to take another look at the instruction manual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy Bulky & A Dissapointment","review":"So the first one we got was making horrible clanky noises when we first turned it on.

At first the noises were quieted but placing a piece of cardboard between the body and the filter cover. That is no longer working (almost a year later). I use it only when we really need it (like cleaning the air vents or kitty's littler box) and then it goes under the counter. It's large, bulky, noisy and an overall dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"This unit is LOUD","review":"I've had a Honeywell tower purifier for years and wanted a desktop model for my office. The price on this one was right, but in the end the joke's on me. It has three speed settings and an on/off for the ionic cleaning. The lowest speed is nearly as loud as my Holmes tower's highest speed. You can hear it on Low from the other side of the house. Other than the noise, it seems to be working fine. The only problem is that I don't often run it on Med or High due to the noise, so it's probably not as effective as it could be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy craftsmanship","review":"The clip on the front grill broke off when I was following the instructions to get it open.

It's not as bad as time passes.-There are rubber pads about the size of a middle finger glued on the back to help if it gets dropped or knocked around. One keeps coming off. I will have to super glue it.I am not sure if this item is actually doing anything beneficial for me. I wanted to get something like this because there is a smoker in the family, and the carpeting in my room is old and gives off a bit of a musty odor. I haven't noticed any fresher air, or less dust, just another gadget sitting around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisey and smells","review":"I have chosen to return it since it is very noisey and has a bad plastic smell to it. It did appear to work somewhat since there was already some dust trapped in the Hepa filter but the noise was unbearable even on the lowest fan setting as was the funky plastic smell. My old Holmes 2400 are much quieter than this machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and quiet","review":"This unit is super quiet! I plugged it in and cranked it up as soon as it came so I could see whether we would be able to use it in our baby's nursery. I was looking for something compact, inexpensive and moderately quiet. I ran it for about 6 hours and immediately I can notice a difference in the air. I will continue to run it everyday until the baby arrives next month and will update my experience to see how much the filter has captured at that time ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too noisy to be usable in bedroom or a quiet office.","review":"I really wanted to like this unit. The allure of never having to purchase filters was too much to resist. On the lowest setting, the unit is noisier than any other small air filter I've ever purchased. Especially distracting while talking on the phone in my home office. As far is using in the bedroom... not an option for me. This unit also emits a mild but noticeable plastic smell while directly in front of it. I only ran the unit for two hours so the smell may dissipate over time. One other possible issue for some... this unit claimed 99% efficiency. It was my understanding that true HEPA filters operate at 99.99%. I must confess that I tend to be keenly aware of background noise and odors although I've owned a number of air filters over the years and this is the first one I've returned. All that said, you may not be as concerned as I was."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't the model I received","review":"I ordered this model, the HHT-011, because it had a permanent filter. I received the HHT-016-MP, which isn't a HEPA and has two replaceable filters, and I realized the mistake wasn't mine after the time to return it had lapsed. I had a non-HEPA air purifier that I wanted to replace because I the filters were discontinued, and I didn't want to fall into that trap again, but here I am.Note to all: when you get this, don't rip it open and plug it in. It might not be what you ordered."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"It is a lowest quality product there is: noisy and getting noisier every day, it starts vibrating more and more, plastic parts are falling off, smells plastic staff and so on.

I have tried to make it work and give it the benefit of the doubt. But I have tried a few experiments with it and I am SURE that it is not removing anything from my air in my bedroom. I have the bedroom door shut and it still doesnt even touch the dust on the top of the dressers. I clean them and keep a watch and it is right back even after using this on HIGH. I wish it worked but I am afraid I will have to try a bigger one or something. I want clean air. and the dust on my dresser tells me that this is NOT cleaning the air. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"I would advise not purchasing this product. I believe the motor in the unit is of poor quality. Tilt it in any direction and it noticably wavers. This is not the sign of a long lasting motor. Additionally, the unit is too loud to sleep to, especially in a 10'x8' room. It generates a choppy fan noise about three times a normal air conditioner.I can't comment on its air cleaning capabilities because I am returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good...","review":"It was good while it lasted.

Since using this product, we've both found some relief.Of course you cannot expect a miracle from simply removing irritants from the air inside your home, but there is less dust, dander, and cat hair floating about.The item make a big of noise, but it is a nice, soothing white noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEGATIVE STARS!!!","review":"I don't know how some people say that it produces \\"white noise.\\" The thing sounds like an airplane warming up its engines even on LOW setting. I really want to like this product but I can't ignore its presence in the room. It's all I can think about! Is my product defective? I'll post a video review later when I get over the flu.. I wonder if I'll be able to sleep through the sound even with all the NyQuil.. The only thing I like about it so far is that it ejects cool air instead of hot air. At least it isn't heating up the room.Update:It's now broken and just sitting atop my shelf. Don't buy this. It's junk as far as I can tell. I used it lightly and only few times a week really due to all the noise even on low setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisey unit for a bedroom!","review":"I read the reviews and really thought I picked a small air purifer that was quite.

But even more annoying was the light - there was a nightlight, but even with that off the thing lights up the room at night. Not acceptable for a bedroom! Did do the job, at least, so I gave it a couple stars. Amazon did refund the price - impressive!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy, seems to do nothing.","review":"This unit is noisy and kept me awake at night. It also seems to do nothing to collect any dirt particles. Wish I didn't buy it. I also wish I had thought to return it within the 30 days. Shame on me. It's a yard sale item now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall Good Product & Value","review":"I am overall happy with the unit. It is a great size and is easy to work. It works very well for being so small.But as other reviewers have noted, it is a little on the loud side when operating. There are three fans speeds. On the lowest setting it is as loud as a regular desk fan on its highest setting. On the other two higher settings the sound is about as loud as the high setting on the exhaust fan above your stove. However, if you plan on using it only when needed or at night, like I do, it works just fine. In fact, the white noise it makes helps me sleep at night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I bought one of these air purifiers because of the price being affordable and the permanent HEPA filter. It never once worked properly. It would only run quietly on low, but the medium and high settings were loud and clunky. I returned it to Amanzon and exchanged it for another one, thinking maybe it would work properly. It did not. I returned that one and bought a Therapure air purifier, which works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud, ineffective","review":"Do not waste your money on this. I wish I had paid more heed to the reviews that noted how loud this purifier is. It is not quiet - aside from being loud on its own, after the third day of use it started to rattle as if the parts inside had come undone and were clanking around. I followed all of the included instructions and thus far haven't experienced an improved quality in the air of the bedroom where I've set up the machine. (I've had the purifier for two weeks). It's basically an incredibly loud, irritating, paper weight at this point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought two - both stopped working within 8 months","review":"I would love to write a 5 star review as the product worked well while it worked. However, I purchased two (at two different times) and both stopped working after 6-8 months. To make matters worse, you have to pay Honeywell a fee to get a replacement. I paid the first fee - not sure what I am going to do with the 2nd unit (just broke this week - it was purchased in October).One breakdown could be a fluke - two breakdowns tells me to look elsewhere next time. I would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"completely stopped working","review":"We used this in our small bedroom, on the floor, for about two months before it started making weird noises and then eventually stopped working. We cleaned it, though it didn't need a cleaning and that did nothing. Two months! And I can't return it, and I don't want to send it to a landfill. And the air in San Francisco is the WORST. So if you'd like a free broken air purifier, let me know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy","review":"These units are truly small and very noisy. I purchased 4 of them for small rooms in my home. It does an 'ok' job for the price but I am thinking I should have gone with a larger, less noisy unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy for a bedroom","review":"I think it is a great buy for a bedroom HEPA filter at around 46 bucks. I find the sound on low to be good for sleep, high is quite loud for the record. I can see the crap it grabs on the pre-filter and glad that it is there! I have noticed a lot less dust accumulation and I am definitely breathing and sleeping better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Product","review":"Very small and quiet but good enough to filter a large bedroom and take away my allergies. I was able to run it every night for about a year before the filter needed cleaning.The lowest setting sort of goes \\"whoom whoom\\" and the highest setting is a bit loud, so I like the medium setting. Also the ionizer makes a clicking noise that some people might find annoying, but I don't really use that function much since ionization doesn't really do anything (from what I've read).You should mainly get this for the low cost and permanent HEPA filter. It is great for allergies or breathing problems at night, and the noise it makes is soothing. I looked into ozone generators but read they can be bad for your health. Hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy","review":"This air purifier is loud. I have to turn the volume up on my TV close to 70 (the loudest being 100) just so I could hear over the air purifier."},{"rating":"2","title":"good value for a hepa cleaner with permanent filter","review":"Some people have commented about the sound. It sounds like a common air conditioner (but without the compressor noise). Part of making things compact is the fans get smaller and have to spin faster to do the same work. I'm using it mostly when the room is unoccupied, so it's not a concern at all.It's doing a fine job keeping the air clean. I may get another one or two sometime.I have allergies so I like to keep the air clean to prevent symptoms. I also use the air cleaner in my darkroom to remove dust that might otherwise end up on film and in photos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very effective","review":"My wife has asthma, badly aggravated at the time by a thyroid problem, unknown to us. I tried this device only wiht the hope that it might make a difference. It did the first night and every night over the last 10 months. When she does not turn it on for any reason, she can feel the difference at night. We use it in a 20 x 20 bedroom, just start it up about 30 minutes before she goes to bed, run it all night, then shut it off in teh am when she gets up. It has a simple open cell foam filter and then a HEPA filter. We have to clean the foam filter every week, which is about a 5 minute job. The HEPA filter takes longer but it I think only has to be done every 2-4 weeks. For people with allergies (which my wife also has) or asthma, this is well worth a try as a solution. We have found it to be very effective. With a good night's sleep, she can tolerate the rest of the day without air flitration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Well","review":"This thing won't actually make your dog smell better. Or your 12 year old's gym shoes. Or the socks shoved under his bed. But as long as you keep your face out of the immediate vicinity of any of those items, you will notice that the rest of the room's air smells fresher and cleaner. Plus this little guy doesn't need a lot of space to sit. Well worth the investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a HEPA Filter -- BIg difference -- Beware","review":"If you have bad allergies and need a HEPA filter, beware of phrases such as \\"HEPA-like\\" and \\"90% HEPA\\". They are NOT nearly as good as the real thing.By its own description, this filter lets through over TWENTY TIMES as much as a real HEPA filter, and if you have bad allergies the difference is massive. HEPA is a specification that must be met before you can use the term. Specifically, it must block \\"at least 99.97% of airborne particles 0.3 micrometers (m) in diameter\\". This filter, on the other hand, removes \\"up to 99%\\" of particles.Shame on Honeywell for slapping \\"HEPA\\" on all their filters even when it doesn't apply."},{"rating":"2","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"This is a $50 piece of plastic with a filter. Nothing special # settings which don't matter because high should be used at all time. The dumbest feature that is a light that does nothing.

Tend to not use it when I'm in the room. Will turn it on when sleeping only if I know I can get to sleep easily, or if I don't have to wake up early the next day - otherwise, it is loud enough to keep me up at night.Can't compare it to other products so maybe all purifiers in this price range are as noisy. I would not recommend it to friends; instead, I would forcefully encourage them to try something else.Probably deserves somewhere between 2 and 3 stars. If it is actually purifying the air I'd give it a 3; if it's only partially doing it's job, it deserves a 2.Edited to add \\"Amazon Verified Purchase\\" label (see comments)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Very Noisy Even On Low","review":"This unit is very loud even on its lowest setting. On the lowest setting we could not watch TV at night with the volume turned down, as we could not hear the TV over the unit across the room.

Nice and small, moved a fair amount of air and is really loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have to break it to remove the front panel","review":"The tabs on the sides are not true latches. They are so cheaply, inadequately and badly designed that it's impossible to remove the front grill part to clean the filter without just yanking it off and breaking the tabs. Now for us the front sits loosely in front of our air purifier; it's not attached. If nobody else is mentioning this it must be because they haven't had to clean the filter yet. The sound of the purifier is pretty loud, I agree. It also turned \\"rattly\\" sounding after about a year. It's okay for us because we use it in the BR's while sleeping and it serves as white noise but for those who want a quietly running machine all day I wouldn't recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOUD!!!","review":"This is way to loud for a 80ft room.

I have since moved it into the bedroom because my Wife's allergies are killing her at night and it's doing the trick for that as well. The only thing I'd complain about is the noise. Realize, of course, that sound is the air moving around the filters and it's subsequent cleansing, but it's still loud.All in all it is a great product, and I am picking up the larger 50150 for the living room knowing full well it's going to be loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"After adopting an umbrella cockatoo I started having mild indoor allergies.

Well, they may have a blade hitting the inside of the filter since I, with normal hearing, do not find it to be objectionable ten feet away from me, even on High. Or, perhaps an engineering change was made between mine and theirs. I believe their posts -- I am just saying that mine is whisper-quiet, even to much younger people.Mine will pay for itself since I spend so much time at the computer, and I can run the air conditioner at a higher (more efficient setting) since my filter is near to the floor, and picks up cooler air, effectively turning it 90 degrees and acting as a cool fan for me, too.I tested the opacity of the air in the room using a laser. The beam went from being visible 90 degrees from the beam to being invisible, so I put my light meter away when it went from 4 to 0.All of what I said above was agreed upon by my 30 year old son and his girl friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it.","review":"Been living with this for a couple months now and I'm finally ready to report back.

My only complaint is that the low setting is too loud to sleep in the same room with. Unless you're the type of person that enjoys a fan or other white noise it will become bothersome. Also, the ionizing is a complete joke, but all ionizing filters are so I won't knock it down for that.I'm not sure if I would buy this again.

We're planning on getting a larger model for our open spaces since my husband suffers from allergies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for office","review":"My co-worker & I pitched in to purchase this product & are very pleased. We share an enclosed office in a large production warehouse & noticed that were constantly finding dust in the air. We've been using the purifier for about a month now & have noticed a difference. We haven't had to dust since (usually we had to once a week)! We both feel much cleaner & would definitely recommend this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of quality control","review":"Ran unit in a small dusty room for 12 hours- with and without ionizer on- and after 12 hours on 'high', the filters were absolutely clean. NO DUST ACCUMULATED AT ALL in filters. Very weak airflow into filters, although outflow was strong. Returned it and will try another brand.I bought this item because there were so many 5 star reviews...I guess that the quality control from the company is the problem, since there seem to be units that are absolutely useless and some that work great. Wish I'd gotten one of the good ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"MMMM, tastes good!\\"","review":"\\"MMMM, tastes good!\\" That's exactly what my 7 year old daughter said the first time I put this on her fingers, and had her stick one in her mouth. For us, this had been a complete failure of a product. Maybe I will just have to use Tobasco sauce."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that good","review":"the product does not have the bad taste it says it does. once applied all it is, is a shiny clear coat on your nails. bite them, there is a hint of a weird taste, but a true nail biter will ignore it. buy something stronger"},{"rating":"1","title":"1/2oz. rip off","review":"This was puchased for my 4 year old it did not work at all. In fact she liked the taste making a whole new problem. After talking to a few people I got similar stories this product is a joke now I am one off the many people with nothing good to say.there should be a 0 star spot in ? #1only gave 1 star to complete review"},{"rating":"1","title":"The same as clear nail polish","review":"Save yourself the trouble and don't bother purchasing this,I was looking for help with my nail-biting habit, bought this item, used it, but it doesn't taste that bad and it's just like clear nail polish, the smell and everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Found it useless","review":"I bought this today after finally getting fed up with biting my nails (I'm seventeen, and have bit them for as long as I can remember) and found that it doesn't stop me from biting at all. It's too mild. In fact, I enjoy the taste, and find myself even more drawn to biting them. I'm very disappointed, and wouldn't recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT DOES TASTE DISGUSTING!","review":"I recently bought this product because as a waitress, nobody likes to see you gnaw on your nails, then serve them their food. It was cheap so I gave it a try. I read some reviews after I first purchased it to see what I was in for. Against what other people said, I used it a few times a day anyway.The reviews that say it doesn't have a taste at all must have not followed the directions properly. It specifies to use it after washing you hands and before bed. It dries relatively fast, so I did this. I feel like the taste gets WORSE after every time I apply it. There IS a very nasty taste that stays in your mouth and makes me regret putting my finger anywhere near my mouth.If you follow the directions, and apply it after you wash your hands, or even just throughout the day when you get a chance, it has the right effect. I haven't stopped biting my nails yet, its only been about a week, but this product sure makes me want to stop as soon as possible. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best results!!!!!!","review":"Inmediate result for stop the nail biting!!!!! I've tried every kind of arrangements with my son. This is effective and I had tried it for one week!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It helps a lot","review":"When you're like me, biting nails since a small child, you don't think that you could ever stop. This stuff tastes so bad that it makes it so very easy to not want to bite the nails and it is worth it to buy. It is only a matter of remembering to put it on after you wash your hands or take a shower. It will only work if you always use it. My nails get so much longer when I use Bite No More. Right now nails are not so long only for the fact that I keep forgetting to put it on again. Otherwise they are slowly getting longer as time goes on. It also works for picking noses. One of my friends did it to her kid and well he doesn't pick his nose anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"Does not have bitterness required to deter biting even when applied thickly. Recommend spending more for something that works.
