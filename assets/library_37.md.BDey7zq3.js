So basically it is only a DVD player. The remote is small so the buttons are difficult to use and the unit responds very slowly to commands. It does not have a skip forward feature. Only a very slow moving fast forward which operates similar to what you get when you fast forward a VCR with the tape playing. It also has trouble reading some of the newer DVDs.The unit comes with the Progressive Scan feature turned off and the menu will not allow you to turn it on.The manual is poorly written along the lines of a generic manual that could apply to any VCR, DVD, or Combo. It does not even troubleshoot the problem of switching from DVD to VCR mode.Not worth the money even at the new discounted price as other mfg's have similarly priced units with much better features and function."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap quality","review":"Cheap quality, but you can't beat the price.

If you believe the food industry is researching products in your best interest, to make food safer and genuinely more nutritious, read this book! The book, along with a few others pertaining to similar topics, restores some bit of hope that there are indeed a few people out there that value good food and nutrition, and are wise to the fact that good nutrition doesn't come in glossy cellophane packages stamped with health claims touting unbelievable \`magic bullet' statements targeted to those with limited understanding of nutrition and health."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Eye Opener","review":"Prof. Marion Nestle covers all the bases in this comprehensive and shocking inside look at the American food industry, and its collusion with government and \\"science.\\" Food Politics goes a long way toward exposing the underbelly of the current obesity epidemic, and related diatetes, cancer and heart disease. Nestle shows how even the agencies designed to protect public interest in this area are corrupted by vested interests.

Evey newspaper, television ad, and magazine model demand that we be thin yet at the same time encourage us to eat more food and make less healthy choices.

These are songs that touch on love, faith, truth, life in general. Tagore has written from the heart. The wisdom contained in these works is startling.

Its alluring beauty has not faded in any way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cross-cultural understanding","review":"Tagore is a wonderful example of merging of cultures - for example one of the prose poems is the reflections of the Samaritan women at the well after her encounter with Jesus. Yet other poems reveal the eroticism of longing that one associates with Indian bhakti poets such as Mirabai; others seem to long for a God without form as one associates with Kabir. Tagore thus represents the acceptance of some things Western while retaining a distinctively South Asian bent.

Between songs Ray Brown says he wants to play something fast; Ellis barks \\"Seven Come Eleven - right now!\\", and the race is on - Ellis and Pass' solo duets/duals bring loud responses from the crowd numerous times.

If the backing pad was flat, the sandpaper disks would last a lot longer. I really like the sander itself, so I just purchased the backing pad with a \\"hard\\" hardness rating. I'll let you know how this works out.Feb 5, 2011 - The \\"hard\\" pad is better, but is still a bit concave. The edges of the sanding pads wear out first, even when I'm careful not to go over the edges of the boards and the boards are first jointed flat. Concave is better than convex for sure, but flat is best for sanding flat surfaces - someone should clue the Bosche engineers into this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick transaction, best price","review":"Simply the best.

Curiously, Heart's little brother becomes a computer industry tycoon and his pathetic little sister becomes a \\"famous\\" nun. If they had grown up to be less prominent citizens would that have diminished the plot?The sensuality of being \\"young and restless\\" was ever-present as was the loss of that vitality 30 years later at the high-school reunion.

The story line is cloying and not particularly believable. The writing style is great JCO stuff, but somehow it was not enough to make this stimulating. I see the larger themes she wants to touch upon, but boy is it a stretch here. Who are these characters and why do I fail to care? True enough many people are damaged by adolescent experiences (real and imagined) but this story just doesn't click. I found it repetitive and dull.

And ramble.Don't get me wrong, I adore this author. I have inhaled everything else she has ever written. But there is much better to be found in \\"Oates Country\\" than this.I have given this novel two stars for the quality of the writing and phrasing. Very few can craft a sentence better than Oates.

The tedium of the flash forwards and backs along with the confusing gender change of the first person narrative does little to further the continuity of the unbelievable plot. While the book probes the mind of a supposed criminal while also addressing class antagonism in modern American, particularly among \\"blue-blood\\" families and their less noble neighbors, the dynamics of the modern dysfunctional family, and the tedium of teenage life, as evidenced by the obsession of the high school girls with John Reddy, I would not class it amongst her better works.

I liked the style; the manual lift was nice, and I especially liked the timer. But, let's see: as I remember I was trying to find a machine that would make good toast. Unfortunately, my Dualit 2-slicer didn't cut the mustard. Didn't make good toast either: dark on one side, light on the other; with the \\"one-slice\\" button poked (by mistake), the results were descending-first slice dark on one side, medium on the other; second slice light one side, just warm the other.

The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it toasts. It's reliable because everything is manual. The lever that raises the toast does not raise it straight up but racks it on an angle. So if what you're toasting is round or small, it squashes it against the front of the toaster. Make sure you get some wooden tongs with this unit. It never toasted evenly, the bottom of an English muffin would be burnt while the top was almost pure white. The side panels are clear coated aluminum or white metal. Over time corrosion occurred under the clear coating that cannot be polished or cleaned off and makes the toaster look awful. The center is chrome and can be cleaned.

It should be awesome for what it costs.2) Believe it or not, the stupid dualit has a lever where the bread would always get stuck- and it didn't come up when it was done. The lever is at a diagonal, so that smaller pieces of bread inevitably get lodged there.3) The timer makes a constant annoying clicking sound.

With the high price, you'd expect it to work better. It's wide opening makes normal sliced bread widths fall down into the toaster and not able to pop up. I'm constantly unplugging it and digging the burning item out with a fork.Bagels are generally too wide for the opening and I have to shove it down and then it gets stuck and I'm once again unplugging it to force the bagel (now destroyed) out. To make two acceptable slices of toast, it usually takes at least 4 slices of bread to get it right. I've learned how to make it work with warming up and watching the toast like a hawk. When ever someone other than me uses it, since they aren't used to it, toast is burnt.

During four weeks of travel in Ghana I found this map to be full of horrendous errors, some gross ones, others in small detail.Major roads are simply not shown on this map, such as perfectly good roads leading to Ada Foah, or there are roads shown that do not exist in reality. I came to several towns of very significant size that were barely a dot on the map.I have the impression that this map is essentially based on maps drawn during colonial times in the 1920's.The only useful map I encountered in Ghana is a map issued a few years ago as a promotional effort by Toyota Co., but this map is unfortunately no longer available.The map serves well to obtain an overview of the geography of Ghana, and once this is done, one should rely on the small but detailed and usually very accurate maps in travel guide books. I used the Bradt Guide for this trip and was very well served."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculously Oversized","review":"Ghana is a small country. Yet this map is ridiculously oversized, with the northern half of the country on one side and the southern on the other. That makes it unnecessarily difficult to plot a trip when you can't see the entire country on one side. A country this small and mostly rural doesn't require a great deal of detail. The map covers up my whole dining table when I spread it out. For that reason it's very frustrating and hard to use.Unfortunately, you may not be able to find another Ghana map. I've been looking, and this one seems to be the only one available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!","review":"I LOVE this album! I was looking for music I could jog or jump rope to. Most techno or dance-type music is so mind-numbingly repetitive that it makes me want to throw myself in front of a bus, but this album is truly original and totally Middle Eastern. It has a few mellow songs, but also a few REALLY fast-paced ones perfect for working out to. Most of these are instrumental. My favorite track is #7. This album is just so different from anything I have ever heard.

I would have thought he would have out grown it by now but it seems he's just as interested in it now as he was when he was two. He loves to play doctor so that was why he was so interested it this dvd. But I have never known Caillou to whiny or bratty. I think that he acts like any normal four year old who doesn't understand why he can't do certain things. I think people who thinks he is whiny must not have any experience with four year olds at all because four year olds I know are MUCH whinier than Caillou. I think Caillou teaches them not to whine when you don't get your way there's always something else to do that is just as much fun. I noticed a significant difference in my son when he started watching Caillou he stopped pitching fits and whining. This is a wonderful show for children of all ages. Much better than Sponge Bob which just teaches nasty behavior to our children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning","review":"As a warning, this is not the same video you may be looking for by the same name.

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the Wellness has no oils in it to keep his skin moist.

The book was published in 1989 and back then all of the varieties of different kinds of flooring types weren't available. This book is mainly for people that are going to nail down their floors. Also, one other point, the book is VERY cheap. The book is binded with plastic rings (like that you would expect from an old recipe book) and it appears that the pages were all copied with a cheap copy machine. All of the illustrations are hand drawn and in black in white. There is some useful information, however it is way outdated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Abstract","review":"Peacefulness is absolutely not appropriate reading for 4-8 year old children. It may be appropriate for 8 or 9 year olds, but I wouldn't recommend it even for them. The sentences and paragraphs in this book are repetitive, but worse than that, they repeat abstract concepts and define abstract terms with more abstraction. This book, like the others in the series, contains almost no narrative, except one page of biography of an exemplary figure.A better introduction for a child to peacefulness would be a story in which a character is presented with possibilities and chooses peaceful resolutions to problems. I don't know where to find such a book for my six year old. I can recommend our favorite book, Children Just Like Me, and a similar book, A Life Like Mine--these two books might lead a child to have a peaceful outlook toward people of other cultures. I can also recommend Mister Rogers' First Experiences series for ages 3-6 for teaching conflict resolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"fats navarro cd","review":"This CD is a very comprehesive review of a great jazz musician who died very young and should not be forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why won't your get back together?","review":"I was disappointed when I heard the live songs on this CD.

Danny Hutton sticks to his few hits, and Cory surely has enough of his to sing, but here he tries to sing Chuck staples such as JOY TO THE WORLD, ONE, EASY TO BE HARD, ELI'S COMING, OLD FASHIONED LOVE SONG among others.

Once in awhile there is a tribute album to a band. That would have been a better idea since this pap is supposed to pass for Three Dog Night.

So it's a pity that while I am anticipating, along with a legion of other longtime fans for the REAL reunion of the original three singers of this, one of the most famous rock acts of the seventies, I and countless other doggies have to put up with another TWO DOG NIGHT production and yet another GREATEST SAME OLE GREATEST HITS collection, while we're salivating for the real thing. Lighten up, Cory and Danny. You guys have great pipes, but it's time to bury the hatchet and wipe the slate clean.

Hermux is shy and pedantic, and longs for an adventure. When the dashing aviatrix Ms Perflinger leaves her travel watch to be repaired, Hermux finds himself thrown into more adventures than he could possibly have imagined.All of the characters in this book are mice - but not living beneath the floorboards in human's houses. No, they inhabit their own beautifully detailed and believable mouse world. The characterization is delightful - and although aimed at young readers, will appeal to many an older reader with a taste for whimsy and anthropomorphized stories. The plot is a kind of 'whodunit' - and requires the reader paying close attention if they are to solve all the clues.The book is divided into lots and lots of mini-chapters - some no longer than a page or two in length. This makes it the ideal bedtime storybook for reading aloud to little sleepyheads!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good, but too many characters","review":"This was a really good book.

This book really changed me and the way I look at things. It is truly beautiful, but I would not reccomend it to those who are either confused by or just don't appretiate some deepness. This book makes you think. It makes you delve into the depths of your mind and discover some things not just about Miracle, but about yourself too. This is a very uplifting novel.

This is NOT a comprehensive text covering the material in exhaustive detail, but it is an excellent overview of surfaces, simplicial complexes, homotopy, homology, and the briefest peek at cohomology. The sequence is efficient, and the author does a good job of motivating the discussions, rather than simply dumping an abstraction into your lap. As always, one should be familiar with point-set and groups before jumping in. If you are looking for a text at an undergraduate level, see Armstrong's Basic Topology or Kinsey's Topology of Surfaces."},{"rating":"2","title":"At the other end of the spectrum","review":"The only other books I have seen that deserve the title of both a reference and a textbook are by Lang. That being said, the exposition is at the other end of the spectrum with the goal being to teach the reader and not develop topology from the foundations in excruciating detail. The strength of the book (the same applies to the other titles by the same author) is that there is no compromise in rigor and the user-friendliness of the book relies upon the motivating discussions spread throughout the text. The author seems to have a long teaching experience and so he wisely advises the reader to work through the exercises. There is a pitfall with Lee's books: because the explanations are so lucid and intuitively satisfactory you might fool yourself that you know the material but this is not the case until you solve most of the problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"A welcome text to my collection","review":"I picked this book mainly because a friend recommended this whole series to me. While I cannot say this book would make a great introduction to point set topology (I think Munkres is still the best for that), it has all that one would want to get going with manifold theory. What I liked most about this text is probably the rigor. This text will motivate the topics and give rigorous proof to many theorems. There are also many good examples to illustrate his point. I'd recommend this book, and the follow-up text \\"Introduction to Smooth Manifolds\\" to anyone interested in graduate level mathematics.

This movie has tons of throwaway characters like the gym teacher, the psychologist, and Chrissy (Lisa's rival for prom queen) -- who could be made interesting, but are instead introduced and then abandoned.Obviously most horror films aren't intended to be high cinematic art, but the good ones at least keep your attention.This \\"film\\" is an insult to Prom Night '80!"},{"rating":"1","title":"great till the end","review":"i thought the movie was really good till then ending which then again today's movies all suck at the end which messes up the whole movie.

The first had a much better and \\"mysterious\\" background and a fabulous disco-camp sensibility. This film is your standard, stupid slasher flick with a boring plot line, very bad acting, and zero suspense. The slasher **Spolier ** is a teacher smitten with a student and you know that from the opening scene of the film. The rest is your standard escape from prison and track 'er down dope fest. Snow acts so terminally cute here - you root for the killer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Prom Nightmare!","review":"This was such a waste of time and money! I was so disappointed with the whole movie. It wasnt scary even though it was meant to be and the killer was so over dramatic with his killings and I kept wondering why he was so obsessed with this mediocre girl...maybe its just me. Anyways, dont waste your time on this one and believe me, I love my scary movies but this one was just plain horrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I didn't buy this","review":"After reading some Amazon reviews on this movie that it wasn't any good I went and rented it cause I like some movies others don't. Well I have to agree with others on here. This movie wasn't as good as the trailers made it out to be. It just didnt have the wow I was expecting. Before you buy this movie rent it first to ensure you don't waste your money if you don't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I KNEW They Were Going To Do This","review":"I knew they were going to release a PG-13 version of the film only to turn around and create an unrated version. Sorry, but I'm not buying it (in both sense of the term). This is, and always has been a cash-in remake. I'll stick with the Jamie Lee Curtis original, thank you. I won't even bother renting this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prom Night (Unrated)","review":"For some reason, I really enjoyed this one. I love scary movies, but this one isn't that scary. I think I just love the plot of the movie. It's funny and spooky-n-creepy. I think this one had potential to be an excellent movie, but it was just one of those movies you can't take serious. In the end, it's a typical teen horror movie. But it was good to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was, you know, like totally horrible, right?","review":"This movie was on Starz OnDemand this month, so when I was up at 4AM this morning with nothing better to do, I thought, what the hell? After all, I kind of like cheesy teen slasher movies, Prom Night is sure to be right up my alley.Eh. Not so much. None of the characters are interesting, the bad guy isn't scary, the plot doesn't make a load of sense, and the writing was shoddy.A huge disappointment, even from someone who loves laughing at the bad, the worse, and the downright pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and Predictable","review":"This film pulls out every cliche from the slasher movie playbook. Every scene was utterly predictable. Not a scare in sight. It was excruciatingly boring. In fact, it was rather amusing (and familiar) to watch a killer go from being very proficient at butchering several teenagers in the first hour and then becoming inexplicably and hopelessly inept at killing the protagonist - a lonely teenage girl. A note to horror directors: Watch all the slasher-movies, see what has been done before and then try come up with something a bit more ORIGINAL. Is it too much to ask?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"It's bad enough that we've had strings of cruddy remakes of classic horror flicks, but Prom Night marks a remake of a horror flick that, well, wasn't a classic. This modern day take on Prom Night stars Brittany Snow as the object of her former teacher's (Johnathon Schaech) obsession, who returns to make her life miserable after murdering her family some time before. Naturally, it just so happens to be the night of the big prom, and from beginning to end, Prom Night is an awful, utter bore. Nothing scary or close to suspenseful is to be found here, and the film as a whole (even unrated) is a tame and neutered slasher that provokes more yawns more than anything else. What's even worse is seeing actors like Ming-Na and The Wire vets Idris Elba and James Ransone appear in this waste, which is more of a shame than the film itself. Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimate fail","review":"As if we haven't seen anything like this before. It had a pretty OK plot for a film that revolves around teenagers, but it really can't hold it's own as a good horror movie, if that's what you wanna call it. The beginning is creepy, and then it just moves into the creepy suspense of just waiting for that one person to get killed, because the only extreme suspense is when you're just sitting there watching a teenager alone in a room, obviously about to get killed, and it takes forever for the killer to come out and kill them, so that's what makes the suspense come alive. The ending is OK, but altogether it really fails and it's not worth watching again. It's not the worst horror movie I've seen (Leeches is the ultimate worst), but it's pretty bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's nothing to see here","review":"Whoever did the poster art for this movie should get an award. It is far and away the best part of this movie. The lead actress and the detective were pretty good in their roles, but the movie has zero tension and the bad guy is particularly unscary."},{"rating":"1","title":"PREDICTABLE.","review":"THE PSYCHO ESCAPED JAIL,AND WENT RIGHT TO THE SCHOOL ON PROM NIGHT.HE DISGUISED HIMSELF.THE POLLICE FOUND OUT HE ESCAPED AND PUT POLICE AROUND THE EXITS AND ENTRANCES AND ALL OTHER DOORS.THE PSYCHO'S ALREADY IN THE SCHOOL.HE SCRATCHED HIS CARD ON PURPOSE TO GET THE MAID TO GET HIM IN A ROOM.HE ASKED FOR TOWELS.WHEN THE MAID WAS READY TO LEAVE-HE STABBED HER.CLARE WENT INTO THE GIRLS OWN ROOM BECAUSE OF AN ARGUEMENT SHE HAD WITH HER BOYFRIEND-SHE GETS STABBED.THEN LATER,HER BOYFRIEND LOOKS FOR HER-HE GETS STABBED.SO ON AND SO ON AND SO ON.THIS WAS A VERY BORING MOVIE.NO SUSPENSE BECAUSE YOU ALREADY KNOW WHAT THE PSYCHO'S GOING TO DO AND HOW HE DOES IT.THERE'S NOTHING TO THIS MOVIE.NO EXCITEMENT.THERE WASN'T ANYTHING TO THIS MOVIE TO GET ANY EMOTION GOING.SHOULD NEVER HAD BEEN MADE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn night","review":"How many ways can I diss this movie?1. Very predictable storyline.2. Packed to the rim with horror movie cliches.3. Unlikeable teenagers doing dumb things that put their lives in danger.4. Girls so jumpy that you can fart and have them running for the hills.5. The killer is revealed very early in the film taking way all suspense.6. The killer is not scary and is could easily be a heartthrob for teenage girls.7. Uses the \\"boo\\" technique ineffectively and excessively.8. Uneven pacing.9. Brainless script.10. You get the drift. This movie is just pathetic in its execution and is going to set back horror films 100 years. If you want a real horror flick watch The Cat In The Hat(2003). Its scarier than anything you'll ever see in this by-the-numbers slasher flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money for everyone involved...","review":"Like a previous reviewer mentioned, I too was horribly embarrassed I went to see this. It was truly painful to sit through. The original was no classic, but it was entertaining and had a sense of mystery to it. This didn't have anything going for it. Bad script, bad acting, bad everything. As far as the worst remakes of recent years go, this and Black Christmas are tops. At least Black Christmas was rated R so it wasn't sugar coated to target a younger audience like this one. The best remakes so far have been The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Hills Have Eyes. Perhaps if remakes like Black Christmas and Prom Night had fallen into better hands, they would have been more enjoyable. Don't waste your time and money here. Buy the original for 6.99. You get to see Jamie Lee Curtis and Leslie Neilsen cut a rug to some groovy disco music which is worth the price alone. Otherwise, skip the prom and stay home."},{"rating":"1","title":"You know the point in scary movies where...","review":"...somebody does something really stupid and everyone hates them for it? well this was a 90 minutes movie of stupidness. Honestly, I found myself yelling at the screen saying \\"don't go back there\\". Truthfully this was a pointless movie, predictable in every way, and the characters were just too stupid to survive."},{"rating":"1","title":"I begrudingly give this one star because I had no choice in the matter!","review":"Awful, deplorable, terrible, even these words don't accurately describe how much of a waste of time this movie is. It feels like a really creepy episode of Dawson's creek, except that it would have been better with that cast. The first victim in this movie is the suspense as you see the killer in the first five minutes, we then see him all cleaned up some time later at the lead girls Prom killing systematically everyone who crosses his path. Why is he doing all this??? Good question, they never explain why so don't hold your breath. There is no plot, no back story, no point. Donot buy this movie!!! Please. I wish I could underline the word please."},{"rating":"1","title":"PROM NIGHT SHOULD BE MORE MEMORABLE THAN THIS!","review":"OK, let's start off by saying this movie blows! It's a slick looking film with no tension and even the jolt scares don't work! The cast is surprisingly good, considering how stupid this film is. This makes the original look like 'The Exorcist'! When will Hollywood learn?......never as long as people will pay to see such garbage! Stay away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless Excercise in Boredom","review":"I can't find any good points to this remake, primarily because of its bland script. Also, the direction brings nothing visually or thematically interesting to light. The cast isn't bad, and the cinematography and lighting are clearly professional, but (like the Black Christmas remake) there are no improvements on the original. The lead finds herself facing off with the baddie twice, but learns nothing and responds no differently the second time. In fact, she has to be saved - this is actually a retrogression, as with the Halloween remake, where the lead similarly doesn't modulate her reactions in any way. In both cases, the original had a stronger and more lifelike female. I doubt this will even develop a cult following, like the not-so-great original with its scarifying disco soundtrack. I say avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"this should be PROM NIGHT V. not no remake.","review":"this should be a fifth installment not no remake. everybody know that the original prom night was about revenge. a boy witness his sister got killed by 4 kids in a banddet bulding. six years has past. he gonna killed them at the prom. this is about an obsessed teacher killed this girl familys went to prison 3 years has past he some how got out and stll trying to get with her. it not scary it like a nick show. i rather watch prom night 3.it maybe funny but lease it got more killing in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down.","review":"I recieved this item today.

This was SUCH a wasted opportunity. The original Prom Night is MILES superior than this sanitized, high gloss, MTVesque, BORING and so incredibly UNSCARY version. There was absolute ZERO suspense in this. They literally show the killer's face from the beginning, so there is absolutely no point in the movie when he was feared by the audience. This was a HORRIBLE movie, avoid at ALL costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the Point...?","review":"What was the point of this?I know that movies are made to make money and the simplest movie to turn a buck is the teen slasher film. No thought, all formula. But this particular film is so empty and soul-less that I was overwhelmed with the numbness of indifference. The villain isn't that interesting. The kids solemnly spout lines that were used a bridges between the songs in GREASE (\\"The prom is the end of school--what if we never see each other again!\\"). The production values are good, which only highlights the utter lameness of the proceedings.In the 70s and 80s, drive-in horror flicks provided fun through over-the-top violence, ridiculous storylines, and hot chicks in various stages of undress. Well, it looks like we've progressed in our politically-correct thinking that even the cheap drive-in horror movie doesn't indulge in the same old thrills anymore.So what does that leave?Not a whole lot. Just take a look at this PROM NIGHT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the cheesy tiara, snot scene?","review":"Wow. This had to be the most un-thrilling horror movie I've ever seen. Everyone is killed the exact same way. There is little to no tension in most of the scenes. No gore. Snore. Good points: I liked the slow to fast motion during some of the killing scenes. And the main girl was almost a two-dimensional character. Story centers around a girl whose parents were killed by one of her obsessed teachers. He escapes prison 7 years later and cops try to catch the killer before the killer gets to the girl during prom. Big negative: No cheesy tiara scene. Could use more runny mascara/snot scenes too. If you're looking for a cheesy, funny, prom-gore-fest - this movie is not your top choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my goodness","review":"I saw the unrated version on dvd and it was bad. I cant imagine what the PG-13 version was like. Truthfully, the movie wasnt awful, but it just wasnt good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame and predictable","review":"I did not have high expectations for this movie, but it was even worse than I expected. There is a huge lack of suspense. You find out almost immediately who the killer is and realize early on that he basically is going to stab everyone he sees. There are no dramatic effects, no gore and no connection to the characters . The only character I did end up caring about was Donna, her friends had such dull storylines that you almost didn't miss them when they died. It was so predictable which characters were going to get slashed and the police stakeout was a joke. I definitely recommend passing on this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome.","review":"Item came as described.

In the very beginning of the movie, there is more film coverage of the adults than of Dennis which my son found uninteresting of course. We bought the double feature of this DVD and he LOVED the Special Edition film with Walter Matthau much, much better. He laughed out loud throughout THAT entire film. Therefore, I'd recommend skipping this version and go for the Special Edition film instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"dennis the menace strikes again","review":"my three year old neice thinks this is the best movie she has ever seen! she's rented it about 20 times. it's really a fun movie for kids with lots of slapstick and very likable characters. it is actually a fun movie for children and adults to watch together. a very nice family movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"okay I know this is just a kids movie, but this movie is extremly naiive, dumb, pointless, did I mention dumb?

Watch this movie if you want, but you have been warned, it's not like the first one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who is the criminal here?","review":"This classic written by Anthony Berkeley is worth reading. It was written in 1937, and since Mr. Berkely was the writer who arguably issued in the Golden Age of detection writing, it's worth it just for that reason. But the book is better than just that. It gives the reader an insight into the British judicial system, and Mr. Berkeley spares no punches when he writes about the people in this honoured institution. The entire book is written with \\"tongue-in-cheek\\", and he handles it masterfully. Mr. Todhunter is no OJ Simspon, but the parallels between the two cases are actually quite dramatic."},{"rating":"2","title":"guitar blues","review":"To me, Robert Nighthawk\`s guitar style led the way to the beginning of guitar based rock-n-roll music which became popular in the 1960\`s. This recording was made in the 1950\`s and it is a pioneering effort. I place Robert Nighthawk in the same musical camp as Muddy Waters. Both helped lead the way to the amplified guitar sounds of the 60\`s. Too bad musicians like Nighthawk didnt become popular with a white audience earlier. He never received the credit due to him in his own lifetime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure unadulterated garbage","review":"These cartoons are an abomination to the classic looney tunes.

However, I learned very little that I had not already read in other books by other, more informed authors, i.e., John Douglas.Dr. Morrison's know-it-all attitude especially grated on my nerves. According to her, her theories are the right ones and everyone else's are wrong. Her ego is without equal.As she interviewed one after another of these heinous killers, she kept asking \\"why?\\" And she kept answering \\"I don't know.\\"Well, I don't know about you, but I read the book to find out \\"why,\\" and I don't know any more now than I did when I started. I'm afraid Dr. Morrison needs to take a course in humility. Too bad. In other hands this might have been an enlightening book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic attempt to sell books by using 'serial killer' in the title","review":"Her 'life' among the serial killers? Her life is among children and she will occasionally go get to visit the lesser known serial killers.

I think I figured that out when I was about 17 and had just begun studying serial killers.Do NOT waste your money.If you want a real expert, watch Dr. Michael Stone on \\"Most Evil\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"A very intriguing title, but a very disappointing read. Dr. Morrison, having spent a great deal of her life interviewing serial killers, comes to no concrete conclusions in my opinion. After having read the book, I was left just as curious about the inner workings of the violent criminal's mind. The book provides little in the way of explanation of the behaviors. It provides some description of crimes that I found interesting (i.e. some of the Gacy killings, etc.); however, the author asserts that she has unraveled mysteries for which she has no substantial evidence thereof. She's very proud of her career and accomplishments and it shows. Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed by the limited conclusions offered in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've read them all and this is the worst!","review":"This book is poorly written and the doctor makes no sense most of the time. Some of her comments are mind-boggling. Like another reviewer mentioned I also kept referring back to her credentials in the back of the book to confirm she is actually a doctor.

I am very glad I rented from the library and did not buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT Bother!!","review":"This book was so bad that it could not even be considered laughable. I eventually had to just quit reading after it became that there is no way the author is an educated professional )let alone a published forensic psychiatrist). To be honest, I was a short way into the book before I bean to wonder if the author was even a high scool graduate. I am not a psychiatrist, but even as a layman I was able to determine that 'Ms Morrison' (if that *IS* her real name), has managed to learn a smattering of psychological/psychiatric terms but has no real grasp of their meaning...Save your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"keep looking","review":"I am just completing this book and it was surprisingly filled with sweeping statements that do not ring true.There is very little insight about the killers to be found in this book.The interviews and letters are dull and lacking in information.The one interesting thing I learned from the book was that both Gacy and anotherserial killer had Klinefelters syndrome.

This is undoubtedly the worst true crime/ forensic science book I've read. It is absolute garbage. Dr Morrison seems to spend much of the book dismissing other forensic expert's opinions as bunk, yet I have been unable to find a single forensic psychiatric article authored by her on Medline.

Morrison's anthology is more of a loose collection of garrulous reminiscences of Morrison's contact with various serial killers.Once I realized that the format of the book was uncompromising and admittedly uncreative, I found little motivation to continue past page 250 or so. What little insight there is to be gained, is to be received well before that point.Moreover, Morrison drones on and on and on and on, interspersing her analyses and WAY too much personal information between characterizations. This is a very long and tedious read after page 250, and I feel a little bit stiffed.This isn't a book so much as a reference manual, and should be treated as such.

I was so angry at the lack of objectivity, accuracy or literary integrity that I was going to write a snotty letter to the publishers, but they would probably have published it as some sort of new art form if their previous editorial judgements are anything to go by.

Does she actually still retain a license for practising medicine/psychiatry or, hopefully, has she been disbarred?It seems hard to tell as she veers from a fruedian perspective wherein all physiological inputs are null and void to a purely frightened and judgemental one, that the killers did it soley because they wished to where in fact she bases her judgements.

There are some nuggets here that may help law enforcement officials identify or profile serial killers, if they can overlook the irritating arrogance and perceived self-importance of the presentation.The book is not well written, despite being authored by a highly educated medical doctor who teamed with a talented writer. It's natural to ask why is this so. Is it possible the arrogance that flows through the book carried through the writing process, that the writer was forced to be merely a scrivener.

Where Joao can be brilliant on Lizt, he fails miserably with Bach. He is trying to add more dynamics Bach's keyboard works, but it merely makes things nervous and garbles the polyphony - although one would think the effect would be the opposite. I cannot recommend any of Martin's Bach works, although he plays the Concerti reasonably well as it matches more his style of playing. Glenn Gould, Janos Janda, and Andras Schiff are much better choices for the Well-Tempered, as well as overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting book, well written","review":"I bought this book after looking over Keith's website. If you approach the book more as a miata-based build diary, rather than a how-to book, it is a great book. The pictures and information are well put together. I am in the process of my own build, using a pre-made chassis from coveland7.com, and reading Keith's book gave me a realistic idea of what to expect during the build process and provided the information that I needed for my own planning process.I also have the Ron Champion book, which goes over how to build the actual chassis. Since I am planning on buying a pre-welded chassis, this book is less of a use to me than Keith's book.Thanks to Keith for putting together a well written book.

The publisher puts out a nice product, with high-res color photos and high quality materials.The biggest problem I had with the book was simply that I wanted more. I wanted to read much more detail and get more information than what was presented.

This book is best for getting you excited, convincing you that you can do it too and giving you a better understanding of the process. He does not cover forming parts, installing, design or anything like that, it's just about the process, and for what it is, it's a lot of fun and pretty informative too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miata Locost","review":"This book is an excellent place to start if you are considering building a locost.

I already have Champion's book, which is excellent, and supposedly this book was an Americanized knock-off of that. I was under the impression it would deal with using American donor components, and what would be needed to adapt them. Nothing of the sort. The frame was bought, the body components were bought, a Mazda Miata was the donor. The book doesn't contain anything that can't be found on the web, and doesn't begin to compare with Champion's book. The title should have been something along the lines of, How I Built My KitCar. I have a small collection of automotive engineering books, but this one won't remain part of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only good if you have a Miata as donor for your S 7","review":"This is a web site information about how someone built a Super 7 from pieces either bought from some dealer or taken from a Miata donor car.

This may not be the book.","review":"This book is as much for those beginning database programming with ADO as it is for those new to ASP. The problem is the emphasis seemed to be heavier on how to use the data-access objects of ADO, that it did on developing ASP applications.If you're a rather experienced developer who has a strong understanding of accessing databases via ADO, consider another book altogether. Much of the material will be redundant for you.Most of the Wrox books I've read are \\"quality\\". This one is certainly good, but if you happen to be an experienced programmer bridging your skillset over to the internet/ASP world, \\"Beginning ASP\\" by Wrox is more than sufficient.

It is superior to other programming books, because the main author has been an instructor with over thousands of students he has the experience to know the common errors that people make when trying to program in ASP.The most helpful feature of this book, for me, is that after showing you the code, he explains what it is doing (in detail) for each and every part."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is out of date","review":"This book is seriously out of date. It does a great job of covering ASP, ADO, database connectons and so on, but there is only one part of one chapter (6) that covers the use of OLE-DB, Microsoft's newest technology that provides the connection and access methods between ASP web pages and databases. The rest of the book, and all the examples, use ODBC which is the older and now out of date method. ODBC was current at the time the book was written, and Mr. Kauffman does a great job of explaining it. However, it is now being replaced by OLE-DB. Also, if you are using Windows 2000 or XP as your development platform, you do not even have the (built-in) option to install ODBC. Instead, OLE-DB comes native with IIS 5.0 which is included with all versions of Windows 2000.

Smallwood was there throughout it all and distills his unique perspective in this well-crafted narrative with both both lyricism and humor. \\"The Five People . . .\\" engaged me from the beginning; I read it a single sitting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I live in New Orleans and was anxious to read an account from someone who stayed behind and endured Katrina.What this book was mostly about was bars, alcohol and Quarter characters. I realize the Quarter was not hit as hard as the rest of the city but it was hard to read/accept/beleive that those in the Quarter were drinking and partying while people were dying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Book","review":"Dont but this book. It is just the rantings of another dumb entitlement culture geek mad because G Bush was not immediatly in New Orleans wiping peoples butts for them and handing out hundred dollar bills. Poorly written, sophmooric, double spaced, so your getting half a book. Its hard to read through the authors sweaty sex fantacies. I was in New Orleans during this event...I listened to the only operating radio station. The events the author described regarding Nagans interview did not happen. In fact, the people operating the radio station pleaded for any public officials to come forward, None did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another perspective on Katrina's effects.","review":"When I read a book it is to gain a personal perspective of the lives and events of people different from my own. While Mr. Smallwood's account did not cover the raw grittiness and horrific events that made for so much news in Katrina's aftermath it is an interesting read of another person's experiences. While not downplaying the human tragedy that occurred in New Orleans I enjoyed this other perspective. One thing about New Orleans is it's diversity and Mr. Smallwood's experience, as he relates so well in his book, provides those of us that live on the other side of the continent a different view of New Orleans than the ugly side we saw on the news."},{"rating":"1","title":"No practical advice for women trying to make it happen","review":"As a \\"married\\", Christian, working woman of three children, I went to this book for guidance and real advice on trying to figure out how to stay at home. I simply did not find that. It may help others that want to stay home and need to know that it can come at ANY cost and to ANYONE, but for those needing practical advice, this book just does not help. When one of the first things I read in this book is that many of society's problems are the result of unwed mothers I had to laugh! Then I went to the front of the book and realized a man wrote this."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Kettle is now not working after 4 months!!","review":"I am from Scotland and hence drink a lot of tea, so I thought the Dualit would be the perfect kettle for me.While working the kettle was quick to heat up, poured very nicely and looked great on my kitchen countertop. The only thing I didn't like is that it was hard to fill. At this point I would have awarded 4 stars.However after only 4 short months of use, the kettle is no longer working. This is pretty disappointing workmanship for what is an expensive kettle."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Year Later It Is Not Worth The Money","review":"At first we loved the kettle. It performed well, being used 5-6 times a day. There normally is a little condensation on the heating element, but right around the time the 1 year warranty expired, we noticed more water at the base. By the time we noticed that one of the windows had a leak, it was after the warranty expired.Dualit has one office in the United States - in New Jersey. We shipped the kettle to New Jersey, then waited 5 weeks to get it back. When we got it back, the kettle was worse looking than when it was sent. I cleaned it before I sent it, the one I got back was dusty and it smelled like glue or epoxy. They had replaced the window but even after several trial runs to get the smell out, it still had an odor and we will not use it.The Dualit kettle is not worth the money - they offer no convenient repair service and will not replace the kettle. Let the buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful, Failed after 18 months","review":"The kettle performed flawlessly for over a year, then failed to completely boil water. A replacement base unit provided 4 more weeks of life, before the failure recurred.US Customer service was a disappointment.Recommend an alternate brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUBBISH ITEM & CUSTOMER SERVICE","review":"Great looking kettle, lousy customer service. We had had this kettle for 2 years when the window started to leak. (We were away for probably 6 months of that 2 years.) I contact the Dualit UK who put me in touch with a company in New Jersey. They said they couldn't help, as did Dualit UK. No window replacements. No help whatsoever. Rather an expensive product for no after service!I will never buy a Dualit again. We've had a similar problem with the toaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leakage","review":"I found the lid difficult and cumbersome to open, but persevered, because it is Dualit, and 'looked nice' in my kitchen.

If you actually try to read the book from front to back, you are doing yourself a disservice. It is way too much information to retain. By the time you complete reading the book, you would have forgotten everything in the beginning.My advice: Skip reading the book and jump straight into doing the practice exams. Read the questions and compare it to the answer. Only use the book as a reference. Do the practice exams over and over until you have a passing score of 80%+.The book is actually pretty good if you insist on reading it. They explain the difficult concepts pretty well with the use of visual aids and Hotsheet summary.Good luck! Get plenty of rest the night before. The test is long and draining!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show.","review":"Bones is terrific. My Wife and I watched it new and watch the reruns on TV as background stuff while doing other things.

The writing is great and the storylines are interesting. But what makes this an exceptional show, in my opinion, is the interaction between all the major characters.

I watch these episodes over and over and never get bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"the price makes no sense","review":"Also on sale singly for $25.49, $21.49 and $37.99, the first three seasons only total $84.79. Why is the complete set of the three seasons marked up an additional 61%? There are no additional materials listed in the package. Even if the Bones Companion were added, at under $11, it wouldn't come close to making up the additional premium.

I really like their first 4 films, and this one starts out pretty well. It has that slow, leisurely feel that the other Tommy Chong directed films do, and some of the scenes are hilarious, but it's a cheat at the end, where they just fill out the film with a 20 minute concert. While much of the concert footage is good, it feels tacked on. Cheech and Chong just wanted to pad their film out to a feature length running time with it. There are some surreal moments in the film, which makes it interesting, but overall it's really disappointing because of how they just seem to quit at the end of the film. It's really lazy, haphazard, and just plain unprofessional."},{"rating":"2","title":"12 year old movie reviewer","review":"Cheech and Chong are the funniest comedy duo ever.

I could have made a better film with a $1000 budget. There is absolutely no script. It's as if they just let the cameras run and made up dialogue as they went along. As for humor there is not one scene where you will even crack a smile. Do not believe for a second any of the positive reviews you see here.

I don't even know how Cheech and Chong fans could like this movie, because this movie is really different from \\"Up in Smoke\\" or their other movies. In \\"Up in Smoke\\" there was at least some direction to the movie, but in this movie most of it is composed of lame comedy gimmicks that were entirely not funny unless you are high off your ass or have an I.Q. less than 20. They don't even smoke in this movie! The closest thing they do to drugs is eat some marijuana leaves... how stupid do they think we are?

I loved these two movies, and found \\"Still Smoking\\" just as hilarious. I have to admit that the last 1/4 of the movie slowed down when they were onstage in the comedy club, but I laughed quite frequently through the rest of this funny move. My Advice is to buy this movie, or at least rent it for a great laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheech & Chong's Worst Movie","review":"Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong exhaust their audience goodwill with this glorified home movie shot in fun-filled Amsterdam. Barely released in 1983, \\"Still Smokin\\" represents the absolute nadir of the team's film career. The so-called \\"plot\\" fits on the back of a match box, with no laughs or production values in sight. Allegedly directed by Chong, who lets the camera run for endless stretches of boredom. Someone should have smoked the negative."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stand-up special, not \\"Up In Smoke 2\\"","review":"There are a lot of strong feelings about this movie. Many people hate it, many people love it. To be frank, it's pure Cheech & Chong, the stuff that made them famous on their 1970's comedy albums. It has no plot, like the classic \\"Up in Smoke\\" or their later bombs, it is really just a long sketch show. If you like Cheech and Chong's humor, it's on display at it's best here. Of course, most people who see this expect a sequel to \\"Up In Smoke\\", where it disapoints. It's not a pot-adventure comedy, although the drug theme runs strong. If you liked their classic comedy albums, you'll probably enjoy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie should have gone Up In Smoke!","review":"This is one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen. What was the entire point of making this movie. I laughed so much when I saw \\"Up In Smoke\\", but cried when I wasted my money when I rented this waste of DVD space! This disc could have been the disc used to create the DVD set for Star Wars: Episode IV, but instead they wasted it on this movie. Believe me, don't waste the money and time to see this movie.

However, the author's perspective in evaluating and analyzing the facts is slanted to the point of being almost completely one-sided, lacking almost ANY objectivity. The author's perspective, regardless of his actual age, seems to be fixated in the late '60s--early '70s, where police and the like are ignorant, goose-stepping pigs, and institutions and the government are enemies of the people.

It's not one of the typical teen girl books with the characters all obsessed with guys and friends and popularity (and I'll admit, those books are good, too), but it tells the story of a girl's day in a really interesting way. While Josie (the main character) tells her story, we get a glimpse at the thoughts and future of those she affects during her day.

It only allows a thin slice of cheese and maybe a bit of deli-thin ham, but even so, unless the bread is pretty thin, I have to squeeze it to fit it in the toaster. I have to ACTIVELY look for thinly sliced sandwich bread. Most of them are too thick to fit into this sandwich cage. Ahhhh, but the results are just divine. I don't care if it doesn't fit very well, it taste sooooo good, and it's sooooooooo easy to make a quick cheesy sandwich.

However the story by itself is really bad. It was hardly romance in this book. The first romance scene happens on page 136 (a kiss) and there is nothing again until page 153. The book has 184 pages.

It always brings a smile to my face, whether I'm reading it, or just noticing it on my altar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very inclusive","review":"Like the other reviewers, I too was drawn to this little book that felt so nice in my hand at the local bookstore. I expected to see candle rituals, incantations and the like from a pagan point of view. Imagine my surprise when the lovely blue and gold placemarker ribbons opened to the \\"Nuns' Birthday Blessing\\" ritual. A lapsed Catholic with decidedly pagan leanings, I took it right to the register and then home.The book continued to surprise me with its depth of information and scope of Christian, Jewish, and Pagan traditions. How nice to see a Catholic nun bringing ancient wisdom to light in a loving, warm and accessible way. Sister Karol goes beyond the mere compilation of rituals to focus on the importance behind their purpose and function in our lives.I like this book so much, I keep it out in my living room, where it's continually discovered by my friends and family. Pass this one on to your friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Karol is not a real Catholic Nun!","review":"Don't be fooled into thinking that \\"Sister\\" Karol is a real Catholic nun. She still claims to be, but the \\"order\\" she belongs to, Sisters for Christian Charity, is not a canonical order. It has no official standing in the Catholic Church. It is a non-heirarchical, ecumenical group of disgruntled and heretical women who will not admit that they do not really believe in Church teachings. A more honest thing for her to do would be to leave the Catholic Church, but who would buy her book without the pretense that a Catholic nun would write a book of spells. The \\"naughtiness\\" of a dissenting nun is the drawing card. Don't buy anything she writes, literally or figuratively."},{"rating":"1","title":"A witch nun's get rich scheme","review":"...is the first thing that popped into my head when I saw this in the bookstore. How despicable. A Catholic nun, a woman supposedly sworn to the service and prayerful devotion of Christ concocting this pagan nonsense. I spent a fair amount of time reading over it - (there isn't much here, don't expect much of a read) and slammed it down with disgust. But then I looked deeper into the author and some of her other writings and it's plain what's at work here. Buy it if you need airy fairy feel good nonsensical pap for your jaded post modern mind grown too cynical for true religion. All others save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful writing, as usual","review":"After only a couple chapters of this book, I saw the same great writing I'd come to expect from Beagle and I told my wife, \\"I'm going to read this book to our son.\\" But then came the sex scene a third of the way through the book that really didn't need to be there. Beagle uses it to reveal something about one character, but he really could have revealed it in another way entirely. The scene also seemed completely out of character and out of nowhere. There's another scene later in the book that is handled more tastefully and actually makes sense in the context of the plot. If not for that one scene, this would have been a five star book and among the best books I've ever read. As it is, I still believe Beagle is one of the most skilled writers I've read and the beauty of his language is as good as Gaiman and Rothfuss, if not better. I still might read it to my son, but if I do, I'll edit out a few scenes here and there."},{"rating":"2","title":"One for real-story lovers","review":"This is my favorite book by Beagle. It creates a perfect world of its own, with real characters and some very strange and disturbing things in it. I could spend years reading it and always finding some new things in it. The only annoying thing about it is the fact that it ends somewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird, troubling, touching, beautiful, unforgettable","review":"Peter Beagle has a reputation as a young adult's author -- why, I'll never know. I didn't much like him as a teenager, but the older I get, the more I admire and enjoy his fantasies. The Innkeeper's Song is a beautiful book, but certainly better for 30 than 13 -- unless, perhaps, for a 13-year-old who has already had to deal with death. It concerns attempts to cheat death by magic, and the strange and unforeseen consequences, both good and ill, of raising a drowned young woman from the dead. The book is also noteworthy for a varied and unforgettable cast of characters who take turns narrating the story, giving the reader many perspectives on the same events and aiding suspense by concealing certain facts until the narrator shifts to someone in the know. Beagle's writing is so beautiful it's practically musical. I recommend this book highly to anyone who loves fantasy, folklore, mythology, and the grand old tradition of storytelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After reading 'The Last Unicorn', I must say I was not impressed with Peter Beagle\`s latest work, which seems to combine all the worst elements of his writing and none of the best. Set in a colorless, drab, nondescript world, the story is told from a dozen different perspectives in a somewhat rag-tag style. Beagle is painfully obvious in his attempts to develop the characters or make us believe that some great depth lies beneath the surface of each one (a too-terrible-to-talk-about-past, a love too deep to put into words,etc.) and it is through this blatant lack of subtlety that all attempts fall flat. The total absence of any sense of morality only increased my dislike for the characters, though I got the impression that it was intended for amusement. The ideas that pervade the book are aimless, contrived in accordance with the plot instead of the other way around; thus the entire book has little more substance than the song upon which it was based"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that much to say.","review":"There really isn't. This book just plain didn't grab me. The characters didn't interest me, and most of the plot twists came out of nowhere. In every review I read I hear people exclaiming over the inclusion of multiple first-person viewpoints, and I can't imagine why it's so fascinating. You can get the same effect from a Babysitters Club \\"super special.\\" Stated simply, I just thought this book was dull and nowhere near the quality of Beagle's other works, both earlier and later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked really well!","review":"I'm glad I got this for my teen son.

Over the vacations time, the families discover new things about each other, strengthen their bonds, oh, and make you laugh until your sides split.

Buy this movie, well worth the price, cause you'll watch it over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Downright hilarious!","review":"I love this movie, John Candy at his best with Dan Akroyd playing the uptight rich guy that we all love to hate. These two characters clash throughout the movie, displaying a great chemistry between the two actors. Watching this movie makes me sad that Candy is no longer with us, as he was just fun to watch.The reason that I give this 4 stars is that I could not stand the forced summer teen romance that was a part of the formula for most movies in the 80's. They could have cut those bits out altogeher and it would have been better.The physical comedy between John Candy and an eleven foot grizzly make this a classic and a must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLASSIC!!

WRONG. The adults/teens would have gotten a kick out of it, but this film was inappropriate for the kids under 14 traveling with us. (There were 7 of them, so I really made a bad choice.) The real problems for us were the foul language and sexual suggestions. (My husband says I should have known that due to the actors in the film. ha. ooops.)

You will never get sick of this movie no matter how many timees you see it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"I certainly agree with Roger Ebert on this one. From a movie starring John Candy and Dan Aykroyd, written by John Hughes, you'd expect to get entertained. \\"The Great Outdoors\\" doesn't deliver. There's hardly any plot, which could have been excused if there were plenty of funny moments, but there are only very few funny scenes and even those are only mildly amusing and not exactly laugh-out-loud funny. Most of the time the movie is just silly and slow, the plot going nowhere. Considering the talent involved it's a big disappointment and only worth watching if you're a very big fan of the stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me when it's over","review":"When I saw this movie I thought it's a shame Dan Aykroyd and John Candy wasted their skill on a dumb movie like this. I don't like it because the writer just slopped together junk and the producer acccepted it instead of saying, \\" sorry, pal people won't like this, you should rewrite it and use better humor\\". But no, he just accepted it not realizing he'd be partly known for a dumb movie like this. My point is you shouldn't waste time watching it.

Team him up with Dan Akroyd and it is as funny as you can imagine. I'm so glad that this film was released on DVD. This is a film worthy of any library of a film buff, comedy addict or John Candy fan.Synopsis: John Candy's character Chet takes his family up to the Northwoods in an effort to bond with his eldest son, Buck. What is supposed to be a relaxing getaway turns into a wild vacation when brother-in-law Roman (Dan Akryod), his wife and twin girls show up. Talk about the uninvited. Throw in a family of intelligent racoons, and a grizzly bear missing hair off the top of its head, and you'll find laughter non-stop. This is a film you will grow to love, if you don't already love it. The scene where the two men try to catch a bat is hilarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Hilarious!","review":"This movie is a family favorite and we think John Candy's best! I think so many of us can relate and the constant antics kept us in stitches. How many of us can actually eat a steak that big - including the gristle? The bald headed bear getting shot in the rear was a grand moment for us and we were almost sick from laughing!

Unfortunately, this book is required by a number of states in the training of future real estate appraisers. With over 17 years college teaching experience, I am frankly shocked -- and disappointed -- that this tome would be so widely used as a required text.

Deep basso voices can remain intact well into a singer's sixties and beyond, but coloratura sopranos are rarely delightful past fifty. Barbara Bonney's lustrous voice has lost much of its bloom and gained some huskiness as well as a wobble under pressure. Also, the other reviewer here is right to point out how poorly Bonney pronounces the text in the Quilter songs; she swallows syllables everywhere else, too. But it's too harsh to deny this singer her acclaimed musicality and intelligence. This isn't the best of Bonney's solo recitals, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and welcome the chance to hear a major singer in the Britten songs, and a non-Anglo style in the Quilter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different-sounding Barbara Bonney, but I like it!","review":"As the others have noted, those accustomed to Bonney's slender, silvery voice from her previous recordings might be in for a shock here. On this most recent recording of hers, she sounds much darker, richer, and creamier than in anything she's done before--practically unrecognizable to anyone who's familiar with her earlier stuff. I have to say, though, that I really like what I've heard on this CD. I guess I'm one of the few who often found her sound too thin and lightweight most of the time, gorgeous though it was. For those who like fuller-sounding voices (as I do) and have avoided this gifted singer's recordings in the past, you might want to give this CD a try. Her musicality and musicianship are still very much in evidence, and this particular song repertoire is gorgeous and compelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Tragic Cost of Popularity","review":"It is always such a thrill to hear recordings of top singers early in their careers when their voices are still fresh, energetic, full of flexibility and vitality and the technique is solid. Unfortunately, for some singers, the cost of being at the top is the toll on the voice, managing the impossible performing schedule most top singers confront. This recording sounds like a singer who is vocally exausted. Consequently, the technical care with which Ms. Bonney recorded her first recordings is sadly lacking here. As a voice professor I play samples of Ms. Bonney's earlier recordings as \\"what one should do\\". With this recording, I now find I am playing examples of \\"what one should not do\\". I purchased this recording for the value of the unique repertoire. I was terribly disappointed in the execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 and a half stars.","review":"At first I was laughing at what these guys where doing on stage with there own deeks.

That's the rough synopsis of this book's stupid plot. Steve Alten is actually a pretty good thriller writer and keeps the plot moving along at an entertaining pace.

The biggest thing I did not like was the father's journal. Instead of a man, who has pretty much isolated for much of his life, seems to get saner as his journal goes on.The good parts are everything else. I liked the comic book fun of the sci-fi.

You really feel like you are right there, experiencing everything that they feel. At times, I found myself even sympathizing with the villians, one of the sure signs of a great author. Domain has everything. Horror, action, spies and conspiracies. By the time you reach the final page, you'll be so wrapped up in the world Mr. Alten has created, that you will wish it was a thousand pages long. Fortunately, two sequals are in the works. Domain is a rare treat no one should miss!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast moving and fun","review":"Ok, as others have said, there are a few rather ridiculous character flaws drawn into the book, but I absolutely enjoyed the story! I had a hard time putting it down, with very few slow points in the whole book. Best part; it was a single book (well, there are others, but this one 'ends' in a very satisfying way). To tie-in so many different culture's myth's and histories was very intriguing. If you open your mind that this is Sci-Fi and just a story, I think you'll love this fascinating book. Well worth reading over a weekend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are all the previous reviewers relatives?","review":"I have read some of the previous reviews of this book, and it sounds as if they are reading a different book. I admit that I am a 'technical' guy, but even without that, there are limits.The basic premise is good, which is why I bought the book, BUT!!For exampel: 1) The US government can reconfigure an oil-drilling platform as an intelligence-gathering center and position it in the Gulf in 2 DAYS?2) The Tomahawk is a surface-to-air missile?etc., etc. Plus, the characters are pretty one-dimensional. I went to the TOR web site, but I couldn't find any place to send them my comments. If this is what the current book-buying publik wants, then I guess I'm going to save a lot of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doman...Amazing!","review":"Since MEG, I've have been a fan of Dr. Steve Alten! MEG was great, TRENCH was even better...but DOMAIN... the best book Dr. Alten has written! I honsetly could not put it down. Dr. Alten does not drag the storyline, which some other authors should take note. The charaters are great and I love how he mixes fact with fiction, it makes the story give you a chill! I can't wait for RESURECTION! Keep up the great work Dr. Alten!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Domain, a novel of deep dumbness","review":"Domain, a novel of deep dumbness.It took a month to read, but it seemed like years!I want my [$$] back! This book is one of the worse I've read.All the characters take turns at being dummies. The lead girl ismade to look almost retarded for most of the book.The main guy seems smart for a while and then gets real dumbfor most of the segments near the end.The last 300 pages of the 'original' book were obviously compressed intoabout 20 pages to shortened the book. It makes the ending soconvoluted, you can't make heads or tails of it.As I got near the end, I was so happy that I would soon be able to launch this... book into the trash can."},{"rating":"1","title":"What girl falls for a guy in a mental institution?","review":"I liked the beginning. It seemed promising, but after twenty pages I was yawning and starting to think about other things, like \\"I have to go shoping tomorrow.\\" and \\"I should walk the dog.\\" or \\"Did I lock the front door?\\" I was so distracted. The story didn't keep me interested.Mick was supposed to be sexy and he was, for a crazy guy, but there was no character build up for him, so you couldn't really undertstand him, or get any depth on his personality, and I got really confused when you'd read some part of Julius Gabriel's journal, and then a few pages later Mick would be explaining it. It's like, I got it the first time I don't need to read it again. A waste of time, in my opinion.Steve Alten is not a bad writer, he just reached a little too far with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much bunky science","review":"I don't mind an adventure novel using a little bunky science to develop a plot, but this one preaches it and I just got tired of the long lesson at the first. He takes every way out theory about Egyptian pyramids and other monuments and throws them into a big soup. Like I say, if it didn't involve a big long lecture, and more adventure, maybe so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"This book starts off with what seems like a good premise, but... there is no focus, no character building, and no clarity. I am a fan of Dan Brown books, which marry fact with fiction, and I am also a fan of other books of Domain's genre, and I love the idea of combining science with the spiritual, but this book was simply very poorly written. The plot eventually became so over-the-top that I just had to stop. Why waste any more time. This was my first Steve Alten book; I will not try another."},{"rating":"2","title":"A spectacular thriller!","review":"When I saw the first summaries of the Domain storyline, I thought that it would be a good read. I wasn't familiar with Mayan culture, so it would be a chance to learn, as well as be entertained. As I delved into the story, however, I found a brilliant plot unfolding. The story is extremely well researched, and Steve's weaving of the fiction into the facts is very well done. Just as The Trench was a step beyond MEG, Domain is many steps beyond Trench in terms of plotting, characterization, and pacing. After reading his novels and his personal story on his website, Steve has inspired me to do what I've always wanted to - write my own book. I've created my own writer's group, and my novel is well underway, with ideas for another. Having performed some research for my own book, I can appreciate how much research has gone into Domain. Thanks for the inspiration, Steve! I can't wait for Goliath, Resurrection, and Primal Waters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Interesting Interpretation","review":"Dr. Alten does a wonderful job re-interpreting (or re-inventing)the ancient Mayan myths and prophecies to create a pretty exciting thriller. There's a lot of information and history jammed into an intense story with living, breathing characters. Many people try for this effect; few get close and fewer still manage to acheive it. This one is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, loved it!","review":"Once again, Alten has kept me hooked on his books. I just love the characters, so human, so original, so real. He manages to create a quite believable tale of adventure and terror, history and myth and something to think about. I liked Michael's strenght, Dom's intuition and Ennis Chaney's personality (totally not that of your typical politician.) Are we ready to open our minds and hearts to a new era? are we ready to really care for one another and our planet? This is more than a thrilling novel, it is a wake up call."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep them coming Steve!","review":"Domain was a fun read, even read it on the prophesied day of doom. Steve does a really good job of storytelling and educating in this book. Read this before it becomes a movie. Either Domain or Meg should be a blockbuster movie, the only thing better would be both of them on the big screen. As long as Steve keeps writing, I'll keep reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alten Does It Again....","review":"Steve Alten the writer of 2 other pehnominal books (Meg and The Trench) has done it again with Domain. He weaves fact and fiction together brilliantly.The ancient civilization of Mayan's gave a prohecy thousands of years ago saying the earth will end on December 21st, 2012. The end is at hand as December 2012 nears and it is up to one man to stop it. Michael \\"mick\\" Gabriel will discover the secrets of the universe with many dangers along the way. I reccomend this book to anybody who wants a great suspensful read."},{"rating":"1","title":"another TOR bomb","review":"I've just got through Domain and what a piece of trash - in fact, I've just noticed that the last three books I've read were TOR-published books and they were all terrible. Is anybody going to put us out of our misery? Domain is poorly written, poorly thought thru (all present tense) and the characters were like cardboard. Oh, excuse, me ARE like cardboard (maybe I should underline it). I'm going to start boycotting TOR books, they're not only ridiculous and unbelievable, they're written by amateurs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good ideas, bad book","review":"Every fiction author walks a fine line between realistic fiction and pure fantastic \\"science fiction\\". Steve Alten has failed to maneuver this line. While I enjoy books of both groupings- realistic fiction, and science fiction, I prefer them separate, and enjoy each on its own. Based on an intruiging idea, ancient civilizations, secret instructions, etc- It quickly crosses the line, and descends into a low-grade alien flick.Alten struggles to remain as realistic as possible in some areas- from political situations, to tedious army technology (each followed with intricate and irrelevant acronymns), to the precise dimensions of the ancient civilizations he has obviously stuidied extensively.All this work is undone, however, with the fiery depictions of cartoon-like aliens, cheap thrills, and shallow characters. The idea is great- but the performance itself isn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun from Steve Alten","review":"Steve Alten writes good books with original ideas which are full of action, thrills and are simply enjoyable to read. This is another one of those: it involes an ancient enigma, secretly written in the Mayan calendar which predicts the end of the world unless it can be solved and somehow prevented. The main characters: psychologist Dominique Vazquez and a high-IQ son of a former archeologist Mick Gabriel are a great team and together they search for answers to solve this ancient riddle. Pure fun, mystery, prophecies and action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hangs together fairly well...","review":"If you're a Steve Alten fan, you'll definitely like this one of his offerings. Unlike the MEG shark series, which is very fast paced but more intellectually \\"breezy\\", Domain requires a little more thinking on the part of the reader. Blending archaeological fact and speculative prediction, Domain hangs together fairly well as a summer read. And who knows?-you may just want to retain this book for its background information when 2012 actually rolls around!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong on Mayan facts, weak on psychological plausibility","review":"Alten ties together a littany of Eric von Daniken facts about the pyramids, ancient Mayan ruins etc. and throws in a wild alien plot and an out of control protagonist's ego to save the world ...Zero for the use of hackneyed ancient trivia, several points for weaving a potentially interesting theory about the Yucatan peninsula meteorite, but in the end it falls apart because he has no clue about how to realistically write up psychological dynamics between his protagonist and heroine.There were shades of Lincoln-Preston here and there, but it does not deserve the comparison or the reference to those authors. This is not to say that Lincoln and Preston always get it right. They don't. But at least when they do - say in the way they mix science facts with historical fiction - they back it up with slightly better character research."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Meg","review":"It's nice to see that Alten's writing skills have improved. I read \\"Meg\\" and felt it to be a mediocre book, simply written and cliched in plot and dialogue. It's the main reason I skipped \\"The Trench.\\" \\"Domain\\" shows greatly improved writing, characters with depth and a plot that, although a bit out of this world, satisfies. The combination of genres including aliens, South American myth, and apocalyptic war blend pretty well. I am going to check out more of his books as a result of \\"Domain.\\" I hope that Alten continues to improve. If he does, he will rank up there with Matthew Reilly, James Rollins, and Preston/Child as a writer of great thrillers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuckoo's Nest on Independence Day","review":"Steve Alten has written a gripping, can't put it down horror, action-adventure, thriller yarn that is a combination of \\"One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest\\", \\"Fail-Safe\\" and \\"Independence Day.\\" He obviously researched the ancient religious myths and customs used to explain the doomsday theory which forms the basis of the book. His characters are believable and very likeable or otherwise, depending upon their roles. The momentum builds and Alten keeps the reader guessing with each plot turn. \\"Domain\\" is a fast paced roller coaster ride from the get-go and the climax is satisfying (I won't give away the ending). Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"3.5-4 stars","review":"Good read. Mr. Alten really did his research. I probably like the book because I have been to many of the places in the book. Good read.. well researched."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damn fine read","review":"Domain is an excellent book. I picked it up a week before leaving for vacation so I'd have something to read on the beach. I finished it 2 days after getting it. I couldn't stop reading. The way Alten meshes real myths, real facts, politics, psychology, and fiction is seamless. He's obviously an author who does his homework."},{"rating":"2","title":"None","review":"(Alten) singlehandedly out does Benchley, Crichton, Clancy, and Cussler combined.

I enjoyed reading Meg and The Trench, but Mr. Alten outdid himself with Domain. This book was meticulously reserched concerning the Mayan doomsday prophecy and the landmarks involved. Combine that with a healthy dose of imagination, excellent charcter develeopment and interaction, you have all the ingredients for a story that is a real page turner that stimulates the imagination. This novel I feel will be Mr. Alten's breakthrough that will give him the creditability and attention that he truely deserves.

I think the jacket runs slightly small but not a lot. I usually would get a medium (size 8) but I went ahead and got a large. The fit is good, and I'm glad I got the large because I don't like a jacket that feels binding or restrictive. However, I think a medium would have worked for me too. A size medium is usually size 8 to 10 - this jacket seems 1/2 size off, meaning their medium is a size 6 to 8. It really is a very nice jacket and if you are unsure, I would suggest ordering on in your regular size and one a size up, then return the one that doesn't fit (or give it as a gift). $20 is an amazing price for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"Straight from the box this jacket was stunning.

The book contains a disproportionate number of technical and specialized terms and is somewhat noun-heavy. There is a pronounciation guide for every word, which is for the most part very distracting and considering how phonetic German spelling is, totally unnecessary. Finally, and probably most troublesome, is the fact that the verb tenses, irregularities, and noun plurals and irregularities aren't included. It's a good little book to have but you need a vocabulary of at least the most commonly used 15000 words at your command to really succeed in being able to live in a foreign environment. Other books, like \\"10000 Worter\\" seem to be more complete.

While the style of this book was narrative, and thus did not allow for a lot of metaphor or poetic descriptions, it nonetheless breathed with richness. My only complaint (such as it is) is that after 30+ chapters with Mineko Iwasaki, there seemed to be a great rush through the years following her retirement to the present day. And while yes, this memoir is mainly about Mineko's time as a geiko, it was a bit disappointing to glaze over this strong and vibrant woman's later years when I had grown so attached to reading her tales."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would have given this more stars but Mineko is not a nice person","review":"I enjoyed the book in general as this subject has always facinated me.

Things that Arthur Golden wrote about were said by him to be fiction, based on things that others told him. She wasn't the only geisha that he spoke to. I found Mineko a spoiled brat and very money hungry. She even comments that she didn't really care about taking care of her customers. All she wanted to do was dance. I couldn't enjoy this book because I disliked the author immensely. I find her too selfish and cold to give her praise for her book. Her litigation being won was, to me, another money making scheme.

That shouldn't matter much if always used with the same pet in the same location and manner, to determine if that pet is gaining or losing. It wouldn't necessarily give an accurate \\"absolute\\" weight that could be compared to the weight of the same pet on other scales, such as at the vet."},{"rating":"1","title":"This scale is neither precise nor accurate","review":"While this scale is definitely on the cheap side, I wouldn't use it to monitor the weight of a cat. You will be unable to spot weight changes any smaller than half a pound. Even though the readout is given in 2 ounce increments, placing the same weight on the scale several times in a row gives results as far as 4 ounces off in each direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong Piano","review":"Joe Sullivan was the leading pianist in the white Chicago jazz tradition, with a distinctive style synthesising elements of the Harlem pianists and Earl Hines, and with a strong percussive approach which often concealled a surprising lyricism.This CD featues some of his best known recordings. Tracks 1 - 8 and 21 - 24 are excellent solos, including such originals as the Waller / Johnson influenced \\"Gin Mill Blues\\" the swinging \\"My Little Pride and Joy\\", and his driving showpiece, \\"Little Rock Getaway\\".Tracks 9 - 16 feature his successful if rather uninspired Cafe Society Orchestra from 1940. Tracks 17 - 20 feature Sullivan in a trio with the unique Pee Wee Russell, whose bronchial rasping clarinet style suited Sullivan well.The solo tracks are essential for lovers of mainstream piano jazz: Sullivan never quite equalled these performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Sound Ruins a Great Documentary","review":"I looked forward to watching this potentially excellent documentary of a period I have always been interested in.

Our expectations were much higher. We are big fans of Ms. Hughes, and we have all her other DVD's. The audio was so terrible that you really can't hear her narrative. We do not like reading subtitles, which is an option with this DVD. The reinactments were so bad we could tell some of them were wearing Pendleton shirts. She must have asked for volunteers. Compared to the great quality of her previous DVD's, this was a real joke. I can't believe she put this out. She must need money? Please, Ms. Hughes, you are better than this pathetic attempt!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO!","review":"I'm a big fan of Bettany Hughes and have all of her other DVDs, so when I saw this video advertized on Amazon I ordered it immediately. Playing it, though, was a huge disappointment. Her narration is all but drowned out by the background sound effects, making the program unwatchable.Sad to say, if you're looking for something to do that's informative and entertaining, bang yourself in the side of your head with a slice of lemon wrapped around a brick - it'll be more satisfying than trying to watch the 'Roman Invasion of Britain.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Informational DUD!","review":"More information was provided in the 10 page insert that accompanied the DVD than was presented on the DVD itself. Many scenes seem to repeat themselves with the same actors, which did not follow the narrative. The audio was also unsatisfactory, especially the voice of the lead narrator, while the others were only marginal - difficult to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Audio","review":"As previous respondent said the audio made a hash of what was to be an otherwise interesting documentary.

I've been getting \\"Fire & Flavor\\" brand that's sold at my local store and these Nature's Cuisine planks are thinner. Even worse the Nature's Cuisine are rough with wood fibers on both sides (even after wiping them off) - to the point where it got in the food a bit. I don't know if I got a bad batch or not, but I can tell you that the \\"Fire & Flavor\\" always have one side smoothed out and even their 'rough' side is still smoother than the surface of these Nature's cuisine.Fwiw, after a number of side by sides, my wife and I both agree that we enjoy the Salmon grilled on the Alder over the cedar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alas, New Evidence","review":"Drew's argument depends on the chariot being a 2nd-millenium BCE invention, made in the Middle East and/or Anatolia.Unfortunately, recent archaeological digs in the Urals and Kazakhstan show that the chariot was inveted there -- in northern Central Asia and western Siberia -- no later than the 21st century BCE.And since the chariots discovered in these graves were fully developed, the date may well be much earlier -- as far back as 3000 BCE, perhaps.The attempt to date the entire Indo-European expansion to as late as 1600 BCE is also rather ludicrous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book jacket/cover is misleading!","review":"This was undoubtedly one of the worst books I have ever read. The jacket cover describes three single girlfriends that are seeking a man to marry...Not true...! I won't spoil it, but when you are still married...you shouldn't be seeking your next husband. The book also has a paranormal twist--and unless you are an occult worshipper--for the most part you won't have a clue about some of the things that are going on.

Ms. Jackson is a a very talented writer but I don't know what happened with this book. I was sooooo disappointed with the romance/voodoo/suspense theme. I am not into witchcraft and this book focused a lot about the \\"darkside\\" and demons. I was truly not feeling this particular book and if I could have given it no stars then I would of done it. This demonic theme was all about sex and demons and very little about the foundation of the relationship. The secondary characters were not necessary in this book but had enough drama for their own seperate novel. You will be better off waiting for this book at a garage sale or library. I actually put my book in the garbage and wish that I could get a refund for the cost of this book and the time that it took to read this horrible book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ms. Never Again","review":"I have to say that this is the worst book I have ever read. The book had no rhyme or reason. I couldn't and still have yet been unable to finish it. The blurb on the back of the book is completely misleading. Its supposedly a story about three female friends looking for mr. right, the book focuses on one of the friends and everyone else are secondary characters with no additional information to impart. Sort of fillers to keep you turning the page.Also the supernatural aspect of the book comes out of nowhere. Not really adding anything to the story. Theres no justification for where the book goes. There were so many grammatical errors and lack of structure, it wasn't worth finishing.I'm sorry miss jackson, i apologize but a writer you are not..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"I would like to highly recommend \\"Lone Star Nation\\" by H.W Brands.

I\`m not sure why Gill decided to smear the Roman Catholic Faith along with the soon to be Saint Escrivo!! He must not believe he will be judged someday. He makes the Opus Dei ,its founder and,by inference the Pope (see Frontispiece) appear to be the Mafioso arm of the Catholic faith.He even took a swipe at Pope Pius XII with the false accusations concerning the Holocaust (I guess the estimate by Jewish scholars the he saved over 800,000 Jews during the Second World War doesn\`t impress Gill). I recommend the book to Catholic-bashing bigots. He\`s lost me as a fan and reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Opus Dei, ad gloriam dei","review":"The author hits on Opus Dei. He hits so hard that one might think that he wants to settle a score. After all, Opus Dei is the major order in today's Roman Catholic church, having supplanted the Jesuits. And its founder, Josemaria Escriva de Balaguer, will be pronounced to be a saint of the church any day now. While I am familiar with some of the tenets Mr. Gill mentions, others have to be taken on faith or as exaggerations.The book, as a mystery, has a tendency to move slowly and in convoluted ways. Every one of the main characters could be the culprit, and the process of elimination is none too swift. But, if you are interested in learning about Opus Dei, then this book is an easy to read introduction."},{"rating":"1","title":"It worked, but my fish did not like it.","review":"The first time I used it, I used it according to directions.

When they didn't respond to even food by noon, I got them out of the tank and put them into our quarantine tank until my husband could come home and completely empty and clean everything in the 10-gallon tank.

One, it is less efficient, or heats slower, and two, the placement of the handle is such that it is cumbersome to lift/ carry. It has to be lifted with 2 hands. The HFH2992-U had it on the upper back portion so it's really easy to lift it with one hand and move it around.Other than that it is very similar to my favorite heater, so I am still happy with it.

With this model, I can use it in the bedroom and not be bothered by the fan noise. Yeah, the thermostat might not be NASA accurate but it works fine. If you don't like it, just use the manual high/low heat setting. I've been using 4 of them in my house for last 7 years, continuously in the winter. One died last year, other three are working fine. I agree with other reviewers that switch design could be better but it's not a deal-breaker for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for heating a bedroom","review":"The Holmes HFH2986-U is whisper quiet, as advertised. I've tried several other heathers but the fans have all been too noisy for use in a sleeping area. I liked the earlier model a little more because it had a temperature dial to provide a more flexible temperature adjustment but it's no longer available. This new model certainly deserves four stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"ripoff","review":"These guys are selling this heater for $65.99 plus $10.79 for shipping!!!

I've tried every possible setting and it will only turn on for about a min before it shuts off and never comes back on again.

Same model andit was quite fine. Easier to send them a new onethan to get the other back to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Well Designed","review":"This heater is over designed and inconvenient to use. It heats your space as well as any other personal heater, but the thermostat provides no additional control over an \\"On/Off\\" switch. And the handle grips on the sides give you no leverage at all in moving it around. It takes both hands to pick it up which is very awkward - especially if the heater is under your desk. I purchased two other heaters from different manufacturers at the same time and they are far easier to manage because they have handles on top. They were also less expensive and provide the same heat output. This one isn't worth the extra cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delivered very quickly-but heater did not work!","review":"Got the item in 1 day, drop shipped from within state, wow!But the heater would NOT work (not the nerds or my fault) in temperature mode at all, Only High on, & Low on worked.Not acceptable if you don't want it 90 degrees or higher! :)Asked for a Return, got authorization promptly, shipped back USPS-slowly, still awaiting credit.Expect both to/from shipping charges ($21) & unit price to be refunded, obviously will see what is done by The Nerds.I hope they are fair with no hassle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quiet but that's it","review":"The thermostat is my big problem with this heater. I have it on 80, but I know the room temp is well below that (about 68-70) and it still won't cycle on. When it does come on, it stays on for less than a minute. I bought this at my local store for $39, not through Amazon. But I just had to check out the reviews here to confirm that the thermostat problem was not just specific to my heater. I'm returning this anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blew out our electric power","review":"This heater on first appearance was well-made. It was remarkably quiet. That being said we had to return it.It consistently blew our electric circuits. Even when we tried putting it on the lowest temperature, it still drew too much power.Not sure why this was happening but felt compelled to return the heater and buy another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works really well. Super quiet!","review":"I use this in the office and it's so quiet you can barely tell it's on. It puts out a nice hot breeze... strong enough to rustle paper that's 8-10' away. The unit itself stays cool and seems safe. I don't use the thermostat, just put it on high then shut it off when it gets hot, so I'm not sure how well the therm works. I've had it three months now, and have been using it almost every day with no problems at all. No shut-offs, no overheating, no funny smells, just works as it should.Two other people at my office have purchased the same unit after seeing mine. I can't say enough good things. It's perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very quiet, great heater","review":"I bought one for my daughter's bedroom after having one at my office last winter. I tried my husband's heater that he said was quiet...not! My definition of quiet is that you can't hear the motor at all, just a rush of air but only when you get within a few feet of it. The high setting is what I use at work since I have an open office but the low setting in a closed 12X13 bedroom is a bit too warm so we use the thermostat there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thermostat mode is a JOKE and an AFTERTHOUGHT!","review":"There are much better working heaters out there for the money. I've had the Holmes 'One-Touch' for over a year now, and although it does provide OK heat in manual (constant on) mode, it does not work well at all in thermostat mode. The unit turns on for only perhaps a minute or two, then shuts off for a much longer period of time. It does not seem to have a temperature sensor to control the unit's thermostat, and thus keep an area heated properly. The unit would have been better off if it had a timer, where you could set it to let's say turn on for 5 minutes, then off for 10, or whatever else time intervals you would need to properly keep your area heated. This is a major shortcoming, since you don't want to keep your space heater on constantly for long periods of time (fire hazard), and you must rely on a thermostat or timer mode to keep the unit on in intervals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous Product -- Do Not Buy!","review":"I bought this heater about six weeks ago. One morning I turned it on, and saw sparks and smoke pouring out of it. Luckily, I was there and could turn it off.

Consider yourself warned!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It does what it's supposed to do","review":"This is a very small heater that I purchased for under my desk. It performs well and keeps me warm. Most importantly, it is very quiet. It does take a long time to heat up the area under my desk, but I'll take that over a loud heater.The only reason this is a 4-star rating instead of a 5-star rating is that the cord is very short. It is about a foot too short to sit under my desk, so I have it located to the side instead of under my desk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holmes heater","review":"This has been a nice space heater to use. It has manual low, manual high, and thermostat temp auto settings,. This is the quietest heater I've ever had. It doesn't put out tremendous heat but it works alright.

I wanted another one and should have stuck with a sure thing. Instead I let the lower price of the Holmes lure me in. Not the same. :( It's true, you get what you pay for. If you must buy the cheaper heater, go to Target and get 30% off all their heaters now at least. I just saw this heater for $25 at Target. I'm going back to Bed Bath and Beyond with a 20% off coupon and buying another Vornado. Their coupons never expire by the way even though they have an expiration date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thermostat Has Never Worked","review":"I purchased this unit off season -so I paid a fraction of the 39.99 being asked here.The thermostat has never worked on the unit -only the continuous HI / LO settings. (I got sick, forgot about it and the 30 days to return it expired -never thought about the warranty). I use this unit in a rarely used 4X6 bathroom. This unit is cumbersome, fat and not easy to grip to pick up and transport to another space. So, even though the functions are not all operable, I've found a practical use for it. The unit is relatively quiet -much quieter than their HFH442. It would probably be a very useful unit if the thermostat were operable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gives infrequent, insufficient bursts of warm air","review":"I got this at Rite Aid to keep me warm at night. I specifically chose this fan heater because of its thermostat feature so that my room wouldn't get too hot overnight.I tried setting the thermostat to 70 degrees, but when that didn't satisfy me, I set it to 80 on high. This thing behaves ridiculously. It'll turn on for a minute or so, but then it'll off for about a half hour before starting up again. Even with it set at 80 degrees, the room can't have been more than 72 degrees when I awoke in the morning. I don't think it ever gets up to 80 degrees before shutting off again. I'll be returning this to the store.The 1 Touch control sounds simple and convenient, but it's actually a bit of a hinderance to have to cycle through a dozen options. A plus is that the fan really is considerably quiet (though, on low, it has an eerie buzz to it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ellis & Green","review":"Guitarist Herb Ellis is joined by rhythm guitarist Freddie Green, pianist Ross Tompkins, bassist Ray Brown and drummer Jake Hanna for this lightly swinging but uneventful program which has been reissued on CD.

I noticed that each of these supplements listed Dextrose as the first ingredient, i.e. they contain more dextrose than any other single ingredient. So I decided to see what Dextrose alone would do for me, as it's about one fourth the price of any of the supplements I had purchased.I wasn't disappointed. Dextrose has worked as well, if not better, than anything else I've tried.

The album itself, from a record collecting standpoint, is as hard to find as it gets, with most of the mint copies firmly entrenched in Japan and England personal record collections. Copies generally sell for $300.00+ when located for sale. Japan's P-Vine label originally issued the cd some years ago, not availible worldwide. At this time it is availible worldwide. Several of the ballads are unforgettable once heard and overall the album was one of quality recordings. The album is far from obscurity to long term soul record collectors. Any sweet soul music collector would be well advised to purchase this cd, now! If it goes out of print, the numbers will surely go up. The current cd prices reflect a fraction of the value of the album, a huge bargain! Another great job by P-Vine to release this cd when it did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent machine that does the job.","review":"I just received my JMAS1000 a couple of days ago. It does the job as a vibrating type massage. The attachments are nice to have because it allows you to use the machine on different muscles depending on what you need. It doesn't do a \\"thumping\\" type massage as some of the other massage machines do though, just a vibration. My only complaint is that the 1 and 2 settings on it could have been 2 and 3 and they could have done with one slightly lower setting. The infrared is kind of just there and I feel like it works, but ultimately I am unsure if it is helping or not.

The first season took the 'serial killer' formula and added a twist of paranormal, and a hint of conspiracy - and the result was an excellent drama with haunting characters. The first season introduced us to the world of Frank Black - a dark world highlighted by the light that he found in the love of his family. The cases he consulted on were grisly, and terrifying, but also interesting and in some sense, spiritual.

If it was on now and not competing with The X-Files, it would be great. The acting, stories were SUPER and visually, one of the best shows ever, in my own HUMBLE opinion. Season one was just GREAT. I hope people will watch these and maybe they'll someday get an idea to do a feature film or go back and do another series. It was the CSI of its time, with a Chris Carter influence.

DVD quality epsiodes of the entire seasaon for roughly $30. Amazon shipped it perfectly in tact. There were no loose discs, even though they issued a warning about it-I checked every one.

The episodes in this first season are incredibly dark and brutal at times but the underlying theme of evil and how it manifests is an intruiging one. Despite its apparent bleak tone, Millennium portrays light and hope amongst all the death & carnage with a constant reminder that evil is just a matter of perspective - what we see & feel can be deceptive. Good people with intentions can indeed do evil things.The Millennium Season 1 DVD set is highly recommended to all casual viewers and those who appreciate quality TV productions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this DVD and convince Fox to release others.","review":"This was one of the few TV series I ever tried to schedule my time around. I don't think I ever missed an episode, and I've been waiting for this DVD to come out for a long time. The series had a darker pitch than its more-popular older sibling The X-Files, but it was engrossing to the point of mania. It may have been bleak, but I made sure every week that I was there to experience it.As for later seasons of the show, it is unfortunate that Fox is less than enthusiastic about putting them on DVD. The best way to demonstrate that the public would be interested in buying season 2 and so on, though, is to purchase the first season, not boycott it. As they say, money talks... and I was skeptical that I'd ever see any Millenium on DVD! Hardly anyone remembers it; it seems like the show that time forgot... so pick your battles.

I happen to love film's like this - definitely a real independent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what's listed","review":"This review is based entirerly on what's printed above.

Chris Carter fans will love it. If this DVD sells The Lone Gunmen will come out!!! Buy...Buy...Buy!! Long live the Lone Gunmen!!!!!Check out Millenium Too. WoooHooo!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Series? Ha ha ha ha!","review":"I had to laugh when I saw that \\"Harsh Realm\\" was coming to DVD. The show only lasted 3 episodes before being cancelled. And with good reason - a half-baked concept, poor writing, and a complete waste of talent (mainly DB Sweeney and Terry O'Quinn). Chris Carter let the excellent \\"Millennium\\" fall apart in the third season, and as \\"X Files\\" was starting to slide downhill, he came up with the lame \\"Harsh Realm\\", thus assuring his reputation as a has-been as a producer and creative force."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid like the plague","review":"Harsh Realm is pretty dreadful. Poor writing, poor direction, and poor production values. Time makes the series even more risible - unlike Chris Carter's other series Millennium and the X Files."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Complete\\" - not really","review":"Ok - I was a fan of the short-lived \\"Harsh Realm\\" - but I have to point out that the word \\"complete\\" in the title of the DVD set really means \\"all the episodes that were made\\" and not \\"what would have been a complete season\\".3 shows aired on TV and then either FX or Sci-Fi (can't remember) aired the remaining 6 episodes that were already made. However, after seeing the 9th episode, you are left hanging in the middle of a plot. And not like a season cliffhanger...it just drops because they had planned to make a few more episodes to round out the season. - So....while I recommend this for Harsh Realm fans...I can't recommend it for newcomers, as if you *are* grabbed by the plot, you are going to be horribly disappointed that you never get to finish the story and find out what happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"From the creator of X-files","review":"Chris Carter's works focus on the seen/unseen elements of faith, with additional religious themes such as Messianism (the chosen one who will save the world), struggle in a controlled world full of conspiracy, unexplicable elements that have to be experienced to be believed, order and balance in the universe and so on.Harsh Realm uses the virtual reality concept as a metaphor for being part of a delusional world, which is a false representation of what our existence should have been. In the few episodes that were produced, the characters learn to renew their hope in a world controlled by an autocratic despot who believes that the world can function at its best under his guidance.Overall, it's an excellent batch of episodes, each having movie-like quality, and as good as the X-files series."},{"rating":"2","title":"great prose, signifying....what?","review":"Patagonia is a sparsely inhabited arid area in the south of Argentina. Bruce Chatwin visited there for a year and wrote this book. It reads like a journal.The prose is descriptive, frugal, and unadorned. As a guide to writers, it's hard to do better. Yet, there isn't much of an overall story and no dramatic arc. It was tough for me to get through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the patagonia I know","review":"I have been to Patagonia, and I saw many different things, none of what the author speaks of.

I finished the book, but not without a struggle."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read for those who love travel writing with dry wit","review":"What travel writing should be. History, observation and quirky encounters and tales woven together to create a unique form of story telling. With humor as dry as the Sahara the author reveals the unique history, people, geography and climate of Patagonia. This guy makes Paul Thoroux read like Fromer's"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow as a sloth","review":"When a book lacks tension and features extensive quoting, it's bound to be boring. This book is boring, and the main reason is that it lacks a narrative thread, other than \\"been there, saw somebody, told me a long and winding story about somebody who was here some day\\". All trips are inner trips, but in this case I would say Chatwin looked inside himself, found not a lot, and decided instead to cut and paste from old stories from down south."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial, sometimes boring","review":"I was very dissapointed when I first read this so famoues book, that many people interested in Patagonia use to read.The autor has a very superficial point of view of this territory and its people, there's no deep sight in the stories of the people themselves, who are seen merely as some kind of zoo animals, besides the only detailed descriptions the autor makes is about physical appearence (fat, slim, dark, no teeth, wrinkles, ugly, etc.), specially if they are men, what could tell us a lot about him.Some of the stories are quite absurd and show that he didn't understand a thing about Patagonia, sometimes centered in romantic stories of fugitives from the far west, yes, a part of the legend of patagonia, but...And finally, the sometimes racist comments on people, specially indians and chileans workers on the estancias (he always describe them as lazy and drunk!!!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected More Depth of Vision","review":"This is a book on a potentially engaging topic that came to me with high critical recommendation, but frankly didn't deliver. Chatwin's narrative is sentimental and seems in many cases superficial. His observations of the Welsh sheep ranchers seemed focused on insignificant details to the point that one may wonder if Chatwin had ever been diagnosed with autism. I couldn't finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chatwin a colonial, anti-Semitic jerk","review":"I started this book expecting to prefer it to Theroux and, after reading Travels in a Thin Country by Sara Wheeler, looking forward to Chatwin's version of Patagonia. Chatwin's focus is on the colonial families, especially those from the British Isles. He obviously has no sympathy for or interest in Latin residents. And then to top it off he tells of a Mrs. Wood who (gasp) tries to pass herself off as English when she is really a \\"Russian Jewess.\\" Then he follows up with Simon Radowitsky, who \\"with the wild hope of his Race\\" is irrational. This book was published in 1977, not 1877, but you wouldn't know it from Chatwin's sensitivities. Read Wheeler for a cultured English viewpoint on Chilean Patagonia. And a much more interesting book."},{"rating":"1","title":"a stranger here","review":"Chatwin never understood Patagonia, moreover he never liked it. I know this because Chatwin himself said so. Anyway, all the wonderful people who lives there and fight their lives over day after day, don't like Chatwin either. So we are even, although Chatwin passed by, and wonderful Patagonia is for ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best travel book I've read","review":"Although a little slow starting, an excellent book filled with wonderful anecdotes, historical information and beautiful geography. Well worth the read"},{"rating":"2","title":"In Patagonia","review":"I liked the fact that the author traversed the country on foot or by hitchhiking, getting a very close feel for the country. He interviews or quotes older experienced people who give a real feel for their area."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rough Jem","review":"Chatwin's Patagonia reads like it was written in fits and starts after long days of travel.

It just makes it smoooooth. I use my moisturizer over it most of the time, but sometimes, I just use this and it's awesome.

But it's still a remarkable work - a subtle blending of farce and tragedy,strong and compassionate, beautifully structured and ironic. The background, conveyed with great economy of words, is very vivid. The characters, though rather familiar figures - typical inhabitants of Greeneland - are saved from caricature by Greene's compassionate intelligence. And as a study of commitment and neutrality, the novel is on a par with Greene's The Quiet American."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE POWER OF THE MASTERPIECE","review":"This is one of the most powerful novels ever written. I think it was the best work of Graham Greene. In this book Greene was able to achieve a very masterful dialog, and he developed so powerful an memorable characters. We can witness how the internal struggle of the main characters intermingles with the power struggle in the country and the problems of the time. This is a very strong book that should be read and known."},{"rating":"2","title":"great novel, poor edition","review":"A great novel, and a great read...this is less about Haiti than about modern man, an empty self where everything is possible and survivable.But this editon is badly proof read.

It's great to take to places where you'll have to wait a while because you don't need to read it from beginning to end- you can open it to anyplace and flip around. I loved how the Wade brothers assumed the identies of all sorts of people, from mental patients to animal jewelry designers. It just shows how versatile they are. Their letters are always formal, though hilarious (such as asking Listerine for recipies and trying to find a house shaped like a W that can withstand atomic bombs). An excellent book for long- or short-term reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had purchased this sterilizer based on a recommendation from a friend. After just a few uses, the steamer stopped working. When the lever to turn the steamer on was pushed, it just wouldn't turn on any more. I contacted the First Years manufacturer, and to say the least, they did have excellent customer service. They had no problem replacing the unit. Upon receiving the second unit, I used the steamer once. And because the steamer couldn't hold every thing on the first run I had to run it twice in a row. To my disappointment, I pressed the lever and again it did not work. Frustratingly, I pushed the lever several times and then the light finally came on. Unless you cool it for about a half hour or more, this is how my unit operated. I'm sure that not every one's experience is the same but this was how mine was. I definitely would caution buyers on the product - only because this problem occured twice with the units that I have used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"We too had problems with turning the sterilizer on. The unit would not turn on when the lever was pressed, but several presses got it to work a couple of times. After about 6 uses it died completely. Not sure what the hard part about making a hotplate that is switched on by depressing a lever (like an electric kettle) is exactly, but these guys found it.This unit also left a LOT of condensation in the stuff we sterilized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great at first...","review":"I bought this right before my daughter was born and have used it every day since she was born 4 months ago. A week ago it just stopped working. I really liked this steamer and it had served me well but now was just not turning on anymore. So I went out and bought the exact same steamer. I used it for 2 days and then on the third day, yesterday, it wouldn't turn on anymore. I'm taking it back today and getting something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars!!! Avoid this product at all costs!!!!","review":"We received this product off of our baby registry a couple of months before our due date and never used it until a week before the delivery. It worked the first time, but never again! I repeat we used it one time and then it stopped working, it just would not turn on!!!!! I asked the retailer for store credit but it was after their return period. I then sent a email to The First Years explaining the situation and never received a reply. Lousy product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"I have this and have used it for about 5 months.

Plus, it's about twenty bucks less than the Avent. More money to use on diapers."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BE CHEAP AND BUY THIS!!","review":"I think possibly the Worst product ever made. I registered for Avent, but my sister was cheap and got me this p.o.s., broke down in two weeks! (the on button wouldn't stay on..) Yes, I read the directions, called customer care, went online, etc etc) The Avent sterilizer works out to be only a bit more and is such a superior product to this (and you get two free bottles!!)With a newborn, it was such an inconvenience to deal with poor workmanship. I'm just hoping to spare some of you out there some aggravation- thank god for review sections :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad product","review":"I purchased this product and loved it at first, however after a few months of use it stopped working.

Why would I pay more money for a product that just stopped working after a few months.... Are they crazy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"rusted","review":"Pretty cheap product. I used it a few times then the base started rusting. I tried scrubbing and everything. I cannot use it now as it is unsafe for the baby to use bottles steamed in rust water!

I purchased this item, and it quit working after a week of normal use."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the $","review":"I have used this steamer daily for 5 months now. It leaks water all over the counter every time I use it. It does hold a good amount at once, although you have to wait for it to cool to run it twice in a row. The metal plate has become discolored. I wish I had done more research before I bought it - now I will probably have to replace it - it just makes too much of a mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Item","review":"The item is very attractive BUT within two of use, the metal base started to rust. I called the company and they were trying to pass it off repeatedly as 'mineral deposits' as if I don't know rust. Anyway I am the point where after minutes of trying to convince them, they agreed for me to return it so we will see. I find this sort of customer service ridiculous!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Serves its purpose","review":"I use the Playtex Drop-Ins bottle system to feed my baby, so I needed a better and safer alternative than boiling to sterilize the nipples and such.I chose this particular steam sterilizer, since it seemed to be the easiest to use, it got good reviews and would work for what I needed it for.I like this a lot, it saves time and sterilizes like it's supposed to.The things that I don't like is that it's not large enough to fit the bottles (I thought it was a lot larger and was kind of disappointed at how small it was when it arrived), only the caps, nipples, closing rings, pacifiers and other small items. It doesn't have a drying feature, so like with boiling, I have to wait till everything cools down and air drys before I can use anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"another disapointment from one of the greatest","review":"there is nothing about this cd i like. i found 90% of it to be boring and repetative. it all sounds the same. i have read other reviews that said how different it was from \\"dreamland\\", but to me, i can't tell them apart. i even listened to it all the way through 3 times. if you're having trouble sleeping i highly recomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks very little.","review":"Was underwhelmed by the seller's use of full CD art and noting in small print below that it was disc only.Thanks very little."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Robert Plant CD With Genuine Band","review":"MIGHTY REARRANGER is a great Robert Plant CD, his second with Strange Sensation, which, unlike the musicians who backed him on his 80s/90s solo CDs, is a genuine band, much like Led Zeppelin was. This CD, like his five solo CDs of the 80s and 90s, continues to go where Led Zeppelin might have gone had drummer John Bonham been able to overcome his alcoholism. Anyone who loves Led Zeppelin will want this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLANT AT HIS WORST","review":"I am always leary about old rockers putting out new material. I have been a Robert Plant fan for years but this album really shows Plant's age. I really don't like the fact that he changes band members every couple of albums either. The 80's and 90's were Plant's best years. I really don't care for Plant's new style of music. I prefer the \\"Principle of Moments\\" and \\"Now and Zen\\" type of music. This music would be great if I was traveling through a jungle or visiting Africa. Not good, save your money. Purchase some of Plant's earlier projects if you want to hear some good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bobby boy knocks it out of the park...","review":"I love the zep. Favorite band ever. As a teen I fought for Plant when all my buddies said his new stuff was terrible and in the late eighties it was terrible (Now and Zen, Manic Nirvana). But his early stuff was damn good e.g., Pictures at eleven and Principles of Moments. Fate of nations was great and then it was of course a beautiful day when he got back together with Pagey (although Page lost his mojo in...1979?) But with this record he owns it. Fifty something years old and I mean he owns it on this record. The band smokes, the production is killin, songs are great and Plant shows up and schools you. Of course he doesn't scream like a banshee -hasn't done that since 1975 for Pete's sake. But he makes a great record here for sure -much, much better than Dreamland. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"another great solo work from Robert Plant","review":"Hving been a Plant fan since his early Zep days, i can tell you this album is a true gem. All the songs are equally amazing and the true rock sound is here once again! Rock on RObert!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strangely addictive","review":"First off, I have to say to all the one-star reviewers that complain this album isn't as good as Led Zeppelin stuff: QUIT LIVING IN THE PAST. Robert Plant has come a long way since those days, and while I don't know if I can necessarily say that Mighty Rearranger is his best album, it's still great. There are several powerful tracks to be found on here, like \\"Another Tribe\\", \\"Tin Pan Valley\\" and the title track.Smooth songs like \\"Shine It All Around\\" and \\"All the King's Horses\\" also impress. The only problems I had were that the political \\"Freedom Fries\\" was a little too hard to follow; and \\"Somebody Knocking\\" ended really abruptly. Also, the hidden track after \\"Brother Ray\\" is a new version of \\"Shine It All Around\\", and I didn't really care for it. (Robert Plant with a techno song? Come on.) Oh well; Mighty Rearranger is still worth adding to your collection.Anthony Rupert"},{"rating":"2","title":"percy does it again","review":"It is amazing that at his age and what he has alreay accomplished in a decades old career that robert plant still is vital and making good, fresh music. His new album with his new band is just fine and his voice is fit as a fiddle. I saw him on letterman last nite and he looks great, tanned, trim and ready to rock.He understands his past and is willing to go on with his business and explore new terrain. I was very pleased the first time I heard the new album, it has been getting good reviews and I read a review or two of his recent shows and they were terrific. I applaud mr.plant for not resting on his laurels and his fans should be happy with his new album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be 10 stars!!!","review":"One of the best things Plant has done...Plain and simple... Easily the best of any of his solo albums (and I have them all!!) and right up there with Zeppelin! I was skeptical even though I am a fan, but this cd put to rest any doubts I had. You can tell he's matured but still sounds fantastic!! I can only hope we get more albums like this soon because Im already on my second copy of this one!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Please, people!","review":"I've been a fan of Robert Plant for years, but I haven't followed his career as closely as some of you other reviewers out there. A friend of mine suggested that I check out this record and after years of appreciating Robert's songwriting and concept, I was pleasantly surprised that he turned in such an engaging effort. True artists grow and refine themselves. I believe that is the natural course for any discipline. If you are a fan, you will love this album. If you are an armchair critic, you will rate it low and say ignorant things about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised by a giant","review":"Some weeks ago I saw Robert Plant performing live in the show of Jools Holland and I was pleasantly surprised by this giant of rock. OK, he does not have the same voice anymore as in the days of Led Zeppelin, but he (and the band) clearly have found new inspiration to make an original rock album. I love this album, it shows good song writing in rock music asks for more than 3 chord songs. The songs show tension, emotion, explode from time to time, etc. A lot happens here on Mighty Rearranger and it seems that the giant Plant has risen up again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily the best CD I've bought in years","review":"I've always found Plant's post-Zeppelin work a little lifeless. But not this time - lively, surprising, amazingly rich and satisfying music, this is easily his best work in 25 years. I bought this CD in May and it is STILL the one I listen to more often than any other - if he had 10 more like this one to sell, I'd buy them all tomorrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"Stuck in the past? Don't bother. This is an album by Robert Plant and the Strange Sensation. There are 6 talented musicians involved and it is a good thing. I bought my first Zep album in 1970, but I have since tossed the lavalite and damned if I can find my mood ring.This album is absolutely brilliant. Great work guys, thank you for it. I'll see you 7/15. You'll know me , I'll be the fat middle aged guy with graying hair wearing the Stewie 'you suck' t-shirt. Hmmm, upon further consideration good luck picking me out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plant In Fine Form","review":"As impossible as it may seem, Plant sounds totally fresh on this album. \\"Another Tribe\\", \\"Shine It All Around\\", \\"Tin Pan Valley\\", and \\"All The King's Horses\\" are the best tunes here. If you let it, this album will take you on a fantastic trip. I suggest you book your ticket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"The band is tight and Plant hits all the right notes in this release. Plant's singing is quieter throughout but not less moving. Some of the Zep-like yells are not his forte anymore anyhow! It sounds on some of the tracks that a new form of music is being forged -- electronica/cerebral rock -- but it is all done with real musicians and real instruments so its all quite natural sounding. I think any Zep fan should enjoy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plant pulls a classic","review":"No doubt everyone questions when one zepplin does a solo album. I went and saw Plant recently and got turned on to some of his new tunes and decided to purchase this cd. Playing it through is a great experience, he really gets back to his roots. The strange sensation are a fantastic band (not back up band)and the tunes are proof of a partnership made to rock.

This movie isn't a slight resemblance to Shattered or a similar tale...IT IS SHATTERED with a different title, different actors in a foreign language! Even the main characters flashbacks to going through the car windshield in the accident throughout as his own memories fight the false ones his deceptive \\"wife/mistress\\" have fed him conflict all there.

I wish the original members had stuck together...I still don't know what happened?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alice Cooper - 'Easy Action' (Capitol)","review":"Originally released in 1970,as this was the original band's second lp.About as good as the first effort 'Pretties For You'(see my review).As I remember,BOTH albums were pretty much a stiff UNTIL 'Billion Dollar Babies' became a million seller.After the Alice Cooper Group had become world known,that's when fans became interested in their early works such as 'Easy Action'.You can hear their Zappa influence.As for myself,I've never been that much of a Frank Zappa fan.Also felt the band's first two records showed just how much Alice&crew were,in fact ahead of their time.'Easy Action' is like part weird psychedelic and part hard rock.Tunes here I thought were impressive include \\"Mr.&Misdemeanor\\",\\"Below Your Means\\",\\"Return Of The Spiders\\"(dedicated to Gene Vincent)and \\"Lay Down And Die Goodbye\\".One of Cooper's lesser known gems.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Sophmore Effort","review":"The Alice Cooper Band's second album sees the band still recording for Frank Zappa's label. The music starts to turn in the direction of the material that would later make them famous. No real macabre stuff yet, but the album is definitely a progression from their first one. The album was produced by David Brigs who is probably best known for working with Neal Young. The opening track, \\"Mr. And Misdemeanor\\" has always been a favorite of mine and a great example of Alice's talent for playing on words. \\"Shoe Salesman\\", \\"Below Your Means\\", \\"Return Of The Spiders\\", and the short but cool \\"Refrigerator Heaven\\" are all good tunes. The finale of \\"Beautiful Flyaway\\" and \\"Lay Down And Die, Goodbye\\" is also a great way to end things. The Alice Cooper band would be signed to Capitol and hit the big time with their next release. \\"Easy Action\\" would be a strong stepping stone to get to that point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly delivered","review":"Friends from Amazon,A enjoy very much buying items with you guys. You have a long catalog, and deliver items quickly.It happened with all the recent items i've bought.But with the book Law's Empire, the person who has delivered it here in my building did not hand it to the doorman.

I highly recommend this book and hope it is on every art and ballet lover's shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Decent Movie On Reincarnation","review":"This is a 1956 movie starring Teresa Wright, one of my favorite actresses. I saw it with my mother when it was released. Based on the best selling book of the same name, it made sense to me then and I have believed in reincarnation ever since. The end talks more about hypnotism than reincarnation but if you believe in it then no explanation is necessary. If you don't believe in reincarnation then no explanation is possible.This is pretty much what most people who have had past lives regressions have experienced, a past life that is unexplainable to non believers. There's no sense in trying to convince anyone of it. You have to experience it yourself. There's a saying, \\"I won't believe it unless I see it.\\" Why not say, \\"I'll see it when I believe it\\".Watch this movie with an open mind and you'll be fascinated with what transpires."},{"rating":"2","title":"Herbs For Kids Sweet Echinacea","review":"Sweet Echinacea is highly tolerable for even the pickiest tastebuds. It boosts the child's immune response and reduces length and severity of illness when given at the first sign of a virus. Great product. I wouldn't be caught without it. When combined with a no-sugar or very low-sugar and non-dairy diet, the illness length and severity is literally cut in half or better."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 generations of kids","review":"I trust Herbs for Kids for many of my children's needs, specifically when they are small with developing immune and nervous systems. I have used it on now all 3 of my babies ranging from 16 months to 16 years and I have always been satisfied with the results. Great, safe product! Note: Do your research on how to use herbs properly and mixing with prescription drugs. Herbs are powerful and effective when used properly."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD ADDITION TO SMOOTHIES","review":"I've heard EXCELLENT things about this product and am on my second bottle. I have twin toddlers who just started preschool so I'm employing any preventative measures I can think of. My only issue with it so far, though, is the taste. It's not horrible, but the kids will not take it in a spoon like they do with their vitamin and mineral supplements. They screw up their faces and say \\"Nuk!\\" It's pretty easy to hide the taste in a smoothie though. I will continue to buy this throughout the winter, but hope they adjust the formulation for taste sometime in the near future. However, if they don't, I'll probably still continue to buy. Taste certainly isn't everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!","review":"First of all, I waited two weeks to receive these drops. Not only was the package poorly wrapped and packed.These drops only has a three months shelf life. I will never purchase again from this company."},{"rating":"1","title":"(1.5) History Lite","review":"Perhaps this \\"one afternoon book\\" contains all there really is to know of Marie Antoinette's short reign at the side of Louis XVI of France before the French Revolution occasioned the loss of her head. Indeed, the book cover suggests some revelations about Mirabeau, DuBarry, and Robespierre. Unfortunately, they are only mentioned in passing among the rambling, if poetic, musings of Marie Antoniette. As simple as a diary, truth is a matter of perception, so the truth can't be faulted with historical inaccuracy. It can, however, be faulted for lack of substance. Like cotton candy, this book is all fluff, the Editorial reviews more substantive than the novel. Not that Versailles isn't a pleasant read. It is. It just doesn't deserve the credit of a novel, and I would have felt less cheated and more willing to indulge the writer's fancies, had I not been duped by the hard sell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"Versailles by K. Davis represents a stream of Marie Antoinette's consciousness and very often I got lost. This fascinating character could not be captured in 200 disjointed pages...some prose, some dialogued in the format of a play and some babble. I found the book annoying and put it down forever after 144 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"ARGH!","review":"Her pug's name was MOPS!!!! and as the future Queen of France was stripped of all her \\"Austrianess\\" so too was Mops banished from French soil. There is so much right with this well-researched little book, but how does the author get such a well documented detail wrong? Eggplant? Where did that come from? Groan."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"At times I enjoyed \\"Versailles\\". At other times I found it maddening. Some chapters are written in script format -including stage direction - I found this silly. At other times, we 're treated to Marie-Antoinette's inner dialogue - or inner babble, depending on one's take. Again, there were inspired sections but ultimately I felt she was trying too hard with the end result being inconsistent and just a little precious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darwin's Legacy","review":"I've been a fan of Greg Bear for sometime, it started, I think, with Eon. Like Orson Scott Card, another favourite, Bear writes stories about people, draped over a science fiction setting, driven by the same emotions as us all. In that regard, Darwin's Children doesn't disappoint; there's no escaping Mitch and Kaye's love for their daughter and each other, tested as it may be. After finishing Darwin's Radio, I was hesitant to pick up the sequel. I found Darwin's Radio to be cluttered with genetics 101 to the point of losing the story. Darwin's Children doesn't make that mistake. It finds a better balance of story and science. I read on the web that the book will soon be turned into a movie, which surprises me, as there's very little in the book that would seem attractive to Hollywood. It's a great read that gives pause. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lazy and Obviously Political","review":"Great disappointment after Darwin's Radio. Little science, no surprises. Tiny amount of character development, but I sure don't feel much for most of these people, who have made choices that I do not understand.Very heavy handed political message here as well -- the Republicans are cast as Nazis who only need an opportunity to show their true colors. Fox News takes some below the belt shots as well, implying that all who watch it are sheep.Unless Mr. Bear concentrates on writing and storytelling a bit more, I'll pass on his next book -- and I have read all his previous works.This author sure isn't near as entertaining as he once was. Perhaps he should run for office and quit writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"You wrote this to do what?","review":"A virus that destroys society and builds a new one to succeed the old. An idea that didn't pan out. Between the shallow characters and the prolonged time periods I waited for excitement.His handling of cultural and political events were of someone unreflective, taking their cues from talking points. Anything traditionally American got the dirty end of the stick. All Republicans are evil despots waiting for opportunity, and are in it together with Rush Limbaugh and Fox News. It left me wondering if this was a hand out gift at a DNC function.As a concept I think the story could have been riveting, instead I had to force myself to complete it. I'll spend a long time evaluating a Greg Bear book before committing to reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Far Fetched. The Prequel is better","review":"It seemed that this book was written because of the success of the first one. I liked Darwin's Radio much better as in the sequel, the author went way beyond fiction.If you read the first one, stick with it and don't buy this one so you can have a lasting better impression which might be affected by this book.."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is too generous","review":"I read this novel in the misguided hope that it would improve as it went on. It did not. I honestly can't think of a single thing that would make this book worth a read. The characters are like cartoon representations of people. The so-called plot is all over the place. My personal \\"favorite\\" is the scientist who thinks she's having a religious epiphany, and seeks to confirm this with a CAT scan. Between the pseudo-scientific pycho-babble and the deteriorating plot line, I'm amazed this book was even published. Unless you need paper to start a fire, try a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimately, I put it down","review":"Maybe I could have enjoyed this book more if I'd read \\"Darwin's Radio\\" beforehand. As it was, the characters were unsympathetic, the plot too meandering, and the pace too slow. I also have a personal aversion to gratuitously scatological stories, and found Bear's needless references needlessly jarring. About 200 pages into the book, I put it down and moved on."},{"rating":"1","title":"I finished it, but don't know why I bothered.","review":"I usually like Greg Bear's work, but \\"Darwin's Children\\" was surprisingly dull. A lot of talk, not many new ideas (just rehash of the genetic stuff in \\"Darwin's Radio\\"), uninvolving characters, and a strangely irrelevant Divine Intervention. Plowing through this book felt like a tedious homework assignment. It's a case of competent storytelling without much to say.I was also a little annoyed at an undertone stuck solidly in A.D. 2003: Bear takes swipes at Fox News, the Evil Republicans, American voters as sheep. Hey, I'm a Democrat, too, but I see enough of this political sniping in the real world. The best science fiction weaves social commentary into the plot and assumes the reader is intelligent enough to make their own comparisons to current events."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first novel from Bear I didn't finish","review":"Greg Bear was my favorite writer, period. If I saw a new novel from him, I'd buy it, no questions asked. But Darwin's radio falls short. His mutated children characters could be fascinating, but he doesn't spend enough time on them. On and on we go, about Washington, hearings, and recriminations. Hey, if I wanted to see that crap, I can turn on C-SPAN and watch the 9-11 hearings, I don't need to pay eight bucks. Where is the wonder and majesty of the Way, in the Eon series? The vast loneliness of space, and awesome sense duty in the Forge of God books? The strangeness and alien humanity in Queen of Angels? This book is a disappointment. If you want to go find the wonder that was Greg Bear, go get yourself an Alistair Reynolds book. That guy ROCKS! And Mr. Bear, please go back into the wonder business, so I can go back to buying your books again without worring about wasting my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sequel to Darwin's Radio","review":"This was a good follow up to Darwin's radio. If you liked the first one, you'll like this book also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borderline Awful","review":"I have read a lot of reviews discussing how Greg Bear's prose is smooth and flowing, and that this book is full of biology, intriguiging, etc. Bull. Every other sentence is full of over-strained hyperbole, struggling to get attention with poor, over-stated comparisions like \\"the rain... drummed like a million bored fingers\\" (not an exact quote). This style added nothing to the plot and was so distracting to the point that I found my self not paying attention. Afetr about 1/3 of the way through I put it down and could not finish it.There are too many outstanding sci fi books out there to waste your limited time on books like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio CD abridged??? WHY???","review":"If I wanted an abridged version of this book, I'd wait for the Reader's Digest edition. What brain-dead editor decided to slice and dice this novel for the audio CD? No thanks... this is one audiobook fan who wouldn't touch this butchered rendition with a ten-foot strand of mutated DNA."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable read","review":"This is a very short review but to the point, as the author ofThe Second Virgin Birth, I must say that, Darwin's Childrem, is well written with a well thought out plot line that holds you interest the entire book. I enjoyed reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent take on a weighty subject","review":"This sequal to _Darwin's Radio_ kept me up late at night, eagerly turning the next page. Bleary-eyed, I'm here to report that Mr. Bear had spun quite a tale of emotional, political and spiritual intrigue. He illuminates the desperation of each faction (parents, children, government) in such a compelling manner, as to bend your expectations and warp your allegiences. Each character/group has their good and bad points. No one is wholly evil and no one is wholly good.The complexity provided a very satisfying reader experience.I strongly encourage you to read _Darwin's Radio_ first to get a handle on the situation, characters and the science.My only regret is that I didn't get more time with many of the characters. Perhaps there should be a third book, following the culture long into the evolution revolution.Definitely worth my time and money, and I purchased the hardbacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"I'm about half way through this book and have been debating with myself whether I'll finish. After reading some of these reviews, I'm going to put the book down. I was intrigued because of the science and because a colleague recommended this author to me. I knew from the very first page that it wasn't really my type of book, but I thought, well, maybe something relatively mindless would be a nice break. But what a disappointment. The best word to describe this novel is: dull. Even for a mindless read, it's, well, dull. None of the characters are even mildly well developed (who are these people?), the pace is way too slow for an \\"action\\" novel (come on, get to the good stuff), and the science is not well explained (huh?)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down","review":"Like several of his sequels, this book is a let down...it doesn't really have a clear plot or purpose. The first book was spent setting the stage for something 'big' to happen in this one, but it just fizzles and dies. Readers who like plot with their sci-fi will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable read","review":"I liked Darwin's Radio, so I also enjoyed this book. For the people who said there were too many characters I have to ask: Did you read Darwin's Radio? Because almost all the characters in this book were developed in that one. Maybe before you read a sequel and then complain that you didn't understand all the characters, you should read the first one BEFORE reading the second one.Anyway, I liked it. Enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beating the Midas Curse","review":"Rod Zeeb and Perry Cochell have done an outstanding job of describing their Heritage Process in Beating the Midas Curse. Their training as Estate Planning attorneys taught them how to use strategies and techniques to pass on wealth to the heirs. But all their training and fancy legal documents did nothing to prepare the heirs to receive their financial inheritance. Watching wealthy families implode prompted them to begin a 20 year journey of trial and error that has culminated in The Heritage Process which is clearly and succiently covered in this fast paced book. I was shocked and amazed to learn that 90% of wealthy families fail to preserve their wealth through the third generation! Zeeb and Cochell have perfected a process that has proven to be the antidote to the \\"Midas Curse\\". Parents who are concerned about the potential negative impact of wealth on their children and future generations simply must read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PRODUCT REVIEW","review":"I first read this book in the Reader's Digest Condensed Book products.

On the basis of this description I bought the item. Well upon receipt I found that it is not A map it is several maps and there is NO large poster-size map of all of the 4 journeys. Each journey is on a separate map and these maps were included in a set of other maps about Abraham and other stuff not related to Paul. And each map is rudimentary, without any detail except what might be needed for sunday school classes.

There may be other significant place names missing. I quickly found that these were missing - there may be others. You get the point. Trying to decide if I want to send it back, or just write in the missing locations with a permanent marker.

THe movie came out in the mid eighties, I remeber long hair being out even then.THe dialouge and special effects were cheezy, and the acting ranged from poor to fair.I guess I must have been tired the night I watched this film in the late eighties, that's why it appeared to be scary.I gave Creature two stars, however, because it had one or two geunine scares.

Writer's Digest, in selling advice to would-be writers, should check the quality of its product.As to the text that did make sense, I found the samples used to demonstrate strong dialogue as bad as those selected to demonstrate weak dialogue. E.g. one \\"strong\\" sample included an info dump. I couldn't believe some of the \\"strong\\" samples had been culled from the work of the literary elite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't learn as much as I hoped","review":"I was looking to learn more about the proper structure on writing dialogue. Especially scenes with longer conversations. She touched on it a little at the end, but I think she could have used a few more examples to help get her point across.On the other hand, this book does a great job of teaching writers a very valuable lesson---how NOT to write dialogue---and for those of us who have been out of the game for awhile, it was great to be able to read over my own work and realize how bad it actually was! Now whenever I'm reading, I find myself actually studying--and sometimes even improving--the dialogue.So I gave it 4 stars because it's filled with examples of do's and dont's from classics like Moby Dick or Jane Eyre to more modern novels like the Harry Potter series. I only wish she would have spent a little more time explaining the proper structure. I learned more about that from a pocket guide on grammar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Devil in the detail","review":"This is a book which takes you into the nitty gritty of writing dialogue. Not only does the author show you what works, she also gives examples of what doesn't work, allowing the reader to hear how dialogue should sound. Wonderful! And it's not just tips on dialogue you'll pick up. This book is packed full of references to setting and character. Despite a misprint in the first chapter, I found this book excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it","review":"Although I've always had a better time writing dialogue than descriptive passages, this book was very helpful and informative. I really like this series, so I definitely recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bradley Bay Sinks!","review":"The two stars are really just for the sheer weight of the thing. The characters are one dimensional, and the dialogue stilted. Every conversation seems to be a string of aphorisms and platitudes. These folks take themselves WAY too seriously!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money or time!","review":"I can not believe I made a mistake and purchased yet another one of her books. The one entitle Tender Heart was bad enough and this one is worse only longer. Characters are never developed fully and the story line is way over the edge. After one day these two fall madly in love and talk goo-goo conversation for the remainder of the book. There are so many good romance novels available for anyone to waste their time and money on this one. Check out Melissa Good, Peggy Herring, and especially Radcliffe if you want some really good romance stories. Don't buy this one or her other book either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sappy at best!","review":"I can't beleive a publisher would charge $... plus for this book. I kept waiting for it to pick up and half way through the book realized it wasn't going to. I wonder if I could get half my money back? For the cost and for your time, I'd recommend against this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read for anyone considering adoption","review":"Thank you, Jesse Green! Your book expressed many of my own feelings as a gay Jewish man who has always wanted children. The book first tells of Andy (Green's lover) and his family, then of Green himself, and then their life together. Along the way, the reader learns the realities of adoption for a single gay man, from the mixed reactions of family to the distancing of gay friends. The book has moved me to start the process myself"},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative enlightening sensitive","review":"As a heterosexual senior mother I strongly identified with the dilemmas and delights of Andy and Jesse's adventure in parenting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Narcissistic even for a memoir.","review":"Jesse Green is the very definition of an unreliable narrator. Let's see: He hasn't adopted his lover's two sons; he doesn't live with them; and his lover named his brother in Detroit, not Green, as the boys' legal guardian if something should happen to him. Yet Green considers himself a father, enough to write a whole book about it. He is an accomplished prosesmith, but I can't imagine a snarkier, more narcissistic book. Read Daniel Mendelsohn's brilliant \\"The Elusive Embrace\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-serving saccharine","review":"Reading this surface-sweet ode to gay parenthood, I was struck by the unsettling feeling that Mr. Green is ultimately more concerned with himself than with actually rearing another living person. Which left me with a frighteningly bad taste. Disturbing in its ultimate implications."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-delusion brought to narcissistic new heights","review":"In prose that's creepily precious, Green ostensibly describes the complex world of caring surrounding his male lover's little boy. But in fact the book reveals a fantasy of the author's own making, which doesn't bode well for the boy -- or the relationship with the kid's father for that matter. A prime example of the urban liberal bleeding heart party line absorbed into one man's consciousness so deeply that he can't see the forest from the woods. The underlying message is that the reader is supposed to applaud these men simply because they are gay. Sorry, but it doesn't work that way guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"A male Joan Crawford in the making","review":"Mr. Green seems so self-involved, so conscious of his own role model image, that one wonders what really lurks beneath the do-gooder, P.C. facade. Reading this book brought to mind Mommie Dearest, in which Crawford wanted the world to see her in an angelic aura but the cracks in her psyche ruptured. It wouldn't surprise me at all, based on this overly sincere book, if something similar eventually occurs in the Green household. His boyfriend and \\"their\\" child had better stay on their toes. This guy is trying too hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary implications","review":"I read this book on alternative parenting and quickly became horrified. It seems the author will justify anything he does under the guise of \\"doing the right thing.\\" And he seems disturbingly pleased with his own \\"integrity.\\" Frighteningly self-deluded is more like it. God have mercy on the child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks Jesse! you changed my life..","review":"I'm a gay man living in Israel, I read this book when I was considering adoption myself. Well... a year later I adopted, this book gave me so much courage and optimism It's one of the most touching books i ever read. It is full of humor and pain, a perfect blend of sweet and sour!I only wish Jesse Green would know that ,Erez his son, who got his name from a visit of his father to Israel, really changed someone's life in Israel!Thanks Jesse, your book is a must to any father to be.

Customer service at the repair center was very unprofessional -- they would tell us the package was shipping out to us, and nothing would arrive. It was only after persistent calling that they finally shipped the percolator to us and it arrived in worse condition. It took them four months to return the percolator to us. They refused to replace the percolator because we owned it for more than 30 days. Amazon was very helpful and understanding and assisted us with a refund.We unfortunately own two of these percolators and when the lid broke on the second one, I had to contact Electra Craft, again. They were able to provide the part, a simple stainless steel lid, for $25.00 plus shipping and handling!

Amazon was great in sending us out another via exchange. The second percolator worked. However, I wished I'd have saved my money. The coffee basket allowed too many coffee grounds to end up in the coffee. Don't take that last cup. You will also need a carafe to store the coffee in after percolating. The percolator maintains the heat too high when ready, and boils the coffee continuously. Mmmm, burnt coffee!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste you money.","review":"We purchased this purcolator for Christmas 2003. Every other pot is weaker than tea, many grounds are left in the bottom of the pot. Once the coffee is done, the warmer continues to boil the coffee making it bitter and burnt. The auto shut off did not work and boiled the pot dry.

There is one snafu, you MUST load the basket very carefully, because if you don't grounds find their way into the center tube and wind up in the brew. My husband is always getting grounds in the coffee, but it still tastes fabulous! I've had to replace the lid, that's been my only complaint. The knob is plastic, but after roughly 1500 pots of coffee, I can't gripe too loudly, because the pot has outlasted every other pot we've ever owned! ...Not to mention that if you truly love REAL coffee (not the drip crapola) this is the only pot there is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand why you are still selling this product","review":"This percolator is not worth the price.

It is an amazing gun and the installation of Co2 is much easier than my Walther CP99. The comments you see about how its hard to open the gun to put the revolving pellet holder in is not a downer. It is good that it takes the amount of force it does so you do not worry about it releasing and letting bb's go all over. It has good weight and construction.

I can count on two hands the number of times I used each gun. With the first one, the barrel latch wore down to the point that the barrel wouldn't stay up. That was after 20 or less reloads of cartridges. I bought another one as replacement in February 2011, and have been extra careful to avoid wear on the barrel latch. Now the problem is leaking CO2. Once a new cartridge is put in, it's empty in several hours just laying on a table. I'd say I've used this gun maybe 7-8 times in a year and a half; fewer times than the first pellet gun. I've never dropped it or abused it in any way; it stays in a drawer when not in use.Having such issues with such little use, tells me these are cheaply made.

It has a good feel, adjustable sights, is a lot of fun to shoot, and is reasonably accurate. If it's plinking fun you want, this pistol is a relatively inexpensive way to get it. The only negative I can come up with, is that it takes too many steps, for my liking, to change the gas cartridge, but that's a small negative compared to all of the positives.

Nice power, and well detailed. Feels solid. Very accurate at closer ranges, but maybe I just need more practice at longer ranges. But it IS a handgun, not meant to be a rifle. The rail along the top DOES accept about any scope or laser out there. I tried a red-dot on mine, worked just ok. It didn't look like it belonged on this gun. Since the .357 is one of my favorites, I'm waiting to find just the right scope to enhance the 'cool factor'.Only a few quibbles about this gun. My hands are about a medium size, and the grips feel a little large to me. Just a mite too much free play on the trigger, but the gun is still new, and I'm sure will feel better with more use.I think crosman could sell this gun for more than they do.

I doubt whether Helena ever heard or listened to recordings of Giacomo Lauri-Volpi (1894-1979) otherwise she would have included him among the greats. Giacomo is tops, perhaps even greater than Enrico. I am saying perhaps because it would be unfair to compare Caruso's archival records even boosted by digital refinements with Lauri-Volpi's fine and well preserved operatic highlight records (currently available on CDs) of the early forties. Lauri-Volpi's voice intelligently combined the sensuous beauty of the young Carreras' legato singing with Pavarotti, Domingo or Melchior's resounding high C's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Juicing book","review":"I'm still reading this book, but it has some very useful information regarding fruits and veggies, to help you in blending or juicing foods to drink.

I can live with that but whoooooo-weeee the GAS that this stuff caused for not only my allergic dog but also my \\"stomach of steel\\" dog. They can clear the HOUSE in about two seconds flat.While I do appreciate the quality ingredients that are supposedly in this food, I am disappointed that I've seen absolutely no difference between this and the Pro Plan or Natural Balance I tried before this.

I have used it for 5 years with two dogs and it's wonderful. First, they think that it's delicious of course and eagerly eat it day in and day out. Second, it's been crucial for my pet's health. Dog 1 had allergies and was scratching and putting her paw into her mouth. After going on this food, she no longer had those issues and her coat looks fab. She's a black lab mix. Dog 2 was adopted with horrendous inflammatory bowel problems and suspected allergies to common proteins. We had to start him on a very restricted diet of only novel proteins and chose the Wellness Simple food. He didn't enjoy it as much and when he was stable, we switched him to this and he did great. He loves it and it has kept his gut stable. Also a lab mix and his coat looks great on this food. We use both the Wellness fish kibble and canned food. Highly recommend.

That was my stupid fault, but nonetheless, I couldn't use the unit for simply enjoying music in my office in addition to burning CDs. Anyway, this control is not really an optional remote control in the traditional sense, but an integral part of the unit, and used to separate the tracks on the LP, so keep track of it. Believe the reviews who say the playback is poor. And the ones that say that without \\"cleanup\\" software to remove hiss and crackle, the unit is pretty worthless.

And then, all of a sudden, it began working.I sent the product back and ordered a replacement. As of today, the product is still enroute via UPS from New Jersey.

It only takes limited types of recordable CDs. The recordings I made will only play on the GF-350... they have not worked on other CD players (home or auto), portable devices, or home computers. TEAC has been useless insofar as customer service and support: they have not responded to my inquiries even though I tried to contact them by phone, mail, and email. I would not buy this product and, personally, I will no longer deal with TEAC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible System!","review":"I received the unit about a month or two ago and I absolutely love it.

The sound from the system isn't that great but when you play the cd's on a better stereo, they are fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limitations","review":"Nice Looking. Easy to operate. But the stylus is for 45/33/78? Not good. 78's don't sound like they should. Manual says 50 hours of recording is when the stylus needs replacement. The cartridge is also pretty poor. The sound seems very limited. I doubt that the low frequencies below 80hz are recorded, consequently the recordings sound hollow or shallow. Also the upper end, to eliminate record noise obviously is also cut off at a relatively low level. Records played on my regular home stereo sound loads better and using a MAGIX program on my computer and re-recordable CDRW's produces much better copies. In fact, better than the lp's sounded originally. If you have records that you can not replace (as I have) this recorder is handy and easy for anyone to use, but if you're serious about high quality, look further. I was considerably disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"The discs that were recorded had transistor radio sound quality.

I have already successfully copied over 100 albums to CD's. The quality of the copies are good, even with the static (adds a touch of nostalgia). The quality of the sound when played on the player is rather thin and weak. But when played on a stereo system with good speakers, it sound great."},{"rating":"1","title":"End use","review":"Recently purchased this item in order to convert quite a number of records to CD. It is difficult to use, but the big drawback is the inability to remove clicks that most older records have after they are converted to CD's.

I cannot recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"High price for what you get.","review":"Found this product to do as advertised. It makes decent CD's of LP's that you can play.

I understand that the \\"special\\" disks are becoming hard to find, but my Office Depot had a supply and I did order the TDK's recommended by Amazon. Probably best to order what you'll need in the future. If you paid $400.00 retail, I supposed the sound quality would be somewhat disapointing, but at Amazon's price of $264 I could live with it and it's not really that terrible. I have portable stereo's that are much worse. I'm NOT a computer/teck geek but it was so easy to copy CD's that I only had to skim the directions once. I've already transferred a number of LP's using the built in reoord player and have hooked up a cassette player and made copies from that.

The turntable component cannot play a record to the end without skipping. We took it to a local authorized repair shop where it sat for seven months waiting on a part that never came.

There are many other options, most of which cost less, on the market.

I bought this as a surprise for my husband and he surprised me by not wanting it because it did not record cassettes. While I was impressed by how quickly I received the item, I was dismayed by what the cost was going to be to return it. Not only am I forced to pay for the \\"free shipping\\" that I received, but I am also going to have to pay a restocking fee of $22.75. The total cost will be $42.75, plus what it's going to cost for me to ship it.I fully expect to pay the shipping cost of returning the item, but the other has taken me by surprise and has made me aware of the importance of reviewing the return policies of any items that I buy from unknown merchants in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but problems","review":"From the time this unit was removed from the box, it has been a nightmare.

I thought the clarity is great and being biligual is very informative. Now the negative, Tad is just annoying. He sings the same \\"Hi, I'm Tad and you can count on me\\" before every verse and it is just too repetitive. He then saye \\" I have lots of brilliant colors\\" before the next verse- over and over and over. The small book that is attached to his hand is way too small for any child to find interesting. We received him when my daughter was 11 months and now that she is 17 months, she still won't touch Tad even when I push the buttons for her.I would not recommend this toy unless you are looking for another noisy and annoying toy for your little one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and only speaks English!","review":"I bought Tad for my 9 month old because I thought it was cool that he sang songs in both English and Spanish.

I'd give this book 5 stars, the first one for the drawing on the cover, the second one for the creativity of the book, third for the surprises, fourth for the adventure, and fifth for the humor. At the end there is a big surprise! Tori, who has a disease that can have her end up in a wheel chair, won the gold and Jill is in third. It was a great book. I'd recommend it for ages 7-12.

The story is set in the world of the \\"Batman Beyond\\" TV series, in which an elderly Bruce Wayne has passed the duties of Batman on to young Terry McGinnis. In this adventure, told in comic-book format, Batman battles the villain Blight and encounters a group of orphans living in tunnels under the city.The story is effectively told and contains some solid action scenes. The characters are well drawn, particularly the creepy Blight. However, the book's weak aspect is its handling of the very serious themes of homelessness and orphanhood. This problematic aspect of the book ultimately leads to a too easy, distastefully saccharine resolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get all episodes on Netflix","review":"Did you know all 92 episodes are on Netflix for the same price as 7 episodes on DVD?

In another one Candace goes to a spa.

After the Yardbirds, we all know the directions Page and Clapton went in, but here we get to see how Beck really grows and matures as a serious guitar player; while maintaining a solid foundation rooted in Blues. My favorite track is \\"I ain't Superstitious\\". Willie Dixon wrote it, Howlin' Wolf originally recorded it, many have covered it, but the most unique interpretation is the Beck/Stewart rendition.

The recipies given seem designed to teach general concepts rather than solve common programming problems. The result is a general Java textbook that is encumbered with the Cookbook format of Problem, Solution, Discussion. There are numerous instances of the Problem being trivial, or downright silly. For example, \\"You really want to know about end-of-line characters\\" and \\"You need to learn the syntax of JDK 1.4 regular expressions\\" are presented as Problems for recipies.

I was so disappointed by the first edition that I swore off O'Reilly for a little while. One of my major gripes, the rampant use of classes provided by the author in libraries has all but vanished. In addition the anti-patterns of bad SQL use that are so rampant in other Java books are nowhere to be found, and in their place are recipes that show sane and proper use of JDBC.I heartily recommend this practical work for Java engineers. For those not familiar with the first edition this is a solid practical work that covers a wide range of Java programming challenges.

I'm assuming this films takes from the novel (which is set in the Lodz ghetto in Poland) - it's not a lavish detailed holocaust film but the message of hope that is gained from this is great.

It has potential, but it never accomplishes much. The acting by the entire cast is good, but nothing memorable--everyone seems to be going through the motions. I couldn't get into any of the characters at all. The plot isn't that interesting either and the film is too long. It shifts from a comedic to a serious tone the entire time and drags a bit during the first hour also. Don't get me wrong, the movie isn't poor, it's just that it is not that satisfying. There are some scenes that are somewhat interesting though. Jakob the Liar seems to really try to be something, but it still ends up being quite dull for the most part.

People had said that strange carvings had apeared in the canyon where she once lived, and supposedly was shot for muder. What really ocured was that a time vortex caught Annie, who now floats in and out of time, between 100 years. The vortex was caused because of the wierd gravity in the canyon. When both kids and sheriff come close to her at the same point in time, the vortex causes them to switch places in time.

The S60 is certainly a close contender in quality. But the Leica Zoom 35-420mm on such a light camera, re-defines the meaning of travel camera.In the old days a travel SLR camera was at best a 28 to 90mm SLR. The thought of taking along a 300 or 400mm zoom was absurd because those lenses weighed too much or were too big. But the Panasonic FZ10 changes all that. While it is technically not an SLR, it certainly serves the same function about 98% of the time.

I emailed ANTonline in order to return the item, and the company did offer me a refund if I returned it within ten days. However, considering that I would have to pay not only the original shipping price but the return shipping price--and considering that the amplifier cost only $10.75 to begin with--I decided to take the loss.

Filmed on a budget a fraction of today's movies this film uses models, illustrations, and photo composition to create the effect of animation that looks like the wonderful engraved illustrations in the classic publications of Jules Verne's novels.

However, that is because they never anywhere gave any idea of where anyone could find it.The stela the Lambs captured in photo proves that there was such a site and it was probably from a subsidiary of Yaxchilan. The two smaller buildings they show are probably also from the same site.The large building the Lambs show in the book looks very much like Temple 33 at Yaxchilan, but they did not claim that it was part of their find. They merely implied it.There is a copy of the book at archaeologist Frans Blom's library at Na Bolom and in it are two reviews by him. The longer one suggests that he had not spent enough time trashing the book the first time.There is some value in owning this book for those intrigued with cities that are still lost in jungles. You just have to be aware that there is a lot of BS in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak and Disappointing","review":"Thought this would be like 'A Year In Provence' or some of the other books by great cooks, travelers and livers of life. Instead, it is a meandering collection of reminisces of a Jewish family in New York City. There is almost nothing about food and cooking, and what there is doesn't satisfy at all. There is also a lot of mundane and even disgusting stuff about dress and illness and jewelry and gossip and such. If your life is like this, you might like it. But if you are looking for good writing about interesting people making the world a better place with fine food, look elsewhere.Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great food-related memoir","review":"Since I've recently read Kitchen Confidential and Tender at the Bone, I thought I'd continue the food-related-memoir theme.But I'd say this book was less about life in the kitchen and more about life in a family, albeit an atypical one.Favorite part: \\"What she (her mom) wants for me is an even cleaner, thinner, happier life than she has.

I almost hate to say this, but this story brings back memories of a few of our family reunions.I enjoyed this book because it's so very relatable and fun to read.

The other half is in possession of Satouri played by Julia Soul who I liked in Rambo 1st Blood pt. 2 she us the adoptive mother of of Jimmy Lee played by Mark Dacascos & Billy Lee played by Scott Wolf. So when Satouri is killed by Shuko Jimmy & Billy seek out the help of a girl named Marion who leads a gang that cleans up the streets she is played by Alyssa Milano.

Any double dragon fan will want to see this film but I am not one who compares movies to the video games they are based on (to a degree). I think the majority of people who view Double Dragon most likely won't want to see it a second time due to the climax of the movie becoming a bit cheezy. Robert Patrick has done better roles but he does make for a good villain as seen in Die Hard 2, Terminator 2, and the Faculty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun!","review":"Now one of the major gripes with this movie is that it doesn't follow the story of the video game. I am having a hard time comprehending why people would want a cookie-cutter storyline that follows the game. Everyone would have blasted it for being too similar, and I applaud the writers for trying something different. Nowadays everyone blasts movies for what it should have been, instead of enjoying it for what it is. Needless to say, Double Dragon is great light-hearted fun, and it doesn't take itself seriously.

The video game series was much better and much more hardcore and more realistic fighting. Fist of all, if you are going to cast a member from Party of 5 in a so called \`action' movie, then you as a producer or casting person better fire yourself forever. Not retire, fire yourself. There is little martial arts for me and my fellow martial arts fans to even try to enjoy. Mark Dacascos is such a talented martial artist and this film does not let him reach his full potential (luckily for us there is the movie \`Drive' - there is a god). The cover is a total sell out. The villains on the back are not all used, oh sure they are used but some are only just in the background.Double Dragon, lots of potential, yet the Power Rangers movie is better than this.That's sad.Well we all have movies to laugh about....I guess...just don't bother.

If your a Mark Dacascos fan looking for a good meaty role here, this is not your movie. Mark is limited to kicks and smirks, with little emphasis on acting. All of the villians overact to the extreme. The action sequenses surprisenly are without alot of passion and artistry. This is surprising given Dacascos abilities.

I got into it knowing exactly how awful it was going to be, and it did not disappoint.The plot is holier than Swiss cheese, the acting wooden at best, and it has the great fortune of featuring all of the following: a vampire clown, a vampire-themed country and western song, and a hotline which one can call in order to become a vampire.

I then switched to freezer bags, plastic containers, foil pans, etc., but Glad Ovenware is my favorite hands-down. You don't have to transfer the entrees to cook them as with freezer bags and plastic containers. Foil pans you don't have to hassle with transferring to cook but the pans are flimsy and don't hold up well in the freezer. Glad Ovenware is convenient and holds up so well that many times I wash and reuse the container before throwing away. Also if I give a meal away to someone in need, they don't have to worry about returning a dish. I originally purchased these at the grocery store and then was unable to find them anywhere.

Also, the width of the margins on the sides varies greatly, and I use the margins so I find it quite annoying when the right margin is only 1/8\\" wide sometimes.

I used just a little bit of it in baking. This was a test recipe, so the ingredients were very basic. Nothing else could have caused this flavor aside from Stevia. My cupcakes had a distinct bitter aftertaste that remained in my mouth for the duration of the night. Luckily my child liked the cupcake, so I am giving it an extra star for that.I also tried a drop of it in plain Lipton tea. Yuck. Same bitter taste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"syrupy","review":"I have loved using flavored stevia drops, but this has a thick syrupy thexture that makes it had to use and very messy.

It is the first time that I have used this brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok","review":"It taste like a Tootsie Roll, not really chocolaty enough for me.

I will be looking for another patella strap that is not as wide. Also the one size fits all is huge. I need to overlap my velcro straps and my legs are not super skinny. (my calves are about 14 inches circumference, not sure my knee, but not abnormally thin) I cannot imagine an average sized man or women who the straps would effectively fit. The brand needs to have sizes. I may try to trim the straps, but overall, not pleased with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"This book could have been called \\"Calibre of Heroes.\\" It is not a page turner. The end of each chapter will not leave you breathless. But if you're interested in the people who traveled the Overland Trails, this is the book to read.

Literally.This is a LARGE format paperback, measuring 8.5 x 11. Now that I've received the book, I see that point is mentioned in the product description, but overlooked by me before I hit \\"Add to Cart.\\" But the size I could have lived with.It's when you open the book that the real problem arises. The text, printed in very a thin, non-proportional typewriter font, flows all the way across the 8.5 inch page. Think of a very tightly spaced manuscript or screenplay from the 1950's, 138 pages long, where the typewriter ribbon is well beyond needing replacement. It's a sea of very light gray. My eyes hurt just thinking about it.I thank the publisher for wanting to reprint this esteemed title, but with so many inexpensive desktop publishing programs available, there's no excuse for a product of this quality.So now I'll go back and find a used hardcover. I still want to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappinting","review":"Maybe I was expecting a book up to the standard set by the first book in this series, on Amtrak. I am not familiar with the New Haven's service area, and was often lost when reading the text. The McGinnes era seems to have few pictures. For example, there is only one of the Talgo trains and none of the converted RDC trains.

My favorite track is \\"I Can't Wait\\", really has a terrific chorus. \\"Words\\" is definitely a great variation on the requisite slower track. \\"Another Day\\" is a perfect finisher.There is so much great early 90s Britmusic out there.

We live in a world that instant gratification becomes the key to everything we do. Drawing teaches us to slow down and see things the way they are.

The author is an artist and a participant in many of these groups and brings great understanding to the needs and feelings of the other artists - as well as to the impulses, motives and feelings of the models. It is well illustrated but is not particularly a \\"how-to-draw\\" book but is rather an encouragement to recognize an authentic and deep need for this kind of human response and find the courage to follow this need.

Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top-notch new talent!","review":"This is a terrific CD. Like most of us, I bought it for the \\"David Duchovny\\" song, which of course is the best song on the album (I'm prejudiced naturally). But the other songs are really good, too. I like them all, but particularly \\"America,\\" \\"Walk Away\\" and \\"The Cheap and Evil Girl.\\" Her sound is indeed very reminiscent of Alanis Morrissette, but I disagree that she's just trying to copy Alanis. Bree is a talented songwriter/singer in her own right. I hope the album is a tremendous success for her and that we will hear more from her.By the way, as we had heard, the lyrics have been changed in the verse that talks about David's \\"jagged Jewish nose.\\" But I LIKED that bit about \\"the cool it just flows, from his 10 little toes...\\"The gag music video of \\"David Duchovny,\\" which was made by the X-Files production crew, was a hoot."},{"rating":"2","title":"David Duchovny, why won't you love me????","review":"OK, I admit it, I bought it because of the song \\"David Duchovny\\" (I love him!!!!!!!!)........"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing time after time","review":"I can't stop playing this CD.

I love every track on the CD. It's that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Found Bree on an Olsen Twins Cd !!!!","review":"This is a great album. My favorite song is Guttermouth and then David Duchovny. They are really great lyrics, Bree is a great storyteller. I really hope she gets around to making another album. I know America is a bit repetitive, but its a good kind of repetitive. Not the annoying kind.And yes, I bought the album because the last song, Show Me, was on the soundtrack to the Olsen Twins movie Our Lips Are Sealed. The funny thing is that this song almost clashes with the rest of the album. All the other songs have a consistenet \\"feel\\" to them. But Show Me kind of sticks out as more of a Pop song, but its very good.Like some of the other reviewers have said, this is a great album, don't dissmiss it as a gimmick album because of the David Duchovny song. It's quite good too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Six months in the player...","review":"I received an advance copy of this disc in June and have literally not stopped listening to it for almost six months. (Now I at least alternate it with Dido every once in a while.) I hear suggestions of everything from Alannis to Mazzy Star to the Go-Go's on this disc, but Bree Sharp manages to cobble them all together to create a great sound for herself. The lyrics are perceptive, in a wise-beyond-her-years kind of way. (I think she's 23, right?) Yes, the Duchovny song is hilarious, but I certainly hope enough people move beyond it to appreciate what remains when the novelty has worn off. (And here's hoping the poor girl has at least met her 'American Heathcliff' by now!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A really GREAT CD!","review":"I had only heard Bree's song \\"David Ducuvany\\" when I first bought this CD. When I heard the other songs, I LOVED them! They range from calming soothing songs to folky/rocky songs. Bree sends out powerful messages with touches of humor. I recomend this CD to anyone who enjoys folk/rock music and loves to have a good time listening to music alone, or at a rocking party."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is an incredible debut album. The songs are catchy and fun. Most importantly, Bree Sharp is quite poosibly one of the best lyricists on the market today. Her word efficiency is incredible.

I hope there are many more albums on the way, although I can listen to this one over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"It blew my mind!","review":"Wow, this CD is it, this CD is everything I have waited for all my life. I cant imagine life before this CD, Bree Sharp's voice takes me to the next level of heaven.

This totally deserves Five stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unexpected Pleasure","review":"Yes, I am yet another X-Phile who bought Bree Sharp for \\"David Duchovny.\\" I was delighted to discover that the entire album is as good, if not better, than that song.

It's been in my CD player since I got it!!!","review":"\\"A Cheap and Evil Girl\\", Bree Sharp's album, released on 7-27-99, is one of the best I have heard in a long time. She reminds me somewhat of the Lilith Fair croud but without some of the edgeiness. She kind of has an edge all her own. I bought the album for the 2nd track, \\"David Duchovny\\", because I'm a huge fan of his. I'm glad I did too, I can't stop listening. My fave tracks are #1(America),#2(David Duchovny),#3(Walk Away), #7(A Cheap and Evil Girl),and #10(Guttermouth). She has a great pop/rock sound with a hint of country mixed in for good measure. I recomend this album to anyone who likes girl rock with a slight edge to it.

She is one of the most unique, most talented, and most intelligent songwriters I've heard in a long time. Her witty lyrics and engaging music create a woman who is carefree and fun one moment, then introspective and thoughtful the next.A Cheap And Evil Girl is one of only about five CD's in my rather hefty collection that I can listen to straight through with skipping a single song. Bree undoubtedly has a huge career ahead of her. She speaks to our culture and to that which makes us human. What a prize Trauma Records holds.Buy her album for \\"David Duchovny\\", but treasure it for everything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bree Sharp CD","review":"I first discovered Bree Sharp by chance when I was picking songs for a free mix CD. I picked her song \\"David Duchovny\\" (I was a X-Files Fan)and \\"America\\" to finish up my choices. I have always liked those songs and found her on MySpace where I found she was in a new band now which should have a new CD out soon. That inspired me to get her first CD with the two songs I liked.

If you liked David Duchovny, buy the single, and spare yourself. None of the other tracks on the disc compare in any way, either musically, or in the cleverness of the lyrics. The title track is annoyingly repetitive. I listened to this cd all the way through only once, and now it sits at the bottom of the my cd pile.I usually dislike negative reviews, but I wanted to submit this one as a warning to others who might consider buying this cd based only on hear the DD song, so they can avoid my mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bree's a really cool chick","review":"This is truly one of the more memorable CD's I've ever listened to. Bree's music is completely original and every track is as good as the previous one. \\"David Duchovny\\" isn't even her best song. Bree's music ranges from slower to some serious rockin' tunes. \\"Walk Away,\\" \\"Not Your Girl\\" and \\"Faster, Faster\\" are incredibly fun to listen to and sing along with.'Music Fan in NY' is confused. They listened once and threw it to the bottom of their CD pile? Most serious music fans know that to appreciate a new CD you need to listen to it completely multiple times.

I was expecting to maybe to like a song or two beyond DD, but the whole album is great. From the first song on the album, it made me want to listen to the entire thing, which I did all day. The stand out tracks in my mind are \\"America\\", \\"David Duchovny\\", \\"Not Your Girl\\", \\"A Cheap and Evil Girl\\", \\"Walk Away\\", and \\"Guttermouth\\".I recommend you get this album if you like female musicians along the line of Sarah McLachlan and Sheryl Crow."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointing waste of money","review":"Steer clear of this bootlegged low-quality material.It is a silk purse containing a sow's ear! \\"Romantic\\" packaging attempts to hide sub-standard sound quality.Empeethree download from gnutella.

The realism of the lingo and sets makes this an enjoyable story. It's definitely difficult not to watch this movie from start to finish!For an extra treat, I recommend reading the original novel, Marooned.

Overall, I would recommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just how bad is it?","review":"Well, it's very slow. The movie actually has no real music. Just a electric hum. The special effects are very weak compared to 2001. Hard to believe both won Oscars for special effects. In widescreen, the special effects actually get worse. The story seems to take forever. And now lets start on the acting. Gregory Peck is featureless, Richard Crenna is dry and don't get me started on Gene Hackman. I love astronaut films like 2001, The Right Stuff and Apollo 13, but this movie left me bored.

The special effects won an Academy Award?! Theyre horrible compared to 2001, which won the year before. The movie is devoid of suspense and humor. Some people claim that this movie is very realistic, but yet Pecks character, the Chief of Manned Space talks to the Apollo craft more than CAPCOM does. And if the Russians could change orbits, why didnt it earlier? Also, NASA tests their astronauts extensively for long-duration missions like Space Station missions, how did they miss that Hackman is suspect-able to space madness? Tip to Hollywood writers: Dont write a fictional astronaut movie. Movies like that (Marooned, Altman's Countdown [not his fault, WB took 30 minutes out of it, would love to see that one day] and Capricorn One) stink.

Unfortunately, \\"Horse with No Name\\" only offers a short and almost irrelevant story about Rei and Tatsuya becoming friends.The two other stories in the book are completely unrelated to the \\"Mars\\" series. \\"Sleeping Lion\\" was an all right story, but the plot seemed unconnected and incomplete. \\"One Carat Fruit\\" was completely disappointing. The plot was boring and predictable and the characters were not likeable at all.I suppose a die-hard fan could extract more enjoyment from \\"HwNN,\\" but I suggest borrowing the book from a friend or a library. Not worth ten dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful.","review":"This is a wonderful selection of pieces--mostly orchestral, many recorded here for the first time. Although some pieces are contemporary, they blend with the Handel (et al), and are very lyrical. I sometimes find Barbosa-Lima too stiff in his jazz/pop recordings (technical genius that he is), but his playing here is warm, sensitive, and emotional.

The publisher was not willing to pay copyright and licensing fees required to include the figures in the digital version as well as the print.The missing figures phenomenon doesn't happen just once or twice -- it is frequent and distributed.

He is most well known for works like the one which appears on the cover, but the book includes earlier and later works, and discuss how they relate to the famous ones. Weston was active in the first part of the 20th century, and most of the works in this show were taken in California and Mexico.

It has a sour citrus bitter tobacco smell to it that by no means turns me on or makes me swoon. It causes me to have a headache every time he puts it on.

It has no character even compared to other mass-produced and heavily worn colognes.I wear it to work because its very simple, unoffensive, and... well... I cant return it, so I may as well use it.

Nixon had agreed to appear on camera with no pre-interview preparation or screening of questions and the subtle jousting between Frost and the disgraced former president is quite evident.A 2-disc set of the original broadcast footage is slated for release in late-April 2009.

Particularly now that I am more politically aware and hold a postion of leadership and decision making in the public sector.

My only complant would be the lack of clear instuctions for all the steps needed to mount to the wall.

Unfortunately I had a hard time finding the list of supported TVs, my bad for not searching harder I suppose. In the end it turns out it doesn't support my 46\\" Sharp Aquos. The only TVs this will not support are TVs that have their mounting screws less than 8\\" apart on the rear of the television as that's how wide the plate is the TV mounts to. If you have a 46\\" Sharp Aquos you're going to need to remove (no easy task) the two lips that contain the support screws on the mounting plate... probably not the safest alternative but since Sharp does have their mounting screws so close together the effect (i'm hoping) should be pretty minimal. If you have an Aquos be sure to measure the distance between those screws before ordering or simply look elsewhere.UPDATE - The mount just survived a 5.6 Earthquake just fine. Sturdy like a rock and no flex when extended. Good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect with a general purpose mount, but it was well recommended by a number of people so I gave it a shot.

Buy a 2 gallon aquarium/bowl and put your betta in it. If you have a peaceful community tank put your fish in it. Bettas can get along with other fish and I have one in my 55 gallon tank living just fine for over a year. The people condeming this product sounds like they are experianced fish owners.

A fish shouldn't be a toy, and even if you took the best possible care of the betta (daily water changes, high-quality food, a plant to further clean the water) the betta would still spend its time floating motionless, or, despite everything, die from bad water. Bettas are incredibly hardy fish, but they still need at least two gallons to do well, and five should be the minimum if you ever want to see it move, don't want its fins to rot, or don't want to change the water daily. You really should buy a ten-gallon or larger tank and put it in with a few other fish.I gave the educational value a three because I hope the kids who get this will learn something after the fish has died.(For anyone wondering, the pet stores that display signs claiming bettas live in puddles of water this big in the wild are lying. Betta don't exist in the wild, they're bred, and even they can't survive in these tanks for long)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but no...","review":"Please do not buy this for your betta, or any other fish.

Lightner argues relentlessly against the five-point Calvinist position that Christ died only for the elect, and exposes their twisted scriptural interpretations that words such as \\"world\\" and \\"all\\" mean the elect instead of what they plainly say. Lightner correctly notes that the scriptures \\"shine\\" with the concept of universality. He also notes, \\"Those who would confine the love of God to the elect are guilty not only of arbitrarily restricting God's love but of placing limitations on the very nature of God.\\" This book is highly recommended along with Did Christ Die Only for the Elect? by Norman F.

He takes a compassionate attitude towards those with whom he disagress, but does not shrink from making bold statements. There is one place on page 97 where I am not sure what point he was trying to make when he made reference to the participation in the guilt of Adam. Though he takes the proper stand on the fact that all are born guilty he says that is not the reason men go to hell. The reader will be advised to read this section very carefully.

Gary's guitar work combines technical mastery with melody and true feeling (something that other guitarist's of the era were often lacking).Standout tracks are Victims of the Future, Murder In The Skies, and Empty Rooms. This album is worth its price for those 3 songs alone. There are some other decent tracks here also, with the exception of the dreadful Law of the Jungle.This album makes a great companion piece for the follow up Run For Cover, which is more \\"pop\\". I think \\"Victims\\" is slightly superior as it is more consistent overall.For an extra treat, check out the live version of Shapes of Things to Come on the video \\"Live in Emerald Isles\\", the extended solo is simply awesome. Not many other guitarists could do such a brilliant solo over a simple repetitive riff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rippin'","review":"Moore' 1983 release \\"Victims..\\" is Moore's best all-round effort.

The re-working of the Yardbirds' \\"shapes of things\\" is very clever as is the way cool solo in \\"Teenage Idol\\" (a tongue-in-cheek take on rock and roll singers).

Dr. Dre's production is outstanding, the whiny synthesizer this song is built around is almost a hi-tech version of 90's G-Funk. It was good on my part for nostalgia's sake. Eminem's rhymes are clever and funny, and though half his verses are spent boasting he somehow makes it enjoyable. I remember, hearing it first on the radio around the time of the 200 Boston marathon (you guessed where I live) and the kids talking about it in school, they had all seen The MTV \\"Making the video\\" documentary on it and felt a bit behind.

What if I lost my job ( happens all the time anymore)? What if I lost my home because I lost my job? Wow! Think about it the next time you are walking down the street and see someone that makes you want to cross to the other side of the street. It might be someone you once knew or later on IT MIGHT BE YOU!!!!!This young Christian man and a friend spend several months living among and as one of the homeless in various cities in America.

How community members across America related to homelessness was an eye-opener for me. The most fascinating was how the church related (or did not relate) to the homeless.

It's very heavily edited and contains no swearing, as well as cuts out important cultural experiences of homelessness. It does a bit of a disservice to the lives some people live and the struggles they go through by mulling the grittier aspects of it over. The book is very heavily weighed down with faith and religion. It is much more geared toward believing in God and trusting that faith will get you through the worst of times than it is understanding severe poverty and the people that live it. The book is laid out nicely and is an easy read, but at a more middle school level. Again, most of the attention of the book is on Christianity as well as the author's personal views on life and how others should solve their life problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good...","review":"these 2 christian guys decide to b homeless for a year and wrote about it well. thoughtful, real, with scripture/praise incorperated well."},{"rating":"1","title":"under the overpass","review":"bad ,bad,bad a wast of money, it was a good ideal to write to make money, but i saw no faith, and the author know not faith, nor god. if something happen he would call to the people that was HIS BACKUP.to send or come and get him, he look to his plan not god. that's not faith. bad,bad,BAD. he eat out of trash can, could not god do better.

It gives you a glimps into homeless life & life on the street, yet from a perspective you can relate to. The guys in the book aren't drug-addicts, or mentally ill. They are from middle-class america & are very relatable. I have bought this book for several high school graduates this year. And will also be recommending it for my book club.

Objectively because it's biased and shows only one side of everything. Also, it's quite uninformed about New-Age movements and misrepresents them entirely.Also this book can be needlessly paranoia-inducing to anyone mentally unstable or highly religious (not that they're the same thing).I didn't even buy this book, I checked it out from the library, and I want to say don't waste your money or your time on this book. If I could go back, I wouldn't have even checked it out from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad, that we have come to this . . .","review":"The fact is, if you're actually considering buying a book named \`the dark side of the supernatural,' the book is probably just right for you. It will affirm all of the short-sighted, narrow-minded, vindictive beliefs you already have. You will quite likely love this book, without ever realizing just how sick it's message is. It will never occur to you to wonder how a religion like Christianity, founded on the principle that we should try and love each other, has been warped into something as jealous and contemptible as the set of beliefs behind this book.So, go ahead, buy the book, read about how all the yoga practitioners and role-players you hate so much are going to spend eternity roasting in the fires of hell. But, the next time you hear that mainline Christianity is dying, ask yourself if maybe, just maybe, the fact that you have betrayed everything that Christ stood for has anything to do with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dark Side of the Supernatural","review":"I found it biblically sound in it's facts.

Mesh is one of my favorite bands and they never fail to wow me. I love this CD. The music is catchy enough that you love it right away, though it only gets better with each listen. In fact, I like this better than their last effort. It has a little more energy and grit. The songs are punchy and diverse, heartfelt and thought-provoking. The limited edition comes with a bonus DVD that has a \\"Making of Collide\\" feature that's over 26 minutes long, fun music videos of three great songs: \\"Crash\\", \\"Leave You Nothing\\" and \\"Friends Like These\\", live performances of \\"From This Height\\", \\"What Does it Cost You\\" and \\"Let Them Crush Us\\", plus audio bonus tracks of previously unreleased demoversions.

Some of my favorites are \\"Open up the Ground\\";\\"This is whaty you wanted\\"; \\"Petrified\\"; & \\"Crash\\" just to name a few. I give it 4 stars because it's not like my favorite album of theirs; \\"The point at which it falls apart\\" but definitely promissing for most of their fans.

The readings of the five canonical Romantic poets--Wordsworth, Coleridge, Blake, Byron, and Shelley--that Wolfson executes here are highly original and compelling and are certain to affect future considerations of the works about which she writes. Perhaps more far-reaching is her introductory chapter, \\"Formal Intelligence: Formalism, Romanticism, and Formalist Criticism\\" which provides a detailed account of the interwoven careers of historicism and formalism in the Anglo-American literary critical tradition. The discussion in that chapter is sure to be useful to students of literary criticism for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good book","review":"I especially like the drawings, they are crisp and clear, with most giving the scale so you can scale up or down according to your needs.

The ones to blame are a part of the \\"Nashville System\\" that doesn't remember real country music. Unfortunately, Nashville's belief of changing with the times to draw a larger demographic audience has turned country music into a watered-down mess trying to fit in with the pop and rock giants that dominate the airwaves. I must admit I was interested when country music started changing to \\"fit in,\\" but almost as quickly realized the change might not be a good idea. Instead of keeping originality, country has joined the masses. What a shame. How could anyone even consider covering Def Leppard's \\"Photograph?\\" Malibu Storm's reproduction of it is dreadful and does not even remotely do justice to the phenominal performance given by the British rock icons. \\"Photograph\\" belongs to Def Leppard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Product.","review":"Kristin is right, it's sticky and it stays on the fur.

What is wonderful also is that I can use my knowledge of health and wellness with this program but if you are not into wellness you can still follow this diet program and not feel like you have to become a health nut but can learn to make one small change at a time.

I needed a flow chart to figure out who the characters were and found myself wondering whether any of the stories were ever going to move forward.I imagine since Debbie's letter hinted at 15 books (see I am a geek and even read her letters) and this is merely number 2 there are a lot of character lines that needed to be introduced.

There were less \\"pollyanna\\" story lines in this book than 16 Lighthouse Road. The drama in Mary Ellen's life was well woven into the story.

During the first book I was hoping it would get better the entire time I was reading it, and during the course of this book, I felt it did.Although there seem to be certain commonalities with most Debbie Macomber books, I was glad that she strayed from the normal formula for some of the characters in this book. I am always more intrigued by the characters that seem like they may have a secret or a darker side than the ones that are all just sugar and pie from the very beginning. Over all I liked this book.

If water can find a way to get in, it will.I have used this case -- perfectly happily -- with my rinky-dink digital camera around water. But without even submerging, water did get into the case. It is simply not waterproof -- nor is it designed to be. A simple visual examination told me before I ever used the case that it could not possibly be airtight or watertight.

I have tried several times to find something here, but to no avail. I am a big Yes and Howe fan. This disc suffers from 'solo album' curse; the dynamics of having different people writing and playing is lost. Howe does all the string instruments. Bill Bruford brings nothing to this; a drum machine would have been as good. The same can be said for Billy Currie on keyboards.Every composition is predictable and uninspiring. Technically good, yes, but no passion, nothing.It shows that Yes is greater than the sum of its parts. Howe's best stuff is still with Yes. I am sorry to say this. I wanted to like this disc.

For those of you who enjoy Howe's ability to draw from a variety of musical influence's to create creative and tuneful music this album will infuriate you. One would think that in pairing up with Bill Bruford, Howe would create some magical moments. Sadly, there's no magic here. Bruford's brilliance is lost beneath those miserable Simmons electronic drums he tinkered with in the early nineties. Howe overplays on every cut displaying none of the passion or creativity evidenced in earlier works. For a quality solo effort turn to The Steve Howe Album. Otherwise, stick to Yes' seventies output with Howe on guitar.

However, the lessons he draws - that we inquire the remore past in the search for answers to today's problems , and that Ancient historiograph suffers mostly from modern historians' reactionary views - are undoubtely correct and should serve as an inspiration to a proper Classics scholar who should want to step into his shoes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent Themes - Poor Organization","review":"Michael Parenti does an excellent job of reminding us where history comes from and how important perspective is in history. His concept of the \\"gentleman historian\\" is very apt, as most of our understanding of the Late Roman Empire is derived from the surviving texts of the Roman aristocracy. This leads to partially skewed image of Rome and of the common citizens as being nothing more than an angry mob. However, along with being incredibly one-sided, Parenti ends up rambling on for 200 pages about this very idea, without making any other important conclusions. The book would more appropriatly named \\"The Assassination of the Gentleman Historian\\". I would suggest looking elsewhere for alternative viewpoints on the Late Roman Empire."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wonder if he enjoyed reading his penguin editions","review":"All biases aside, it's a joke to think you can understand the material cited in the without even a working knowledge of latin (or greek for that matter) as Parenti does. The best insights in the book are things that even students taking a basic Roman civ class could tell you (the sources are written by the wealthy, are often inaccurate etc..).

This CD marks a return to mainstream country music style and rather more predictable (if still good) love song lyrics. I also felt that there was less variation in the tunes. So...

His range is now very limited and the songs are truly boring. I guess his long-time fans will have trouble letting him go, but buy one of his pre-adolescent albums if you want to hear Gilman when he could soar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Billly's Back!","review":"I have been a long time supporter of Billy Gilman. I have multiple copies of all of his cd's, have attended several concerts all over the country (he's awesome to see live), and have, in the past, been involved with websites dedicated to supporting Billy. I must say, I was only mildly pleased with his last couple of cd's... I felt his voice was not yet fully changed and it did not have the impact on me his \\"younger voice\\" did. However,this new cd has made me smile! I love hearing his incredible voice again. :) I think this \\"Billy Gilman\\" cd will be worn out just like my One Voice and Dare to Dream cds are. The lyrics to most songs are touching and the song choices are perfect. Thanks for hanin' in there Billy!

Ratings identify best values (shaded stars) and Johnson includes advice on when a specific vintage is \\"a point\\" (ready to drink). He is at his best with French wines and one chapter focuses exclusively on Bordeaux. One fault: the review of California wines is not very comprehensive. The simple rating system of one to four stars is realistic and leaves room for your own judgment. I recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want a single, simple reference, this is it.","review":"Hugh Johnson is not only one of the most knowledgeable writers on wine, he is also one of the most eloquent.

From the opening of Black Ice to the final notes of Kings of Sleep, Stu takes you on a musical journey that ranges from the virtuosic to straight up rock out. Hamm shows that he can not only fires off notes with the best six-stringed players of the day, but he can lay back and groove with the drums as part of the rhythm section while the guitar player solos over top of it. Stu's playing is awe-inspiring, as he proved when he was playing bass with Joe Satriani. It shows off his high-level of proficiency, but it all makes sense. Anyone who loves guitar should own this album, if only out of sheer respect.Favorite tracks: Black Ice, Surely the Best, Call of the Wild, Kings of Sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kings of Sleep - Stuart Hamm","review":"I'm an 80's Metal gal....yes, big hair and everything. This was a cassette in my collection for many years and I used to play the heck out of it. Recently, I was trying to remember Stuart's name to repurchase the album.

With Asia being the hot topic in business today Martin Roll manages to communicate a superb insight into the decision making levels and challanges of Asian companies. The book stands out through its clarity in which a sophisticated brand framework is brought to life. The great mix of theoretical and academic work combined with case studies and applied examples make this book stand out. It is the combination of the writing approach of this book and its Asian insight which makes it one of the most relevant business books I have read for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a joke?","review":"Are you kidding me?

I couldn't have been more wrong. First of all, the father in the movie is a dog breeder who is not only abusive to his dogs, but his wife and son as well. In one scene in the movie, the father, mother and son are at the police station. While they are there, the police officer pushes back the mother's hair, exposing a bruise on her forehead. While abuse is certainly a disturbing reality for some families today, the topic does not belong in a family movie that is likely to be viewed by young children. Beyond the topic of abuse, the rest of the storyline has little/no redeeming value. I am shocked that Reader's Digest gave this movie their Seal of Approval.

But, I got this movie for my preschool daughter because she loves dogs. I was really saddened that it turned out to be a story of animal abuse, child abuse (verbal), and spousal abuse. The father character in this movie is mentally and physically abusive. He is not \\"redeemed\\" at the end, as happens in most movies of this type. I was really hoping that in the end, he would \\"see the light\\" and become a kinder, gentler father and husband. Instead, he's carted off to jail! Very sad.

I haven't seen any of those so I have nothing to compare this to, but, while I found myself enjoying this a bit, it was very cliched, predictable, and badly acted, with some of the most groan-inducing dialogue ever captured on film. The script needed a good polish; it felt like a first draft. Children, like the one I was baby-sitting, are sure to enjoy this sweet tale, but adults should steer clear. It is overlong, boring, inconsistent, and nothing we haven't seen hundreds of times before.

I thought I was going to read Chicken Soup for the SINGLE'S Soul-- not Chicken Soup for the Christian's Soul.A book I was so much looking forward to, greatly disappointed me because of all the religious stories it contained.

When this was first installed, it wouldn't lift water out of the sump basket at all under battery power. I have 9 foot basement walls and the basket is 3 foot deep. Customer service informed me that I had too many 90 degree elbows so I had the sump pump plumbing reworked to eliminate all 90 degree elbows. Even after making this change, the pump can barely move water out of the well. I doubt it will keep up in a significant rain during a failure.

Its difficult to see the levels in the battery to determine where your levels are so finally instead of blindly filling it up i used a small flash light while i was refilling. I have not had a problem since as I finally filled the water to the proper level.

She is one of the few writers of mysteries today who seems to have a love affair with words. Those of you who like your mysteries terse and short should avoid this. But for those of you who love well-written procedurals from a writer who knows how to use the language, don't miss this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overlabored and obvious","review":"As a psychological novel, Death in Holy Orders is middling to good. As a mystery, it fails entirely. The culprit of the murder is obvious half-way through, with no attempt to even hide his guilt -- I wondered why on earth I should keep reading. Keep reading I did out of sheer stubborness, but even at the end, when the motive and mechanisms of the crime were all laid out, none of it really was all that convincing. If this is P.D.

James is my favorite writer of this particular genre. In this book, I would have wished that her characters and plot had been tied more to our univeral angst. I would like to know of her tale of the common folks living very much in these times, especially those us living in but not of the world of commerce and the drama of rising and falling stock markets. I didn't care about any of these characters, even Adam seemed so one dimensional. If lives full of anachronisms is what we are about these days, Ms. James succeeded. Perhaps I am wrong. Perhaps the characters of this book do represent the self absorbed, aggressors we all live with these days. I am however,waiting for and will appreciate her gift of a new novel as I do all of them. Give Adam his soulful thoughts back again, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Death in Holy Orders is Deathly Dull","review":"I normally enjoy P.D. James novels very much. This was a surprising exception. The plot was slow, the characters for the most part uninteresting, and the culprit, once revealed failed to have a convincing motive for murder.

This story had great potential, but the combination of dull characters and a very slow pacing put an end to those hopes. James bogs down the first third of the story with background and detail overkill. When the story finally does get moving the charters involved are very dull and I really had to force myself to finish it. Better editing could have saved this story, but as with many of todays writers James tries to stretch a 200 page story into 400 pages with disasterous results."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Disappointment Here!","review":"I just finished the book. I really liked it. The storyline had a lot of different plots buried within plots. They were intriguing, and I could follow them! My only complaint, which is minor, would be that I sometimes had to flip back to refresh my memory on who a particular character was. I would suggest that you jot down everyone's names as you encounter them, with a brief description of their character. For example,there are about five priests alone,whose names all begin with \\"Father.\\"I give this book \\"five stars\\" because it totally satisfied me. It is such a good English mystery!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Death in Holy Orders is deathly dull","review":"As much as I enjoy reading P.D. James and especially the Adam Dalgliesh series, I found myself slogginng through the book. I nearly put it down. The plot is uninteresting and I found it difficult to care about any of the priests, ordinands, staff or guests of St. Anselm's (with a few exceptions). If you are new to the Dalgliesh series, you would be better off reading \\"Cover Her Face\\" or \\"Devices and Desires.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Death in Holy Orders","review":"P D James can still write an engaging tale, ample to engage the mind on a transatlantic flight. But this mystery is a failure.Indispensible for the genre is a plot that \\"works\\"; that remains credible after the denoument. \\"Death in Holy Orders\\" visits all the possible villains and properly acquits them, but the chosen bad-guy is simply not credible as such; he has no motivation for a brutal murder. This story does not hang together.I was unable at Stockholm Airport to buy this from Amazon, alas; so I paid more than needed. And when I wrote Ms James c/o her publisher to request a refund, you'll be shocked to learn that she has in five weeks made me no reply whatever.It's no shame on any author, to be unable to produce consistent work at age 80. But for the sake of the reputation P D James has already established, she ought now to call it a day."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pot of copper at the end of the rainbow","review":"The setting is brilliant, and the musings on death are vintage James. I raced through the novel savouring the taste of this other world. It's intriguing and wonderfully detailed. BUT, the end leaves you wanting more. Somehow, it's far less of a shock than it should have been, after 400 pages of intricate webs and careful story-telling. Should have been just there, but stopped short of a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"P.D. James is marvelous. Richly drawn characters in a wonderful mystery that puts other writers to shame. Certainly that James' novels are thoughtful, beautifully written, and expertly realized puts her in a class uniquely her own. This one, with its setting, characters, and dialogue, is particularly and richly satisfying.There are few writers who approach a mystery with such care, art, and brilliance, creating something of fine entertainment and lasting value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vivid setting & characters","review":"This is a mystery in which becoming acquainted with the characters is as diverting as determining whodunit. James evokes a vivid sense of place with her Anglican seminary inhabited by anachronistic, yet timeless, characters. They are truly human, with the range of experiences that make any of us capable of great good or great evil. The key to the mystery itself lies in a complex web of relationships that the author slowly reveals. A few things hold me back from giving this five stars. First, a good 50 pages easily might have been trimmed from the book without injury to the story. Also, some American readers may find it difficult to visualize the route of the detectives as they traipse around the London suburbs and the English countryside. Overall, though, a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beguiling Murders","review":"Ms. James cleverly navigates her readers through personal sins, management quandary, and society turmoil. Scores of secrets materialize in a minute community. With so many confusions introduced, one forgets that a clear motive might be an answer to any mysteries. Very cunning of Ms. James in weaving her tale and I applaud her in compelling me to think too deeply into matters all throughout the book. I do not understand the reasoning behind writing only one chapter for book four but Ms. James must have an experienced writer's artistic and logical answer in doing so. Ms. James' vibrant use of the English language together with her vast vocabulary results in a pleasurable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"--A Classic Adam Dalgliesh Mystery--","review":"Commander Adam Dalgliesh of Scotland Yard is called upon to investigate the murder of a student at St. Anselm's theological college on the East Anglican coast. Dalgliesh is ambivalent about working the case because he is quite familiar with the school. As a young man he had spent several summers at St. Anselm's and going there after so many years would bring back memories.P.

I think that her books will be read for a long, time.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A ripping good mystery","review":"Being an avid mystery reader, and favoring the American female authors Paretsky, Grafton, and Dams, I was prepared to be less than enthusiastic with \\"Holy Orders\\". What a pleasant surprise to find a good old fashioned English mystery with lots of different characters, plot twists, and suspects. P.D. James develops her plot and her characters in an organized manner and gives nothing away in advance. The detailed descriptions of scenes and settings are well crafted and enhance the flow of the action. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and James now makes my \\"short list\\" of favorite mystery writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"wish I could give it a better review","review":"The writing was good, but the subject was dull. And didn't anyone else feel a little offended that at least three of the \\"good guys\\" thought that it was just a shame that poor Father John was being persecuted when all he had done was fondle a few choirboys - after all it wasn't like he raped them. While I might be willing to believe that one character - or even two - could be that backward in this day and age, would you really expect that from three of them, and two of those police officers? And Adam Dalgliesh gets less and less believable with every book - personally, I wish she'd write another Cordelia Gray book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story, abrupt ending","review":"Complex tale and interesting characters.

The murderer turns out to be a character with no real motive for the crime-actually none of the characters have much of a motive for the crime. Oh well...bad day for PDJ.

The lyrics have no content and come off as arrogant rather than humorous(not forgetting no melody). The production is crap, especially on the guitars.Basically, if i want 70's hair metal I'll take ac/dc and Van Halen thank you.The album starts on a good note but then The EP falls rapidly downwards- The vocals and lyrics get irritating silly andpretentious. All of this is cliched, sloppy and ingenuineThe guitar riffs, are so stolen from other bands its a bit of a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed the Mark","review":"I found this band scoping the net for new music.The look of the band caught my eye and I was hoping a kick ass rock and roll band.

A table at the beginning of the book is not resizable on the Kindle, and the text is extremely small and faint (on an original Kindle). There's also a diagram that's not resizable. I can understand that about the diagram, but the table is just a timeline of fly fishing and rod technology--no pictures, just text. Worse, throughout the book's text, there are numerous unnecessarily hyphenated words that retain that hyphenation regardless of text size on the Kindle (for example, \\"unneces- sarily\\" or \\"hy- phenated\\"). If this were a business memo I'd muddle through, but it's too unpleasant for light reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous Book!!!","review":"George Black has written a most literary and enjoyable history of the bamboo fly fishing rod. Unhurried, with frequent fascinating digressions, he takes one through the history of the development of this remarkable sporting instrument, beginning in the mid 1800's and coming down to the present. He provides much color to persons whose names were all we knew before: Leanard, Edwards, Hawes, Thomas and more. A grand book by a great author. You will really enjoy this book, even if you are not a fly fisher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bamboo for You","review":"If you like flyfishing and want to learn about the history of your tool, this is the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate to badmouth it, but...","review":"This idea that Piers Anthony gives is great. Two worlds - one magic and one technological - is brilliant. The moment a friend told me about it, I went out and grabbed it. The book was also well written. I just couldn't stand the multiple-page long monologues Stile gives frequently. It seemed that every chapter Stile was giving some speech or another about morality or about how great he was at one thing or another. That's another thing that's not so great. I like having a hero who is really good at a few things, but it seemed that Stile was good at everything -riding horses, fighting, the Game, robots, even magic he picked up quickly. Heroes that are too good wind up too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"An average Scifi-Fanasy","review":"This book seemed to me to be too ordinary. It talks about him beating robots but all he is, is an ordinary jockey. He doesn't have special power that lets him beat up robots twice as powerful as him. I do have to admitt that it gets a little better when he goes though the curtain to the world Phaze. Basically what I am trying to say is that the book has the good essentials to be a story but it lacks the final touch ups. The book has no real excitment, I would advise you read books like The Hobbit by JRR Tolien, The Eye of the World by Robert Jordan, The Wizard's First Rule by Tery Goodkind, or books by Robert E. Feist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"Science world or fantasy world, it isn't much fun to be in the lower classes.This book has all sorts of stuff, and the title is a reference to the two different sorts of universes therein. The main character is a serf, or member of the underclass in the science based universe. He is exceptional in that he is one of the top players of a complicated Game that is a major part of life there, which basically involves navigating through a series of contests.Apart from that, someone wants to bump him off."},{"rating":"1","title":"First in the Adept series, and shows it.","review":"Split Infinity runs its course on the merit of its premise.

Science fiction ever written! The world is detailed and original. The story is moving and thoughtfull, and of course all the women are hot and totaly devoted to Stile (the main guy) What more could you want??Oh and so you don't think that this is a totaly sexist, male only book, you should that Stile (the main character) wouldn't be able to open a box of cracker jacks without a women helping him. (guy is hopeless) Unicorns, mages, powerful citizens, this book is THE BEST P-Anthony has ever written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining.","review":"Although I enjoyed this book, I also thought that it seemed to be written on a lower level than some books I've read. It was kinda like the whole idea was good and original, but the way it was written didn't seem very \\"top quality\\". It was like the book didn't fit into an age group category.But I did like it. Very entertaining. I liked how Anthony wrote a book that included sci-fi and fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Piers' best","review":"I read this series back in the 1980s when I was a teenager, and I remember loving it. Like most of Piers Anthony's works, it's light and airy and aimed more at the younger reader than an adult looking for a serious or literary work of fiction.Nevertheless, the trilogy is a very enjoyable read, and even better because it's just a trilogy. Unlike many of Anthony's stories that seem to extend over an infinte number of books, this trilogy has a definite ending with book three.Between here and book three (Juxtaposition: a lovely name for a novel, isn't it?) you'll be treated to a wonderfuly imaginative fantasy story involving robots, magic, and even politics. Defintely Piers Anthony at his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"To be concise, this book rules. To be otherwise; I thought that this book was a very good piece of science fiction with enough of a twist to easily set it apart from some others of that genre. The characters are great; Sheen would have to be my favorite, though. (Who else felt sorry for the poor 'bot? *sniff*) The Phaze/Photon concept was very interesting, and I liked seeing it explored further in the later books of this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book and series of all time","review":"Split infinety has a little of everything.

Would certainly not recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have !!!","review":"We researched for a few months all kinds of mosquito programs. Everything from a full installed system to the 8.00 cutter yard spray, which by the way works really well. We finally purchased the Coleman Mosquito Deleto and we couldn't be HAPPIER. WE noticed a big difference by the 3rd day! We also used the table top mosquito inhibitor. We have a very small yard, 1/4 acre, the system is in our backyard in the corner. I check it about twice a week to make sure it's running, ie. the propane isn't empty. The propane tank lasts about one month. I can't recommend this system enough. We live in humid,mosquito inhabited south Texas. Now we are able to sit on our deck and enjoy watching the kids play without slappin' the fire out of our legs and arms......FYI, we purchased our Deleto at Lowes, cheaper than the price posted on Amazon :o)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great litle cart","review":"Received it well within the time specified. Went together fairly easily. The hub caps were a bit of a trial, but I put the cart on its side, protected the end I wasn't securing with a piece of wood and used a rubber mallet to knock the caps on.Nice and light weight which is great for us girls. Breaks down for transport in my trunk and is a good little workhorse around the yard. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, poor execution","review":"This cart seems to have everything going for it until you try to put the wheels on. The knock-on caps designed to keep the wheels on the axles are a very poor choice of fastener. The second wheel on each axle is a wrestling match because with the ballooned-out wheel design, the axle will not touch the floor. Using a small wooden block to push up into the wheel rim and hold the axle in place results in rebound off the plastic wheel itself and an immense amount of impact force is required to hammer the knock-on cap onto the axle. The knock-on cap tool designed to fit around the cap and assist with hammering the cap onto the axle is plastic and only adds to the rebound when trying to strike with a hammer. My suggestions...unless the thing is already assembled, look for another choice and if you need a real workhorse buy a heavy duty garden cart from a hardware store because the cost will only be slightly more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun scooter for American Girl Dolls","review":"I purchased this scooter for my daughter over a year ago. She has enjoyed playing with it and uses it for her American Girl dolls. The seat is a little bit awkward for the dolls to stay on, but the seatbelt helps. It is a very good value for the price and an excellent substitute for the \\"AG\\" pricier brand version. I love the American Girl product line, (and highly recommend the magazine) but some of their products are just priced too high.

The original batteries worked well for 10 years or more before their capacity to hold a charge started to fail.The replacement battery from Mega Wholesale/Big Mike's Electronics started to show signs of failing after a couple of months, and after 7-8 months it could hardly hold enough of a charge to turn on the phone and make one phone call. I wonder how long that battery was on the shelf in Big Mike's warehouse? Neither the date of manufacture nor the 'best before' date is indicated on the battery, so it wasn't clear when I received the battery that its best days were probably long ago.

I fell in love with Nouri Sommers with the first book in this series, THIEF OF HEARTS. And at first I thought Nouri Sommers should dump that rotten husband of hers (Ethan) and hook back up with her former lover, high-power attorney, (Clint Chamberlain), but then the reader was introduced to manly P.I. (Charles Mason), and I thought, well, a woman has to leave her options open...that is to say until handsome homicide detective, (Gabe Baldwin) was introduced. At long last the perfect man for Nouri has come into her life to rescue her!

Victoria Taylor Murray has achieved what so many writers only dream about--readers who love her books and want more. This series is the kind of reading you savor for that get-away time at the cottage or long train or plane ride, and if you are lucky enough to go on a cruise, having VTM along to read is another bit of wonderful entertainment to enjoy. As other reviewers advise, the best treat you can give yourself is to buy the entire series so you don't have to wait, as everyone else did, for your next novel to come out.

I've just finished the third installment in the Lambert series, FRIENDLY ENEMIES. The mystery and suspense are sustained artistically by the writer's refreshing talent. The character portrayals become even more sharply drawn here, with crispier descriptions and more clever nuances of focus. I too (like other anxious readers and devoted fans) am wondering about future adventures of Nouri and Clint, or maybe Nouri and Gabe. Nouri and Charles perhaps? From what we've already seen of Victoria Murray's talent for suspense-filled operetta, we can be certain that the writer has it very skillfully orchestrated. Bravo, Victoria. You know how to titillate your readers.Very Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seeded Reviews?","review":"I have not read these books, but it is rare for a book to get so many reviews and have an overall 5 star rating, so I thought I'd check it out. Then I noticed something fishy - I'm not making it up - check it out for yourself: Most (not all) of the reviews use the same basic language and grammar. Most of them mention the word \\"series\\" in the first sentence, \\"characters\\" in the second, and the last sentence ends with one to three exclamation marks \\"!!!\\". Also, they don't say anything about the plot of the book, and they have about the same number of helpful votes (30-50). All this is very suspicious to me, and then comes along a review that says they bought the book because of all the 5 star ratings and then found the book to be awful and even contained many spelling errors. Did the same person write these using different names? It looks that way to me. Based on all this I decided to skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling Sex Scenes!","review":"I am a person who loves losing myself inside someone elses world for a few blissful hours each day as I unwind from my day's work.

With most series, by the third one, it all starts to get a little boring. Well, boring is not what you get here! No one can write romantic suspense like Murray. She's better than any of the bestselling authors out there. Her books sizzle and keep the reader enthralled. A great love story that will leave you wanting more.

From the botched, boring interviews to the artifice of using grainy, black and white film, Rattle and Hum is just wrong. Near the end of the picture and for no particular reason, we have color.At least the audio is high quality and nothing can detract from U2's excellent performances. It would have been more interesting to see a full, unedited concert from the Joshua Tree tour rather than this not so \\"art\\" film.Better U2 films: Popmart (although also visually annoying, the energy and setlist is far better), Elevation (perhaps the best), or ZooTv (for the sheer scale of the event).[DW]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-Ray versus VHS video","review":"I can not see any difference in quality between this Blu-ray version and the VHS video version i have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Russian+19th century=good","review":"In the footsteps of other such amazing Russian authors comes Turgenev, and his wonderfully written play 'A Month in the Country.'

I bought this CD off of this site because I had heard of the Refreshments (who were awesome) and wanted a little more of the same. Although these guys aren't in the same ball park with the old Refreshments, they do have some potential to get their name beyond the shadow that the Refreshments have placed them in until this point.

Talented musicians play throughout the CD, but with all this talent one would think there would be some originality involved in the music creating process. It's the same old song, same old themes, almost as if Roger was hurtin' for songs to write about. I would like to see more out of a band with this much potential..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad Day in Mudville","review":"After the Refreshments broke up, I couldn't wait to see where the key players would land. I bought Honky Tonk Union the moment it came out. What a let down. The Refreshments were fresh and distinct. The Peacemakers are uninspired and generic. It's obvious that Roger Clyne has talent, (Jack Vs. Jose, City Girls), it just seems that he has surrounded himself with a backup band of the Gin Blossums or Shania Twain. The unique sound that the Refreshments had is certainly not evident here. More Nashville than Tempe. There are 3 or 4 decent cuts but the bulk of the album is country lite. Bring back the Fizzy Fuzzy producer, Cliff Norrell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Good Start--but let's see some more","review":"I bought this CD based on looking at some of the other reviews.

Also, when you stow them and collapse the temples, the temple tips don't scratch up the lens like cheaply designed sunglasses do.btw: I know that 2113 are a man's style but their lens are bigger than any of the styles for women which all looked too small for my face; so far someone has yet to notice and point it out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was so bad it was painfull!","review":"I didn't think it was possible to write a book in which every character is absolutely lifeless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Dance out\\" Sessions 6","review":"Yesturday I borrowed this CD from my local library, before I went and bought it, and was utterly disappointed.

This is the first one that has disappointed me.1. Including both C# and VB code in a single edition makes the book much fatter than it needs to be, and quite inaccessible. It would have been better to print two editions of the book.2. Some examples are too lengthy. I tend to find smaller examples more useful than large ones, because they're easier to get running and then adapt to my own purposes. I appreciate that the authors are trying to demonstrate \\"real world\\" applications like a Bug Database and a Stock Ticker, but unless you are going to spend hours digging through the code, these sorts of examples are not practical.

Further, it makes the worst error a book can make -- to assume the reader already knows the material for which he/she bought the book to learn in the first place. The book comes across as disjointed and does not flow. The example concerning the program developed throughout the course of the book, a bug reporting program, drags on and on and on...very tiresome. The database information I found next to useless and angeringly frustrating to follow, as result of the disjointedness to which I referred earlier, and a great lack of clarity. One concludes upon reading this book that the authors genuinely know their subject, but are frustratingly unable to clearly, concisely, and logically communicate that understanding in a flowing, useful, organized fashion. My advice? Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"No, you don't need Visual Studio.NET","review":"That's categorically false! VS.NET is *not* necessary to work through this book.

Or the fact that Slam likes Matisha and Kiki but if he asks ether of them out the other will not talk to him is something I can connect to . But my all time favorite part is when he and Ice get into a fight on the top of the roof at Ice's house and Slam was really hurt by knowing that Ice was dealing drugs. Or mayby it was the part when Slam's team beat Carver in the last basket ball game of the season. Then Slam went back to school and every one thought that he was a hero.

No originality at all. Enough with these men who know immediately that this is the woman for them and manipulate the woman to come to that realization by using sex and self control, when their instinct is to dominate. Booorrrring. I didn't finish it and that's rare for me. Perhaps some readers are not familiar with the entire series, thus found something enjoyable here.I have read books by Laurens from before the Devil's Bride, Cynster Book 1 and she had some talent.

Sorry Stephanie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I read this book on the heels of Wild Night. I only got about a third of the way through before giving up.

They might have made a good book if put together. But this book was just plain boring. Way too much emphasis placed on the characters' relationship.

Not up to the past standard of Stephanie Lauren stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment","review":"I have read and thoroughly enjoyed each of the Cynster series from Ms. Laurens, and this is the only one that I put down without finishing. The plot was too farfetched, the characters uninspiring and the storyline failed to engage or maintain my interest. Perhaps this novel was too rushed to the publisher without the author's more typical craftsmanship? A disappointment for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Her Best Cynster","review":"I am a big Stephanie Laurens fan but this was not one of her best books. It started off with a bang and I laughed so hard at the beginning, when Amelia proposed to a drunken Lucien Ashford. Then it got really slow and although the sensuality was there, it didn't quite pack the wallop that her other Cynster novels had.The last portion of the book, when she introduces the rest of the wonderful Cynster family in, is where it again gets interesting.I really rate this as a 3-1/2 but gave it a 4 because a 3 was not fair.I was only slightly disapointed, but still a fair read."},{"rating":"1","title":"no plot","review":"I am a major Stephanie Laurens fan. I have enjoyed her books becuase there generally character development, and a plot in addition to romance elements. I have been happy with the strong heroines and heroes that are good men. I particularly enjoyed the earlier Cynster books. This one has no plot. It is just sex that becomes repetitive and boring. I am embarrased to say that I rushed out to buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't she have an editor?","review":"Ms. Lauren's story is 'alright' a little contrived but it could have been fun, had she not decided to have her main characters have sex every 6 pages...after a while, it's just boring and insulting to the reader who is actually looking for a story. In this case, her 'theif' was also very easy to figure out, and secondary characters drawn very shallowly. But most importantly, this woman needs an editor to teach her how to begin paragraphs and sentences with more than, 'Thought she would die...' 'Felt herself falling...' This isn't even good English!My second Laurens book, and my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"I am a fan of Stephanie Laurens novels, especially the Cynster series, but I was let down with On a Wicked Dawn. Each character had such potential to be far more interesting and far more adventerous. I felt there were more intimate scenes then necessary....we get the point! we WANT the romance!! the chase, the expoloration, the discovery! I felt that this book and it predecessor, On a Wild Night, were lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if you want a good sleeping pill...","review":"Right after reading Amanda's story (On a Wild Night), I just could not wait to read about her twin. Amelia's story became the 3rd book I read from the Cynster series. This 3rd experience was the equivalence of a cold shower: trivial plot, unchallenging story, and dragging sex scenes that made me yawn almost to the point of disjointing my jaw. I understand this is sensual romance, but excess even in what is expected can be detrimental. If this was the 1st book of the series I had read, it would have stopped there. I am not a writer but I guess it must be quite a challenge to do quality work every time. Either that or the Cynster saga has reached its limit and the inspirating muse (or formula) needs to retire.Anyway, IMHO this one is not worth even a free rental at the local public library. Hmmph! But at least it put me to sleep for a couple of nights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought this book without realizing what is really was, and was truly happy to see it was Amelia Cynster story. However, after reading the first third of the book, I was soon extremely disappointed. This book lacked any intrigue. It was very straightforward, without any interesting plot. Characters lacked depth and emotion, it was completely unclear how they fell in love, why they fell in love, etc. All that we got from the book were numerous, detailed, sex scenes. Overall, I found this book to be a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...hard to stick with it.","review":"I rarely write reviews and usually really enjoy Lauren's work; however, I find it difficult to stay with this one. I am always thinking of the next book I want to read and skim more than I actually read. It's hard to explain it's just that the plot isn't there. It's too many thoughts on both Amelia and Luc's part. I guess I just really like sparks between the characters and there isn't any between them. Someone else wrote that it should be the end of the Cynsters...I agree! :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"How can an author write so well without","review":"much of a plot? I enjoyed the male Cynster books, even though they were skimpy on plot as well. This had very little to entice the reader. Amelia proposed to Lucien. He accepted... The End-right?

I found the story of Amelia and Luc to be entertaining: amusing dialogue and refreshing twist (like Julie Garwood) that Hero and Heroine really do like each other in the story ... rather than having a hate/hate relationship, as some 'romance' novels do (which I don't count as \\"real\\" romances anyways).... lots of sex scenes, and an okay storyline. If you ask me, this novel is well worth the read, should you be looking for a romp with two colourful characters.If, as suggested by other reviewers, this is SL at her worst THEN SLs worst is still pretty darn great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not her best","review":"I enjoyed \\"On a Wicked Dawn,\\" but it could have moved a little faster. The love scenes were steamy enough, but no one was getting scorched. I like fun, exciting passion like her other works, and Rogers, Lindsey and one of my latest reads, \\"Anything,My Love\\" by Cynthia Simmons. That one had been running for a cold shower."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just words to fill the pages.","review":"From the very beginning page I knew this book was going to drag. I love Stephanie Laurens' books. She is among one of my favorite historical romance writers. This book however greatly disappointed me. The love scenes, while steamy, left me a little bored. The two just never really seemed to fit. Amelia was too naive and Luc's knowledge of sex was rather trivial. The words were there, but I just wasn't convinced of the passion and excitement of their lovemaking. When I find myself skimming through the love scenes something is missing. I also found myself bored with the page fillers. This book dragged out so many boring incidents occurring in the characters lives I couldn't even finish the book. I just skipped to the end. Which by the way concluded so uneventfully boring it wouldn't have made a difference if I had read it first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disappointing...","review":"Stephanie Laurens's books are in general pretty good, and this one not bad, but I was hoping for better after A Wild Night. As in All About Passion, I think that she is relying too heavily on the characters' relationship inside the bedroom rather than the one outside the bedroom. We are told that they have known each other forever, but I didn't get that feel. The drama at the end helped, but I think you could easily get rid of 1/2 the 'does he/she love me' angst and some of the bedroom scenes and have a better book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of passion","review":"great romance and even more with rereading several times ahero to be loved and aheroine to be dreamed of thank you STEPHANE LAURENS"},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money!","review":"Like many other readers, I have eagerly read every one of the Cynster series. But this one is a waste of time. One reviewer noted it took them a week of perseverance to get through it. I'm going on 3 weeks and am still not done! Amelia deserved a better story and better character developement, I'm still not sure what sets her apart, other than \\"she's a Cynster female.\\" And Luc has no obvious character other than being spineless.

Generally, I laugh, I sigh, I enjoy every word. I usually cannot put the book down until I have finished reading it. This book does not measure up.

After the first 100 pages, I set the book down and have no intention of resuming my reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isn't what I expected","review":"After reading the other Cynster books, I anxiously awaited the publication of this. It just didn't live up to my expectations. Maybe as a short-story this would have been all right, but so much is fluff (just adding pages) that one gets the feeling that the author is just trying to write a novel. Okay, we know that they both love each other...we know that he's no longer in need of her dowry...just tell her already. I usually can read one of her books in a day or so (after all, I do work and have a family), but this book took over a week and I had to force myself to finish it.If you're looking for a fast-paced romance...look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This one is about the other twin in the Cynster series. Her name begins with an A. Yes, I am being sarcastic. The plot and characters are boring. So is the sex. There is suppossed to be a plot, not just sex -anywhere, anytime, anyhow.

Her characters breathe with a vibrant immediacy that is as compelling as the storylines that propel her novels. The historical detail is wonderful, with an attention to the minutiae of the period that is as satisfying as viewing intricate beadwork. Every drop of distilled description adds to the fragrantly complex whole. In this outing, the facets of a shopgirls' life in her off-hours are heartbreakingly portrayed, and the descriptions of Coney Island are a beautiful braid of social commentary, exposition, and simple color.

This was a great adventure film, that had me wishing I was right alongside with them. There is awesome scenery, great action sequences, humor, and a 'just for the hell of it' attitude that is very refreshing. Now, as for the ecological message - yes it gets a little heavy-handed and in the way of the movie. The message of over-consumption, and the ability to live in harmony with the land is a powerful and important one, and I give props to the filmmakers for tackling it, but they perhaps over-did it (time-wise).

And dissapointing the legends and pro climber were so lost and ill prepared. Why are Yvon, Jeff & Kris so grumpy? Have they considered lowering the retail cost so the clothing is more affordable to surfers, climbers, snowboarders, etc, or perhaps increasing factory worker wages, instead of removing fences on their remote and distant land.

Like many mid-european eurobeat singers, they couldn't actually sing, all vocals were done by the producer and assistant and the two men on the cover were catalogue models hired to sell the record and dance and lip sync on stage.Very much a one hit wonder and certainly not worth the price people are trying to sell it for, not everything that is rare and deleted is because it was good, sometimes it was just so bad it wasn't worth republishing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest collection of Hardfloor tracks.","review":"Two discs of Hardfloor mayhem.

Maggie, a country singer, who attracts violent crime, murders and men like spilt Kool-Aid attracts ants. This book had me smiling from beginning to end. Although, at the end of the book I found myself HAVING to know if Maggie went with Marshall, the coffee-regular detective or Tony, the latte with the works private investigator...but I'll have to wait for the next book. I am sure it will be good, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Good As The First","review":"While I enjoyed the first book in the Maggie Reid series, I found this one lacking. The storyline was too centered around all the men after Maggie rather than the reason her ex-husband Vernell was missing. It was amazing that every time she had a crisis, there was at least one or more incredibly handsome men around to comfort her.It would have been more interesting to expand the plot of the \\"Redneck Mafia\\", given us more background on them to help build the story around Vernell's disappearance.I found Maggie a little too self-centered in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"A little slow to get started but then it grabs you and I couldn't put it down.Ilike all of the Monk series"},{"rating":"1","title":"A great disappointment","review":"As an avowed Anne Perry fan, I was thoroughly bored with this book. First, the theme of the book is repetitive. Perry repeats herself in describing the characters' backgrounds in bok after book. In this one, the descriptions wore thin so Perry fans might find this tedious. Second, the beginning of the book begins with an error in editing or in sloppy writing. A question asked of a character and answered gets repeated by another as if he had not been in the previous scene. Very sloppy. Third, the author's anti-catholic stab adds little to the main story and seems gratuitous. Blaming the catholic Church for everything seems to be in vogue among certain circles nowadays but here it had nothing to contribute to the story line. Skip this book. Get an earlier MONK novel from Perry and enjoy it instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"A slender plot is bloated by Perry's incessant and repetitive psychologizing. An editor should have restricted to two (three at the absolute outside!) iterations of: Monk's frustration about his lost antecedents; the tensions between Monk and Runcorn; Hester's brave-but-vulnerable background; Callandra's brave-but-veiled feelings for Kristian; the flame-like fascination Elyssa exerts; Kristian's heroic idealism; the characterologic impossibility of Kristian killing an innocent bystander; etc, etc. When the denouement finally arrives, it is unprepared, implausible and distasteful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very readable","review":"Simply put. Likeable and interesting characters. Great period of time. Wouldn't call this a high-octane read, but enjoyable. Liked it enough to look into other Anne Perry novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Formula Mystery","review":"This is my first Perry book and I am disappointed. First, the plot is your typical mystery formula with false runs and blind ends, and a bit of a 'surprise' ending (but not really.)Second, the characters are all 'canned,' from the heroic freedom-fighter Elissa to the compassionate nurse, Hester, to the dedicated and logical surgeon, Beck, and on and on.Third, Perry uses the annoying technique of telling you what to think of her characters, instead of building their reputations on their actions and letting you decide for yourself what to think.I gave it Two Stars instead of One Star because there were some interesting period scenes of old England and some historical insights.Overall, it was boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"Let's start with the flaws. The book includes lots of repetition (someone could start a drinking game for every time Monk says 'I don't know.') A good editor could have eliminated some of this and made the book less maddening to get through. The ending is a bit contrived and unbelievable. However, I have to admit that I was very taken with this book and totally believed in the characters, setting, and most of the plot. The characters were complex and interesting. Perry made them real. She also has done excellent research on the Victorian period in England. The details are fascinating and help paint a picture. Although the ending is not the most satisfying I've ever read, the reader is compelled to stick to the very end and care about what happens to the characters. All in all, a very enjoyable read"},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk, talk and more talk","review":"I will not bore anyone with a rehash of the storyline.My opinion is that, once again, Ms. Perry has spent too much time on each character's thoughts and not enough time on constructing an interesting mystery.How many times and for how many pages do we have to repeatedly read of the courage, fortitude and nobility of those who were involved in the 1848 uprisings? Page after page after page...I've read many of the author's books and this seems to be a tradition with her. Many readers seem to enjoy it, but I'd rather have less lecturing and moralizing and more thought to a decent mystery. The last few pages seemed thrown together. After spending time on this book the reader deserved a better thought-out conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous book","review":"Precious Bane is an incredibly rich, lovely story, told in a manner that seems almost faerie-like, though incisively real in its depiction of human nature. It's about a young woman born with a hare-lip in 19th-century rural England, and how she comes to win (and be won by) the fine young man who is the desire of her heart.It's a great book for teens because, among other elements in its complex theme, it is concerned with true feminine beauty, which resides in purity and virtue.The story is moving, and lingers long after the book is through.

A glorified Catalogue which contains photographs that we have all seen before. You would do just as good to order catalogues (which I already have) from famous seed banks to get the same thing. When I got this book in the post I was shocked to find that Ed had repeated every single picture from the seed catalogues. Not one picture was unique. Not one. So immediately I was very unhappy with this book but then it got worse. The descriptions are not accurate and do nothing to serve the reader with factual useful information. I later learned that Ed Rosenthal got the seed banks to pay him to do this book and he did not grow the strains and has not had any growing experience with most of them. This is the last Ed Rosenthal book I will be buying.

Once again I feel that Ed has missed his chance to really add anything new to the field and I wish he would get back to the nuts and bolts of growing instead of books with pretty pictures.

I read this book for exactly the opposite reason. For me, this is a book about a man Holy or not who was tortured for his beliefs and that is a far more powerful premise. Everyone is convinced their beliefs are the only right ones there are, and everyday, as we can see in Iraq, people are being executed and killed in the name of religion. People die defending their beliefs, right or wrong, people die to preserve our freedom.

So skilled is she that it's hard at times to know where history leaves off and her imagination takes off (for instance, Merryn was NOT an historic character, but Oldcastle was).I have to admit being just slightly disappointed that Henry's Agincourt speech paled in comparison to Shakespeare's famous \\"band of brothers\\" soliloquy, but that's to be expected.The main thing about this book is that you really begin to care about Harry and the people around him. You feel you understand him and even pity him. Of course, whether the real Henry V was as honorable is another whole matter.

At some point one of the ear buds went dead; by that time the product was out of warranty.About 2 years into its use one of the legs broke off, not at the hinge as one would expect but actually the plastic part of the goggle body itself. We glued it together with plastic cement, bot a month later the other leg broke off, in pretty much same place. We glued it again, but then it broke again in a new place, not where we glued it. Conclusion: the quality of plastic the goggle body is made of is way too cheap.

Her characters are well drawn and come to life.She is often compared to Sarah Orne Jewett and Mary E. Wilkins, other Maine writers, but a better comparison would be to Mary Ellen Chase, a Maine novelist who is contemporary to Carroll and who also used similar settings to explore comparable themes.

I opened the completely plain white box without even any writing and found the timer... and that was it. No instructions on how it works, no contact information, no nothing.

Though perhaps that is more to me being spoiled by glamorousness of Hollywood films.That being said I was not remotely disappointed.For some reason I had an affinity to the character of Messaoud... There is something about him that I inexplicably connected it.Whilst I enjoyed it the film is very blood thirsty, violent and at times unbelievable. With guns being so readily available I am surprised there were not more significant deaths more readily.I would definitely watch again"},{"rating":"2","title":"when\\"","review":"I have been waiting for this film to be released in theatrers or on DVD--it gets 5 stars automatically --It is not an insult to say that it may not be as great as Pontecorvo'sbut I am told it deals with Setif-- my father was there and watched on May 8th in horror and though a doctor was prevented from helping the Algerians who were being butcheredI will check comments from time to time--to see about theatrical release--I have alerted Amazon about DVD release"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent!!!","review":"That is the word that describes this piece of work.

It took me months to finish this one, whereas It usually takes me a few weeks to finish her books. The plot and characters were just dull and predictable. I will however continue with Nora, this was my first dislike of all that I have read, afterall she can't please all of us!"},{"rating":"1","title":"oh sooooo dissappointing...","review":"Reading the synopsis one would never guess Nora could dissappoint. I absolutely love all her books but I could barely finish this one.. If only she would have given more depth to the characters, I reall couldn't feel for any of them... I wanted so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Homeport","review":"\\"Homeport\\" tells the story of Dr. Miranda Jones, a cold-on-the-outside but warm-on-the-inside art historian whose family name is synonomous with art and relics. Her parents are cold and remote, but all the same she has entered the family business and has carved out a name of her own. Into this scenario steps Ryan Boldari, a handsome, charming, family man who happens to be an art thief. Together he and Miranda must find out who is trying to steal a priceless statue and ruin the Standford-Jones reputation.This book provided a wonderful romantic story, with a strong heroine and an equally strong (not sappy) hero in Ryan. Some of the most heartwarming parts were the most realistic -- Ryan taking Miranda home to dinner with his family, Miranda simultaneously heartbroken for and furious at her alcoholic brother Andrew (in fact, I'd love to see a sequel on Andrew sometime). All in all this was a very enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT story line; this should be made into a movie","review":"At first the title of the book can throw you off, however, this book has an amazing and orginal story line. The way everything was weaved in from the past with the technology and spy skills of today. I enjoyed the mixed lot of suspects and how the author gives you several chances to see the charaters at their best and try to figure out who was up to what. This book is prime movie material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspense, intrigue... and steamy romance -- I love it!","review":"Although author Nora Roberts is considered a romance writer, this particular novel has suspense, intrigue, mystery . . . and hot, steamy romance. The contrast between the stiff-upper-lip, high-bred female lead and the warm, italian passion of the male lead leaves no doubt that steamy nights are ahead. Throw in high-tech thievery, art forgery, and murder and you have the perfect recipe for a \\"nail bytin'\\" good time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Hooked","review":"I am also a first time reader of Nora Roberts. My mother-in-law suggested I read this one and I just couldn't put in down. I loved Miranda and Ryan together so much so I found my stomach in knots with every turn of the page. I never knew what was going to happen. I would definitely suggest this one to any first timer to Nora Roberts, you'll be hooked. I can't wait to read my next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very dyamanic!!","review":"Ms. Roberts' Homeport is a little hard to get through at the begining but after the first few chapters, it gets much more easier to get into the plot of the book. A wonderfully long and still mysterious yet lovely story . Keep it up, Ms. Roberts. I'm a major fan of yours.Those of you who like long books will love it. (smile)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything good about this book,story and characters","review":"This is one of the best fiction stories I have ever read. It moves along quickly, there is lots of action, twists and turns to the plot. The characters are colorful. I loved the Art story-line. Miranda was just wonderful. It was full of descriptions of places and people. I thought there was just enough characters. I enjoyed it to the last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed for the first time with Nora Roberts","review":"While normally a fan of Nora Roberts, I was disappointed in the pace and the weak personality of her 'heroine' as opposed to the unrealistic persona of her 'hero. Dr Jones is given a lot of good credentials but no common sense. Ryan Boldari is given smoldering sexuality but the manners of a suave caveman. The storytelling was not up to its usual flew-through-the-pages mode. It could have been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow..........So very slow...........","review":"This book was one of the hardest books to get into and finish. I love Nora Roberts books and am always excited about reading them but this one took me forever to read and I had to force myself to finish it. The best part of the book was the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooorrring!","review":"It was so hard to get into this book. The beginning was dull, even with the attack. I havent even finished the book. I happily tossed it to the side, after trying again to read on. No luck. It's collecting dust as I type this. This was my first Nora Roberts book and I was deeply disappointed. I will stick with Barbara Delinsky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy, mysterious, elegant","review":"The romance is surprising, tender, and exciting; the story keeps you guessing until the last few pages. The drama and mystery make it seem more like a thriller than a romance novel, which make the romantic scenes even better when they show up. She is smart and independant; he is strong, clever, witty, and charming without being too rehearsed."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Artistic Adventure - Nora Does it Again!","review":"Homeport's theme is focused on the character of Dr. Miranda Jones and takes place along the coastal waters of Maine. Enter, Ryan Boldari, a very handsome, exciting and extremely creative thief. The story encompasses the world of art history and the Renaissance period creating lots of action and adventure as the world renown bronze, \\"The Dark Lady,\\" disappears disclaiming Miranda's credibility as a top-level scientist in her field. Interesting dialogue on famous artists such as Michelangelo and their works are just added touches of enjoyment as Nora takes us on an exciting murder/mystery ride with romance and intrigue all mixed into one book. I was captivated from the very first page and couldn't relax until I got to the end of the book to see how it all played out. This, in my mind, is the main ingredient to a very good read. Once again, thank you Nora."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I've been a fan of Nora Robert's for more than 10 years. Most of her books I've read multiple times, and enjoyed each re-reading. This one I read once, and barely finished it. The characters lacked the depth that one expects from Nora Roberts. She thrust them into danger and, instead of sitting on the edge of my seat in suspense, I really didn't care what happened to them. The characters in some of her early Silhouette novels have more depth and personality than what's-his-name and what's-her-name from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Long - Again","review":"Another endless book from Nora Roberts, although this one only took me two weeks to finish, instead of three months. It was ridiculous having a thief for a hero, and being an Irish-Italian person myself, I found the descriptions of the Boldari family unrealistic and insulting. I didn't find Ryan all that charming, and found the love/sex scenes sort of silly in their wording, which is my typical reaction to this author, so I skipped over most of them, not to mention that neither character seemed sexy. The only reason I'm awarding a second star is because I like the locations where the story was set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"HOMEPORT is a very interesting page-turner. It's to be recommended. It's the best thriller I've read since Craig Furnas's THE SHAPE. HOMEPORT is intelligently constructed, well-written, and I wish I had it to read again for the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Nora Roberts","review":"I love most of Nora Roberts' books. This on was no exception. Really enjoyed this book and would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun thrilling mystery involving art and sex.","review":"A strong principled but introverted heroine finds herself forced to work with a dashing, rambunctious thief in order to unravel the mysterious art thefts and forgeries surrounding her.In my opinion this is one of Roberts's best novels: no supernatural stuff, nothing too gory or dark, and what it does contain is wonderful: two very different characters who challenge one another, fabulous works of art, many mysterious crimes and lots of beautiful locales. It's romantic, very sexy and funny. Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nora's best work!","review":"\\"Homeport\\" is Nora Robert's best work to date. It has a great plot, and I love the characters. The romance is sweet and not cheesy. I've never read any book better written by Nora Roberts. It's excellent! I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Nora Roberts to date","review":"I can only say that for a long time I depended on reviews to guide me in my purchases but after reading Homeport I realised sometimes you just have to go with your own guts. If I paid attention to some I would have missed out on what is simply a delightful and entertaining novel.This book should easily grab Hollywood's attention. The plot was grabbing and for me quite unusual yet believable. I agree that discovering who the killer was and the motives was well written but the end was a bit contrived. However, all in all I consider this one of if not my favorite Nora Roberts to date. I found the sub-story of Andrew (Miranda's brother) quite interesting and wished there was more coming from them. But please if you must err.....err on the side of buying this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Homeport disappoints","review":"The title is good. The book is not! Interesting careers in crime and art mesh in this very predictable read. However, the plot is miserable and the outcome expected from page two. The book is very detailed when it comes to the sexual experiences of the characters, embarrassingly so. Too much emphasis on the unnecessary. If you have nothing else to read... this will do. Otherwise select another book. Just because it looks good, doesn't make it so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying...","review":"Overall I enjoy Nora Roberts' books -- usually I find her characters are delightful, charming -- women with well-developed \\"masculine\\" sides (i.e. strong women) and men with well-developed \\"feminine\\" sides (i.e. sensitive men) and all without wimpiness or weakness.That's not what I got here. The wimpy, defensive, somewhat hysterical and anxious \\"heroine\\" (quite unattractive and ridiculous) and an overbearing smooth operator caveman \\"hero\\" (smug, self-satisfied and full of himself). Disliked most of the other characters, too.I couldn't finish it. I tried (because it's Nora Roberts) but just couldn't stomach it, couldn't make myself go on."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very boring book.","review":"I find it interesting that so many people that have reviewed this book enjoyed it so much. I got halfway through the book and couldn't go on because nothing was happening. Nora Roberts is one of my favorite authors however I found this book very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long live the queen...Nora Roberts does it again!","review":"Just when her fans think she simply can't produce anything better than our most favorite of her previous books, the queen steps up to the plate and hits another home run with her diamond tierra! My husband groans a little when he sees me reading another Nora Roberts book. But not for long. He knows that getting my attention while my eyes are glued and glazed carries the same odds as winning \\"Megabucks\\" here in Las Vegas. But, he's a smart man. He knows that it won't be long until Nora's well crafted romance, misted with just the right amount of eau de lust, will ultimately work in his favor. They call Ms. Roberts a \\"prolific writer\\". For those of us who have read and enjoyed every one of her books, she simply can't be prolific enough to ever satisfy our imaginations. We bow at your feet, Queen Nora...long live the queen! (P.S.: Can't you write a little faster?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A GOOD SINGLE ... But Remixes are AVERAGE...","review":"I have to admit when I first heard about her new single which was released together with her ULTIMATE KYLIE x2 CD collection to date. It was so infectious and something new compared to her last album. We now see her moving into something like Pop/Techno/hip-hop together on one track. As this track is also co-written by the Scissors Sisters. This song could rush back to those late 70's and 80's club rythmn's. The remixes are okay but could've been better. BUT they are not bad at all. I think they are just filler remixes. But anyway. A good buy if your a kylie fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ravishingly simple music","review":"To be honest, I have not heard this CD; however, I saw Sequentia perform Ordo Virtutum on their last tour and was stunned. The music is absolutely beautiful. Because the music lacks a melody, the focus is on the beauty of the human (mostly soprano) voice, and Sequentia withstands this scrutiny. Although Ordo Virtutum has been touted as the first opera, and does contain some character roles, its main appeal is as pure music. Listening to this qualifies as a spiritual experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"disgusting","review":"Beautiful music as you might expect, interspersed sporadically with loud male voices that sound somewhat like hog calling.It is hard to believe that a recording company (director?) could be so stupid"},{"rating":"1","title":"Columbia keeps making these cheaper and cheaper","review":"I have always loved this pullover and used to buy this item every few years because I would literally wear them out. Now I understand why Kohls has discontinued selling this item though, because Columbia keeps making this item cheaper and cheaper. I recently bought two to replace the ones I had. They now cost more and the material is pretty much see-through (just hold it up to the light). I have previous versions of this item and you can definitely see how much cheaper they're being made. The thin fabric makes the collar look terrible and the item just sort of hangs on you. As well, a few washes pretty much destroy these \\"new\\" versions.

I do like how thin the coat is, you can layer it really well. Also if you wear it for a while without wash, it doesn't stink too much, I guess it just airs out well.

The problem I had was that I bought the Kindle version of the book and it was so poorly edited that there were typo's every couple of pages through out the book. Seems as if they were in such a rush to create a Kindle version they didn't bother to make sure it was done correctly. I can reccomend the book was worth reading but, don't buy the Kindle version."},{"rating":"2","title":"The IOI series just got really good!!!","review":"I loved the first book, wasn't too wild about the second one, but could not put this third book down. It was WONDERFUL, a great addition to the Incarnations of Immortality series. It is nice to see the big story really start to develop. I had started loosing hope on the second book (I would suggest skipping it) but am really committed to the story now that I've finished the third one.Niobe is a character and her life is a real joy to read. It is great to see how her hand in the great game that Satan has bestowed upon the Incarnations. The story never lets up and never gets boring. I can't wait to read the rest of the series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Wonderful","review":"This was the first of the Incarnations books that I read, and fell in love with the series within the first couple of chapters. I was already a Piers Anthony fan, loving the Xanth series, but this series is much more mature and has deeper plots and characters than the light Xanth books do. You feel for the characters, come to love them, and this is what happened when I began reading about Niobe and her life. Honestly, this book has changed and influenced my life in a many ways, and silly as that may sound.While this is a stand-alone novel, much like Anthony's other series books, I highly suggest reading this one begining to end--it will help with understanding some of the later books, as this is one series that is incredibly interwoven."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthwhile Read","review":"I have read a few of the \\"Christmas In My Heart\\" Books, and I find each one worthwhile. Although the stories are very sentimental, Christmas, more than any other time of year, is a sentimental season. Probably the greatest asset of this collection (and the other volumes)is the diversity of the stories. The stories range from ones that can be shared with small children (\\"Small Things\\") to ones adults would enjoy (\\"Pandora's Books\\" in this volume and \\"Meditation in a Minor Key\\" in volume 1). While most of the stories are quite old (19th century/early 20th), there are also more recent ones (\\"Matthew, Mark, Luke,and John\\" - post Korean War). Each story is deeply moving and refocuses the reader's attention from the hassle of shopping and writing cards to the true meaning of Christmas. The stories are inspirational and heart warming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stories!","review":"Listening to these stories puts me into the Christmas spirit.

They are a nice break from the hectic pace of today's world. Joe Wheeler does an excellent job of gathering and selecting the stories and the stories he writes himself are wonderful also.

Through reading Ro Wauer's book, I got a clear understanding of what a park naturalist's work entails. The work is a paradoxical blend of solo time hiking in the mountains, inventorying plant and animal species, along with leading tourists on nature walks around the campground. It was on one of the latter that the famous \\"poodle story\\" took place - more I will not say.\\"For All Seasons\\" works equally well as a preparation for a trip to Big Bend, reading while at the park, or a companion to reminisce with on return.

You know it must have been good if your mother-in-law calls you long distance to talk about these books. There was not enough information in the beginning of this book to make the formation of this group of men in any way plausable. For myself it was a little hard to believe that these characters fell in love.

Very one-dimensional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far, far too long","review":"This book has the same problem that afflicts most of Stephanie Laurens' books -- it was about a hundred pages too long. The romance plot (Plot A, if you will) just couldn't sustain itself for that long, by that point becoming just absolutely ridiculous that the heroine wouldn't marry (I mean, they've had sex just about every way and everywhere with no thought to birth control -- why NOT marry?), and she didn't have what I feel were suitably compelling reasons to keep resisting (other writers like Eloisa James can write a good \\"I love you but I can't marry you\\" reason, Laurens just really can't).Then, the mystery plot (Plot B) completely died on the table. I had no interest in it, and it just didn't have anything close to the force needed to drive the back end of the story. The book was over on page 300, but it kept going and going for another 100. Don't buy this book -- get it out of the library, and be prepared to put it down early."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long for a mediocre story","review":"I picked up this book expecting another fabulous historical from Stephanie Laurens, rich in characters and an intriguing plot. But the book was too long to support this plot, and the characters, especially the heroine, wore thin. One of Laurens' strengths as a romance writer is how well she writes the hero's journey to win over the heroine. And in this novel, the heroine's protestations are extremely weak and outcome is obvious from the beginning.The Lady Chosen certainly cannot compare with any of the Cynster novels, which have distinct characters and compelling romances. I fear the Bastion Club series is going to be 7 novels of retread ground, especially if Laurens is writing 2 per year."},{"rating":"1","title":"great concept awful awful book","review":"Who does not love the idea that a bunch of handsome, heroic ex-spies would form a club and just be manly. I know I believed these books would be great especially with all the good reviews. I forced myself through 5 of her books thinking they had to be good with those kind of reviews. Don't do it! All her books contain are love scene after love scene with bad writing, unbelievable and dull plots. I don't know why I thought this book was so bad, I was just so bored. I gave this book two stars only because I loved the idea of the Bar Cynster. For entertaining historical romance you actually enjoy reading try Julia Quinn, Judith McNaught, or Gaelen Foley and save yourself hours that feel wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!!","review":"I read a lot of book and have never felt so compelled to write a review. This book is awful. The characters have no redeeming value. There is NOTHING likable about either of them. The plot is weak and there is no chemistry between the main characters. Don't waste your time on this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Solid Story","review":"This is the first book in Stephanie Laurens new series. It is a solid book and a good introduction to the new characters. As with all of her books, it is well written and the charecter development is excellent with solid supporting charecters. However, the similarities between this heroine and Honoria in Devil's Bride are to great to be missed and got in the way of my enjoying the story. When she is done with this series, I want the story of the spymaster, which is definately foreshadowed in this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alright","review":"This is my first stephanie laurens book. Iwasn't that impressed. The story was okay somehow the events leading to the mystery were tame and when revealed was a dud... The romance was also normal. Read it if someone lends it to u or borrow from library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love SL's writing but didnt L O V E this book","review":"I am an avid reader of everything Stephanie Laurens writes, and was so hooked when I read \\"The Promise in a Kiss\\" that I went and bought all the books she had written thus far. The way her characters interact and get into interesting \\"tangles\\" always keeps me up until the early morning reading. I waited anxiously after reading the last of the cynster series for the start of this Bastion Club series, but after reading this first book I felt that I could have waited a while. It was a great read once it got started, but I put it down several times before I finally decided to just finish it. I'm still anxious to see what the rest of the series holds, but I can't say this is the BEST that Mrs. Laurens has."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lady Chosen","review":"Okay- let me be honest w/ u.... IT SUCKED. DONT READ IT. Leonora, the heroine is to submissive- she allows herself to be quieted w/ every kiss(Apparently no feminist). Usually, Stephanie Laurens is a good auther. I just didnt feel the real reason why the book was published. The story line only went on when Leonora and Tristan (the hero) decided to stop dallying w/ each other. Story line sucks; It was basically a book about sex. You couldn't turn the page without reading one more corny love scene. Another thing: The heroine inclines her damn head too much! I'm returning the book, so, If you have to, get it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this Garbage.","review":"This book was so boring and mudane I didn't even finsh it. One reveiwer mentioned how many time the heroine could incline her head haughtly. A lot apparently because I got sick of the first one hundred times. I just hated this book. I did not feel a damn thing for the main charcters, like I would a Cynster novel. I will not read another Basiton Club book again. I will stick with her Cynster novels. I believe the next one is Simon Cynster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Off to a great start!!","review":"I've always enjoyed reading Stephanie Laurens' books on weekends. Great way to relax and unwind. The beginning of this series is just as promising as the Cynsters andd I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather Boring for a Ms. Lauren's Novel....","review":"I used to think that Ms. Laurens was a brilliant romance novelist & used to buy all of her newly published books, but lately, all of her works R rather boring & uninspired, & unfortunately, this one's no exception either...."},{"rating":"1","title":"stalker","review":"I'm returning this, having read to the halfway point. The hero is a stalker, plain and simple. The book starts out in an interesting fashion, then bogs down and becomes very irritating when he thinks no doesn't mean no. Well, actually he apparently knows it means no, but that's immaterial to him, because he plans on getting what he wants regardless of the heroine's feelings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something was missing","review":"Decent writing--in terms of grammar, style, and storytelling technique. Decent plot. But something seemed missing. I felt nothing for either of the main characters. And the plot was not interesting enough to keep my interest in the story in spite of the characters. I could barely find the motivation to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!!!!","review":"I thought this book was excellent. The Lady Chosen was the first Stephanie Laurens book that I have read and I loved it! I fell in love with Tristen! I could not put the book down. I will definately buy more of her books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much better than the manual","review":"I was very dissapointed with this guide. I expected more hard numbers to play around with to help optimize ship design. There are some handy tables, but they totally neglected power usage numbers for weapons. You can get those numbers from the game by painstakingly replace each type of weapon and seeing how it affects warp power requirements. Why couldn't the guide give me these numbers? How about the formula (even a rough one) that relates max speed to impulse and total mass? How about more of an explantion for different cloak types vesus anti-cloakcomputers?I know they dumbed down SFC3 to reach a wider audience, but did they have to dumb down the strategy guide too?The manual does do a good job previewing the campaign missions though."},{"rating":"1","title":"No ideas at all","review":"The basic premise of this book is to feel good while getting rich. The only problem is that they NEVER tell you how to do this. There are no ideas. It is all fluff. They are a feel good cheerleader for nothing. Don't waste your time with this. Warren Buffet has already done the hard part. Go read about him and invest wisely. This book sounds way too much like the \\"Chicken Soup\\" books. This one would be \\"Chicken Soup for Simpletons\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very interesting & vaguely distasteful","review":"The author lost my interest fairly shortly into the program, as he started reciting the 24 (or however many) \\"ah-ha's\\" that one must remember in order to become wealthy. Even short lists of things to remember tend to be tedious if not creatively crafted and delivered, and I found this long list to be neither of those. Skipping ahead a bit, the suggested method of applying a numerical rating to your contacts (most of which are probably also your friends), and always regarding these people in accordance to how valuable they are to your bottom line, to be a bit distasteful. Then I skipped ahead to the part where everyone in a business environment could be neatly categorized into a woodland animal archetype, and I just had to stop listening. This may be a great book for some, but I got rid of my copy before finishing it, and have not regretted that move."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much substance...","review":"I was really suprised with the poor qualityof this book since I really enjoyed Robert Allen'sprevious books Mulitple Streams of Income and MulitpleStreams of Internet Income. This current edition ofcreating wealth was just a bunch of feel good psychologicalnonsense laced with some information in his previousbooks. I even noticed some information that was fromhis free reports which can be obtained at his website.Don't waste your money on this book. If you must read itcheck it out of the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to accomplish anything","review":"This book isn't just about becoming a millionaire, it brilliantly outlines basic steps to accomplish anything. It covers networking to team building and more. However, as any of these Personal Improvement books are, it takes a lot of effort from the reader to accomplish what the book says you can accomplish.It is a matter of finding what works for you through gathering knowledge. I highly recommennd this book to assist anyone in that pursuit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very happy!","review":"I never received the product.

They cancelled the order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine piece of work.","review":"I felt as if these guys took all the late night infomercials and explained how they worked and how to use these ideas to make millions. Great book. The only difference between you today and you 5 years from now are the people you associate with and the books you read.6 of us are going to take the challenge and make a million in the next 90 days."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS BOOK!!!","review":"The book is a mere rehashing of everything we've heard for the past 20 years or more about creating wealth--NOTHING NEW HERE. It has simply been repackaged by two very shrewd businessmen with EXTREMELY QUESTIONABLE ETHICS.DON'T BE TAKEN IN!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another weak project from Robert Allen","review":"This time he teams with the author of the Chicken Soup books. Does this make anything he says any more relevant? This is basically a weak attempt at giving you the psycology of a millionare with \\"ah-has\\" and \\"manifestions\\" thrown in for good measure. He also uses cliff note ideas from some of his other works. A nuts and bolts way to a million dollars? Not hardly. And there are better books out there to get you thinking and acting in a successful way. Mr Allens books aren't all bad. They are mostly bathroom reading and obvious attempts to promote his other endeavors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Meat But You Have To Search For It","review":"My hat has to go off to these two guys as theyre very successful. Bu they could have written this on half the paper. Too much hype and too little substance. There is some good stuff in here but not sure its worth searching through to get to. The format of a novel and a how to book in the same book is interesting but it was far too predictable for me. Lets go for less hype and some straight forward advice rather than a new method for these two to make a million."},{"rating":"1","title":"a complete fraud and waste of your hard earned money","review":"I can't believe the positive things people are saying about this absolute waste of paper! Its hysterical, the authors start out saying this is not one of those books that tell you in order to get rich you have to think rich, and then the entire book is exactly that! There is absolutely nothing in this book that gives any specifics on how to earn money, just generalizations and plugs for how successful the authors are by getting honest people to believe them. Any 5 yr old could have written this book. Normally I would give a book away to the local library or something if I didn't like it but I would be ashamed to give this book to anyone even a stranger. I can't imagine how these authors can look themselves in the mirror everyday without getting sick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Gibberish","review":"This book has almost no substance and is completely based in fantasy. It reads like a sermon at a really bad church for the A.D.D. The author wants to sell you his products to make himself a millionaire. I highly question the positive reviews written here because they basically quote the book word for word. I suspect they are planted to get you to buy the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read for changing your life for the better!","review":"This is a great book. It is very similar in style to the wonderful 'Serendipity's Secret' in that the learning points are woven around a heartwarming story.The story itself is easy to follow and inspiring with great practical tips for not just making money but for improving your life in many other ways. The only thing I would change is to have the practical teaching element at the end of the book, rather than placed alongside the story. Other than that, highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointing","review":"Sorry, but this book was terrible. I had bought it by mistake because its title was so similar to a book I was looking for (Bach's \\"The Automatic Millionaire,\\" a much more useful book). Seriously, their great \\"ideas\\" about how to make money are: buy real estate with Other People's Money! Invent something everyone wants and sell millions of it! Seriously??? Like I would need a book to tell me that?? If I could do either of those things I'd already be rich and wouldn't need the book. For most people, these ideas are unrealistic and unworkable.They have this very naive notion that all you have to do is hang around with some rich people, and they will be happy to teach you all their secrets and lend you money to fund your dreams. Yeah...sure.Completely useless book; waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not prepared as an ebook","review":"This book has two stories writen at the same time. In the original pbook format one story was written in left pages and the other in the right pages. But this is all lost in the Kindle and its very complicated to follow the story.

It's unique and so different from any other book I've read because on one side of the book is an excellent story that keeps you so involved that you can't put the book down. I actually stayed up all night reading it. The second side of the book, gives a more technical and detailed, easy to follow outline on how to become an enlightened millionaire. Both sides relate.

Not one of the suggestions would work period. Flipping homes sure that works just not the way he says.

The non-fiction hints and tips are on all the left pages and a fiction novel is on all the right pages. I would have prefered the book be divided into 2 normally formatted sections.The books content is surprisingly full of empty rhetoric. The fiction novel section just seemed to pander to the reader and insult my intelligence in too much of a 'touchy-feely' style, the non fiction section was quite lacking in real workable solutions. It mainly delved into psychological and religious pep talks, even quoting the bible on a few occaisions.I'm basing my rating on the fact that this book is a lowest common denominator type book in that it assumes a low level of intelligence for the readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Personal Development","review":"adhealthandwellness recommended this as one of the books that was essential for my personal development when I began my quest for personal improvement in network marketing.

Contrary to what some of the reviewers say, there is no substance. I mean, you be the judge and see if you can get anything from this: desire + belief + action = success. If you are looking for an inspirational read, this could work. But there are no specific ways on how to become rich. The substance portion comes in in the chapter on real estate since that is what Allen is known for but those techniques are old school.

They are getting richer, while money is paid for their goods, and the would-be millionaires are led down one more \\"garden path to riches.\\" It still takes money to make money--unless you have a fantiastic backer and benefactor.

I have many tapes from Hansen that were promoted by SMI many years ago. And I have read some of Robert Allens books, most notably Multiple Streams of Income, Nothing Down and Creating Wealth.I'm in network marketing and am h appy to see prominent people like Robert Allen, Mark Victor Hansen, Robert Kiyosaki, Brian Tracy and others promoting this concept of wealth creation.As everybody knows by now, The 1 Minute Millionaire is both fictional and non fictional. The fictional part is a story about a mother who must create income quickly. The non fiction part showcases Hansen's and Allen's most famous strategies. As a result this book is both inspiring and educational.I recommend The 1 Minute Millionaire for anyone. It can change your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful Guide","review":"I was given a copy of this book as a gift and found it really inspirational. To me, the greatest strength of the book is the motivational aspect - the authors do not only give money-making ideas and techniques but they also encourage positive thinking. To me that is the most important ingredient in the journey to being a millionaire. We just have to believe we can do it. The only thing about the book that threw me off a bit was the way it was structured with a fictional story on one side and the fact-based information on the other. Maybe it was just me but I would have preferred all the fact-based information first and then the story after. Overall, though, I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its just ....ok","review":"The first \\"Cruel Intentions\\" was highly underrated. There was a strong chemistry within the cast (obviously since Reese & Ryan married!) and the characters weren't one dimensional. Even evil Kathryn was capable of pain that Sarah Michelle Gellar managed to convey in brief moments which was perfect for that character. But Cassidy for CI3 falls way short of being three dimensional. She's just cruel for the whole film and showed no weakness. Everyone has a weakness. However, I will say that the character Patrick somewhat intrigued me. He went beyond the game of cruelty and ...well, I won't give away what happens, but I was very disturbed by it. As for Kerr, he was alright. Its not his fault his character was kind of dull. Anyway, the film is \\"ok\\". Its worth watching if you run into it on cable, but I wouldn't buy the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising. . .","review":"I bought this only because i loved the first one, hoping it wasn't as terrible as the second. After i watched it i was so impressed. First of all i loved that it really didn't have anything to do with the first, aside from Cassidy being Katherine's cousin,and sharing the same last name (there is only one reference to Katherine and Sebastian in the beginning). It is much better than having different actors playing old characters, which drags a movie down alot. I thought the story was great, with good twists.The whole cast is very attractive, which can't hurt either. The \\"bad\\" characters are all pretty likeable, aside from one, and all is well in the end. The best thing about this movie is the character Cassidy. I sarted out hating her, and ended up really liking her for her realness, and honesty she does not try to hide that she is a b*tch. This actress does a particularly good job, pulling off both loveable, and complete brat at the same time. I would definetly reccomend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"It keeps up with what's expected...","review":"When compared to the second movie I would have to say that this one is better. The movie certainly brings the 'game' to a whole new level.I do wish that the movie could have been a bit longer than about an hour and a half and there were a few places that were unfinished. But the full circle was enough for me to want another movie.For those who do not know much about the Cruel Intentions movies, this is the story line order: Cruel Intentions 2, Cruel Intentions, then Cruel Intentions 3. I would recomend that you watch them in the original order but keep in mind that the second movie takes place before the first one and helps explain why some of the people act the way they do."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst intentions of all!!!","review":"First put, this movie has nothing to do with cruel intentions. It is a disgrace to its name and to be associated with it.The only relevance is the mentioning of the 2 main characters from the last 2 films relating to the main female character. That's it!!! What a shame!The first movie was the BEST!!! The second...well, it was a pretty decent prequel, thought production value was like a grade-B movie.This third has a better presentation than the second, but the storyline sucks so bad!!!

Oh, and I like horror movies an awful lot.This book is a delight. Some chapter titles (\\"Dracula and Other Vampires\\") are obvious but necessary; others (\\"Screams of Laughter,\\" \\"Deadlier Than the Male\\") are quirkier and more inspired. If, like me, you saw most of these films as a kid, The Amazing Colossal Book is a great refresher course. If you haven't seen the films, this book should whet your appetite, as the photos alone are worth the price of admission.Why isn't it in bookstores everywhere, or piled all over convention tables everywhere?

It felt a good deal like reviewing for a 5th grade geography test.Thousands of facts are available, but many are perfectly useless and utterly dull, so why devote a book to them?

It's reasonable to have great expectations for Mr. Altman and I eagerly await more books from him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Manages to convey suspense even though ending is \\"known\\"","review":"John Altman's first novel, \\"A Gathering of Spies\\" is a convincing debut. He uses ideas that have been used many times before: the \\"atomic secret\\" at Los Almos; the secret of the point of landing for D-Day; a long hidden and extremely well training (and feminine) mole; and historical facts such as Einstein's letter to Roosevelt. This book is different because his craft so well. It is a thriller that thrills; one of the protagonists (Katarina) does the incredible, but we believe it. An aspect of this novel that I truly like is that Altman protrays a character who does horrible things, but, oddly, I come to somehow like her and hope, against all hope, that things work out well for her in the end. But I shall not divulge the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor at best","review":"This is the first review I've felt compelled to write. This book is awful.

The nazis are able to get a female agent on the inside of the building of the atomic bomb.The agent marries one the the developers of the atomic bomb. Through spy tactics she learns what is really going on in Los Alamos. She is pursued by another American agent whose wife is ina prisoner of war camp.The race for her to deliver the information to Nazi Germany is nonstop and exciting.

The ending is also good."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll never believe Jack Higgins again!","review":"Noted author Jack Higgins must have been blackmailed to have written a glowing tribute to this new author. Higgins raves ( \\"If there are thriller writers better than this, I'd like to know who they are. John Altman is a major new talent on the scene\\")With such a tribute on the attractive dust jacket, how could I resist it. Thankfully, it cost me nothing, having taken it from the library. Readers of thrillers, spy and otherwise, are pretty understanding when it comes to far fetched stories. But this one takes ridiculous to a new level. The nazi woman spy kills 8 trained british agents lying in wait for her, virtually with her bare hands. And that's only the beginning. Stupid becomes outrageous and segues into the absolutely absurd. I'm a good sport but Higgins....DON'T DO THIS AGAIN! As for the 30 year old first time author/musician, don't give up your day job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrrring !!","review":"This book just arrived at our libray & I am the first to read it. How Stephen Coonts, Jack Higgins & Ronald Kessler could give this book a rave review is beyond me. I suspect that there is an 'Old Boy Network' in publishing as well as anywhere else. John Altman is a musician, perhaps he should write about that since he knows next to nothing about spy novels! It may be that I am being too harsh in my criticism; mayhap his next novel will be better.

I feel the plot was very predictable and I had a hard time working my way through it. The last hundred pages started to get interesting, however, it ended much to suddenly. You build and build and build, then end it that suddenly. I would have liked it to continue for another 100 pages, a lot more could and should of been said. I will, however, read his next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fast Read But Lacks Credibility","review":"John Altman's debut novel, A Gathering Of Spies, is a WWII spy thriller that provides a fast read and lots of action. Unfortunately, I can't give this book more than just a \\"fair\\" rating (i.e. 2 stars) for two reasons. One reason is that Altman's characters lack sufficient depth for me to care about any of them. The second reason is that while the plot takes many twists and turns, many of them lack credibility and are too predictable. I think Altman has the potential to be a future bestselling author and a writer of well-written books. However,unlike some other reviewers, in my opinion, this particular work does not deserve for Altman to be compared to some of today's better spy thriller authors. Maybe he'll be deserving of this comparison in the future, but not now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stole the plot from Le Carre","review":"Are you kidding me with this book? In the course of the first few chapters I caught on immediately. The plot and construct of the main character are largely stolen from John LeCarre's \\"The Spy who came in from the Cold.\\"Same deal: an aging protagonist, inserted into an espionage plot so deeply under cover, with loyalites to his country and the woman he loves so conflicted that we, the readers, are left to wonder which way he will turn.Here's what's very telling. Altman gets glowing reviews on the book jacket form other spy writers. But if you read his bio, Altman's only credentials are that he comes from a family of writers.Thhe bio also promises that Altman is busy on his second book. I can hardly wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrrrrring !!","review":"This book just arrived in our local library & I am the first person to read it. How such authors as Stephen Coonts, Jack Higgins & Ronald Kessler could give this author a rave review is beyond me. It must be a requirement of the publihing world that there has to be an 'Old Boy Network' in writing as well as everything else. Altman is a musician, perhaps he should write about that since he knows next to nothing about spy novels! I know I am being harsh; maybe his next book will be better but \\"A Gathering of Spies\\" as a first effort is pretty poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've seen this idea handled MUCH better","review":"This appears to be an attempt to take off on Daniel Silva's \\"An Unlikely Spy\\", which was a REAL thriller. Many of Altman's repeated phrases ( e.g., \\"between the fourth and fifth ribs\\" ) quickly became boring. I suspect that anyone who thinks this is \\"a exciting first novel\\" ( &c. ) hasn't read Silva's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth The Read!","review":"I'm a Ken Follett fan, and I loved this book as well.

Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome plane read","review":"I'm scared to death of flying... bought this in the airport at JFK and made it back home through an hour of turbulence without once looking up. Katrina makes La Femme Nikita look like the Avon lady, and the final showdown ROCKED. Altman might have restored my faith in spy novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Summer Read!","review":"I took several books on vacation and this novel was by far the best. It's fast paced, very well written, with lots of historical details and plenty of action. Those few people who appear not to like this book got too caught up in questions like: \\"Could a woman really take out all those men?\\" That's not the point. This is very enjoyable fiction - don't read more into it than that and you'll be entertained from the first page to the last, and eager to read Altman's sequel. Keep 'em coming!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Non Stop Action!!","review":"What a great read this book is. It's a classic World War II spy yarn with some interesting and unexpected twists. The action is virtually non-stop, and the dialogue and plotting are intriguing. I hope never to meet Katarina Heinrich on a dark corner. Anyone who likes this genre is sure to love this book. Can't wait for the sequel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair ar best","review":"This novel is a dubious debut. Questionable at best. Look, I realise it's a first novel, but please...Skip this one and read The Unlikely Spy. Now there's a spy thriller! And you can bet the farm that Mr. Altman himself has read it--repeatedly. I mean even his Nazi female spy and Mr. Silva's (The Unlikely Spy) share the same first name: Catherine. Couldn't think of another name? Hey, wasn't Silva's Chatherine's father being held at a concentration camp as leverage as well? Hum? The dust jacket says Mr. Altman comes from a long line of writers. Obviously, one of them pulled some strings for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable.","review":"This book gives a new meaning to the term \\"page turner\\" -- I couldn't wait to finish it (mainly because I have an obsessive/compulsive habit of finishing any book I start, even if I have to skim the remaining 90%)! The plot is good, but the writing is sophomoric, and the characters are cartoonish. It reads like a proposed film script. Bubble and Squeak indeed! The book would have benefited from an historical epilogue detailing what eventually happened to Canaris, as well as to the real German spies that were turned by the Brits, such as Garbo. I don't think Le Carre, Micheal Frayn, Charles McCarry, or even Ken Follett or Daniel Silva have much to fear from Mr. Altman."},{"rating":"1","title":"A GATHERING OF SPIES doesn't cut it","review":"Do not open this book unless you are terminally desperate for reading material. Aside from the many factual errors -- likely the result of skimpy research by the author and/or the lack of the publisher's fact-checking -- this title is basically a pot-boiler featuring stereotypical, one-dimensional Nazi bad guys, rather improbable plotting, and a good deal of just plain silly dialogue. While the author seems to have tried his best, one hopes his second novel, now in the works (according to the dust jacket) will prove to be a more mature labor."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Gathering of Spies","review":"The book did not go into main details! It woould jump around, one chapter you are in Germany in 1943, and the next chapter may be in Prussia, 1944!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Reading -- Boring","review":"The plot and characters were thinly developed; the scenarios were historically inaccurate; and the writing was laborious. I struggeled to get through this one -- hoping that something would happen to make the plot more interesting. Alas, the story ends abruptly and oddly.

I highly recommend this seller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps answer the question of life balance, which is a question worth answering","review":"The phrase \\"life balance\\" is a hodge-podge, catchall phrase that's usually sprinkled into gripe sessions about work over cocktails. But what does \\"life balance\\" really mean? The book - \\"Life Matters\\" - not only does an excellent job defining this important component of life, but it expresses the idea that lack of balance is fundamentally a misalignment of the principles that are important to each individual. Soundview recommends this book because it challenges the reader to take an introspective assessment of what matters most and how to structure a productive existence that's holistically consistent with each life facet. The authors write that this self evaluation enables you to forge your own navigational intelligence geared towards optimal living."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fresh Approach to Life Integration!","review":"I enjoyed the fresh, pragmatic approach to applying common sense. Although familiar with many of the stories and examples from similar works, the Merrill's provide useful up-to-date examples for aligning important areas of life: Work, Family, Time, & Money. Each section helps the reader identify what's in it for them along with the author's personal experience relating how they have incoporated their own ideas.

I looked around for the other cat and noticed clumps of cat hair all over the house.I started to panic and was preparing to bath the cats, when one cat began violently throwing up in the middle of living room.I thoroughly washed both cats, and they seem to have calmed a bit.

However, the songs are too much overdubbed and some sound like somebody (else) making a solo. Worsestill, the packaging is most disappointing, like a counterfeit product --- there's no booklet, no lyrics, not a single sheet of liner notes, not any recording or production dates... which is quite unusual for a regular multi-CD set from Warner Music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great setting, poor author","review":"The book had an intriguing premise -- behind-the-scenes chicanery at two large NYC museums -- but the author's writing does not do it justice. The lead character was bland, the red herrings not even heart-felt, the loose ends plentiful, the dialogue weak, and the characters poorly drawn. In page after page of unattributed dialog -- where were the editors? -- no clear sense of character emerged that would have me, as reader, link lines to a particular character. The museum setting is a rich opportunity for a better writer. Of three people reading this book, two of us would not return to this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could it be any more Boring","review":"While, after five books, there is finally the potential of a relationship between Alex \\"Blondie\\" Cooper and Detective Mike, this book was sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo boring!

I live in NYC and visit the museums frequently but this just did not hold my interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"History meets psychological thriller","review":"This is,a great read. If you are I interested in history and ancient artifacts and like a good thriller this is it. It held my interest from the first chapter and I enjoyed it almost as much as a Jonathan Kellerman . The location of the murder investigation is the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Natural History Museum. The body is found in a Sarcophagus at the port in New Jersey and the hunt for the killer begins. I will definetly read more Fairstein in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bone Vault, Linda Fairstein","review":"This book is amazing. Fast moving and extremely interesting. Not only do you get a good mystery but you also have a history lesson about the MET, Museum of Natural History and the underground of NYC. The story is a cliff hanger style of writing and keeps you hanging on the next work. I will read a lot more of Linda Fairstein's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Really Wanted To Like This Book!","review":"Beacause I have read her previous books,I know Ms. Fairstein is certainly capable of producing an interesting story, but this is not example of her best effort.

Hopefully, someone else will find it worth finishing."},{"rating":"1","title":"who's talking?","review":"Not impressed. Ending kind of anti-climactic. Dialogue cumbersome, but the most frustrating was half the time I couldn't tell who was speaking. Paragraph after paragraph of exchanges, with no indication of who is speaking. Not ultimately important in the plot, but distracting and frustrating. Poor writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deadly","review":"As in deadly dull. One of the tragedies of writing a novel with the television mini-series in mind is that you forget that you should try to use all of the usual writer's device of keeping your reader's attention. Things like interesting characters, believable, quick moving plots and dialogue. This was painful to read, a shame for something that's suppose to be a mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed it!","review":"I really liked the mix of mystery and the knowledge they also give you about the museum system on NYC. Very entertaining, quick read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I read the same book?","review":"I lasted only one-third the way through this boring book. It has pages and pages of irrelevant dull dialog and detailed descriptions of what clothes the women wear. The part I read contained no sex, no violence, and no graphic murder. The plot is so farfetched and improbable that it is totally incredible. I loved Prey, The Last Jihad, and Dead Aim, but The Bone Vault is a book I could and did put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoped for better","review":"This could have been great but author resorted to padding using stuff that wasn't in any way relevant: 9/11, Martha's Vinyard, etc. I'll be honest. I'm halfway through and thinking of quitting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull & Boring !","review":"I've read all of Ms. Fairstein's novels, and this is the most disappointing. The details of museum history as well as the travels through each and every room, vault, et al, failed to pique my interest. The best part is the interfacing among Alex, Mike and Mercer, however, this failed to raise this novel to a level where I would recommend. Ms. Fairstein has done much better in the past, but this exploration of the museum and bones as well as the convoluted plot which brought this novel to fruition was just not believable to me.Better luck next time, Linda!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Boring Vault","review":"I can only think the \\"Bone Vault\\" ploy and the museum location were contrived to build on the success of \\"Relic\\". The bone vault plays almost no role in the novel. The characters are so underdeveloped I had to reread references to the killer at the beginning of the story to refresh my memory. The killer had no personality in my mind. This book is a chore to read. There were times the main characters were having conversations about such nothingness I was conviced there was a page total the publisher insisted Fairstein reach. With novelists like M.

This book does not tell the cons of owing a dog of this size and stature. I never saw the word \\"drool\\" mentioned nor the potential weights of any of these dogs. Also, in my opinion, the author is very biased when it comes to dog food manufacturers. He states that many owners think they know more about nutrition than the dog food producers. In many cases, owners do know more. He doesn't say much about the positive affects of a raw diet and supplements for giant breed and how most commercial dog foods are not geered to the growth of a giant breed. He really doesn't get into the genetic disorders that plague most giant breeds but gives a group of common disorders that affect all breeds.

Jane Austen may not be over-represented, for example, but John Wyndham certainly is. What about Xavier Herbert? Samuel Delaney? More from P G Wodehouse? This selection truly is only half-right."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Goodward?\\"","review":"Some errors or omissions can always be conveniently ignored or blown-off without a second thought. Unfortunately for 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die the mistake contained in its pages is too egregious to go unmentioned, and having not read the entire book, casts a cloud over every profile discussed therein.In 1001BYMYD's write-up for what is perhaps the greatest novel of the 19th Century, James' Portrait of a Lady, it inexplicably misspells or perhaps the author of 1001BYMD is stunningly unaware of the actual name of a seminal character in the history of literature: Caspar Goodwood is referred to as Goodward!One marvels at how an error of this magnitude could slip by the author, proof-reader, editor and publisher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this fun book--at bargain price","review":"Great condition, as promised, and speedy delivery.

Out of 1001 books, I found 12 books that I haven't read that I would like to read. It looks like the authors ran out of gas early so they loaded up the book with filler. I can't believe that I need to read 6 books by Jane Austen since they are all very similar. Nor do I need to read 8 books by J.G. Ballard, 7 by John Banville, 10 by Samuel Beckett or 7 by Saul Bellow. And I am just up to the letter \`B'. There is even a james Bond novel in there. I think you get the idea. Save your money.

My first thought after reading the first book suggestion was \\"why should I read this particular book?\\". The short summaries included do not tell you what is so great about the book.

The book has some interesting elements (including the villain's unusual neck) and the author generates some moderately exciting action, but this book pales in comparison to Patrick O'Brien's Maturin/Aubrey series.Better to reread the O'Brien books a third or fourth time, than to read this once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle Edition editing the only drawback","review":"My one complaint isn't with the authorship, it's with the editing job on the Kindle Edition of Sharpe's Enemy.

Anyone who is a fan already, has all of these songs and they sounded ten times better in a studio than they do onstage. If you haven't been a Chicks fan before, this one certainly won't convert you. Save the cash for their next album. Maybe it will be worth buying. This one is a stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and disappointing","review":"I have all of these songs on my other Dixie Chicks CDs. I realize that this CD is songs performed on the concert tour, but I was hoping for at least a new song or two--or if not that--I was hoping that at least there would be some remixing so that there would be a little bit of novelty to the CD. I was disappointed because it really is nothing that I haven't heard over and over and over before---sorry that I spent the $$$. Hey--are any of these going to be released to the radio as a single? I imagine not--since there is nothing new here? So--I guess it is just a way to milk more money out of the fans.Note to chicks: next time give the fans more value for their money--ie new songs, or new arrangements, or re-mixing--why should we spend our money on the same old thing? Doubt this one will sell millions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"This album along with the talent of this band is completely overrated. They have successfully tried to politicize their views giving them much needed attention. Now back to the music. Album recording is poor, singing is like listening to Nurse Ratchet.

There is your fair and balanced review."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Voice that doesn't hold up","review":"Maines voice doesn't carry well in live venues. Without studio magic, Maines' voice sounds nasally and unimpressive. It's clear she doesn't have the pipes of a Martina McBride or a Tricia Yearwood.This offering lacks the spunk that the band has marketed itself with in the past. All in all, it's not like Johnny at San Quentin or Garth live.This CD shows the limits of hype. The Chicks, not to be confused with real songwriters, give lackluster performances live. This collection shows that the songs aren't their own. It might as well be a demo album with stock cheering added.Hype suggested that the Chicks had crafted a career that would last for decades. This collection does much to refute the early promise.Who knows?

The Chicks deliver in a big way in both venues.For those of you who don't have all their other CD's this would be a great way to get the \\"best\\" all on one CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great live album!!!","review":"All of the Chicks greatest music on one cd....cannot get much better than that...and it's LIVE too!!! I've seen the Dixie Chicks live twice since 2000 and they are fantastic! So glad they released this cd to remember the TOTW tour!!!I wish there was a 10 star rating..because this one, along with the other Dixie Chicks cd's are top notch!!!!A side note to redtunictroll:I had the pleasure of seeing the Dixie Chicks live after \\"the incident\\" in June of 2003....let me tell you that Natalie, Martie and Emily never said ANYTHING offensive. The only thing Natalie said that was even close to anything involving the whole fiasco was that having the right to vote is one of the GREATEST priveledges that the American people can have. They kept their focus on the MUSIC....unlike a certain other country artist that couldn't help but poke fun at Natalie by showing doctored photos of her with Saddam as well as a dog relieving itself on a picture of the Dixie Chicks. Now THAT is tasteless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty monotonous to a newcomer","review":"Having never heard any Dixie Chicks music, and after reading several glowing reviews, I spent the $13 to buy this set. I am a huge Alison Krauss fan, and a moderate country music fan in general, so I was curious. I was completely disappointed. Speaking as a total newcomer, these cds are pretty monotonous and boring. Virtually all of the vocals are shouted/screamed out, there is no modulation, no \\"quiet\\" moments, and it all sounds like the same song, just periodically broken up by a few seconds of what sounds like canned audience screaming. The backup band is bland, all blending into one. After a while, it seems like that scene in the film Groundhog Day, where Bill Murry wakes up to the same song every day. This is simply a display of mediocre talent. For real talent and virtuosity, pick up the new live album from Alison Krauss and Union Station."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality","review":"The CDs arrived here very quickly and were in great shape.

The constant hairstyle and clothing changes from the respective concerts are more disruptive than anything. It takes away from the music because you are constantly distracted by the editing. It's done in a \\"music video\\" style and NOT as you would expect to see from a concert. It makes you wonder about the audio tracking. The audio track is seemless, too seemless as this is a compilation of numerous concerts. \\"Is it real or Memorex?\\" Save your money on this one and buy the \\"Evening With The Dixie Chicks\\".

This CD proves the point. They sound great and nearly all their best works are included. Great show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dixie Chicks On Top of the World","review":"I don't care what anyone says, but the Dixie Chicks rock. And it will be sad if we let their beliefs (or anyone's beliefs) from preventing them from greatest. After saying that, let me just say that this is one of the best live album I have ever heard. A collection of their biggest hits from their previous 3 albums, this cd shines BRIGHTLY. Not only do these girls ROCK, but you can hear the passion in their voices and the way they play. You can feel the energy of the fans and it really inspires you. This double cd makes you feel like you are at an actual show. Also there are great pics that goes along with this release. I almost missed this cd, because they are not promoting it. Most people don't even know about it. But don't let that prevent you from buying this cd. Can't wait for a new album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talented but can't listen any longer!","review":"How could anyone say the Dixie Chicks have no talent? They clearly have a unique sound in country music. My problem is I can't listen to them any longer without cringing. Natalie Maines comments regarding our Commander in Chief just keep ringing thru my ears. She said she feels \\"vindicated\\" on her opposition of going to war in Iraq. On a day like today, when that tyrant who murdered hundreds of thousands of people is captured, her lack of compassion for the Iraqi People makes me sick. So......there are good songs on this cd, but it is not selling real well, is it! I just can't listen any longer. Get the new Johnny Cash or Toby Keith cd, they're great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CHICKS Are Not Country","review":"By there own admission the Chicks turned their back on country music (Joining Leanne Rimes, Faith Hill, SheDaisy, Shania Twain and Deanna Carter in that failed endevour). Wide Open Spaces was a great CD, but their music and politics have went down ever since. They all copy Shelby Lynne and the ALT country movement, or think they are Brittney Spears. If you want country please try Sherrie Austin, Gretchen Wilson, or male singers such as George Strait, Toby Keith, or Alan Jackson. I would not put one red cent in the Chicks purses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti- Americans","review":"Don't Buy they are anti american and do not support our troops who give them the freedom of living in the USA"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Girl Group Ever","review":"Girl groups better than The Dixie Chicks:1.

If you're one of those fairweather fans you turned your back with all the controversy, maybe you should give them another shot. This album has all the stuff you'd want and it's a fun listen. You will want to pick up the companion DVD as well, it's a few songs shorter, but you get to see the Chicks in action (very well shot by the way) and you get to see their very cool new video for \\"Top Of The World\\".

It is almost too easily-digestible, but if one needs a fast-reading primer (as opposed to wading through \\"rise-and-fall-of-the-third-reich\\" type books), it could serve. It is a non-biography in the sense that you're looking at Goering from 3 miles away instead of 1 foot away -- i.e., you don't really come to know the man intimately.

They have a bigger problem or plot, unlike in kindergarten. This one has a lesson to it. And it shows that even though things can be bad, but then get better, problems and \\"shipwrecks\\" can happen. Then, you gotta think fast to help fix them, or disaster can strike. What was confusing about the book was that it just ended. Just ended. It never said what the class thought about Junie B.'s \\"I'm Sorry\\" note. I don't know if they forgave her or not. I wish it did. It would make it longer. Plus, I got a bit annoyed at her when she wanted to be the STAR. Being the star doesn't mean you'll be famous or the center of attention.

The story is absolutely adorable but I found myself \\"editing\\" some words out of the story (ie. \\"stupid\\") and explaining some plots in the story to my daughter so she'd understand that are not always the right thing to do or say to another kid. It's (the series) definitely a parent/child involvement which, to me, is a great basis for communication and learning establishment between parents and children. My daughter was enchanted to have something to relate to and understand and her interest in bedtime reading has now progressed to replacing some of her favorite cartoons during the day to have mom read a chapter to her.

Yet Columbus didn't swim to the U.S., but the Junie B's class \\"changed history\\". I'm twelve and it confused me why Junie B took the blame, and seemed to make herself look good to do that and wanted people to thank her from taking the blame to make her look good.

The repeated use of spelling and grammar errors was too much for me but my daugther seems to like these books than the other much better ones I bought (magic tree house). Anyway when I read to her I make sure I read MTH :-).Apart from the grammar issues this particular book has a very glaring factual error.

I swapped it out for the same model. After about 25 shots the pump would no longer pump. I never pumped it over 8 pumps and most of the shots only did 3 pumps. The manual suggests less than 10. I tried oiling it with a few drops of oil, but it still wouldn't hold air. The bolt isn't smooth and feels like it's about to break off when you pull it back to cock it. The scope is flimsy and slides out of it's mounted position. The accuracy grouping is poor. I stabilized the rifle with sandbags and used the scope to aim. Even at 25 feet it had 3-4 inches of drift in the grouping. In summary, two out of two of this rifle has been of very poor quality. One jammed after the first shot and the other failed after about 25 shots. I finally just ended up purchasing some shotshells for my .22 rifle and returned the Airmaster 77."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken out of the box","review":"Brand new out of the box, it won't pump up so I can't vouch for accuracy or power. The pumping arm has no resistance at all and it looks like the slide isn't actually attached to anything. I guess that explains why so many websites are selling a refurbished version of this pellet gun. The trigger has a somewhat long and stiff pull, which I imagine would loosen up after some use. Overall it feels solid despite the heavy use of plastic. The stock sights seem reasonable but the included scope is worse than the $11 Walmart special. If I were going to keep this I would probably upgrade the scope. Otherwise this looks like a decent starter gun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed Faulty out of the box","review":"I should have believed other reviewers.. this product is low quality ... brand new out of sealed box and would not pump up and develop pressure to shoot.

Although it carries the Remington name, I realize that it is made by Crosman. It feels much sturdier than most of the comparable bb/pellet guns that I have used. Everything feels solid and the accuracy is excellent. I have read questionable reviews about the scope, but I have not tried it. I bought this gun specifically for open sight shooting in the yard and woods. I would recommend this over the slightly cheaper Crosman or Daisy bb guns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pellet rifle","review":"As others have said, you probably don't want to shoot BBs out of this thing as it may damage the barrel. Others have also said that this scope is not the greatest and they're correct but with a gun with a muzzle velocity of 755 fps how good of a scope do you really need?I've shot about 350 pellets at this point and this gun is accurate (after adjusting fixed sights) and powerful.

Extremly accurate with a little adjustment on the scope which the manual explains perfectly clear. The only set back is that with most air guns, sometimes it jams, but not often at all and can usually be avoided by not rushing the load. It is however, just as powerful as described. I still have a pellet stuck in my oil drum.:) Exelent buy and highly recomended especially for beginners!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Value, If It Continues to Work","review":"Once I got the sights adjusted, accuracy and repeatibility of aim seem better than my ability to hold the rifle steady. Construction seems solid. However, plastic gun stock is much too light affecting the overall feel and balance. Noise of discharge is much less than what I expected given the other reviews. Scope is made of relatively cheap materials but it seems to do the job. As mentioned in other reviews, getting the pellets in right can be a bit tricky. If it doesn't go in the right way, just dump it out and try again. For the price, I've no complaints.Update - Two weeks after using this product, it jammed on a pellet and there didn't seem to be any way of freeing it. Wound up throwing the gun away rather than incur all the time and expense it would have entailed to fix it."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a piece of crap","review":"Remington should be ashamed for marketing this junk. I bought one and right out of the box it wouldn't pump up; the plunger had disconnected itself from the ram. I took it back got another, it work fine for about 25 shots and the same problem occurred. The only reason I gave it 1 star is so that this email site didn't think I forgot to rate it, and there is a possibility to sell this thing for parts if I find another misfortunate who was duped by the Remington name on it. Very disappointed and I refuse to buy anything labeled REMINGTON in the future because we all know how the \\"screw me once, shame on you ........\\" saying goes. Now figuring Remington's questionable reputation, I realize this thing was probably crapped out of China so Remington could make tons of money screwing the Americans; very disgusting business practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor QA and poor Amazon customer service","review":"Son opened this Christmas gift only to find that it would not fire.

Most of the time their players don't know when to stop their tingling.Well happily, on this CD Cal Tjader isn't half as intrusive as Milt Jackson usually is.

Greenfield series and was disappointed to find that ones I couldn't get at the library are out of print. But \\"Exiles on Main Street,\\" by Lisa Kleinholz, is more than a worthy successor. Ms. Kleinholz's heroine is quirkier and more believable, and the variety of people she deals with are more relevant, than those in the earlier books, which were also set in New England. I think her book will also appeal to mystery readers who are in their early 30s (most female sleuths these days seem to be somewhat older, which I, at my advanced age, happen to like, even though I liked this one for her off-beat view of life).

As she investigates she begins to find out information that immerses her in the dangerous world of the Khmer Rouge and the deadly secrets that members of the Cambodian community have tried to forget.

Take a Look in the Mirror does exactly just that, but the fact of the matter is that Korn is just looking at an Michael Jackson-like face and saying that he can still sing \\"Thriller.\\" It can't be done, so just keep purchasing the first 3 albums and wait for a Greatest Hits CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow......","review":"when a band normally says there getting back to their roots its normally a lie, korn however did a good job at it. this is by far their best cd yet! its got everything old korn cds did, heavy vocals, heavy bass and g-tar and it has kick ass drums. this cd is perfect....my only problem is that they put \\"one\\" on there like 8 mins. after the last song...thats alittle annoying. but any ways you should definitly check this cd out. and dont listen to that dumb ass that just put down HAHAHAHA as his review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah...","review":"Korn sucks.

When I listened to Korn on the radio, all I heard was repetitive chord structures and excessively downtuned guitars. In my opinion, Korn is an overrated band, but as I connect better with Opeth's emotion and melody, my musical views are likely different than yours.

I've heard alot of bashing on this cd, but it's one of the best new cd's this past year. Did My Time is excellent...the live version of One is nice, although it would sound better in the studio. Y'all want a single is a great song too. Right Now is ok. Break some off, is a good song as well. The rest of the songs are decent, although i haven't quite warmed up to them yet (which i'm sure i will with a few more listens). It's not the best Korn cd by far, however. The self titled cd, Untouchables, and Follow the Leader are the top 3...but this is 4th. I love korn more than any band, but if you're not a big korn fan, you may not like it very much, which is fine because I hate seeing wannabe fans at concerts who only know the songs that mtv plays.

The guitar playing wasn't impressive and most of the songs sounded the same. Why did I give it two stars? Because there were only two or three songs that I liked and the rest were like listening to the same song over and over again. Yes I like Korn, but I don't Like this cd. Don't buy it unless you like that heavy metal repetative crap. Just because Korn is playing a song doesn't mean it will sound good. Save your money for canned corn, mmmm..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Return to Glory","review":"For a while, I was worried that KoRn had lost their edge. Follow the Leader was a very poppy album, followed by Issues and Untouchables, both artistic albums, but lacking the intensity found in the group's first two cds. However, Take a Look in the Mirror is a return to older styles. Davis' vocals are more developed, and combined with the band's harder rock, KoRn may have put out their best album yet. Definitely worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"korn is too slow...","review":"...I have a younger brother who loves every thing korn does and i had the chance to hear all of their albums which was the most horrible experience i ever had to bear with and their songs are REALY slow. I hear people praising korn's seltitle but to me its basically the same riff, over and over again which is terrible--how do these guys even sell so many records ?Thats beyond me. Anyways, korn's \\"take a look in the mirror\\" is not heavy or technical but weak,boring,uninspering,lame lirycs...The only thing that is good about korn ? Is their clean production but well that doesn't help when all your songs sounds exectly like the other. Heck, rappers have albums with clean production or pop arist, but does that make them good ? No! Nu-metal is garbage. Listing to shadowsfall!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT","review":"This is what u call an example of what many rock bands have failed throughout the decades. A nearly flawless cd. Everything is perfect except for the horrendous collaboration with Nas.Anyways this a nearl perfect cd in its own ways. Although it is not real metal, it still has a great place beside the gods themselves, Black Sabbath."},{"rating":"2","title":"a reflection of take a look in the mirror","review":"THIS KORN ALBUM IS SOOOOOOOOOO AWESOME. korn is THE best nu metal band out there and this album proves it. they came back with the awesome heavy riffs, and kept the melodic quality they developed in untouchables. the best tracks are break some off and counting on me. this album is a must have. SO GO GET IT BIATCH."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST Korn album.","review":"Take A Look In The Mirror, is by far the best Korn album. It's sound is like old Korn, while still sounding fresh and new. Lots of screaming, and bagpipes, what more could you want in a Korn album?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"OK I just want to clarify something. Glo DNHR wrote a really stupid statement. He said he didn't like Play Me becuz Korn could didn't get somebody bigger than Nas to feature in it. First off, Nas is fairly well known. Second, GLo, you are dumb if u think what makes a song good is who you can get to feature in it. What's good is the music. Korn has too many guests on their songs and not enough talent. Btw, this album has two good songs, \\"Did My Time\\" and \\"Counting on Me\\". The rest is not super. I really don't like Korn much but they do have some good songs scattered on different albums. Buy Untouchables, it is the only halfway decent album with no crappy bagpipes or weird noises *cough*Twist."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHATEVER U DO, DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM","review":"korn USED to be a great band. they began goin downhill on untouchables and have'nt stopped. this nu-metal \\"i hate you\\" blah blah blah and \\"i hate everything else\\" blah blah blah is getting really old. i mean, grow the hell up, how can these multi-millionaires possibly relate to the music they r putting out. maybe they used to relate to it (hence to first couple albums) but these munkies need to grow some brains and write some decent new material. just listen to the first track, \\"shutup,clsoe your mouth etc etc etc\\", here is a tissue jonathan now please go kill yourself. Save the money, buy a really big bat, and go to the record store and smash all copies of this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Korn I know","review":"think ther's a point when a band have to retire. It's not the time for KoRn but I think these guys should take some rest. Releasing albums every year for the pleasure of relese them is not healthy for a band that has been recycling old ideas and sounds and trying to make'em sound fresh during the last years.I own the first two albums and they're great. Follow the leader is okey but I get tired and sold it. The next attempts to make something good desilutionated me. This is the case of Take a look back in the mirror. First, check the CD cover: Isn't it similar to the Life is peachy album? Yes. The really heavy music that make self-titled album a kick in the ass is gone. Tthe lyrics are stupid and the screams sound weak in comparation with Daddy or Kill you (in the Life is Peachy CD), true demostrations of inspired singing.Yeah guys, you should take a rest. When you feel ready join together, breath deeply and do what you are good to: play heavy music."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's good, but not the best.","review":"I became a korn fan when i got Untouchables. I thought it was an awesome cd (still do). I got all their other cds as well, thought they were good. I was very happy to find out that this cd was coming out and bought it! I think it's very good, but I think Jon should change his lyrics. Don't get me wrong, they're alright, but if it's always going to be about being angry at yourself or someone, then it's going to get old fast. I know that one can be angry forever if they wanted to, but he should write about other things as well. But the cd is good! Just buy it, don't listen to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"For KoRn an ..Peachy fans","review":"This review is just intented to early KoRn fans (from the first two albums, and follow the leader).I'm sure you guys are expecting some return to the old korn, because that's what the band's been selling in this album..well remember Metallica with St. Anger? \\"this is our hardest sound and hardeest album\\" well Anger sucked and sucked BIG TIME.This is almost the same...but not entirely. I'm sure you all hated Issues and Untouchables as i did but this cd is not that bad. I actually could hear it interely without really hating all the songs. J.Davis is screaming a little bit more like he used to, the guitars are a little bit more decent aswell as the bass and there's bo synth sound for our luck.Jon still sings some verses horribly but not as bad as Issues and U.If you want you may download some songs but DO NOT buy the album. Instead you could user your money in The Mars Volta or something like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't go off what I say though, judge it yourself.","review":"A Faith No More rip off with a wasp on vox and a diesel for sound Nothing you can get from more talented bands such as Slayer or Monster Magnet. Variation is less than the sights of a dry river bed with the personality to match. A lack of musical talent only rivaled by Slipknot's refusal to display it. And the cut myself thing works for emo bands in their first few releases and no one else. Nu Metal is a sinking ship and the bands are like rats."},{"rating":"1","title":"korn on the slide","review":"now youre bein a bit harsh if u say 'korn' and 'life is peachy' are korns only truly great albums. 'follow the leader' helped kick start all that nu-metal and brought metal back to the masses. 'issues' was a retread of 'follow the leader' and only at times managed to match the quality of the bands first 3 albums. but even the most die hard fan would find it hard to defend the rest of their albums. 'untouchables' was at times lame and this album, dont even bother.what was that about burnin out rather than fadin away?....korn seem like theyre tryin their luck with the latter"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to you Korn!?","review":"I was disapointed when I heard this album. Korn has lightened up a little too much. I mean songs like \\"Yall want a single\\" and \\"Right Now\\" are really stupid. I gave this cd 2 stars cause I liked Break Some off, and One with Metallica. But other than that this album is really not good. Hopefully Korn will go back to their old self on their next album. I liked untouchables and all their other albums, but this album is just bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for a Die Hard Korn fan","review":"I loved the first 3 Korn albumns. They had something new and different to the music scene. Now...they really remind me of Metallica. Trying desperately to stay in a scene that has moved on without them. Issues was okay...saved only by 3 songs. Untouchables was god awful with no redeeming songs. So where does this CD stack up? Well it's a lot better than Untouchables, that's for sure.There are a few good tracks on this CD, so if you like Korn, it's probably worth the buy. Try to find it used though. After a while, all the songs seem to just be noise and a bassline that sounds cool, but don't stay in your head. Yeah, it's heavy, but what good is heavy if the songwriting sucks?I'm giving it 2 stars because it was better than I thought it was going to be, but definitely a lot worse than their hey day. Go buy the latest from God Forbid if you want the new breed in metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"best korn album to date","review":"a massive improvement on untouchables wich was, in my opinion, i piece of s***.my favourite songs are 'break some off', 'alive' and 'when will this end'a must buy!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Purely awful","review":"I was a Korn fan, a big fan until this album came out, don't these guys ever grow up? There is no real emotion anymore out of these guys, its all just talking about how insane you are, how many times have we heard Jonathan Davis say, \\" I feel so insane\\"? It was very poorly produced, i can barely hear the drums, not that i would want to, they are hardly memorable, the guitars, pure garbage, creepy intro, chugging, dull, repetitive riff. they had the potential to be so much better but are confined to the image they wish to maintain. They used to evolve with every album, then they wish to sell more records so they \\"go back to the roots\\" what a bunch of sellouts. This is Korn's St. Anger, a joke of an album made to \\"go back to the roots\\" so they can win back the old fans and sell more records, both records were complete abominations and we are all dumber for having listened to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry for my earlier Review","review":"But, the truth is that these people don't have ANY talent. Anyone could pick up a guitar, and play the tune of 'Did My Time.' Anyone should know that. And, it surprises me that they need 2 guitarists to lay the rhythm down. It's just the truth. And the drummer... I could do that stuff. Don't take it as an insult to you fans, I'm just telling the truth. And Death Metal has my support. Long live Extreme Metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment.","review":"Korn's new CD Take A Look In The Mirror was a big disappointment. Don't get me wrong there are some really kick ass songs on this CD. I was just expected more from an awesome rock band. Most of there songs have a similar sound. Songs that I really liked are:Right NowCounting On MeBreak Some OffDid My TimeYa'll Want A SingleDisappointing CD, but I am still a fan of Korn."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best!!","review":"Definetly the best best koRn album. Not much rap and nothing garbage like Follow the leader (Although some of the songs were good from Follow....)If you didn't buy it yet go ahead and do it NOW! you won't regret it.A little dispointment was when they said about the expanded booklet. It was expanded, but the pics were not good.Favourite songs from this album:RIGHT NOWCOUNTING ON MEY'LL WANT A SINGLEPLAY ME (FEAT. NAS)aLL ppl r saying they hate play me cause of nas in it.

But I do prefer older Korn. First two albums were great. But what I can't understand is why people complain about it. Someone said that Jonathin Davis needs to grow up. You mean change thier music like Metallica, and Limp Bizkit did?? Wow. Look how well they are doing now. Its all about the sound. If they had that sound they did as on the first two albumds, it would be great. Well I stick b y my bands. No matter what they do.

I used to listen to Korn and now I think they suck big time. They're one of the worst bands ever, even worse then \\"Brand New\\". All Johnathan Davis does is whine like a little girl. Thats not singing, thats whinning. This is proboly one of the worst Cds I have ever heard, and that song \\"Ya'll want a single\\" is the worst song ever. They call themselves a rock band, when they have rappers in their songs. Come on, Korns an awful band, but on the good side their not as bad as Metalica and Limp Bizkit."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"Are you call it rock music?Is it actually music?I think this is just a piece of crappy noise.Anyone can play this crap. Just buy a dicent guitar than bunch of sequencers, guitar synths, and aother stuf, and hit the strings. I'm sure you can be another korn musician, just call your band different name, something like \\"Onion\\", or \\"Carrot\\". Otherwise, these korn company will sue you for using they so called music.Have a nice day."},{"rating":"1","title":"korn has lost touch with the word GOOD","review":"wow, how could anybody say this is even remotely good?they had very good music from their self-titled album until issues, then came untouchables, the only CD worse than Slipknot's iowa. but now there is this, even worse than both of those. how could anybody compare this CD to Life Is Peachy? I mean LIP is my favorite CD, and people say this is like it? The mose pissed off song is right now, but that doesn't compare to good god. and the only good song on this album is a cover of metallica's best song, anybody who buys this CD for any reason other than to hear them play one is not too smart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but not....","review":"From an enginneering stand-point, the album is well produced, the mix is awesome....but from a fan's point of view, I hate it. I only like 2 songs off the whole album, and I can hear those on the radio. I've been a fan of Korn forever as most people will say the same, their style is just going down and further down. Where's the excitement of the first 3 albums? I don't get excited by listening to their music anymore, I don't get that fist-clenching feeling I used to. The fact of the matter is, Korn will continue to search new musical styles (much like the Deftones) and their albums will always sell, because their name sells. They have millions of fans still and as soon as one of their new records hits the shelves, those fans will run out and buy it, take the first listen and say it's the best album Korn has ever done. Their songs just have no content anymore. Hope this helps some of these stuck-on Korn fans evolve and branch out into other music. PEACE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best AltMetal Album of the Year","review":"I have a very hard time believing that there are any metal fans who don't feel that \\"Take a Look in the Mirror\\" isn't Korn's magnum opus to date.

It's rich, bold and I just can't get enough of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd","review":"one would say this cd is very good, it has many great songs but 'did my time' surely has potenital for being the single. its better than any other song on the cd. other songs like 'yall want a single' or 'Break some off' or 'Right now' will totally break peoples necks if listened to loudly. if your a good korn fan this a good one to buy but save a few dollars and get a copy. thats what ive been doing lately ;].

Well, it seems as if KoRn are trying to please the fans that abandoned them after their first 2 albums rather than trying to better themselves as musicians. Sure, it's some of the heaviest stuff they've ever done, but that's about the extent of it. Nothing new or innovating and the quality of the music isn't that great, but it is loud, heavy, and angry. Admittedly, the first time I listened to it, I was blown away by the heaviness, but after a while I began to notice the same tired lyrics of pain and despair, the simple song structures, and that every song sounds similar. I would only recommend this to diehard KoRn fans. If you're new to the band this is definately not the place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"god what a mistake","review":"... the instrumentals for this cd are HOTT... but the lyrics suck so much...

I had hope for them until Untouchables and then I just gave up. I stand by that statement. This is a not a good cd. It wouldn't be as bad I don't think if they had said (along with everyone else) that it was gonna be like the first two albums. You know if you say that, you have to live up to that statement. But they got the old school fans hopes up and then BLAH! It sounds almost death metal in some parts.

It would be awesome if they could bring it back, but it seems to not be working for them.This CD has a few good moments but I would'nt recommend buying it, unless it was on sale or used. A good album to download too, but then the poor record company executives would have to sell one of thier Ferraris or condo in Aspen just to make ends meet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Album From Korn","review":"When Korn first came out I wasn't into them at all. I was still in the grunge seen. It wasn't untill 2000 when i saw them live I really got into them. Personally I think this is there best album to date. Its got great guitar riffs, great bass lines and jonathan davis does only what he can do on vocals. The only bad thing i found about the album is the stupid rap song with nas (i think it was nas) It is out of place in the album and isn't Korn's style. Probably Fieldy's idea, but overall if you are a fan of Korn its definately a must to have next to Follow The Leader, Korn, and Issues.(...)Peace"},{"rating":"2","title":"Korns Best...so far.","review":"I would love to give them 5 stars but I cant becuase they can do even better than this cd....BUT. This cd is their best so far..even better than thier self-titled. The reasons why I say this is because their first cd isnt as versatile as this one, and their sound has beefed up a whole lot and john's vocals on this cd are overall pretty good. He has showed his hard stuff on this cd quite a few times, but nothing like -When will This End-..track 13. Mid-way through the song 2min. 34sec. to be exact show how hard John can actually scream.. I feel If he did this more often they would have recieved a 5 star rating from me... Vocal are good none the less. This album is a good mix of tease and please. I cant wait to hear their next cd..

Nowhere near as creative as their old stuff, and nowhere near as listener-friendly as Issues or Untouchables.

The only songs even remotely good are the two radio songs, Right Now and Did My Time, and they're nothing amazing. Korn diehards might like it, but as someone who does in fact own all of their albums, I was very much let down. Just because Korn did it, doesn't automatically make it gold.

I hear peopple bitch about Death Metal and Black Metal vocals but I much rather hear that then some whiny drone. I could find a bum on the streets who could play guitar better then this. The drums are week. They use the bass riffs to fill in for their lack of talent. Don't waste your money, buy some talented bands. There are so many bands with so much more to offer.

This Album is the same as their last, and now they are just repeating the vulgar music they have been making for years. Screaming, yelling..bla.bla.bla. This CD was made too quickly...and it shows. This CD barely hit the top 10, in the United States..sitting at number 9 for 1 week. Now falling to slot 42...Go buy some Marilyn Manson. He changes his tunes, and it does pay off. His latest Album was #1 in America and all over Europe. He is a true Artist and has an ever changing style and music.(Buy Holy Wood, it's Manson's best)"},{"rating":"1","title":"When will this all end?","review":"This is probably the worst KoRn cd that they ever made. Untouchables is better than this. I don't think its just me but after Follow The Leader KoRn has produced horrible and uninteresting cds for almost a decade. The only track I like on this cd is Did My Time, the only song really worth listening to. I agree with the Velvet Revolver guy, they are pretty much the only interesting band that is out today (VR). I can't belive KoRn are still around, and its been only 10 years? Well, Life is Peachy wasn't that great either I guess the only Korn cd i can listen to is there self-titled, and I barely listen to that either.

I still have the first Korn CD in the changer, its been there for about 3 years, along with the first Rage Against the Machine. Both bands do very little for me after their first releases. Thats where all the genious is. I give one star to this album because I do feel slightly more afraid by Korn yelling \\"Shut up, shut up, shut up I'll mess you up\\" than I do by Linkin Park yelling \\"Shut up when Im talkin to you!\\" both verses are so passionate and so much thought went into them, that I tend to tremble when I hear them.

I think my view was warped way back when I first put Issues in my CD player. This band has really \\"jumped the shark\\"...quality's seemed to be thrown out the window and replaced by a steaming heap of badger crap. If Untouchables was bad, then this is really worse. Their music doesn't have a great feel to it anymore. And would old school/awesome Korn really name a song \\"Y'all want a single\\"?! Don't buy this and dig out their self titled album or Life is Peachy or even Follow the Leader if you're really wanting some Korn in your diet. It'll save you some money, and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"KoRn Return With a New CD of Recycled Trash","review":"KoRn started out strongly with their self-titled debut. It was new, angry music that today's youth could relate to. Life is Peachy and Follow the Leader were a bit downhill, but they came back with the unique melodies and rhythms of Issues and The Untouchables. Now, however, they go back to sounding exactly like they did almost ten years ago. It's like their style never changes. They sound like the gimmick's up...nothing new is to be found on this album. It consists of different lyrics plastered on top of the same drab, boring riffs. And the whole quiet verses, loud, angry choruses thing is more than old hat by now. For a lover of angry, pointless, headbanging music, this might be okay. But for someone looking for a step up for KoRn, your best bet is to stay far, far, away from this old recycled trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Take a Look in the Mirror\\" -- Waste of a CD","review":"Although I'm not a die-hard fan of Korn, I like a lot of their music.

They rock and will always get regular play in my house. I have read all the reviews that trashIssues and Untouchables and I don't agree with any of them. Korn was perhaps the most influential band of the 90's - they changed music forever. Think about metal before Korn. I hope they continue to experiment and evolve and look forward to the next step.

With her first two cds she drew comparison to Taylor Dayne, Martha Wash or Chaka Khan, but with this one she comes close to Tina Turner or Joyce Kennedy. This cd like any great work has you finding something more everytime you refer to it. I like the fact that Anastacia continues to take risks by exploring different musical grounds in this case more hard rock instead of staying in a musical comfort zone.

The opening Seasons Change & Left Outside Alone is really rocks and mean to me. All the songs from Time until Welcome to My Truth are really great! But from Pretty Little Dum Dum until the end the soul of the album is down (even Where Do I Belong & Maybe Today also good).

Joyce promotes giving up your needs for your husband's and constantly defering to his opinion, which won't likely work unless you have an honest, intelligent, hardworking, compassionate, reliable husband. Save your money. See a Christian counselor. And try Joyce's book \\"How to Succeed at Being Yourself.\\" I liked it very much and I think you will too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Help Me, I wasted my time and money!","review":"This book is basically the story of Joyce and Dave, an emotional basketcase who is saved by her saintly husband. The whole thing seems to be therapy for the author while dispensing very little that isn't obvious or just silly. For example, when discussing conflict- \\"If your husband's face is all contorted and you think, My, he looks strange, you are probably making him mad and should back off.\\" She later goes on to state that if your spouse has a different personality trait than you, you should \\"forgive\\" him, and a woman should never be too tired for sex. Most of her advice is only applicable if you have a perfect husband and you are willing to fully submit to him. Instead of buying this book, take your spouse on a date, it will be a better use of your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of reach","review":"I listened to this album a few years ago, but in contrast to all other HB records, I didn't feel the need to buy it.

Unfortunately for me, I didn't enjoy it very much and, thus, will probably be the last book by Clinton McKinzie I'll read (at least for the foreseeable future). The plot started off interesting and exciting; however, what ultimately developed was mostly predictable. Further, I found the characters to not be particularly well developed, resulting in my not caring one way or the other about what happened to them. The main mystery for me was to see if I could make it to the end without resorting to skimming pages. I must admit that I did not succeed in doing so. If I was to rate this book with a word (rather than a number) I'd assess it as a \\"fair\\" read. With so many books out there and so little time to read them, my recommendation is to skip this book -- unless you have a strong interest in rock climbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incomplete, but a good intro","review":"This book gives a well-prepared introduction to CORBA. In that role, it succeeds admirably. Be warned, this book should not be considered a complete overview. There was a lot of info left out: error handling, optimization, ORB configuration and others. But, if you do want an intro into the world of CORBA programming, and just happen to know how to program Java, this is where you should start."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is horrible!","review":"I had expected this to be a comprehensive tutorial and reference. However, The examples won't work without serious tweaking, a majority of the book is wasted comparing or teaching other technologies, and the explanations are cursory.

They were short on expalanations and instead concentrated on making statements. This, in my and my friends collective opinion, is not a book but rather a waste of precious time and it is more of some sort of notes that the authors themselves can understand. You can never find what you want to about CORBA and even if you do, you can get an idea of the concept but not total comprehension. In either way you have to throw this book away and get a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time and money","review":"there are MUCH better books out there (like Pedrick's Programming with VisiBroker) than this piece of junk. the codes in the book just WON'T work. and don't expect much help from the authors' web site."},{"rating":"1","title":"HARD","review":"many pages for a not identified content, the examples have to be deciphered .I have still no a good idea about what corba is after this reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for beginners/intermediate users","review":"I would definitely recommend this book, especially for the beginner-intermediate level.

I regret so much that I waste some time on this.This book is junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I was EXTREMELY disappointed. It seems like quite an accomplishment to pack so little info in so many pages. First of all it left out many of the very essential parts of CORBA and instead concentrated related technologies things like EJB.In addition the comparisons ranged between slightly inaccurate to completely inane. They were so CORBA-centric, that they neglected to acknoledge the weaknesses that it has. And they compared things that don't warrant comparison such as Servlets and CORBA which are in NO WAY competing technologies.The only parts that I found vaguely useful were the tutorials some of which were well thought-out."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"I loved the first edition, and the second is even better.This book has everything: Opinions, lots of code, compartive code, theory, more code, comics, more code, evaluation methods, more code, and lots of neat toys to play with on the CD.Even if you don't care about CORBA, you should buy this book. Its explanations of the servlet, JDBC, and RMI API's are the best I've found. The discussion of Enterprise Java Beans is far ahead of the tools that will make them possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too verbose to be of practical use","review":"Orfali and Harkey tend to be too expansive. While this could be OK if what you're looking for is detail, the time needed to get a simple answer from the book on any given question, makes it prohibitive to use the book as a reference. Even as a textbook, the book is too verbose and details things in such excruciating detail that turns the hurried reader away. People who are in a hurry to get a jump start or quick answers should avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attempting to stop the unstopable","review":"Very biased unfounded claims about Java RMI's future.

I wanted to bring my experience to your customer's attention so that others won't have the same problem. The food caused my cat to have a serious urinary tract infection that required a vet visit and special food to cure. The total cost to me in out of pocket un-reimbursed expenses was close to $200. I contacted Well Pet several times to request reimbursement, but they ultimately refused even though my Vet told me that the food was likely the cause of the problem.

It tells of an arson expert who sets his own fires. The book tells where and how he did it. He was always the first one on the fire scene and knew exactly where the fire originated. I have a high respect for Joseph Wambaugh, and am so sorry that this book didn't do anything for me. The second half of the book is just so boring with legal turmoil, and finally a conviction. But now I do know how to set an arson fire and not be caught Woo hoo!!!!!!! Save your time and money. It's just not that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"TMI","review":"Too much information.

I like the new character addition of Balkis and am looking forward to the next book. The first few books in the series were great, but a lot of the storylines in the last couple books have seemed to have the same basic concept. This book adds a little more with the addition of Balkis being a major character and not just someone who shows up now and again. I only have one fault with the book. That being how the Caliph got to Damascus with Talas bin Daoud and his army arriving later, when earlier in the book the Caliph was held up outside of Bagdad and Talas had already arrived at Damascus. Other than that, the book was altogether a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging and beautiful","review":"Very well made, and looks beautiful on a shelf after it's done.

There is a ton of action in all the episodes and the CG sequences are better than ever. Furthermore, you also finally get clued-in on the majors past and who Goda is.The sound/music of this dvd is amazing. In these 4 episodes, more so than the last 8, the producers have heavily mixed in some of the best and mostly unheard of, GITS OST music scores- over the action and over the dialogue, making each episode have more of a movie like flow.Also what's even more impressive is that for the first time, in a long while, you actually get to see a fully CG animated ghost dive.Now as for the Tachikoma's, they are in full force in this DVD, however, there jobs are a bit different than usual, they get to help the Section 9 crew ghost dive!, yea and there humor is also intact in this volume as well.As I said before, very impressive for a continuation of the series, definitely a must see"},{"rating":"2","title":"Roses for Mama","review":"Maybe the best christian fiction book written in a long time.

I also think that the author isn't asking the right kids for his books. For example, in the first book, there was about 5 pages citing kids arguing on which Pokemon is the most \\"powerfulest\\".The question on whether this book is helpful or not is completely based on how much the reader actually knows already.

Soltzman's is absolutely terrible. I have always had an issue with his sound - his tone is harsh, nasal, and not suited to any music that requires delicate phrasing and beauty. David Shifrin, on the other hand, is an absolutely brilliant artist. An artistic director for the New York Philharmonic and director of several music festivals, David Shifrin is a deeply committed musician. And it shows in these sensitive readings of the Mozart concerto and quintet. His tone is absolutely astounding. It's sweet, mellow, and delightful to listen to. He uses an extended-range clarinet as Mozart intended and the result is delightful. This is a wonderful CD and, as a clarinetist, I cannot recommend it more highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Low Freq.

But on the whole, I've been very disappointed. Although the book covers a lot of relevant topics, it does so in a way that seems sloppy and self-congratulatory. The book could do with a thorough proofreading to catch the numerous typos and other errors, and the author seems more concerned with impressing the reader than in making the topics easy to grasp and apply.

Covey, an excellent alternative!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Naggy reading","review":"I totally agree with the idea that Dr. Larua has on parents raising their children and stay at home moms. However, the book really started to grate on my nerves. I found myself skimming to get through the chapters and onto the next.Book is also a bit hard to follow due to Dr. Lauras \\"voice\\" then quotes from articles or other books or callers from her radio show.I read the book, knowing that I want to be a stay-at home mom and _I_ want to raise my children (yet to be born I might add) and not have \\"a 16 year old raising them\\" as Dr. Laura might say. Dr. Laura definitely stresses this in her book yet it becomes too much. the book has negative tones to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm... I don't get it","review":"I don't get it. Why the venom about same-sex parenting? I personally was raised by two wonderful women who were \\"their kids moms\\" and I am a healthy, happy, well-adjusted, successful woman. I own my own home, am married to a wonderful man, and am planning on having my own child soon. Why does everyone think that lesbians and/or gays can't raise good children? It's simply not true! My moms were better parents than 99% of the straight parents out there! I defy Dr. Laura to do a study that proves that children raised in same-sex households are any worse off than their counterparts. I 100% promise that she would find some very surprising answers. My house was filled with love, and I am a happy, productive adult. It is funny to see someone talking about something they have absoultely no experience with and know absolutely nothing about!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I agreed with everything she was saying about parenthood","review":"I do believe we need to do more for our children and parents, especially for the mothers. This book talks about the importance of having a dad in a child's life, stupid reasons why to have kids and why we need to be there for our children and raise them also. I also agree with her that a child needs both parents, a mom and a dad."},{"rating":"2","title":"parents trying to reach ideals for child rearing","review":"Reviewers here need to get to the meat and the potatoes of Dr. Laura's book, speak specifically about the issues she has brought up, not type crank reviews. The type of reviews that you want to stay away from are of the sort from July 21, 2000, where none of the issues of the book were addressed. One item that I got out of it is if you are not married, don't have a child. Especially, if you were to be having your child(ren) in daycare for hours a day and days a week, you are notreally totally rearing them, and it is the children(who are not possessions) who suffer."},{"rating":"1","title":"If there was a lesser score, she'd get it.","review":"I flipped thru this book just out of curiousity, because #1, I think this ridiculous woman is a farce and a affront to all women. I was going to try to keep an open mind about her and see if she has a clue of what she talks about. She doesn't. She also doesn't know how to keep an objective view about anything, her style is blatantly explotative. I can't tell you how much she disgusts me. The book reflects her one tract closed closet she claims is a mind. I would never recommend reading anything this person writes at all. I can't use the words I would like to use to tell you what I really think about this bleached blond joke. She has no business being a talk show host, or a radio host, her credentials are a joke. Just like the person herself. She makes me ashamed to say we have ONE thing in common. We are both chromonsonally female. The book is trite, and way to predictable. Just like her.

Counseling is not about judging, lecturing, and spouting personal poison. How many families has this woman damaged? Not enough to satisfy her appetite to inflict harm because she's back with a book that ignores reality and condemns the struggles of modern women to raise children. Economics in the real world is simply dismissed by LS. The kind of nonsense she sells in this book gives qualified, experienced, knowledgeable counselors a bad name. \\"Dr.\\" S. knows little about this profession, real life, or the people who live it.

The best thing a parent can do is raise their child in the REAL world with respect for ALL people and the ability to choose for themselves according to their own ability to reason through rather than some cotton-candy dream world where they'll be eaten alive if they ever manage to detatch from Mommy's umbilical cord. It's Drs. like Laura that will keep Freud in business forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Advice for Parents","review":"I bought this book as a \\"retirement\\" gift for someone who is giving up a teaching career to stay home with her kids.

This book helped me understand my father."},{"rating":"1","title":"I gave it a chance, but found her advice unconstructive","review":"In an honest effort to find good guides on parenting, I took a look at this title and ultimately came away disgusted. Not so much with her advice--in many ways Dr. Schlessinger's advice is quite good. But her tone is often insulting and the way she makes fun of people who have made bad decisions is unconstructive. I would rather not improve my sense of parenting by gloating over the terrible mistakes of others--rather, I'd like to learn from them. On an aside, Schlessinger's writing does seem to be a bit out of synch with advice I've found in other resources, and upon further investigation I discovered she isn't a psychologist at all but a physiologist. That explains a lot really: this is a sensationalistic book born of her sometimes-cruel radio persona, not a book born of a thoughtful and well-informed background in self-help and psychology. My advice is to forgo this book and rely on other, better-informed self-help guides."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Long Whine","review":"I have been an at-home (feminist) mom for all the years I have been a mother. I think there is great value in being at home, and I am enjoying this season of my life tremendously. This book, however, doesn't say anything at all new. To be sure, Dr Laura does have the anger/whine thing down really well. If you are a hard-working parent trying to make ends meet, reading this will make you feel pretty awful--like a dog whose master just found the pee on her rug. There must be selfish people dropping their kids off in day care, but all the men and women I know who use day care are thoughtful, loving parents. If you want to be castigated for trying to manage home/work, by all means, read this book. If you want to read something that takes into account a complicated world, where most women aren't lucky/talented enough to make big money hosting their own radio show (where you only need to show up during the hours the kids are in school), I advise a great big pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty Assumptions","review":"While Dr. Laura does have some good thoughts in her book i.e. discipline in the home, spending time with our children, she also makes very faulty assumptions throughout the book. Especially in her section on childcare, she makes these very broad assumtpions. The reader is led to believe that all children in day care are raised by the day care. What if a child stays in daycare ten hours a week? Does that mean they are being raised there? What about a child that is there only 20 hours a week? Surely a child is not raised in that time. I find Dr. Laura's tone to be very offensive and her black and white assumptions to be ones that are hurtful and inaccurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift idea for full time moms or for moms to be!","review":"I got this book for Mothers Day with a note attached from my husband thanking me for being such a good mom to our two daughters. It made my week!I think this book is very helpful for stay at home moms (and stay at home future moms) in really getting to the heart of how important you really are to your kids. I think that this book would be difficult to read only if you truly put your own interests and desires above the well - being of your chilren.The only possible negative thing about the book is that there are many quotes, faxes and radio show excerps giving the book a somewhat unusual style. I liked this about the book but I can see how some readers may find the style too inconsistent for their taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried","review":"I tried but couldn't read this.

Her reasoning is confused and conclusions are faulty. If your kids are in daycare, they are still your kids and you will be responsible for their actions, not their caregivers.Her mean spirited and shrill complaining is mostly preaching to the choir. I don't think anyone should write a parent book until their kids are 25.Finally, the book will make some pat themselves on the back, while others will turn away in disgust."},{"rating":"1","title":"More bile from hate-monger Dr. Laura","review":"Dr. Laura takes a few paragraphs in her introduction to once again rail against gay people before spewing her invective towards everyone else.No one's going to argue that parents need to be more hands-on in raising their kids, but does anyone really want to hear the radio physiologist's nagging tone on page after page?

If you're thinking about getting this cd, you should. You should purchase all HiM cds and go see them live. I think this is the only HiM cd with Parker and Mazurek, I could be wrong though.

I did not enjoy his Shostakovich Symphony No. 5 as much here as the version Stoki produced on Everest but many others did. A lot of critics called this version more impassioned and with deeper attachment that the seemingly more laid back Everest production.This is a concert reading of Stoki's rewrite of \\"Pictures At An Exhibition\\" which excludes a number of the pictures and takes a more Russian view of the score than Ravel's more international approach. By Russian I mean Stoki uses more low strings and woodwinds to make paint the portraits.All told, this is the old wizard in concert doing a pair of cornerstones of Russian music. If you've never heard this one it will give you an idea why any Stokowski performance can be such a revelation."},{"rating":"1","title":"$16.99 for the Kindle Version?

Some entries are useful, while others simply waste space by going far to in-depth (for example, there is an entire algorithm that conveniently shows how to add pi/2 to the maximum axis to find the minimum axis of an object in an image). Other complicated topics are frustratingly over-simplified. The storage format topics are almost laughable; there are encoding and decoding details for macpaint and pc paintbrush formats that nobody ever uses, but entries for jpeg, gif, and tiff claim that the algorithm is to complicated for the scope of the book and point to outside references.

Often miltary style movies don't show the depth of the soul searching aspect that a soldier goes through and the psychological conflicts that can be brought back from war. In this incident the conflict was brough to the war field and Skeet Urlich portraits this loss exceptionally well.

It is a pity that Kate did not limit herself to what she does best and bring in an experienced director.

It doesn't helped that the author proves to be rather pro-southern in outlook which heavily tainted his approach.

Based on manufacturer's web site, I found that my size is right between medium and large. I ordered a pair of large first to be on the safe side. But oversizing is not a good thing. Even if you can strap down the top and bottom, the middle portion is still too loose to provide adequate support. I returned it back to the 3rd party seller for exchange ($5 fee). The medium size fits snug on top and bottom without strapping down. The knee portion is tight enough provide a good level of support, though I do not feel any improvement to what I used to have.

I was totally shocked and disappointed. They turned out to be totally opposite of what I thought they would be. I'm not saying that pop music is bad, it's just not what I expected in this cd. I blame the radio stations for giving us the wrong idea about this band. All in all I'm not a pop person, so I didn't really enjoy this album as much as I thought I would have.

I really liked it. A few days ago, I was in the local record store and noticed the CD, Now You See Inside. I remembered how much I liked the song and purchased the album. Aside from the first two tracks, the rest of the album sounds more like NSYNC with guitars. Blink 182, NOFX, Goldfinger, etc. fans should beware. This album is decent, but it's hardly comparable to Dude Ranch, Enema of the State, or other albums in this genre. Not all of the songs are fast and upbeat.

The first track was also a good tune \\"Politically Correct\\" and then came \\"Right Now\\" and I was, at that point expecting a good punkish-pop album. NO. Every single track after that is soft lyrics and music not close to punk or rock stuff. Personally I prefer rock or punk. This is not even close to Eve6 which is also recomended on the page. Some reviewers have called these guys the missing link to the Goo Goo Dolls and N'SYNC or even closer to the Goo Goo Dolls side, what are you guys drinking? This is N'SYNC with instruments except for the first 2 tracks, they are the only reason I am giving this 1 star.

I mean even more punk than stupid Get Up Kids and even more punk than the best punk band ever MxPx. They're also sooooo emo too. Even the best emo bands like Taproot and Chaz is the Reason aren't that emo. Emo isn't a music, it's a state of mind, and these guys have it. And they're sooooo hardcore! Fugazi and Snapcase can't hold a candle to them. They're almost as hardcore as Kid Rock, but, you know, nobody's as emo as the Kid himself, Kid Dynamite. I think SR-71 should play with Hot Rod Circuit, Puff Daddy, Taproot, Disturbed, MxPx, Chaz is the Reason, Snapcase, Kid Rock, Kid Dynamite, Slayer and John Tesh for the most hardcore show ever!

Out of no where they came out with the single Right Now that's pretty popular in Sac town. Definetly catchy but some songs lack lyrical sense. Songs like Politically Correct, Empty Spaces, Another Night Alone, Fame (sort of), and Right Now don't really have that problem. The only song I can't make sense out of that I enjoy is Last Man on the Moon only because it's catchy and that counts for something.

Whether it's punk, ska, surf or good old rock and roll, the band delivers. But the Horrorpops are best on stage: tattooed to the bone, go-go girls flirting with the audience, Patricia slamming the upright bass, Kim Nekroman with an awesome Horrorbeach guitar solo.. it's all there.And don't worry about being a one-time act: the Horrorpops are currently on tour again in Europe with new go-go Naomi (Mille will be missed though) and going back to the studio later this fall for a second album.If you're into any kind of rock music or guitar sound, Hell Yeah! will look great in your collection, mixing the best of various genres."},{"rating":"2","title":"HORRORPOPS","review":"Excellent.

Especially disappointing is Psychobitches Outta Hell, since if they had put any effort into making it a good song instead of just a song, it could have served as an anthem to an entire demographic of chicks (like me).

If they lose, they will become the Toymaker's playthings.The games are largely English school games and while this may have worked on-screen, the description of them is pretty unengaging. Unfortunately, most of this story no longer exists in its original form (and the one episode I have seen is pretty boring, too) so this may be the only way to enjoy this story.The Toymaker has been popular enough to return (in written form) a couple of times: you might want to read 'Nightmare Fair' or 'Divided Loyalties' to see him in a better story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice effort in many ways, but...","review":"...leaves the reader with a desire for less editorializing and more objectivity.

Now, 8 years later, I realize what a gem Naveed was, and still is. I'd say it's one of my favorite rock albums from the 90's, up there with Throwing Copper and Nevermind. The hard driven guitar rock on Naveed far surpasses anything OLP has done since. Hard to believe that I didn't hear about these guys until Clumsy was released, but Naveed is a great album, a sound that I only wish they would have stuck with for longer. In my opinion, OLP kind of sold out after Clumsy, trying to make pop hits, and getting away from the awesome rock you will find on Naveed. If you were to only get one OLP album, Naveed is without a doubt their best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shaky debut album, disappointed after hearing the last 2","review":"I didn't even know that Our Lady Peace had another album besides \\"Clumsy\\" and \\"Happiness...\\" until a few months ago. When I found this out, I was elated, because those other two albums are amongst my favorites of all-time. They are both basically flawless albums. After finally picking up \\"Naveed\\", I was greatly disappointed. This album has bascially nothing to offer except the title track, \\"Naveed\\", which is an awesome song. \\"Starseed\\" and \\"Julia\\" are decent, but absolutely nothing like the tracks Our Lady Peace put together on their last two albums. To compare this album is unfair, but it's truly not a good performance by Our Lady Peace. Most of the songs sound like the same song on a continuous loop. For fans who haven't yet bought this album, wait a few months for Our Lady Peace's 2001 release to come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"This album is great. Our Lady Peace's best work? Probably not quite. Still, you should buy this album, it's a must for fans of alt-metal type music. This album seems to be influenced by the Seattle sound of the earlier 90's. (From bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Live, etc.) Not that this is a bad thing, though. \\"The Birdman\\" is a great opener; it seems to give an optimistic output on the rest of the album. I'm not sure that there's a bad song on here, although some (especially Naveed) kind of drag on. Definitely the best song you'll find here is the radio hit \\"Starseed\\". It has a classic-rock feel, but the vocals keep it fresh.

Shame on you. Our Lady Peace encompasses thrilling lead vocals with guitar riffs so awesome that you know other bands are likely to copy. The drums are completely awesome. Jeremy Taggert is the best drummer I have ever heard or seen. The songs on Naveed are in depth hard core music. Each song with its own unique feel and meaning (my faves are Starseed and Dirty Walls). The fact that you can hardly find these albums in a regular record store is a shame. Give these Canadian boys some credit. In a time here in the good ol' US of A that is full of pop artists, shut them out by blasting Naveed by Our Lady Peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Albums Ever!","review":"Our Lady Peace, most people will recognize this name due to either their Clumsy album or their Happiness...Is Not A Fish You Can Catch album. However this is the one that started it all. People who love the newer OLP albums will maybe find this one a bit different but in this case different in a good way.

He is an arrogant, selfish bastard. He doesn't do anything useful with his time - or his life - but prances around seducing women, gambling and drinking. He knows Roslyn desperately needs a husband, and knows that he won't marry her, but is still trying to ruin hewr every time they run into each other. That she 'can't resist him' is not an excuse. I really really disliked him. Towards the end he redeemed himself a bit, but by then Roslyn became a complete shrew. I was all so stupid. But what do I expect from a 'big missunderstanding' story.

My recommendation to Evanovich-- Fire Charlotte, take a vacation, and release a better book or stop writing. My advice to the reader-- Save your money. Don't buy \\"Full Tilt\\"--reread the One through Eight series."},{"rating":"1","title":"no Stephanie, but still O.K.","review":"I've never thought of myself as lowbrow before, but all the scathing reviews of Full Tilt and Full Speed are making me rethink that.Let's get this out of the way right up front: No, this isn't nearly as good as a Stephanie Plum novel. The tale of weekly newspaper publisher Jamie Swift and dashing tech billionaire Max Holt is much more lightweight and campy, even. Max is as much a caricature as James Bond; the gun-toting, Bible-thumping Vera is a harpy; no woman is as superficial as Deedee (at least I hope not!) and the flaming queen Beanie is an insult to gay men everywhere. Only Jamie is somewhat realistic. But Full Tilt was still fun, especially Muffin the world's most amazing computer. I've definitely read worse.If you go into it expecting it to be no better than your average sitcom, you won't be disappointed. I have to admit that, as soon as I finished Full Tilt, I ordered Full Speed from the library. Maybe I should consider it a guilty pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full Snore...","review":"I am one of those obsessive people who always finishes books I start. And I kept hoping this one would get better, but it read like a bad soap opera, and ends with the heroes riding off into the sunset. As a fan of the Stephanie Plum novels, I had high hopes for this book and even thought what a great person Evanovich was to give a \\"leg up\\" to Charlotte Hughes. But since Evanovich's other books are so good and this one was so bad, I think Hughes should keep her day job. I plan to avoid any books with her name on them in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had hoped for more!","review":"I am a true fan of Janet Evanovich, and will continue to read her work, but I kept reading Full Tilt hoping I'd get to the good part, but the good part never came! I'm giving it two stars just because I know there's a story in there for Max and Jamie, I just didn't find it. I look forward to Full Speed, not to mention To The Nines (love you, Stephanie!)and hope the next installment will be worth my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"It's hard to believe this dreck is written by the same brilliant author who brought us Stephanie Plum. Hughes must know where Evanovich buried the bodies -- I can't imagine any other reason Evanovich would attach her name to something so bad. Evanovich's Plum series has everything this one lacks, including a plot that holds together, humor and creativity. Take a pass on this series & invest in a Plum -- you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was she thinking?","review":"I was so mad after reading this stinker I mailed it back to the publisher. Evanovich must really like her \\"good friend\\" Charlotte Hughes if she lent her name to this thing, which can't possibly have much Evanovich writing in it. Insipid, plodding, a compendium of trite -- maybe it's supposed to be some kind of send-up?"},{"rating":"1","title":"if you love the stephanie plum series, don't buy this","review":"Awful, boring, silly. Bought this at an airport and looked forward to some light vacation reading. I couldn't get past the first chapters it was so bad. Shame on the author and publisher for trading on the author's good name to trick people into buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"So incredibly bad","review":"This story is so bad. The plot is lame, the scenes are poorly conceived, and the dialogue is downright pathetic. It's so cliche and unrealistic--like something a 13-year-old would write. I wish I'd read the reviews before I got it. The only good thing about this book is that I didn't pay anything for it--just borrowed it from the library.Don't bother with this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Plum","review":"Not as good as the Plum novels. I bought this book because I was waiting for the next Stephanie Plum book to come out and needed something to read. It's ok, but doesn't come close to the Plum series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I'm very disappointed with this book. The plot was ridiculous, boring and convoluted. The characters lacked any kind of chemistry, and were completely uninteresting. I don't know how Janet Evanovich can do such a good job with her Stephanie Plum series, and be so consistently disappointing with her other work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I picked this puppy.","review":"It's sad that the level of intelligence of the average reader is so low as to cause a book of this caliber to be a \\"best seller\\". The person who awarded it five stars has got to be a relative, if not one of the authors. I've read one other Janet Evanovich book (SEVEN UP) which was a fast, amusing read, so when I needed something light to read on a plane trip, I picked up this one. Why she allowed her name on this book is a mystery in itself. I got halfway through it and couldn't take any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evanovich Phones It In","review":"What a shame that such a talented author has co-written such a lifeless, unfunny story. The premise, genius Max Holt from \\"Full House\\" as a grown up zillionaire inventor, is so promising, but the writing is boring! Where are the off-the-wall characters, zingy dialog and screwball situations J.E. liberally flings into her books? Come on, Janet, you know this isn't good writing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Par","review":"I enjoyed the Stepahnie Plum novels, but this one is poorly written and has a fairly dumb premise. No more of these for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Plum","review":"Full Tilt is a mildly entertaining read. You'll get a couple of chuckles, but thats it. Janet evanovich's Stefanie Plum books are much better. I love the Plum Books and so I picked up Full Tilt, thinking it had to be great, I was very disappointed. there is not much in the romance department, And not much in the mystery department. The charachters are pretty flat and one sided and the whole novel seems to fall on its face. Don't be fooled by Evanovichs name on the title. Full Tilt is definitly not up to Plum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining read!","review":"Don't expect a deep and meaningful literary experience when tackling Full Tilt, but expect a light easy read thats loads of fun!Although far fetched, Full Tilt is a bizarre yet entertaining read. Pure fiction - full of ex strippers, wrestlers, millionaire's, snazzy cars, a talking computer and other crazies, Full Tilt is fun, lively and quick to read. The characters are not as real as those in Evanovich's Plum novel's, but are rich in desciption and it is easy to imagine what is going on - regardless of the absurdity of events (who ever heard of a computer going through menopause?...). The talking computer in the 'Maxmobile' added a sort of Bond twist, and enabled the investigations to go to a much deeper level.I will definitely continue reading the 'Full' series, and look forward to reading more Jamie and Maximillian adventures."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Stinker!","review":"I'm not sure what these ladies were thinking when they wrote this. I love the Stephanie Plum novels, but I absolutely hated the character DeeDee! She is so annoying I can't overlook her; all of the characters seem way over-the-top stereotypical. There's the gay assistant, the political ex-wrestler, the richy rich guy with only the best gadgets. Pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Again....","review":"will I buy an Evanovich and Hughes collaboration. I love the Stephanie Plum series by Evanovich, but I struggled thru the earlier book, Full House. And I couldn't even make it thru this one. It is AWFUL! I love to read. I read the cereal boxes at breakfast, but I couldn't make myself finish this book. The characters are very one dimensional. The writing is inconsistent (sometimes Max is the cousin and other times, he's the brother-in-law). Where was the editor? Please don't waste your time and/or money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adventuresome!","review":"No, this series is not like Stephanie Plum. This is not for Mystery fans, but more Romance fans. The Characters are well developed, but a bit far fetched, and the plots are a bit unbelievable. Even after all this I don't think it is a bad read. The story moves very quickly and is a page turner, it is not like you are getting bored throughout the book. I still am a fan and we will see as the series grows it may get better, there is a lot of room for that.Max and Dee Dee are back from Full House, twenty years later. Dee Dee's Husband, Frankie, is running for mayor and is looking for missing tax dollars. His brother-in-law, Max Holt, comes to town to help him out. Max is helping out one of his sister's friends, Jamie Swift, by investing in her news paper. There is an instant connection there!This was a fun, quick read, and full of adventure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best, but has some good points","review":"Full House had potential, and Max Holt was interesting in that, so I was looking forward to seeing him in Full Tilt. But he was totally different -- what happened to his change the world revolutionary zeal? I thought Muffin (the talking computer) was the best part of the book -- I did hear the audiobook version, which I think added a lot, because you hear her talking in her Marilyn Monroe voice. The wrestlers were just kind of there, not really doing anything funny as in the first book. I thought Beanie was okay, and I liked the relationship between him and Dee-dee, but I was disappointed in Dee-dee, who was so funny in the first book. Anyway, this is not up to Janet Evanovich's usual standards, sadly enough. It makes you appreciate her normal flair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed Bag","review":"Like many of the other reviewers, I was disappointed in this book. The heroine, Jamie, is not particularly likeable and was such a shrew to Max most of the time, that I had a hard time understanding his attraction to her. I particularly cringed every time the woman said \\"double damn\\" and stamped her foot. Come on... how old is Jamie supposed to be? Also the writing at times was sloppy. Max and Dee Dee's cousin Nick was once referred to as their uncle and then again as \\"Max\\". More careful proofreading, please.That being said, I _did_ enjoy the story. I'll buy the sequel because I think the Jamie/Max duo has promise and the storyline itself held my interest. At the end, I was ready to get in the car and go off with them. I'm just hoping that their next adventure finds Jamie in a better mood."},{"rating":"1","title":"DREADFUL -- DON'T BUY IF YOU'RE AN EVANOVICH FAN","review":"I'm sorry to say I'm one of the duped readers who put this dreadful little book on the best-seller list. I bought it on Evanovich's name alone, but wouldn't have if I'd had the sense to thumb through even the first two pages in the store. I've read and enjoyed all of Janet's Stephanie Plum series -- I suggest you buy one of those instead. (They're easy to spot, they have a number in the title, i.e., \\"Seven Up.\\") I've also enjoyed several of the out-of-print Evanovich romances and her Stephanie Plum Christmas book, although I'm neither a romance or mystery fan. Unlike any of Evanovich's other books, in Full Tilt the characters and plot are unbelievable and unsympathetic, the dialogue is stilted and forced, and Stephanie Plum's wit and intelligence are missing in Jamie Swift. Unfortunately, this means I'll be handling future Evanovich's with tongs -- or at least, a good, long in-store reading session before I plunk down the cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"I was sooooo disappointed! I buy the Stephanie Plum books in hardback so I know that Janet is usually good for the investment, but this book was BAD. The writing was so poor, it made me cringe. Didn't anyone edit it? The plot was weak and unoriginal, but I could never seem to get past the junior-high level poor grammar and cliche-ridden writing style. I rarely find it hard to finish a book--I'll slog through almost anything--but I skipped a large portion of this one to read the ending. The first book in the series was an acceptable early Evanovich. My advice to the publisher is to kill the rest of the series now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"What a waste of a few hours of my life! I thought I would get a few laughs from Janet E., even though I knew it wouldn't be the same as the Plum series...what a joke. Preposterous situations, no spark at all, totally predictable at the end. I won't be reading any more from this collaboration, that's for sure. I didn't care for any of these characters at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down...","review":"I, too, struggled through this book and was disappointed. It is very distracting when the lead character's brother-in-law is called his cousin sometimes and his brother-in-law at other times. It was a little difficult to read and it was the second book by her that I've read where there are inconsistencies. Why isn't the editor catching these errors?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I loved the adventures of Jamie and Max! After reading the first book, I immediately ordered the second book, etc. I was so upset when the series was over - I wanted more Jamie and Max! Actually, I still want more Jamie and Max, so I am hoping there will be another one.It's hard to compare this book to the Plum series - they are both different! I enjoyed both and look forward to more Janet Evanovich novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're better off waiting for the next Stephanie Plum","review":"Billionaire with a feminine version of a Knight Rider car drives into small-town newspaper editor's life, and it's mostly annoying.The book doesn't COMPLETELY lack a hope of romance or a mysterious element. And perhaps Full Tilt would have been better if we didn't already know and love Janet Evanovich and her ability to create a relaxed mystery with scandalous sexual tension. Chances are, you'll be disappointed at the cardboard-cutout characters, the substandard mystery and the perimenopausal automobile.Full Tilt wants to be a fun book, but really isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I started reading this hoping for the snappiness of the Stephanie Plum series but gave up before finishing. This series is just not worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I was totally shocked when I read Full Tilt. I am a big fan of Evanovich and could not believe how BAD the book was. I could only assume that the other author was responsible and Janet had lent her name to boost sales. I hope that future books by Evanovich will be like her other work - not great literature, but fun to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 stars.......","review":"okay i have been waiting to say this from the beginning of the book.....its crap!!...ok the jokes arent funny..character arent developed...they are just way too 2 dimensional...the attempted murders are just boring and so uninteresting....do not read this book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun book to read","review":"I bought this book to finish out the series that I had already started.

Rarely have I laughed so hard I cried. Great stress buster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"Max is The Man! Smart, sexy, hunky, fightin' fit...he's got it all! Jamie didn't have a chance.

At Christmastime, I read my first Evanovich book--her \\"Christmas\\" Stephanie Plum novelette--and loved it. I picked up Full Tilt and expected the same quality, but no. I read half way through the book and put it down. There was no hook, only meagre characterizations and \\"been there, done that\\" storyline. My advice to Janet E.--write books on your own and save your friends for shopping and lunching out."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"I am sorry to say: the worst of Evanovich. Stephanie Plum rules but this book has a lame plot, no memorable characters, no fun, no sex, one word BORING!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment!","review":"I was initially drawn to this book because of Janet Evanovich's name but I don't believe her input into the story was a major one. This book was a vague continuation of some of the characters from Full House. I found it difficult to believe that the young Max became the shallow, superficial adult Max. Worse than that was the character of Jamie - she seemed to be a mass of neuroses but generated little sympathy. The chemistry between the two was nil and there didn't seem to be any reason why either one would be attracted to the other. The mystery was not interesting and I found some of the supporting characters mean spirited, the rest were uninteresting at best. I will just stick to the Stephanie Plum books from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money...","review":"This is the typical story of dashing rich man sweeping beautiful lonely girl off her feet. There is nothing new with that. Then throw is a totally ridiculous talking car (imagine Kit from \\"Night Rider\\") and an uninteresting story line. What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is Terrible!.Another Disappointment From Evanovich","review":"After having wasted my money this past Christmas on \\"Visions Of Sugar Plums\\" , I trusted Janet Evanovich's name and reputation once more and was terribly disappointed again. Evanovich's Stephanie Plum novels are so much fun, and usually so consistently well written, that this awful collaboration with Charlotte Hughes is incomprehensible.It's just badly written and silly. Don't waste your money. Like I did. Again.All I can say is \\"To the Nines\\" had better make up for this!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Full Tilt(ing) downhill!","review":"I love the Stephanie Plum books and have read them all. Didn't care that much for the Christmas book but at least it was all Evanovich. I read \\"Full House\\" and while it wasn't on the same level as the Plum stories, it was entertaining enough. But this one has gone from fair to really poor. I do like romance novels as well as mysteries, but believe me this book missed in either genre. I think Evanovich is coming up with the characters and Charlotte Hughes is doing the writing. Full Tilt is missing something romantically. I didn't feel a real attraction or sexual tension between the main characters (not like what there is between Stephanie and Morelli or Ranger). Also, the computer in the car was stupid. Muffin didn't come accross as real at all. I definetly will not buy the next book in this series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I squirmed through this book, and wish I hadn't bothered. It's a dull psuedo-romance, neither \\"wacky\\" nor an \\"adventure\\". The situations and characters have potential but evolve into nothing, flat and lacking in interest, sex, and humor. I disliked Full House just as much--but a fabulous series like the Plums seemed to warrant a second chance for this series, too. I will NOT invest in a third Full-whatever if and when it appears.Maybe Evanovich helped outline, but if she was involved in the actual writing I'd be surprised. If this is representative of Hughes' writing style, I'm avoiding her books forever. If I could speak to the authors, I'd ask them to see if they could be more engaging and less annoying in the first person, rather than than the traditional romance-novel third."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother, it's not even by Evanovich","review":"This book was a terrible disappointment. I'd give it 0 stars if Amazon had that as a choice. I don't believe it was written by Evanovich at all. That \\"newcomer\\" Hughes must have convinced JE to put her name on the book just so it would sell. I arrived at this conclusion because the writing is so clumsy, devoid of humor, and markedly inferior to JE's other novels; it's not possible that JE's writing regressed to such a point. The characters are non-engaging cardboard cutouts with no authentic personality, unlike JE's Plum series.

Unfortunately, the container is poorly designed. When you take the lid off to give them water, the lady bugs (at whatever stage) wander into the crevice meant for the lid. They are then squished when you try to replace the lid. Out of the 10 larvae, we ended up with one lady beetle to release. The rest died in the manner described above. If the container was designed a little differently, we would consider buying more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money. Disappointing","review":"My daughter got this as a present. I had to pay $5 to get the ladybug larva delivered. Feel the first shipment should be for free. Then I had to put tape around all the seems because they were able to slip under the lid and escape. When they finally hatched from the cocoon stage they were brown not the typical red and black. I know that ladybugs come in all colors but his is designed for kids which expect red and black. It's cheaper and more fun to go to OSH and get a bucket of lady bugs which have about a hundred and then put those in the container. Would not buy this again I would just stick to their butterfly land"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried it Twice, Disappointed","review":"After the first disappointment, I decided to try again and order the lady bug larvae a second season. Just the larvae cost about as much as the entire kit itself. When it arrived, we followed the directions exactly. Sadly, there were only 4 living larvae (whereas the material promised something like 15) and they all died within 3 days. Even more disappointing, I wrote a letter to the company explaining my unhappiness, and they never wrote back. After mostly dead larvae twice now and poor customer service, I cannot recommend this kit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer!!","review":"This was a nightmare.

I don't think we can handle watching a repeat of the cannibalism.The new larvae behaved themselves (i.e., they didn't eat each other). They grew to maturity and we relaeased them into the backyard. I guess ladybugs, like love, can be better the second time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Pleased...","review":"My husband and I bought this for our 4 year old son for his birthday. The land arrived withen only a few days. We sent off for the ladybugs that night and the wait began. After a week, I checked my bank and found they had cashed the check, so I waited some more. I called after about 10 days and found out the ladybug had shipped. The ladybugs arrived 13 days after shipment and most were dead. My son was vey upset, he was looking forward to having his ladybugs. We did what we could to help the 2 that made it here alive, but it was to no avail. The paper that comes with the ladybug started to grow mold, as did the sponge inside. We also found out the ladybugs are allergenic, so parents be warned.

We sent off our card and waited for our ladybugs to arrive...and waited...and waited...and waited. Finally I contacted Insect Lore who said the ladybugs must have got lost in the mail and sent me a coupon to order them again. They asked that I wait until the end of September to order so it was cooler (we live in Miami). So I waited until the beginning of October, sent our card in and again waited for nothing.

I was a bit nervous that the ladybugs wouldn't make it as many of the reviews had mentioned, but decided to take the chance anyway. I was happy I did. Surprisingly, every single one of our larva turned into a ladybug. I think I was more excited than my daughter to watch the transformation into ladybugs. My daughter did enjoy keeping the watering pad moist to \\"care\\" for the little critters. One of our ladybugs was a bit of a late bloomer. I thought for sure he didn't make it, but two days after the rest had emerged from their pupa, that one finally did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift for the bug lover!","review":"My 7 year old recieved this as a gift for his birthday.

The only exciting day of insect watching came the day that the shipment arrived from Insect Lore - the ladybug larvae moved around a lot for about a day, then hid for almost 5 days while they turned into ladybugs. Once they were ladybugs, they just sat around and didn't do anything (they only seemed to move when we weren't looking at them). Then they died. Wow, what a letdown. Next time, we'll go with an old-fashioned ant farm!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip OFF!!!","review":"We ordered the Lady Bug Land for our daughter for Easter. There were no lady bugs included! NO WHERE on the order form in their catalogue or on their website does it say anything about the lady bugs NOT being included. So they give you a coupon and an order form that says you have to include FIVE DOLLARS for shipping and handling of the lady bugs, after we already paid $19.99. TOTAL RIP OFF.

I often found myself pressed for time, and the sheer volume of each chapter was frustrating, such that I often skimmed for context, copied definitions, and then read through the summary for all the important things. Furthermore, I found that doing so was an effective way of studying for my class.I know that the subject material is interesting.

At this point ih her career, Allende did not need to sell herself as the \\"sexy Latina\\" we see on her book.

I am an avid reader, and besides \\"Paula\\" I've read all her books. Some of them I loved, some of them i just enjoyed, for her style of writing is unique and masterful enough to keep one wanting to read on. The \\"Aphrodite\\" however was most dissapointing. For me, it looked more like an unedited, hastily printed diary, then either the cookbook or a study of aphrodisiacs, as the book appears to have been intended. Sure enough, Allende hasn't lost her wit or the ability to write compelling stories. It had probably more of the \\"personal\\" touch then most of her previous books, and that I found quite compelling and worthy the time spent. However, the book as a whole seems to lack something, it feels just too \\"loosely\\" bound ! I'm hoping that her next book will not be more \\"commercial\\", riding on the fame one. Give us another \\"Eva Luna\\" Isabel. I love your books too much to believe that \\"Aphrodite\\" is \\"IT\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was too self involved and trite to be enjoyable","review":"Aphrodite was a terrible disappointment to a die-hard Allende fan.

Isabel Allende touched the subject with humour, art and wit. In a book that is like a Pandora box, you can find a carefully blended range of elements. Nicely mixed with the text are reproductions of beutiful art work and sensual cooking recipies all related to Allende's theme of sensuality. You can feel her mischivious spirit in this book. She allows you to touch the tantalizing flavours with your imagination and savour them discretely without offending the hidden puritan in all of us, but rather with a grin in our faces. If you have a sense of humour, enjoy cooking and appreciate art, you will enjoy this book as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"tasty","review":"Isabel is hilarious and also many good recipes. a laugh out loud cook book for unusual recipes.

It concentrates less on legal strategy, and more on adventure. I was not enjoying it much, until he went to Mexico to uncover the truth about a shady operation that involved his murdered friend. The action in Mexico in the last half of the book was excellent, bring the book up from a 2 to a 4 star rating in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Grisham He's Not","review":"My first impression of Steve Martini's writing style was certainly not a good one. I have a pretty good opening sequence where two lawyers are gunned down gangland style, the story creeps into a boring state. Shallow character development and poor introduction of other players in this novel cause me to wonder,\\"What's going on here?\\"A few action scenes emerge to wake me from slumber. The description gets a little better. An interesting betrayal than takes place. However, the ending is about as realistic as a poor Stephen Segal movie.I will consider try reading another book by Stephen Martini. He seems to have several legal thrillers on the market. However, The Arraignment novel did not strike my fancy in the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much court-based...","review":"I've read the whole Madriani's episodes and I think this is the less interesting. In general, Steve Martini is really bright in portraying the defense-prosecutor in court fight. All of his \\"trial-based\\" books are very entertaining. I can't say the same of this one - that is, in fact, a bit \\"far\\" from Martini's usual milieu. It is, nevertheless, a good reading, but don't expect Madriani at his best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Paul Madriani fan","review":"I was disappointed by The Arraignment. In all the previous stories in the Paul Madriani series, plots are advanced and suspense is built through nicely crafted testimony and cross-examination in the courtroom. No such courtroom scenes are to be found in The Arraignment. Instead, author Steve Martini tells a more visual story, with action sequences that he seems to have written with visions of a movie deal dancing through his head - knife fights, gun battles, and even a James Bondish scene in which two men on an ultralight plane spray a hotel pool deck with bullets while Madriani runs and dives and bloodies himself eluding the gunfire (rather than simply taking refuge inside the hotel). The book ends with a lengthy epilogue that is needed to explain the convoluted actions and motivations that lie behind this tortured tale. If there's another book in this series, Martini would do well to return Madriani to the place he performs best, in the courtroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"The story started off with great promise. Then it just died. The last part is so disappointing that I can hardly finish reading it. The writer didn't seem to know what he wanted to say or how to end the story. He just made up some totally ridiculous plots to try to tie everything together. And it doesn't work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plodding, Boring, Low Tension \\"Thriller\\"","review":"This is not one of Martini's better efforts - very plodding plot, and pretty [weak] most of the way. I often put the book down for days on end, with little desire to get back to it! That is very atypical of me when I am reading a well-crafted thriller. This is a legal hackpiece that is hardly worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven","review":"With Steve Martini's The Arraignment, I found a very uneven mystery. The characters seem flat and shallow, although maybe you have to read from the beginning of the Paul Madriani series to get more background on recurring characters. The writing seems rather bland and dry. Some parts were very predictable and I figured out the villan halfway through the book (something I don't usually do). The first half of the book showed great promise, and then proceeded to sink with each successive page. The plot was very convoluted, and even at the end when things were somewhat explained, it still seemed totally unbelievable. Too many questions were left unanswered and the entire plot didn't make sense. As someone who reads dozens and dozens of mysteries every year, I wasn't impressed with Mr. Martini."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looked like stolen goods","review":"Received this CD program that appeared to be stolen goods.

The title is grossly misleading. In fact after reading the book one wonders why it was named as it was because it has so little to do with the plot or action in the book. Madriani becomes some kind of private detective in this book after a friend of his dies in a hail of bullets while talking to a client outside the courthouse before the client is to be arraigned. That's as close as this book ever gets to a courtroom. The rest of it entails Madriani trying to find out what his friend was involved with and why he was killed, which nearly gets Madriani killed. The answer is not particularly interesting and how it is revealed is less so. There really is little to recommend this book....and I don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Martini - but this one was weak","review":"As others have mentioned, Martini does a good job bringing the reader along but starts to lose grip of the story and the reader when he goes to Mexico. I can't recall an ending like that ever. It's like he didn't know how to conclude it properly, so he just had to explain everything at the end without incorporating it into the plot. It was easy enough to know Tolt was a bad guy, but you can't save all the facts for the last page or two. Just very disappointing and not worth the read I'm afraid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not one of his better novels, but not bad...","review":"I'll have to say I've enjoyed some of Martini's other work better than this one. But still, I read the book almost without stopping because I enjoy this author's style of writing. I think what disappointed me more than anything is the fact I had the plot figured out from the beginning and the story ended as I thought it would. Regardless, I would recommend the book to anyone for a good read and I'll be waiting for another Martini book in the future. I'll have to admit the beginning of Chapter 7 on page 82 really tickled me. Apparently, Martini/Madriani has his own views on journalism's \\"spin\\" nowadays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half Action Half Lawyer - Half Baked","review":"In his other books when he fully concentrates on law or on thriller (e.g. critical mass) he is able to put his full heart behind his writing. This book really meanders. It starts off as a legal stories wanders as a narrative in the middle and ends up as a half baked thriller story. There are two stories intertwined but neither is explained easily. Suddenly our dear lawyer has become an action hero. How he survives multiple spots where he would get killed beats me. When you try to do a number of things you often end of doing none of them well."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Happens in the Epilogue","review":"Arraignment was my first Steve Martini book, and I followed the convoluted plot with interest. Much of the plot was implausible but still interesting and worth the time. However, when the denouement occurred in the epilogue, I was stunned. Mr. Martini ends the last chapter of his book with loose ends everywhere. This forces him to give the reader information in the epilogue that he has omitted in the plot. I will give Mr. Martini's work one more chance, but I would not recommend Arraingment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This book was highly recommended but I was totally disappointed. It started out okay but then got boring. There was no character in the book that I cared about or frankly, how the story ended. It went 100 pages way to long. It was dragged out, to wordy. Not sure I would read his books again. After reading just a few pages, I would fall asleep. Found this book to be a great cure for insomnia.I have read better murder mysteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I picked up this paperback in the airport while my flight was delayed and had high hopes for it.Like most have already said, the first half of the book looked good, but fell apart at the end.This was the first book I have read by Mr. Martini and may be the last.If you like this sort of book, go for David Baldacci instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Legal thriller that misses the mark","review":"Heard the taped version of THE ARRAIGNMENT, a legal thrillerby Steve Martini . . . it again features a recurring character (defenseattorney Paul Madriani), yet this time there's more adventurethan courtroom drama--leaving me disappointed . . . also,the plot was overly convoluted . . . it starts off with the murderof a friend on a crowded city street and winds up on a questfrom California to the jungles of Mexico . . . the only savinggrace for me was in the fact that Joe Mantegna's reading wasexcellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for bigger framed individuals","review":"it seemed to sit on my wrist bone quite uncomfortably.

I was expecting this food mill to last much longer considering the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I bought this food mill as an upgrade from my ancient aluminum Foley because it got the top rating from Cook's Illustrated magazine. Like several other reviewers, I find that the knob falls off the handle after just a couple of turns, rendering the device practically useless. I have emailed the manufacturer which claims to have 25-year warranties on their products. We'll see what they say. But for a product that costs this much -- now even more expensive than when I bought it -- it should work flawlessly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knob Unscrews--Frustrating","review":"For the price this food mill is a frustrating piece of poor engineering. Cuisipro missed the mark. I have to spin the knob back down when using it every few turns or it will unscrew and come off.

I like making mashed potatoes in it much more than in a potato ricer, since I can add a lot of potatoes at once. With the ricer, the first batches are cool by the time the last ones are done!I like the fact that this food mill came with 3 different plates; fine, medium, and coarse. My old one only had one plate. I like the way it is easy to hook over a bowl to use. I would have preferred a regular screw bolt, or whatever you call it, to keep the crank on, instead of what seems like a very flimsy plastic 'scraper'. The rest of the foodmill seems to be very well constructed, then the put a clip on plastic gadget on the bottom that can't possibly last for very many years. Very puzzling! Yet I will enjoy it while the clip lasts, and then find something else that will hold the crank on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tiny Euroface","review":"It's quite a nice product, but is really small for a standar room.

My favorites - \\"Don't Chain My Heart\\", \\"How Many Times\\", and even the title track (which is very loud and powerful). As usual, there are some slower songs like \\"Wings Of Time\\" and \\"The Other Side\\" that are definitely worth a listen.Overall, this shows that TOTO is not just a rock/pop group but can also contend with the big boys. Unfortunately this also marks the departure of drummer extrordinare Jeff Porcaro who was taken way too soon (RIP).Shame on the U.S. airwaves for failing to recognize a continued talented band and kicking them to the curb!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Toto album","review":"I'm a Toto fan so I can say without hesitation that this is clearly the worst Toto album.

Ill stick with the Toto of the early 80's where Toto IV ROCKS."},{"rating":"1","title":"The other perspective","review":"If you are in the group of fans who thought that Toto IV through The Seventh One produced some of the most airtight performances on the planet (and I'll throw out \\"Waiting For Your Love\\" and \\"You Got Me\\" as examples), then I strongly advise you sample whatever sounds you can from \\"Kingdom of Desire\\" before purchasing. When I first put it on I thought I was listening to any one of a dozen early 80's rock bands. I warmed up to it a little at around the 8th track - there is some nice work from this point on, and there is plenty of good material for David Paich fans on this cd.In my humble opinion, Toto are one of the most talented groups ever assembled (in any of their incarnations) but I wasn't thrilled with the Rock direction they took on this album. It seems almost like a step backwards for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good writing, uncomfortable content","review":"While I appreciated Thomas's writing ability and the interesting organization of this book, I felt very uncomfortable with the sexual content.

I was looking for a seated practice that would support me in easing back into poses. This DVD did not do that. It is appropriate for *total* beginners only. Each of the two classes lasts only 10 minutes and is so basic that it really only hints at asana. Several minutes on each are dedicated to *very* simple breathing. One class spends 2-3 minutes on meridian tapping in the hands that is more like qigong than yoga. The majority of the DVD is spent on the instruction segments (35 minutes for each class), again aimed toward total beginners. I found the instruction uninspired.

Unfortunately, Mic Geronimo never got the credit that his counterparts did, but I honestly think his 1st LP was better than the other artist's cataloge. (Except Jay-Z)This LP will make you want to get a pair of Tims and represent. There's only a couple of tracks that make the LP a little bumpy, Mic's attempt at making a radio/R&B; track.

Mic is like a cross between NaS (His Lyrical Skillz) and LL Cool J (His Playa imige). Mic hails from queens, NY and Any body who knows his rap knows that queens has brought forth some of the games greatest MC's ( ATCQ,Onyxs, Ja Rule etc) and that aloone makes his album worth a listen.

In order to do this, Flip must confront her own insecurities and mature while at the same time try to help the boy she is in love with solve a mystery that will allow him to become whole. This mystery/romance deals with growing up, much like Michael Segedy's Hampton Road, a psychological thriller that deals with love and social conflict- a must read).A great romance story and mystery that will keep you spellbound!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"I love this book!

However, they had an overpowering flowery smell that made me downright sick. The smell was so bad and so powerful that I had to immediately go over the surface I had cleaned with another cleaning product to get rid of the smell of these wipes. The only people who I could imagine liking these are those who like really heavy, flowery perfumes. Not me. After using just two wipes, I threw away the whole package.

I also am certain that the Big Screen awaits the Lambert Series.Very Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor book","review":"I have ordered many many things on Amazon, but this is my first time ever to write a review. I ordered this book because it had very good reviews (like 165 5 star out of 167 total). So I thought it must be good and since I like mysteries I should enjoy it. I was surprised how much the reviews can be missleading! This book is all about sex and alcohol. Yes, there is nothing wrong with those two, but everybody sleeps with everyone (at the same time) and everybody is getting drunk all the time. Nothing deep or tuchy. The author uses the same words and expressions throughout all the book. Boring, not a pinch of excitment in this book and I couldn't find where the mystery was??? This book is like a very very bad soap opera."},{"rating":"2","title":"TERRIFIC ENDING TO POPULAR SOAP OPERA!!!!!","review":"I'm such a LAMBERT fan...That being said, the last book in this world-wide popular soap opera was to die for!

I will absolutely be on the lookout for more hot stories by this very fun writer! (Thief of Hearts, both compelled me and repulsed me as a reader, Forbidden, pulled me in, Friendly Enemies, hooked me, and Le Fin completely captivated me until the last page had been read. You think I'm kidding? Read the series as a whole and I think you will agree when I say this is one of the most fun series I have read in a very long time!) You will have to read all four books to understand what I mean. I enjoyed all of the emotions I felt as I read each book.

Without doubt Le Fin is the best book in the series so if any readers out there who want to save the expense and the time of reading the entire LAMBERT series no worries...start here...I mean with this book, the writer did a super job of keeping her readers all caught up with everything from the first three books.

Gabe and Nouri belong together so I was thrilled they wound up together even though for a long time I didn't think they would, whew! When the writer stated on the back cover of this book, 'falling in love, out of love, and in love again,' she really meant it!

I only found a handful of recipes that used natural sweetners (like juice concentrates).I understand that fructose does not raise blood sugar as quickly however it is just as bad as sucrose which I am trying to avoid in my diet.I would recommend this for diabetics only; for those that are thinking about buying this book for a life-style change and desiring to eat healthier, try \\"Feeding Your Family\\" by Cynthia Lair. She actually gives natural sugar-subsitutes and offers a great about of recipes for a healthy life-style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as the reviews say","review":"I just wanted to lend another perspective to the reviews written here for this book because I bought this book based on those reviews and was very disappointed. The majority of the recipes call for sugar substitutes such as Sugar Twin or Equal, which is okay, but I was expecting more recipes involving natural sweeteners, like juices. A lot of the recipes are not really recipes - for example, fruit jam roll-ups are simply refrigerated crescent rolls with no-sugar jam and nuts - wow, I needed a recipe book for that? Also, the recipe instructions are annoyingly vague - I can make up my own recipe and estimate and correct for, but when I purchase a cookbook, I expect exact and detailed measurements and instructions. Overall, it certainly isn't a 5-star book, and I just wanted to write this review so other people thinking of buying this book would not be disappointed when they got it and tried the recipes. I wish I would have looked for a Splenda cookbook instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"No sugar - but lots of white flour","review":"I was disappointed that most of these recipes still use refined white flour or cake flour. These refined carbohydrates can spike blood sugar too, just like sugar does. Probably the only recipes I'll be able to use are the ones for custards, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best desserts I have ever tasted!","review":"I can not believe how wonderful these desserts taste. It is incredible that no artifical sweetners were added. Not only are these receipes good for our health but, they are low in fat. That is a big plus considering we are always watching our weight. Definitely 5 star all the way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of its kind!","review":"I'm 15, and never really was one for classical vocal music. But when I heard Arleen Augers sing I was walking on a cloud! It's absolutely beautiful. The pure, rich quality of her voice is something unmatched, and her choice in music is breathtaking. I would implore anyone and everyone to add this CD to their collection. It's sheer perfection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love \\"Love Songs\\"!","review":"This is an exquisite collection containing some wonderful basic songs for intermediate singers (Schumann, Quilter, Schubert) and challenging ones for more advanced voices (Copland, Poulenc). Auger is, as always, as close to perfection as a human can be: the line in her voice soars, connects, inspires. This is a fabulous collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Voice of experience","review":"There isn't much I can add to the praise bestowed on this album by earlier reviewers. I do think though that a special poignancy is undeniable since Auger's voice, while still beautiful, clearly is not that of a young singer. Her maturity makes her interpretations of these love songs all the more touching. I've probably played this CD a dozen times through the years, far more than any other in my collection. It remains consistently and deeply satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"feather bed cover","review":"Actually thought I had cancelled this order, but decided to keep it when I examined the merchandise.

At $1, it's an excellent resource to help one familiarize oneself with the war."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Slash Across the Cultural Vein","review":"In this early collection of mainstream fiction, Harlan Ellison looks at the violent subculture of the punk, the addict, any person who finds themselves of the underside of life. Mr. Ellison has gone underground as a member of a street gang, among other jobs, and his experiences ring through in every story. HE pulls no punches, and the cumulative effect brings a truth to these urban fables."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative","review":"I have had a copy of this book since the early 80's. I bought it because I am a Christian Bible teacher and wanted to understand the rituals and customs of Biblical times. It has given me insight into the mindset of people during those days and helped me make my teaching more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely useful for historic research.","review":"I'm giving this book 5 stars for the fact that I have good memories associated with finding an old tattered copy of this book in my library and sitting with it for hours on end. I think this book is great for the fact that it gives you the backgrounds on Vlad Dracul, the \\"historic Dracula\\", Lady Bathory and so forth. The first chapter or so of the book is indispensible for its coverage of the vampiric myth from ancient times through the spread of Christianity and its influence on the vampire's nature. Though certain things can be disputed in the book by some hard core historians, it's a great intro read on vampires, and for some just a good read on European cultural details during the times addressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garage door is working!","review":"My garage door slipped one day almost crushing my car.

Sears is around $20, a local garage shop actually asked $45. I always order two now at a time. The installation is very simple, I would estimate 15-20 minutes and definitely doable for anyone with basic mechanical skills.The problem as other reviewers have stated is with the design. The carriage should be made out of brass to extend its service life. In the plastic version I am changing the carriages out every 2-3 years as a preventive maintenance step even before they fail (you should expect them to fail after 3 years under normal use, better to do it before the door comes crashing down)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't play my Blue Ray discs","review":"I bought this player in June, I did not get a 1080p tv until Dec. The player plays my regular dvd's fine but when I tried a couple of blue ray discs I discovered. 1.The third Pirates Of The Carribien movie would only play the previews and the bonus disc, and 2.The third Resident Evil movie will not play at all. I called Phillips customer care and they sent me another player ( this took 10 days ). The replacement acted exactly the same as the first. After another call to Phillips I was finally told that this was a known problem and they would be getting back to me in a day or 2. I am still waiting for them to resolve the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't Play Some Discs","review":"For the money, I am pretty disappointed that this player will not play some discs.

And they only have one album (as opposed to the Mum from Iceland). Beware, the cover of that album shows a picture of two heads together behind a mans belly and a light blue background.So despite of where the link in the name of the group may lead you, it does not match with the factual origin of the music.Hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very big deal....","review":"With \\"Wonderful Life\\" Lara Fabian finally has all the right songs on the right album.\\"No big deal\\", \\"The last goodbye\\" and \\"Review my kisses\\" stand the best chance of hitting the US Pop Charts.

There is no better singer on the international stage today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Life","review":"I very much enjoy this CD, and Lara Fabian has made \\"A Wonderful Life\\" her own.

Celine is my favorite of all time so i disagree when a reviewer states this album was better then celines'. i feel more of the emotion in a song when she sings and less when lara sings though i still think she has a great voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clay just isn't good no matter how prestige.","review":"I tried this litter and it was supposedly the best out of all clay litters, my problem is even for the cost, it doesn't do very well with odor. Your home will smell like litter all day. I will admit, I am not a fan of clay litters as they are much too dusty. Natural pine and some corns are much better, I also recommend using some Dr. Eisley's Cat Attract temporarily on top of the litter if you want to transition your cat to natural litters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived in very poor shape!!!","review":"I have been using Ever Clean for 25 years. While it's an outstanding product, it's unfortunately very heavy. When my shipment was packed at the vendor, someone slashed the container with a box cutter. There was 14 lbs. of litter scattered over my kitchen floor. (Also totally jammed my dust buster when I tried clean up the stuff in the corners). In fairness, delivery was very quick but obviously too messy for words"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS LAMP","review":"I recently bought this lamp for my nursery even though is was a little expensive. After plugging it in I put a bulb in it and it went up in flames. Luckily it went out quick but I was scared I had been electricuted, not what you want to happen when you are eight months pregnant. Don't buy this item it has faulty wiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful shade","review":"I was a little hesitant about this lamp because of the price, but once I got it home and pluged it in, I was very pleased. It is beautiful turned off, but even more beautiful at night when it is turned on. It is a perfect addition to our little boy's room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful lamp","review":"Yes, it's a little expensive, but it is SO hard to find any good green and yellow baby accessories. I love it and have had no problems with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshing delight!","review":"A rich melange of exotic music tempered with a \\"back porch\\", folksy touch...I en-n-n-joyed it! A keeper?... YES!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough to be a textbook","review":"It is refreshing to find a book on youth gangs and violence that avoids the ideological quagmire of either A) seeing the past through rose-colored glasses and calling for a return to \\"traditional values,\\" and B) claiming that all violent criminals are victims of a heartless society. Young Thugs explores the possible reasons that lure teenagers to violence, joining gangs, and participating in illegal activities. The book is organized into chapters that explore these different topics, and makes a good textbook to stimulate discussion with students. As an university lecturer, I have chosen it as a textbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"luvly","review":"first of all the cd looks beautiful. i'm listening to track8:tristan & process remix of kiba now and as all good psytrance should it is feeding my mind and making it flow at a lovely pace .track 9 just kicked in now , taiyo the chakra remix.this one is a bit darker but extremely energetic and also a bit understated until the death metal guitar sample hits..wooohoo!overall this one is extemely tasty!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Very Disappointed!! I ordered this for my daughter for Christmas. The sprayer leaked the perfume all over your hands. I let the company know and they sent us another one and it did the same thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"I've been enjoying Tommy fragrances since 1996. I especially like the TommyGirl Summer special edition 2002. This is the first time I tried the body mist and I really love it. It has a nice light scent and makes my skin shimmer. Perfect for summer with a tan. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tommy Girl Shimmer Perfume","review":"I really enjoy this perfume, the bonus is that it has glitter in it for the added touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book.","review":"Highly recommend this book! Keeps you on the edge of your seat. I will certainly read more books by Chuck Holton and Gayle Roper."},{"rating":"2","title":"What any fan has waited for...","review":"Dear friends, I must say that this is the best release Marillion has given in years. It's everything a fan ha dreamt of, specially those who discovered this great band too late in time to get the original singles. The whole bunch, whith ALL the different version of the singles, in a boxed set, with really good quality sound is too much to believe. If you are a fan and still haven't got it, you should. If you're not a fan, the it's a great chance to get a really deep look into the best songs of this great band. Slainthe Mhath!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Source of Information","review":"A good source of information and handy reference when trying to work one's way through the complex world of television and film contracts. Of course, there is no substitute for real legal advice. If anything, the information in this book enables one speak intelligently with one's own attorneys."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Age at its Best","review":"For a new artist, this guy has it on! I have been hypnotized with this music since I bought it. It brings forth my memories and emotions and places them into Egypt's past. I can truly imagine what Egypt was like with this music. I highly recommend it. If you enjoy music of all kinds, this is a must. Its almost like a movie soundtrack, with memorable themes througout the CD.I give it five stars, no complaints, every song is good. Go for it, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Czech it out!","review":"This is great stuff -- I suppose I'm biased since I'm (a) a sucker for good mysteries and (b) an aficianado of Eastern European literature. With this little gem you get the best of both worlds: philosophical musings, superb characterizations, and clever crime stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Finish It","review":"I really couldn't wrap my brain around these supposed \\"mysteries.\\" Perhaps they are a great reflection of the eastern European psyche, but after four or five pointless stories, with their stilted dialogue and inane solutions, I gave up. My spouse also enjoys mystery tales, and her tastes are certainly different from mine, but she was also unwilling to read more than a couple of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-written but inevitably lacking","review":"I \\"saved\\" this book for several years, thinking it would be another Rushdie book to savour. When I finally read it, I felt that it was mere journalism, OK, maybe well-written journalism, but.... I did not find the flavour of Central America (though I have never been to Nicaragua), but rather the observations of a keen mind in a situation that was quite unfamiliar. The resulting book, I fear, shows that unfamiliarity. I thought, \\"Yes, Rushdie, from another Third World country with a certain style of contradiction, would understand Nicaragua and the revolutionary process with a special eye.\\" I think the latter (process) turned out to be largely true, but not the former (Nicaragua). I would recommend this book to all authors who might feel that they could produce an excellent book on a place they know little about. Travel writers are excused, because they write about travel, not necessarily deep insights. But a major novelist ? I thought it would be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I lost interest in the book","review":"It was not what I expected. I lost interest in reading it, and I abandoned it. I will not be buying any more from that author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book, subject even more so, deserves reevaluation","review":"I just saw a film on present-day Nicaragua, a country that's no longer flavour of the month, at least as far as the world's press is concerned. It's been at least 15 years since I've read this book. I liked it fairly well then, and feel that, though Rushdie might have been a bit too kind to the Sandinistas (who deserve much of the criticism they received) the fact that Nicaragua was robbed blind by Somoza (who stole relief money for the earthquake that hit Managua in the 1970s)and, it seems, by the penultimate president, Aleman (convicted of financial wrongdoings but certainly not jailed)gives the Sandinistas' programs (redistribution of land,literacy, and the equal participation of women in Nicaraguan life)some credibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly packed","review":"This product arrived in a broken container with the contents totally spilled all over the box. I immediately called Amazon and the rep had me order from a different merchant. I love the product. I use it for my nails. They are not stronger but they have lost the ridges that one gets with age. They look way better!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lotion","review":"Come without leakage, works as it always has- perfect!

For dry skin, you can't believe the difference after using this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoof Maker","review":"Hoof maker is the best product for dry and cracked hands and feet. It is non greasy and we use it all winter long. Fantastic product would recommend for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb","review":"Nobody will ever pay this much for those resident evil games. i own every single resident evil game to date and i know that no one out there will pay this much. ur just ripping people off. specially when ur Resident evil 3 is missing the booklet. and ur resident evil 1 is a greatest hit edition. i have the original with booklets for all of mine. and people can find those anywhere and buy all for and only spend less than 60 bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"little shop","review":"Good sheet music, but missing alot of songs fromt he movie. Easy to play, but meaty enough for rehearsals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and Cumbersome","review":"This is little more than an extended Griffiths. I gained very little from this book. Most likely you are buying this for a class, but you would be better off with Griffiths or maybe Sakuria."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs 3rd edition!!","review":"I had this book for my first quarter of QM (undergrad level), and I had Griffiths for my 2nd quarter. If I had had Griffiths to start, I wouldn't have even opened this book. It is a very well rounded book, but not very good for an introductory text. The print/font made it impossible to try to find something when flipping through the pages. Quantum mechanics can be very interesting and intriguing if presented properly. This book did not. It was like reading the dictionary, whereas Griffiths or even Gasiorowicz was like a good novel: you wanted to keep going and learning more... This book is tedious. BUT it doesn't say \\"Introductory\\" in the title, so maybe my review would be higher if this had been my textbook after becoming familiar with the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fine Print","review":"From the outside, this book appeared to be identical to that of my colleages. However, a quick glance inside immediately shows its inferior nature. The print quality is horrible. It is much less clear than the rough draft setting on my hp deskjet at home. In some instances, the fine print is rendered illegible. It is particularly problematic when flipping through the pages in reference or review. The fuzzy print makes it difficult or impossible to find what you're looking for without carefully reading the page. This unfortunate feature greatly diminishes the value of this otherwise excellent textbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quantum Book","review":"I've worked from several texts. Shankar is far better than Liboff, but then that's not saying a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great for first time QM students","review":"I am taking a class that reviews QM but unfortunately I never took QM as an undergrad. So this book isn't very good if you are trying to get a comprehensive overview of QM. It seemed to have a lot of derivations and information though so if you are looking for a more in depth course this will probably help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shankar lacks empathy","review":"A 2 because one of the first lines state \\"this book is selfcontained for someone with no knowledge of the subject and blah blah blah it should be readable and easy\\" this book is mightly confusing and rather boring. Shankar's style is akin to trying to give someone directions in a totally strange land to a unknown place by waving their hands in the air and telling you which way to go. This type of thing may be fine if you're speaking to someone who knows the land--a professor of the subject maybe, but is flirting with confussion for a student. A 2 simpling because this might be a great book--once you know the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning Not For Those Who Are Struggling","review":"I bought this book when I tried to learn QM by myself. I am not stupidand I know how to differentiate and to integrate but boy is this bookhard to understand. This is a book for people who already understandthe subject not for those who have major problems understanding it.If you have an IQ of 170 then this book is for you. If you are aroundthe 120-130 mark and have trouble with advanced math I recommend startingwith Linus Paulings - Introduction To Quantum Mechanics.You have been warned :)John"},{"rating":"1","title":"catastrophe!!!","review":"[...] this book has nothing to do with QM , it explain so poorly the materiel that some times it's struck me how easily this writer can take simple thing like infinite wall potential and make it complicated!Amazing!There are no examples in this book ! Yes you read right NO EXAMPLES! There are some excises that you can do in your spare time..this look like some lecture note from a prof, that didn't have much time to make it to a real book, don't even hesitate to ask yourself which one is better this or Cohen tanudji...The mathematical introduction that every one is getting excited here is nothing less then total blurr,The good thing in this book is that all the subjects in QM appear there, that's true, but for sure you can not learn any of them ,,..[...]pitty there is only one star grade as the lowest grade one can give, otherwise I would give this book something that look like planck contstant.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit bottle","review":"The pump does not fit the 64 oz Torani pumpkin spice sauce container.

I can barely hear the music, plus it is not really \\"boogie\\" choreography. The quality of the DVD is questionable... it froze up on me and then often gave me a message (skipping over the damaged areas). Maybe it is because it is a \\"Time Life\\" DVD. It say's on the back.... \\"New, pumped up versions of the '70s hits\\".... But, IMO, it is a watered down and muffled version! Or maybe the quality of the DVD (damaged) causes the poor sound system. Don't waste your money like I did. I'd give it a NO Star rating but the system won't let me! Stick with the original Richard Simmons Sweatin' To The Oldies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too difficult to do for me","review":"Withing the first minute, I quit doing this video.
