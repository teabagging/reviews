However, miss Fischer should pay more attention to the details instead of get every note just right. There aren't huge mistakes, which makes it worthy, but it isn't perfect. The booklet says that she's quite young to perform all of this pieces and I believe it's true. She can improve in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bach by Julia Fischer","review":"You must listen to this with SACD kit to do justice to the recording. OK CD layer is not too bad but with sensitive equipment you can hear so much more with the SACD it is unbelievable.She is one of the best performers of Bach solo pieces if not the best. Milstein, Kagan, Grumiaux, Perlman are good. But she is something else. Timing, fluidity, expression I can go on and on. This is the most \\"musical\\" interpretation of these pieces I have heard so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great playing, but not a great traversal of the S&P's.","review":"I am in complete agreement with Mr. Larson's review. Fischer plays the notes impeccably, but there's a complete lack of spirit, drama, flexibility of tempo, and contrast of color and dynamics. Her playing is metronomic, turning some of Bach's greatest music into a series of student exercises.There are plenty of technically adept violinists with the technique to play this music flawlessly, but who have more to say interpretively (try Szeryng, Ehnes, or Tetzlaff, for examples). And then there are those who are slightly less than perfect, like Gidon Kremer, whose Bach is breathtaking beyond works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Julia Fischer performs J.S.Bach's Sonatas and Partitas for Solo Violin","review":"In March I heard Julia Fischer playing Khachaturian's violin concerto at a concert at the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C. She is such a wonderful violinist that soon after I got home I checked what other performance of hers would be available from Amazon. When I saw this CD I promptly ordered it. Because on this CD she plays without an orchestra, her virtuosity is even more obvious and superb than in the concertos where she is accompanied by a full orchestra. I recommend this CD to everybody who likes the violin music of J.S.Bach!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could rate this half a star I would","review":"I bought this storage tower years ago.Unfortunately, the other reviewers are correct.This product was a waste of money as it seems to always tip over if I were to completely fill the slots with cd's.I'm sure the other consumers purchased this because of its sleek appearance.

However, though the Scriptures are reliable (of course), it is the added notes & advice that should give parents & pastors concern. Be advised that some of the advice given to young men here is questionable and unwise, particularly on social issues and dating. Instead, I would recommend a Study Bible geared toward teens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Refuel is rewrote","review":"This so called Bible in magazine format is full of inaccurate wording.

There is nothing wrong with this approach as long as your goal is simply to read and write the language. This particular book is of little use to a person who wishes to speak the language, but is an excellent reading and composition manual.

This is the worst movie I have seen so far. I did not even finish it. The reason is simple. It looks at Gould more as an oddity than a prolific artist of the 20th century. It discusses things such as his love life. Nobody needs to know about that. I care about Gould as an artist and as a man but not about his private life. I thought that this movie would give me something new about Gould but it did not. This is not the right movie for a true Glenn Gould fan. I would recommened Glenn Gould: The Alchemist if you really want to see Glenn Gould the man and the artist.

I knew everything that was gonna happen in this movie. From the first seen you can tell it's gonna suck. *Spoiler* The first seen has a guy walking down a dorm hallway, when he hears a door open and close and goes to check it out. The lights flicker (Wow how original) and a person... in a really, really stupid mask shows up and kills him with an ax. This is what happens throughout the entire movie.

Jeff Conaway looks like he's on Prozac, and we have Chad Allen as the seemingly strange bad boy. The pacing in the first part of the movie is very slow, and even when it picks up, it's with such erratic plot jumps that it's impossible to keep up with. By the bloody climax, we're told what the secret is, but what's the big deal? Manipulative, average acting, and no real surprises.Rent, don't buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasted my time on this secret???","review":"This was one BAD film!

Instead, he always seems to just bash him in the back of the head while he goes and kills other people.

Whatever good there is, is dredged up over and over...I despise it! It ranks with his undistinguished Starlight Express and Phantom sequel, Love Never Dies. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat and performed it in junior high, and loved Jesus Christ Superstar, seeing the original film when it premiered and performed that as well in college in the 1980's at Penn State. But his most recent works leave something to be desired. Just my opinion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT !","review":"Andrew Lloyd Webber made it again. Much better than the overrated CATS, this musical brings some memorable songs such as \\"Love Changes Everything\\" and \\"Seeing is Believing\\" wich are oftenly found in Broadway selection albums. Besides, the story is very attractive and the staging seems to have been very suggestive, despite being a \\"chamber\\" musical. It's a pity that it became a flop."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 CDs, but only 3 tunes","review":"Webber has written a few pretty melodies for this show, but that's where he stops. I found this 2 CD set to be nothing more than the same 3 songs, over and over again, usually with different lyrics (but not always). The only redeeming feature is Michael Ball (Marius from Les Miz) who sings the role of Alex beautifully (as if he could sing any other way)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let me see if I've got this right...","review":"...A 17-year-old boy has an affair with an actress in her twenties, who then marries the boy's uncle.

Then, for good measure, he runs off with another ex-mistress, this one his uncle's.I'm a big Andrew Lloyd Webber fan in general, but I can see why this one is widely considered an embarrassment. Even in these relaxed times, an affair (Alex-Jenny) that constitutes child molestation, with an element of incest thrown in, is bound to put many people off their feed.Go back to EVITA and PHANTOM, and forward to SUNSET BOULEVARD.

The best songs are: Love changes everything, Anything but lonely, and the mermaid song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great score, silly show.","review":"This is a classic example of a bad show with a great score. The rather silly plotline and the quiet intimacy of the show guaranteed its quick demise on Broadway (although it was a success in London), but this CD documents what I would consider one of Webber's finest scores. It is intimate, subtle, almost a chamber musical in a way. Not at all what one would expect from this composer. Michael Ball is stunning in the lead role, and the remaining cast members perform beautifully. Several stand-out songs and an overall feeling of grace and old-world style should assure this score's survival, despite its less-than-stellar Broadway stage history."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love this Soundtrack","review":"This soundtrack is very enjoyable. Despite what that individual from Texas has to say, This musical is the best written that Andrew Lloyd Weber has to offer. Ann Crumb (Rose) and Michael Ball (Alex) both do stellar jobs with this music. Ann Crumb's voice is fluid and very pleasent to listen to. She has an incredible quality and emotion behind her voice and is a very well polished technical singer (as is Michael Ball). The songs from this show are catchy and beautiful. The plot to the story is a little thin, but the show (on Broadway) was outstanding as was the cast. I highly reccommend this musical. It grows better each time I listen to it. I hope it is revived some day. So don't listen to that other review, this soundtrack ROCKS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Feed-thru Fly Control!","review":"I've used SimpliFly for the past few years and have really noticed a difference in my fly numbers.

I'm sickened by what took place during the 12 years of dictatorship in Germany which ended almost 60 years ago. But insulting millions of people who couldn't control the events going on around them or the people who live in Germany today by producing such a character attacking play with over exaggerated accents and dumb lyrics is counterproductive to creating peace and friendship with people in the world community today. It only shows you that things never change, only the direction of the pendulum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"I really did not like Producers at all. The cast recording was just boring...nothing new or original and nothing that really grabs you and leaves you stunned and speachless. Oh actually I take that back I was speechless by how terrible this was. To me there isn't anything funny about the Nazis and what they did and to me it's too bad so many people love this immoral show. I was repulsed by how terrible is was and I never need to listen or see it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Producers","review":"This was a very, funny, slightly risque version of the stage musical. I enjoyed it. Nathan Lane is at his hysterical best."},{"rating":"2","title":"The revival of musical theatre","review":"This is hilarious!!! Mel Brooks is the genius of comedy, be it musical or not. This was a breath of fresh air when the only shows running on The Great White Way were sad or boring dramas. Sure they were good, but this was the pie in the face to every one of those shows. Nathan Lane is phenomenal once again and he was perfectly cast along side humbly comic Matthew Broderick. It's lavish and over the top, typical Mel Brooks. If the original movie could have been improved upon in any way, shapr or form, this is it. \\"Springtime for Hitler\\" would probably get most anybody in trouble, but not Mel Brooks. He can make fun of The Pope and nobody will yell at him. All that said, buy, listen to and go see this show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Springtime for BROADWAY!!","review":"This is a great cd!! This cd brings back memories of the golden age of broadway, with its great music and even better humor. If u have not seen the show or never heard any of its music, try to imagine a cross between \\"funny girl\\", \\"fiddler on the roof\\" and \\"my fair lady\\". What really carry this album is the superb sound quality, the wit of the lyrics, and the amazing cast. The best songs are: the king of broadway, along came bialy, and prisoners of love. You will love this cd even if you have never seen the 1968 movie or the new musical, trust me, i am speaking from experience. Buy and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where did they go wrong?","review":"In the show \\"The Producers\\" Nathan Lane playing Max Bialystock and Matthew Broderick playing Leo Bloom sings a song called \\"Where Did We Go Right?\\" I want to ask Mel Brooks, where did they go wrong. This almost flawless musical has a flawless CD. On March 17, 2001 Lane and Broderick left the musical in NY and now, unless they come back, no one will be able to hear them sing all of these great songs. This CD is a Broadway treasure, winning 12 Tony Awards and a Grammy for this CD. \\"Springtime for Hitter\\" is so much better than in the movie and yes, Mel Brooks says, \\"Don't be stupid be a smarty, come and join the Natzy party!\\" Ever since I have gotten this CD, witch is the day it came out, I have listened to it so much I know ever line by heart. Yet even still I roll on the floor laughing and every time I think how lucky we are to have Mel Brooks alive, God Bless Mel!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly My Favorite Show Ever!","review":"I, like many of the reviewers, was able to see The Producers twice, and adored it both times! While the cd isn't as good as the real thing (what is?), it's one of my favorite cds.The divine combination of Mel Brooks, Nathan Lane, Matthew Broderick, CADY HUFFMAN (I want to be her when I grow up), and the rest of the cast, along with a stellar production team, have the power to do anything. Cheer you up, make you realize that Broadway hasn't completely gone down the drain, anything! Personally, I think the US government should hire them as researchers for cancer cures. I bet it would work!If you don't have this cd yet, buy it! If you do, buy it again and give it to everyone you know (except for people you hate. Give them Titanic: The Musical). This cd is priceless! And, speaking of priceless, why don't they release a DVD recording of the show? Mel Brooks, are you listening?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A hilarious romp to Little Ol' Lady Land!","review":"I loev this CD...It's not one of those show albums that won't come out of your CD player...you need to listen to it in moderation becuase you will laugh to hard to listen all the way through...Nathan Lane is a genius, and Matthew Broderick is surprisingly awesome as Leo Bloom! I love all of the songs...and all of the actors. I especially like the songs \\"Opening Night,\\" \\"I Wanna Be A Producer,\\" and \\"That Face.\\" Enjoy!! I want to see this show next year, and I think my family is going to go together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ear Candy from Mel and Co.","review":"I must confess a terrible thing: I pirated this CD off Audiogalaxy. (Hey, I'm a poor college kid, i have enough trouble paying my tuition bills.)Now I'm actually reconsidering buying the CD, just for the lyrics. I just *have* to understand \\"King of Broadway\\" in its entirety: chorus, solo, the Yiddish part - everything!!In short: buy the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly entertaining","review":"I was unsure of how well Mel Brooks' type of comedy would translate to the stage, but it is every bit as entertaining as his film works. Nathan Lane is fabulous, and Matthew Broderick sings much better than I ever realized. Very deserving of all its Tony awards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterical !","review":"I was fortunate enough to see \\"The Producers\\" with Nathan Lane & Matthew Broderick shortly after it's premiere. The show was absolutely hysterical, with a really strong score. Nothing against Mr. Broderick, but Mr. Lane's part is larger & has the best songs. He totally deserved the Tony for Best Actor that year.Musically, the production contains more songs than a typical score, with strong voices and orchestrations. Best tracks include:The King Of BroadwayI Wanna Be A ProducerKeep It GayWhen You Got It, Flaunt ItAlong Came BialySpringtime For HitlerBetrayed [Lane's \\"tour de force\\" recap of the show]While I wouldn't call this the best show to grace the stage (though it won the most Tonys ever & NY critics tripped over themselves in praise), it is fantastic & came at a time when the Great White Way was taking itself way too seriously. Also, it was too bad that \\"The Full Monty\\" did not share in the victories of that season. Timing is everything!Nonetheless, one of the best scores ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This deserves 10 STARS!!","review":"This is a fantastic musical. I haven't laughed this hard in a long time. Broderick and Lane are FANTASTIC! This is a must own! I wish I could see it live. :-(."},{"rating":"1","title":"Merely servicable cast recording","review":"Cast recordings can serve the purpose of being a souvenir of a great evening at the theatre. They can also stand alone without the show if the music is great enough. This album is in the former group. Sure, \\"The Producers\\" is a great evening's entertainment. It is the best Broadway show to come along in years (because it is out only to entertain rather than be culturally or intellectually important - hello Stephen Sondheim). The music, however, is merely servicable. Except for the centerpiece of \\"Springtime for Hitler\\" (written in 1968), there isn't a memorable melody here. Mel Brooks \\"hunt and peck on the piano\\" melody lines are given a big Broadway orchestra treatment but that doesn't save them. Don't get me wrong. It all works very competently. But it rarely rises above competence. Anyone looking for great songs will be disappointed. Buy it as a souvenir or as a warm up to actually seeing the show (if you are lucky enough to get tickets)."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"PRODUCERS\\" PRODUCES NOTHING NEW","review":"This has to be the most over-rated, over-hyped musical score in the last hundred years. It isn't just a matter of not measuring up to the reviews that's at issue, it's the fact that the music and lyrics just aren't very good to begin with. Aside from \\"Springtime for Hitler,\\" the score is, in fact, so awful that one wonders how the cast can bear to do this material night after night. When the dust from the ecstatic, over-arching reviews settles, many are going to be embarrrassed by their effusions over this uninspired work. Musical comedy? No, musical schtick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite what the hype states it is","review":"Don't ask me how I got tickets, but I saw this show pre-tonies. Now don't get me wrong... it's pretty funny, but it does not deserve the distinction of having won the most Tonies. The music is just too campy. Sure, on purpose... but it is sickeningly campy. It's the epitome of the connotation that is attached to the words, \\"____________: The Musical\\" You won't be hearing many of these tunes at auditions. Go on. Buy it. Because everybody else will, but if this is your favorite musical, you have no idea of what a musical can be. I thought we had moved into an era where the power of music uplifts a story to create what is truly an artform. The Producers is a show; it's not art. It's not very hard for a Mel Brooks to make a bunch of yiddish rhymes and get a show that will be popular in New York City. All in all, The Producers is another example of hype from the critics pushing one show through at the expense of other better shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Da Woist!","review":"Not only is the music derivative and clunky, but also boring, the lyrics sophomoric. This the \\"Animal House\\" of Broad-way musicals. Nathan Lane is, as always, Nathan Lane. Too bad he can't come up with a new schtick! The old one is good but just about worn-out. Matthew Broderick is vocally weak with his only strong point, his looks, of course absent from the cd. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"O-U-C-H !","review":"5 minutes of \\"Springtime for Hitler\\" parody is one thing...this here (an evening's worth) is SOMETHING ELSE !!! (You saw it here first!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"When you go it, flaunt it.","review":"This is a good CD. The show, in my honest opinion, is so much better. The CD really doesn't do justice for it. The show is an experience....but the CD is always good to have as a relic of memory from the show. Nathan is such a great actor....and my favourite songs are: \\"We Can Do It\\", \\"I Wanna Be A Producer\\", \\"Springtime for Hitler\\", \\"Betrayed\\" and \\"Prisoners of Love\\". I reviewed this CD before the show opened...and I gave it a pretty bad review....because I wasn't much impressed with the CD alone. When I finally saw the show, I changed my opinion completely and now I listen to the CD almost everyday. But for those people who know they will never be able to see the show with the orginal cast...all I can say is....tsk tsk tsk....It won't be the same without Nathan.. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mit a Zetz, Mit a Zing, Mit a Bing Bang Bing Bang Boom!","review":"What more can one say about \\"The Producers?\\" Its flagship song, \\"Springtime for Hitler\\" was just over three minutes long in the movie, and has been expanded to just over eight minutes in the Broadway show. Is this a \\"gut\\" thing? By and large, ya, although Hitler's monologue could have been cut a bit. Nevertheless, it remains the most hilarious eight minutes ever shown on stage.Other high points include the Al Jolson takeoff, \\"Haben Sie Gehort das Deutsche Band,\\" which one can enjoy without understanding ein wort of Deutsch, \\"In Old Bavaria,\\" and \\"The Siegfried Oath\\" to Adolf (Elizabeth!) Hitler (who was descended from a long line of English Queens). And, of course, \\"Keep it Gay.\\" Note that most of the songs in the soundtrack were not part of the movie.Fortunately, this treasure is a CD, for if it were a record or a tape, we long would have worn it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Producers","review":"A very good cd. There are so few really good broadway musicals anymore, that it's nice to hear one that is melodic. Overall, it's good, but not great. The singing is also good, but not great. The main good point about this show is the humor and what elso would you expect from a talent like Mel Brooks. Overall, truly an enjoyabe show and cd. I saw the show live and it was a blast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minority Report","review":"I know I am in a minority, but I don't know what all the fuss is about. The music sounds very familiar and derivative. The lyrics are often funny but not too sharp or clever. More on the level of Mel Brooks' \\"Blazing Saddles\\" humor - people sitting around a campfire eating baked beans and farting. I know Mel Brooks thinks this is funny, but personally I graduating 6th grade a number of years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shaw's 1938-39 Band","review":"This CD contains music from Shaw's most famous band (1938-39). Helen Forrest & Tony Pastor provide the vocals on most of the tracks. There are also great instrumentals like the song \\"Traffic Jam\\". The sound quality is great and this CD also contains some hard to find Shaw songs. This is a must for Shaw fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great foreign language film","review":"Mother of Mine tells a very sparce and moving story of the consequences of war.

I just want to add my five star rating to the others to encourage viewers to watch this.I will say that the story is fascinating. We get a bit of what happened to Finland during WWII. (In my ignorance I didn't know that Finland had sided with Germany.) It's not a political story, though, it's a human one, set against the trials of their circumstances. The film is so well done, the script, the cinematography, the actors, that anyone can relate to the lives of these people. They had hard choices to make and they had to live with them. Despite the hardships the film is not at all depressing. There is a lot of love and beauty in it. We see the sea, the Skane geese, the beautiful but simple homes, as well as the beauty of the people involved.I won't spoil the experience of possible new viewers by revealing too much of the plot. Just see it for yourself and enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this movie","review":"Poignant and realistic, this movie explores the difficulties of being a child who is moved around during the ward and who must adapt to different family settings. Finally finding a true home is heaven until things change. Well made, precious, and tender, this movie will touch your heart. 'Tis true, tears will be shed, but it is such a heart-warming film. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"When the child was a child ...\\"","review":"I found the acting utterly superb and the cinematography beautiful in the film \\"Mother of Mine\\".The phrase that came to mind when I wondered how to describe this film is \\"When the child was a child ...\\" which is part of a poem used in Wim Wenders' film \\"Wings of Desire\\". And that refrain in that poem by Peter Handke holds a different meaning for me in its original language, German. It seems more haunting, sadder, and unanswerable.When I see a film of this caliber, I lack the articulateness to begin to do it justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chance to re create genius","review":"Laurel Burch has fans all over and to be able make some of her quilts it will be fun!

So far, I am not impressed with Wie geht's?. The charts and diagrams are not clear, the grammar is presented seperately from the culture and vocabulary sections, and the exercises are mindless. I also find it fairly useless to be given anywhere from 20-60 vocab words in one lesson with the grammar as an afterthought. I would much prefer to be presented with the grammar lesson and then the application of it through vocab.

Even with that goal in mind, most of the recipes have salt, sugar and processed foods in them, not to mention the largest section was on red meat while fish and vegetable based dishes were pretty scant.

The binder locks that hold the sleeves, unbelieveable enough, easily come open while the case is closed and the sleeves go everywhere within, when the case is open the binder locks do not easily open and are extremely flimsy and easy to break.

The extras are fairly useless as the Botswana special is in a previous season. The guys, as usual, are fairly hilarious, even if a bit obvious sometimes. The lorry (semi truck) competitions were just hysterical. I laughed my a#$ off. I always love the stars in the reasonably priced cars & interviews with them. I always wonder how the American celebrities cope with the car laps because personal experience tells me shifting with your left hand & steering with your right does not come natural to us.

I was hoping for more thorough information."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissappointed","review":"I was hoping to find at least some stories of love-attachment, passion, and descriptions of vulnerable, sometimes hot, first time sex or love-making. Out of seven stories I've read thus far, majority seem to come from a porn plot. With stereotypes of loose woman. Like group sex, and the first timer ate one woman three hours, while the other women watched and changed CD, like it was an aerobic event. Seemed more about lust/porn, rather than the feelings that took over to compel a woman to first make love with another woman. So if your looking for some tasteless plots, along with hopefully, ones with feeling, have not read one yet. Keep looking, or write you own book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"The carafe supplied with my coffee maker kept coffee hot for maybe 2 hours. The Bunn carafe solved that problem.

Now the outside steel shell gets very warm when filled with hot coffee, which means it is losing heat too rapidly, cooling the coffee, after about an hour and a half the coffee is room temperature...BLAH!

It centers around the hobo partnership of the author, Leon Ray Livingston, aka A-No.1, and Jack London (who was a slightly better writer than A-No.1). They travel from New York City out to San Francisco by rail and have a heckuva an adventure on the way. Most surprising to me was the apparent confliction the author felt about his life on the road as a railroad tramp. He clearly hates it, yet cannot quit the life. I'd say it's a must-read for people who are interested in the psychology of the hobo-tramp. I read it twice!

Maffit's text is unfailingly clear and on point. Brown's photographs are splendid. The book is organized very effectively. I can't imagine a library that should not have one of these included in its collection. The hidden treasure in the package is the music, contained in a cd inside the back cover. Maffit's compositions and performances are truly world class. Although the book itself is well worth the cover price, the cd makes it an unbelievable bargain. Besides being a marvelous educational tool, it would not be an overstatement to say that the book \\"Rhythm and Beauty\\" may well contain some of the most astounding music released this year. A tour de force. Check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"Rocky Maffit has missed the mark on this one. As I read Rhythm and Beauty, I was reminded of a sixth garde book report, summarizing the key infomation of previous works (such as Planet Drum and Drumming at the Edge of Magic, Mickey hart).In addition, the companion CD failed to present the wide variety of rhythm and sound that is out there in this world. Overall, this felt like a hack attempt at targeting a culturally starved audience.Even the photography lacks the mystery and power that is inherent in the subject material.In spite of this horrible review, I feel that Rhythm and Beauty does have merit in it's concept- a slick coffee table book with style and good information, but sadly, it did not measure up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unenthralling","review":"Regrettably, I didn't find this tale particularly gripping, nor could I get from it anything substantial about political oppression, as a metaphor or otherwise.

This book follows the last year-and-a-half of McQueen's life and ends just after his memorial service. Grady describes McQueen's failing health in detail, and even recounts his last visit to the bedside of the dead actor. You won't find much here about McQueen's fame (apart from a reference to Lee Majors) or his legendary love of speed. What you will find is a gentle tale, told with tenderness, of a man who said he'd done everything there was to do and now just wanted to be happy.What made McQueen happy? The answer might surprise you, as will the path he embarked upon in his last year. Everyone wants to be like 'The King of Cool'. But perhaps to become most like McQueen is to become like the man described in this book: one who loved his family, his friends, and God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Useless","review":"There is no English whatsoever in this package, not on the cassette tape, not in the book.

I bought it new in 1996 and have tried various recipes over the years. It's a book I pick up less and less as time goes by because, so far, none of the recipes have turned out for me. I'll probably give this book away (and pity the poor soul who receives it). I admit to being only an average cook, but I'm best at baking. I gave it two stars because I love the spiral binding and it has a huge selection of recipes. Maybe some of the ones I haven't tried are good (but I doubt I'll try any more recipes from this book).

I'd have even stayed with the guy's loathing of women if the writing were interesting, but it's not. Really bad use of bookstore space."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathological Men, Heartless Reportage","review":"The narrators of these stories are shallow, good-looking, well-educated, upper-income young American men with ice water in their veins. They are profoundly cynical, not terribly intelligent, and seem to be as emotionally affected by a J. Crew catalog as by the death of a friend. Women love them and go to bed with them, and those women are unimportant, annoying. Klam has a knack for describing a female's body so that not just her privacy, but her very humanity is threatened. In \\"Issues I Dealt with in Therapy,\\" the money- and status-obsessed narrator catalogues the physical flaws of his lover, a medical resident, who has a single hair on her chin, which distracts him. In \\"The Royal Palms\\" there is perfunctory sex, after which the grateful woman tells the disinterested narrator that he is the world's greatest lover. The men couldn't care less. They are repellent, and Klam's women are pitiable for needing them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast start","review":"It's rare that a debut work - be it a collection or longer-form piece - comes off as confident, assured and assertive. It's even more rare when an author hits the stands for the first time at what might be called a full sprint. But that's the case with this book ... SAM THE CAT is riveting and hilarious all the time ... yet also very poignant throughout. Klam's characters stir up a mixture of anger and pathos, leading to what one can conclude is his ultimate aim - a reaction on the part of the reader that is very close to that of each story's main character. A very neat trick indeed.Can't wait to see what Klam turns his microscope on next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited in Voice, Range, and Ideas","review":"These stories read like performance pieces.

It was so lame that some friends took turns reading it aloud. Lines like \\"It was like trying to stop a bullet with a chocolate chip cookie\\" are still making me and my girlfriend laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"One-trick Pony","review":"Almost every single story in this monotonous collection is told from the first-person viewpoint of a youngish male angry narrator who has an inferiority complex about more successful men, a physically flawless girlfriend whom he treats with contempt, and an obsession with money and status. I think either the stories in a collection should be linked, with the same narrator (as in Junot Diaz's \\"Drown\\") or demonstrate some range. Two of these narrators both had former girlfriends who wet the bed when drunk. I mean, couldn't he think of anything else? I think it's fine to have unattractive and offensive narrators if there's a point, otherwise it's gratuitously oppressive.

When I saw this book in the library, I figured I'd give it a shot over Christmas break. It was not a waste of time. This is a thoughtful and well-written book which points out many obvious (and some not-so-obvious) instances of androcentrism in both the study and practice of archaeology. There are a few places where it seemed that Nelson was about to fall into the trap of gynocentrism which she rightly denounces as being just as bad as androcentrism. However, she usually catches herself in time. I am very glad I decided to read this book, because it has given me a new perspective from which to evaluate the material I will read in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie to watch","review":"This movie was hilarious. Even though singing is what Kelly does on a regular basis she really put her all into this movie. The first time I saw the preview was at the Destiny's Child concert.

Very entertaining for the whole family.","review":"I really enjoyed this movie because it had a great musical background and theatre approach to it. It showed a star who was looking for love with a busy schedule as well and finds it with a man who is struggling to get his lawyer degree and pass the bar exam. He is seat filler with his friend who plays the woman that he dates.When the two meet, they are instantly attracted to one another and begin to date. The singer however has just ended a relationship with a gorgeous black man who is self absorbed and does not pay her enough attention. He digs into the history of her new prospect and brings the dirt back to her.The ending is great however because of the turn of events of which I will not tell...you gotta buy the movie.

Oh, and around the holidays the local stores get the Sugar Cookie, Candy Cane Lane, and Gingerbread blends.This tea closely resembles the Gingerbread blend they currently sell, however, it tastes so much better. There is an added ingredient or taste that just simply is missing from the gingerbread tea. Bengal Spice tea is my new favorite tea. I love the spicy initial taste, and depending on the cream you use, the after taste following is very uplifting. It is a very rich tea and tastes very good with a sweet treat like some peanut M&Ms;, or any other milk chocolate.Celestial Seasonings, hats off to you again for making such a great tea.Tea drinkers, you have to try this. I'm a bengal spice-o-holic."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best tea I have ever tasted.","review":"I was looking for a tea that would help me with nausea and they was no ginger tea available at the time.

I bought some after reading the reviews, but felt they really missed the mark. This tea should be simply called \\"Cinnamon Tea\\"--that is the ONLY flavor I taste, and not at all like Chai. Imagine melted Red Hots dissolved in water, and that is about what this tea tastes like. I love Celestial Seasonings tea usually, but this one is really overpowering with the cinnamon flavor, which should be better pointed out on the box. I am going to try their India Spice tea based on other reviews, and will hopefully find something more complex like what I am looking for (and will hopefully be a nice substitute for the expensive Chai from Starbuck's)."},{"rating":"1","title":"vile","review":"Hidden in the ingredients under \\"natural flavor\\" is some sort of herbal sweetener like stevia.

Now that I am back and have finished brewing a cup of this tea, I find that there has never been such an on point review! A cup of red hots brewed in hot water is EXACTLY what this tea tastes like- I could have boiled some cinnamon sticks from the cupboard and got the same taste. Where are all of the other flavors? Um, not here in this tea, I tell you that much! I am NOT sure if this has anything to do with this being the decafe version, but I will NOT be buying this again.

I find many of their offerings decidedly below par. But Bengal Spice is actually pretty good. It's perfect for cinnamon fans, as that is undoubtedly the boldest taste in this blend. And it's true that you don't need to sweeten it; the cinnamon takes care of that itself.In terms of strength it's nice and bold. The vanilla smoothes everything out though...it's not too strong, unless you let the bag steep for an inordinately long time. But Bengal Spice does have one notable weakness....for those looking for a great chai, you might be disappointed. Because while it's strong and has a nice flavor, the ginger, cardamom, nutmeg etc. is hardly noticeable, masked by the strength of the cinnamon. It's a shame, because this blend is definitely better-tasting than some, such as Yogi's classic India Spice. If the other \\"chai spices\\" in this blend had been stronger, this would be a 5-star tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"3.5 million pounds, really?","review":"This is a very tasty tea - nice and spicy, plenty of cinnamon and the ginger gives a nice bite, and no caffeine. Every box I've gotten has been fresh. My gripe however is the lack of strings. The box claims they save 3.5 million pounds(!?) of landfill waste every year by not using individual wrappers or strings/tags/staples. That seems like an exaggerated claim, and the lack of strings and staples is a real annoyance in my book. It means I always should use/carry a spoon in order to agitate the bags a bit while steeping, and remove them from the hot tea. It's so annoying I even considered only 3 stars. Mostly I drink tea at the office, and bringing a spoon around with me to meetings is odd, so instead I tend to wait until tea is cooler and use my fingers, which also is odd. Individual wrappers I can do without because I drink frequently enough the tea doesn't go stale, but please give me strings and staples."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing","review":"Bought this flavor on a whim...and I absolutely love it!

Hot and spicy aren't necessarily the same thing). It did not taste sweet to me unless I used two tea bags. Unfortunately this seemed too sweet for me this way and the smell was somewhat annoying. Meanwhile, I ordered Jasmine tea around the same time which is an EXTREMELY bitter green tea if you steep it too long or with too hot water(found this out the hard way). Then it hit me. Since I didn't like either of them, why not brew the two together and see what happens. PERFECT EUREKA!! They seem to balance and compliment each other. The combination brew is neither too bitter nor too spicy. It's delicious together and I feel good after drinking it. The spices used in the Bengal Spice are all given as balancing to the Khapha dosha, as is Jasmine tea (did not know this when I ordered the teas). I think I stumbled across something good here. I sweeten the brew with a touch of raw honey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy","review":"Friends introduced us to this tea during the summer. She had made iced tea with it.

Dan Hall made it for his son, who loved trains, and I think that any kid would be able to enjoy the magic of a film created not for profit, but out of love. I think all kids should be able to enjoy the light-hearted story and the cute jokes. I'm happy to say that I'm a much better actress now than I was when I was seven...I now attend Interlochen Arts Academy as a theatre major.

She wanted to come to Minnesota and live happily ever after, like Susan Smith, with her much younger lover. \\"Curses, foiled again!\\"Author Linda Godfry has done a good job of dredging up old newspaper nuggets, correspondence, pictures (embedded in the text, not in the conventional and convenient center of the book) and the court transcript in this little True Crime book.

But alas it fails as a drama. Not much happens. But neverless it has a certain charm to it. And the singing is quite good. The production on the other hand is a little perverse. The stage is divided by the forestage which is littered with musical instruments and the upper stage which is largely populated by puppets who mime the action. We start off with the singers in concert garb in the pit forestage. Then gradually they don their costumes. But we never do really get rid of the puppets. And as the opera goes on the pit becomes more and more cluttered with instruments. God knows what all this signifies but it doesn't destroy the presentation since there is not much plot to begin with. All in all a decent plea for Alfonso and Schubert although as an opera composer he falls short."},{"rating":"2","title":"For fans of Schubert and collecters of operas","review":"Schubert was not a successful opera composer and his operas are considered to be dramatically weak.This performance reduces the time of the opera from three hours to 2 hours six minutes. Normally this would upset me but in this case I suspect the reduction makes the opera more accessible and certainly doesn't seem to harm it. There is lots of beautiful music and fine singing. The first reviewer has well described the staging which would normally would disturb me but in this case I find it amusing. Since I am a collecter I am glad I got it and would recommend it to those with a substantial budget for music. For others there are so many other fine operas!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the choir ?","review":"The music is splendid but the stage is very poor. Because of producer's ambiguous, abstract concept, we can see only the solo singers. This opera has been written for choir ansamble according to the tradition of Singspiele, Zauberflöte to Meistersinger von Nürenberg, so choir is an intrinsic component of the whole stage. Mysteriously enough, we cannot see even a member of chorus group, the fact that results in a total disappointment. What is the king without the celebration of his subjects on the stage ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mercury","review":"An excellent CD, but one that shows its age when listened to today. The acid folk culture that was its genesis has passed on, and the tracks on this CD sound dated as a result. Also, I'm sorry, but David Freiberg can't sing. You can hear him straining on several occasions. Unfortunately, unlike Bob Dylan or Leonard Cohen, this does not add to his charm. Nevertheless, there is some excellent stuff here. \\"The Fool\\" is a terrific 12-minute jam, and \\"Dino's Song\\" is surprisingly catchy. The real delight on the CD however, is \\"Gold and Silver.\\" This instrumental piece is spectacular. Just sit back and relax and chill to its groove. A surprising aspect of the CD is that there's not a tremendous amount of power. Quicksilver Messenger Service's reputation is such that I was expecting more sonic force and reverb.

John Cippolina sounds as silvery as you could hope for, but the songwriting just doesn't deliver on the promise of Cippolina (or the rest of the band) as players. Yet another first-rate live band with third-rate songs. As is still true with most jam bands today, the songwriting takes a back seat to the possibilities the live medium, where the song is just a platform quickly left behind in favor of improvisational flights. In comparison to the wild rococo psychedelia of the Dead's early studio albums, where they made use of the full potential of the recording studio (and had really good songs), this album isn't very groundbreaking or trippy even for its time.

Unfortunately, I found the writing dull and pedantic. The story is mostly told from the main character's point of view, but her voice does not change from infancy through adulthood. And there are sudden inexplicable shifts in point of view and in time, which work well in a short story or essay format but are annoying in a novel. I think her intent is to foreshadow, but telling us about a future act when the main character is still only 3 is not effective foreshadowing. And I kept remembering my 7th grade English teacher's direction to \\"show us, don't tell us\\" as to how different characters feel and relate.It was with much disappointment that I finally decided that my annoyance with the writing style was too great. I gave up halfway through and returned the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very compelling once you get past page 100!","review":"It took me a long time to really \\"discover the treasure\\" in this book. I would agree with an earlier reviewer that the first few chapters were unnecessary and detracted from the story. However, once I got past that, I found an amazing and enlightening story. The writing was wonderful, and the story of a small German town before, during and after Hitler answered questions I had long harbored about how Nazi Germany actually came to pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ever wonder how the Germans \\"let\\" the Holocaust happen?","review":"This book was a wonderful story, and a great insight to the German people who allowed Hitler to gain so much control over their country.Many of the books written about the Holocaust either tell the American point of view or the Jewish point of view - this one is different. Trudi, the main character, is a midget Catholic who comes of age during the war.The story is not just another 'lesson' about the terrible things that happened to the Jews in Germany during the war, but it's also the story of a girl whose physical differences set her apart from others her own age.I don't want to say any more because it might spoil the book. All in all, it was a wonderful read, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely, lovely, heartwarming","review":"Trudi is born in the middle of the first World War in a small town in Germany. She is Zwerg, a dwarf, and thus set apart from the other children. Or maybe it's because her mom is slightly, shall we say, bonkers? Trudi is the person you probably would have hated if you knew her -- she demands your secrets then betrays them, she keeps to herself, she has an extensive ego. But somehow Hegi makes you love Trudi (although it's doubtful Trudi will love you back). The story of Trudi's life between the wars (and most importantly during the rise and fall of the Third Reich) is more about one person's relationship with a society that doesn't quite acceept her in the worst possible time to be different. After all, Trudi is the last person to approve of Hitler (and she proves that several times over, in words and actions). In the end, Trudi's loyalty (and she does have it) shines through and you know you weren't wrong to really like her after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I the only one who didn't like the book?","review":"After so many people said that they liked this book, I decided to read it for myself. After 250 pages the book didn't interest me at all. But I continued to read the story and by the end I was extremely disappointed. I felt no compassion for Trudi and thought her to be selfish and drab, regardless of her insane mother and short body. The character developement left a lot to be desired. I did think that the author had a good sense of seeing the war through a German viewpoint but that most of it got lost between Trudi's life and her stories. How can one possibly find any good in this as a literary work when the author writes such obsurd lines as \\"To force their secrets to the surface like water farts and let them rip through the silence.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"It's too bad the author did the audio version.","review":"Of the 4 cassettes in the audio version, I listened to one. The author's voice never varies and is a distraction to the story. I would like to finish the book. The story is sad yet captivating. I left Trudi between the wars and look forward to more of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a post-9/11 read","review":"I read this book before 9/11 and was horrified by the depiction of how the Germans in Trudi's town were led down the path to acceptance of the dehumaninzation and destruction of their neighbors. Most became obsessed with self-preservation at any cost and eventually either spied on, or were spied on by, each other. Even within their own homes their lives became very careful and circumscribed. I thought that could never happen here. Now I think I must read this book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it.","review":"I hated this book. I couldn't even read it on an airplane, that's how bad I found it. And I really, really tried since friends had recommended it to me. But after about 1/3 of the way through I found myself thinking, \\"What the hell do I care about some dwarf in Nazi Germany??\\" I suppose that's not the most politically correct attitude to take but I don't get the hype. I found it extremely slow and easily put-downable. Tough to get into"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful imagery combined with a compelling plot","review":"Three cheers for Oprah! If she can introduce middle America to writers like Ursula Hegi, there's hope for the intellectual future of our country. This is a superbly written tale that weaves the big Questions (with a capital \\"Q\\") into a very approachable, touchable, memorable story. It is a story I talk about with others over lunch and wake with it echoing in my dreams. More than a summer read, Stones from the River is a book whose impressions will out last even the deepest tan"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm glad that I read \\"Stones From the River;\\" A Great Story!","review":"Ursula Hegi, in this dark tale of a nation gone mad, explains how it was possible for the unimaginable to happen. She exposes aspects of Germany and Germans that must be understood if we, who weren't there, are to ever understand how the Nazis could have risen to power and nearly destroyed Germany and much of Europe. Hegi digs into the soul of \\"ordinary\\" Germans and finds evil and good, darkness and light, weakness and strength; she finds people like us and our friends, relatives and neighbors. I found myself asking: What would my family and I have done had we lived in post World War I Germany? Could anything like what happened there happen again? Given different times and circumstances, could it happen here? Thank you, Ursula Hegi, for telling a marvelous story that needed telling..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved little Trudi","review":"Like little Hanna, I loved Trudi, gossipy ways and all. Having the abridged sound recording to jump start and to help wade through some of the longer passages was invaluable and I loved Ursula's (the author)narration. Especially helpful were Leo's interpretation of sin (most of the time it is being human)and Trudi's discoveries of what is most difficult about loss and how to address loneliness. This book is a marvelous epic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patience is a pre-requisite for this book","review":"Patience is a pre-requisite for this book. Just so you know, you have to be prepared for a very slow moving book, with a lot of wordiness and only so-so visual imagery. I usually like recommendations from Oprah's book club, but this one was not as good as the others. I expected more from this book, maybe because it is set in between WWI & WWII, and had so much potential to have so much happen, but it doesn't. Instead, it goes on and on about Trudi's thoughts and aimless plots, and not about what's going on around her. Some people might like this wordiness but I prefer a faster, edgier moving paced book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing","review":"This was one of the most haunting and satisfying stories I have read in a long time. Normally, I speed through novels, but this one I took a long time to read so I could savour the story. I found it so interesting, humourous and haunting all at the same time. It was recommended to me by a friend who said, \\"It's a little slow-going at first, but stick with it and you'll be richly rewarded.\\" I can't put it any better than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you enjoy literature, READ THIS BOOK!","review":"Ursula Hegi has become one of my favorite authors...this book alone inspired me to buy more of her work. Now that I have everything she's published, I eagerly await more. Hegi paints a very believable character in Trudi Montag. This story reminds all of us who grew up without being \\"popular\\" of how cruel children can be, but that we survived, and we had company all over the globe, and across time. She shows that everyone has something that makes them different, and helps make these differences something we can live with, if not learn to embrace. The history in this book is amazing, and is a must read for anyone remotely interested in WWII and/or the Holocaust. \\"Stones\\" gives a perspective we aren't used to seeing, and one that I believe is invaluable.This book is a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reads Like A Beautiful Painting","review":"I read this book perhaps 10 years ago. It is still my favorite novel. It is so beautifully written, and the main character has stayed with me all these years. I need to reread it:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down","review":"I read books during my 30-minute lunch break at work, and I sped through this novel, always wanting to sit for longer than those 30 minutes each day! Hegi weaves a beautiful story that made me laugh out loud, even cry at times. The characters are wonderful, and Hegi's descriptions really put you in early 20th-century Burgdorf. She also does a good job of weaving connections that support the themes like storytelling and individuality/differences as beauty.Reading the back cover before reading the novel actually made me wonder if I would like it, but I'm glad I did read it; the cover just does not do the book justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Put into words what happened in Germany during 1915-1949","review":"Trudi in Stones put into words what my dear gentle Aunt Mary could not when she was released from a KZ by the British soldiers. The only thing she would say was that her husband died of a broken heart after he was fired from his teaching position, their property confiscated and she ultimatedly sent away to prison when she was denounced by her neighbors. It puts her pain to rest. She spent her last days with us in Michigan and I loved her"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Touching Novel","review":"Ursula Hegi's \\"Stones from the River\\" is a very touching novel about a zwerge (dwarf) girl, Trudi, who lives in Burgdorf, Germany. She has many difficulties living in a small town, with many people isolating her because of her physical differences, and has only her father for support. As she grows up, she makes it her job to know everyone in the town's business. Trudi uses the power of gossip to help herself be noticed and accepted in her town. Hegi can therefore weave the stories of the people in Burgdorf around the central story of the maturing Trudi. With the help of some other misfit, yet lovable, friends, Trudi is able to expand and grow during the second World War. Through all of Hegi's perfect literary usage, one can become completely submerged in the time and life of a young girl, desperately trying to fit in. I recommend this book to anyone who understands how it is to want to be \\"normal\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terricfic book that educates and captivates.","review":"Hegi has an art for making you feel close to the characters in this book. I felt like I knew each one of them personally. You begin to realize how important this is when the fate of each character unravels. This book awakens one to the differences in each individual. You learn that everyone is unique whether it be in their appearance, their lifestyle or in their religion"},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable","review":"This is a novel of unique depth and richness. The style is so understated that one could miss what is going on but that is an important part of the strength of this compelling book. This is not a novel for those who want instant gratification. Some reviewers have mentioned the somewhat tedious opening chapters. The plot does develop slowly but it is well worth the wait. The story of the life of Trudi Sontag from childhood thru her young adult years in Germany during and after World War II is a testament to the best and worst in human beings. Trudi is unlike everyone else but thru her tale we learn that she is very much like all of us and her heroism is an inspiration because of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made me a fan!","review":"This book made me a fan of Ursula Heggi. What a great writer with a gift for human interest. Beginning in pre-Nazi Germany, this story ends after the war and focuses on the conception, chidlhood, adolescence, and adulthood of a female dwarf and the keeper of the pay library. She knows just about everyone in her small town, and all the drama, triumphs and tragedies in their lives are detailed along with her own. Wonderful book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meghan from CT","review":"Stones from the River by Usula Heigi focuses on the life of a dwarf in Germany during the Nazi occupation. The author uses Trudi's love of storytelling and small town gossip to weave a story not only of the main characters life, but of all those around her. The begining of the book was slow but as Trudi grew the stories began to pick up. The presence of the Nazi's brings a historical element to the novel. I would recommend this book-but you have to trudge through the slow begining to get to the heart of the story. You ultimately get to see Trudi and all those around her mature into acceptance and understanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"One thumb up, the other down","review":"I'm torn about this book, I enjoyed her writing style and parts of the story. It is a little depressing since the setting was in Germany during the World Wars. There were way too many characters, 38 to be exact, so I had a hard time keeping many of them straight. It was long and boring in places. What I really disliked was the ending, in short- \\"I don't get it?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow start -- good middle -- lousy ending","review":"This book was a major disappointment. The author seems todrone on and on about ordinary happenings without providing any pointor revelance to the overall story line. I plodded through the last 100 or so pages hoping for an ending that would tie everything together or at least be a happy one for Trudi. Instead, the book just sort of petered out. I was very disappointed and felt like reading this book was a huge waste of my time. I guess I just didn't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I really don't understand the high rating for this book. I found it a hard read and just when I would get interested in part of the story it was on to something else. I made myself finish it, hoping the ending would be better than the first 1/2. It wasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"plodding life story","review":"Initially Stones from the River was promising, however, as the book proceeded it became a tedious series of events in the life of Trudi. After a while it became difficult to even empathize with her as she seemed more and more unmoved by the events around her. Also, the prose style seemed forced and even cliche."},{"rating":"1","title":"kinda boring","review":"i'm sorry, but i read the novel STONES FROM THE RIVER and usually my comments are very good from OPRAH'S BOOK CLUB but i have to say that this book to me was pretty boring and lame. i fell asleep the first 10 pages of the book!! the ending was pretty good and it was a good story but it was sloppy and choppy. a dull review form me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most retarded book I've ever read!","review":"This book is depressing with morally corrupt values. I can't believe that my english teacher made us read it! Who cares if poor Trudi Montague is short? I think she should stop whining about it and no one should be required to hear her gripe about it! This is a pity party that I really don't want to attend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stones from the River","review":"I avoided this book because it was an Oprah book club selection. I gave in when I heard it was about WWII Germany. That was the only good part of this book, and that alone kept me reading to the bitter and disappointing end. I wearied of the gossipy town with too many loony people. I actually was thinking of making a character map so I could remember who was who and who did what to whom. Then I realized it just wasn't worth the effort. The worst part was at the end when we're supposed to believe that someone told 5-year-old Hanna about the naked man by the river ( a really minor incident ten years ago and they're telling a five-year-old). Yeah, right! Give me a break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very concerned about the multible star readership!","review":"This book is a German language course disguised as a lenghty but dwafted story leading up to WWII. In it, little-village women drive cars, bath in their own indoor tubs, but also swim in mighty rivers, and keep food cold in refrigerators. Give me a break!This is not how women lived and behaved in a small village back then, or even a big town for that matter. If people bathed at all they had to use public bath houses which weren't free and at home they took sponge baths over the kitchen sink. In summer milk and butter was kept cold in basements and in winter the food was placed between two windows to keep it from freezing. Women back then didn't learn to swim and driving a car was out of the question since most people couldn't afford a vehicle.Judging from the obvious errors I still remeber, after laboring through 500+ rather boring pages, proper research for what could have been an important story was sadly ignored.You'll be the judge!"},{"rating":"1","title":"it was ok","review":"My school made me read this for a required summer reading and i have to say this book was not that good. Yes it does show potential and wasn't completely a waste of my time, but it was quite dry and if i had to choose i wouldn't read it again. to reiterate it was ok, nothing spectacular and personally i wouldn't recommend it for anyone under 30."},{"rating":"1","title":"No book yet!","review":"I cannot really review the product because I have not yet received it.

Finally on my last attempt, I passed whatever hurdle was holding me back and to be truthful, I'm amazed at how much I really enjoyed the story. Well worth overcoming my consternation.My advice for those who hit that wall...don't give up on this book! However much you want to throw it out the window...keep it around and someday, you might get over the wall and dig it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorites","review":"I have read this book four times now, and each time it's gets better. Anyone who thinks this is a book about a mentally ill woman and a dwarf is missing out. Ursula Hegi takes us into World War II Germany in a way we don't usually see. By first connecting us to the people in the small German town of Burgdorf she gives us an insightful look at how the German people may have felt about what was happening in and to their country. She made me feel Trudy's pain, strength, rage and love in a way that was uncomfortable at times... yet I didn't want to book to end. For masterful storytelling and a raw look at humanity, Stones from the River is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable!","review":"This book goes down as one of my all-time favorites, without a doubt. I'd never heard of Ursula Hegi before or any of her books, but now that I've been educated I will look for each new book. I disagree with many of the other reviewers who said the first part of the book was uninteresting. I found the whole book gripping and it wouldn't let go, even after it ended. \\"Stones from the River\\" is one of those books whose characters seem as real as your own family and you don't want to lose them when the story ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing storyteller of a WWII coming of age","review":"From the beginning of this book I fell in love with the character of Trudi, the \\"zwerg\\", or dwarf woman. Her story spans the WWI and WWII era in a very small town in Germany. Trudi's childhood tugs the heartstrings as she is rejected by other kids for being different and finds her solice and ultimately her niche in the stories she tells and the events she witnesses in the town in the course of her life. Her view of the world captivates the reader as you hear her thoughts and sense her feelings during a difficult time period where beloved neighbors were persecuted for their faith and taken away, bombs were dropped and Nazi witch hunts reigned. During the same time Trudi is coming to terms with how different she is, she is also helping others who are being killed for it. At its conclusion this book leaves you wanting to know more about Trudi and the woman she becomes."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has a little bit of everything.","review":"I am a fast reader, but this book to me my entire weeks vacation to read. What a trooper Trudi was! I really liked the book because it had a lot going on.

I thought it was an amazing story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave it an Honest 125 page try!","review":"At times, I found this book interesting, but it would frequently drag me off to irrelevant unknown places, too many characters that I was uninterested and lost!

I have only read 178 pages and I wonder if I can bear to read more. The writing seemed good at first. When I realized Trudi was not even 4 years old when she was so all-knowing that lost me. But I kept on. I now feel it is sooo sloooow. And almost childish in the writing or telling of the story. I do not know if I can keep reading as I feel it has gotten very tedious. Perhaps if the author edited it so that it was half its length the story would move. I am normally a patient reader. If my book discussion group decided to take the book off its list I do not think I would ever pick it up again. I have read Holocaust literature. I feel this book is laboriously getting to the Holocaust. It is making me forget the writing I did like in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toughest book I never finished.","review":"This was the most tedious book I havd ever started to read.

Give me a break!A novel of Nazi Germany? I have read better ones.Although I have just finished the book, during 2 breakfasts and one lunch (doing more skipping of pages than of reading them), I can't tell you now what the book is about.

I have several friends whose judgement and taste I generally respect who like her a lot. Not me. She seems trite, contrived, and obsequious to contemporary trendy themes.

I wouldn't know."},{"rating":"2","title":"A ripple in history","review":"Ursula Heigi's \\"Stones from the River\\" is right on historically. Not only did she manage to capture an era of hate and prejudice, but she carefully weaved in the fictitious life of Trudi Montag. This is not a love story, nor a story for the weak at heart - but a story of a courageous young woman in one of the world's bleakest, most horrific periods in history. It starts off subtly - giving much needed background for this epic and ends with a bang. Read the first half in one week, the second half in one night. Excellent! Deserves 4 1/2 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Our life journey shapes us like the river shapes the stones","review":"What a beautiful story, what a wonderful story. The setting of Germany around WWII is a history that seems so familiar and so often told that it's like McDonald's - so familiar that its pedestrian. Then up steps Ursula Hegi with her story that weaves a rich tapestry of people's lives; revealing the role of the ordinary in something as disturbing as the Holocaust. And then there's Trudi. I learned so much from T's journey. She learned to love herself and, thereby, love others. Thank you, Trudi, for showing us all how important it is to shine your love on others and use your gifts and strenghts constructively. Thank you, Ursula Hegi, for bringing us this beautiful story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Self Rationing at the end to avoid the inevitable!","review":"Once I had my feet on the ground and was certain the story would improve I could hardly stop reading. Hegi's characters possess depth parallel to the towns people of many German towns during this horrific time and through Trudi, the reader is able to share both the many pains and unexpected pleasures of a soul far greater then the dwarf body portrays.I rationed single pages at the end to delay saying goodbye.Fortunately, I picked up Michael Chabon's \\"The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay\\". Same time frame including Prague and the U.S. as two cousins enter the world of Super Hero Comics and New York City prior to the Bombing of Pearl Harbor. And alsmost as good as \\"Stones from the River\\".Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"This is the first book I've read by Ursula Hegi and I thought it was great.

Some people say it's 'slow', and well, I admit that if you want to read an exciting book with lots of action in it, this isn't what you want to read. But I thought it was very interesting. Of course I don't know what WW II was like, but to me this book seems like very realistic. But it's not just about the war, it's also about Trudi's life before it, when her mother goes crazy and dies, and lots of other things. What I think is so good about the book, is that it doesn't focus on just ONE problem, like the war. It's about the complete lives of people, which makes it much more realistic. It's also interesting to read how everyone's lives evolve and how the relations in Burgdorf (where Trudi lives) change and grow. I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to read anything too superfacial!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stuck on page 300","review":"I started the book knowing that I had to get past the first 100 pages and I did. But, for the last few days, I've been stuck around page 300. The story has great potential, but there's too many \\"little\\" details to keep in your head. I love the character of Trudi and how she interprets what is happening. Her point of view is a very powerful one, but I think it gets lost when it's intertwined with so many other characters!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looses your interest after a while.","review":"I was at first reluctant to read this book since it was an Oprah book club selection, but I read it anyway since it was so highly recommended from friends. The story is a very touching one about a \\"vertically challenged\\" woman who struggles to live with her difference in a \\"tall\\" society. The story is interesting but then halfway through the book it turns into a war novel depicting stories of what it was like to live in Germany as a Jew in World War II. I think that Hegi should've stuck to one story line. The novel seemed to be divided into two different strories that went on for too long. It was hard to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book didn't make sense","review":"I read this book expecting an epic tale about saving people during WWII. I expected too much. Trudi Montag, the main character who tries to accept herself through others, didn't hold my attention and gave me a cold feeling throughout the book. She antagonites over somewhat petty things, but seems to not let them go, resulting in a slow, awkward book. Although Helgi tries to show the German population and how they were affected, I found the town and it's people to be overbearing at times. This book is a long one, and unless you like the author, I don't think it is worth reading !Melody"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Task to Read, But Worth the Effort","review":"The characters are rather bizarre. Don't expect to be able to relate, unless you're a pretty off-beat person, but the book is worth the read. It explains how the people of Germany could have allowed Hilter to come into being and produce the madness of Nazi Germany. The only disappointment is the story sort of dies at the end with no real climax or closure.

What a terrific book. Whenever an author chooses a well known pattern, the challenge is having something new to offer. Jan not only shows a way to prevent stretching, the major problem with this star, but presents so many variations and alternative ideas, one hardly knows where to start. The stars range from the appliqué-embellished Tea Time to the swirling, off center Spiral Lone Star. In addition to the six projects with directions, there are 24 more inspiring Lone Stars in the Gallery. The stars are strip pieced and some of the corner designs are paper pieced. Jan also provides a chart to show how you can change the size of any of the projects, ways to split your diamonds for more excitement, design possibilities for the setting squares and quilting ideas.

The projects and samples are limited in style and extremely outdated. The photography is poor and the layout uninspired. Though published in 2001, it looks like it is out of the late 80's or early 90's.There are now SO MANY wonderful polymer clay books on the market that provide better information and inspiration, not to mention step by step instructions illustrated with wonderful photos and diagrams.

Lemay has managed to turn a mediocre style and extremely thin technical knowlege into a career writing poor quality books that are consistently full of errors. I found more errors in this single book than I've ever found in any other book. When errors are in the code as well as the author's discussion, mere mortals like you and I have little chance of actually learning Java. As far as learning Java in 21 days, it simply cannot be done if you use this book. Beyond errors and other problems, the book fails to cover many key issues. The entire toolkit for graphical interfaces is glossed over and examined so briefly that you can't possibly learn how to create applets that really do something. Definitely look elsewhere for your Java needs"},{"rating":"1","title":"Your worst nightmare.

This external wall charger made things so much more simple!

But applying their formulae to my workouts and using full range movements, I have nearly doubled my functional strength in less than 8 weeks and in only 6 workouts. I have added 11 pounds of lean muscle mass (based on caliper testing). More importantly to me, I have nearly tripled my muscle endurance. And my workouts take a quarter of the time they used to, so I have more time to enjoy other areas of my life. This book is definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you looking to increase strength?","review":"If you are buying this book to help build strength like I did this is the wrong book for you. It may be good to build mass but not strength. The premise of the book is pounds per minute and this will give you your biggest gains.

The album contains some of Ochs' most enduring writing -- \\"No More Songs,\\" \\"Ticket Home,\\" \\"James Dean\\", \\"Basket in the Pool,\\" \\"Chords of Fame\\" and so on. Even \\"Ten Cents a Coup\\" furnishes insight into our current world -- who could be more ugly than Johnson, Nixon and Agnew? Look at our current crop of politicians from Clinton to Bush to Cheney. But the politics is secondary to the sound. Ochs, with the help of first-rate sidemen, rocked on this, and he also soared at times, riding the crest of a C&W groove. Listening to this, at times I feel like it is a warm summer night, and I see a bright, beautiful falling star in the distance. Won't somebody reissue this in a respectful packaging at an affordable price?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Resource","review":"This book is a resource for every harried soul, longing for a saner pace, a map for the path of their life or a way to live in tune with their community and the earth. Allan and Cantwell make it clear that it is not necessary to have a cabin in the woods to live a simple life, and that thousands already quietly live their lives creatively and full of purpose in the city.

With a few happy exceptions, their lives are now miserable -- or over.It's as bad as the chimps from the space program, who after years of careful training were sold to laboratories for medical experiments. Most of Linden's subjects -- after being reared in human company and taught to use sign language or symbol-boards -- were sold to laboratories, placed in zoos, or attempted to return to the wild (with disasterous results).The image of a despondent gorilla in a dank concrete zoo cage, signing desperately to passers-by \\"get me out, get me out!\\" will haunt me forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Convinced It's New","review":"You know, I put this in the shower when it arrived, without really inspecting it first.

It is a sequel to the author's earlier book on Burgess and Maclean. Whilst a bit dated now, it is interesting and easy to read, albeit a bit subjective on occasion. Unfortunately, it bears the hallmarks of quick production. There are one or two printing errors, and some inconsistencies about dates.

But when I went home and began to read it, I foundthat was really nothing more than lists, LKists of books that the supposed biographee had read, music he liked, words he said before the age of two, mostly a collection of gibberish. The book had no glue holding the entire thing together and I even disregarded the entire middle section, because after reading the first section, I didn't care anymore about EDwin's life, and just wanted to see how he died. Even that was dissapointing. THis book was not a fluent read, the author of the book inside the book was first of all writing way to advanced for his age level and didn't seem to care what happened.

Jeffrey may be a literary \\"device\\", but he's also Edwin's best friend, just as Rose is the love of Edwin's young life. Millhauser knows that children have full emotional lives, and as we get older, we're lucky if we can hang on to at least some of that childhood intensity.This book means so much to me, because it's about a child who gets to fully express his genius (and all of us are \\"geniuses\\" until adolescence kicks in, and we start to doubt ourselves)."},{"rating":"2","title":"relive childhood","review":"This is like being plugged into a memory machine and reliving your youth.

This book is not going to provide adequate preparation, so be prepared to select another probability text such as Bean or Ross from the list.Given the level of difficulty of the actuarial exams, the level of this textbook is much too low.

My previous Nylabone Frisbee lasted 2 or 3 years. My large labradore was very sad when his favorite toy was missing. I finally found them here at Amazon and he is a happy camper now. My younger Dachsund then chewed the bone part off the toy after a few weeks but hopefully will leave it alone now. The lab is a heavy chewer but never chewed up the disc. He likes to fold it in half like a taco in his mouth. He won't leave you alone when you go in the back yard for he will drop it in your lap to throw it for him.

It appears that the author and the editor didn't bother to re-read the first two books to check for consistency. And it really shows.Most of the character conflict has already been played out in the first two books or it is contrieved around information that contradicts information provided in the first two books. The characters are supposed to be several years older by the end of this book but they don't appear to have grown at all.My suggestion, skip this book. You won't be missing anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too predictable","review":"It might just be my age catching up with me. When I was young I actually liked what I read from Orson Scott Card. Now as I read his books I find my self bored and disinterested. This series, which I have now read 4 out of the 5, is for me, complete *#$@. Progress of the story was the most predictable story I've read since Dick and Jane (maybe that gives you an idea of how old I am). I will not even bother reading book 5. Which is saying a lot, because the only reason I forced myself to read into book 4 was I accidently bought book 5 first and felt I needed to read them all to justify the expense. However, 3/4 of the way through book 4 and I could stand it no longer. I read to enjoy myself and escape. Simple put, I couldn't do that with this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great.","review":"I read this series as a child and really enjoyed It. I recently revisited it as an adult. Certain issues about the series struck me. 1) Gender determinism. While Card is weakly in favor of equality, he clearly feels that women are \\"naturally\\" going to serve certain roles and men will \\"naturally\\" fill other roles. Gross. 2) Homophobia. Some pretty disgusting language is used to describe homosexuality. On the one hand, if viewed simply in the context of the story and the characters, maybe Card can get a pass. But...in the larger context of our world, its really, really regrettable. 3) Arranged marriage of young girls. Coloring all of this is my adult understanding of Card's religious background. Overall, the series is ruined for me. I wish I hadn't revisited it and it had remained a pleasant memory. Also, fair warning to parents, you might want to consider the negative messages in these books before giving them to children or at least talking over these issues with young readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Sunglasses","review":"These are wild sunglasses.

While he is still coming into his own with the formal oral presentation, there is no question he quickly hits his stride once he begins physically demonstrating and verbally describing the component forms of Long Fist - simply outstanding. His martial skill is evident and he clearly understands the depth of the art (eg, subtle points, like intention and flow). The instructive format of the video and the genuine heart with which Mr. Yang delivers the content yields a solid resource for the practitioner truly intent on improving their skill level. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Count Five - 'Psychotic Reaction' (Edsel)","review":"From what LOOKS to be an earlier reissue of the San Jose's psych / garage band's sole album. This one, however is on the Edsel label, which has got four (4) less bonus cuts than their pressing on the Collectables label (see my review). Different cover and all, as this is for the completists, as I believe I actually know one patron that has this CD, as well as the one I just mentioned. Still hard to believe these were actually high school seniors that made this 1967 classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak except for the title song","review":"These one-hit wonders put out this album which basically consists of the terrific title song and lots of more pedestrian filler. Unless you are curious or a completist, all you really need is a single of \\"Psychotic Reaction.\\" If you can't find a single (and most likely you will not, these days), get it on one of the many '60s compilations out there -- the original \\"Nuggets\\" compilation being the best choice, if you can still find that. I had the good fortune of finding this Count Five album on vinyl in a bargain bin for about $3, and I snatched it. It's certainly worth that price, but I would hesitate at spending a CD price for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST INSTANT POTATOES EVER!","review":"I have to say after many searches of Instant Potatoes, this is the best brand Iv ran into!

It also has a stopwatch and count down timer that you can use any time neither the hour hand nor the minute hand are obscuring it. To its credit, it's pretty heavy, so it's good exercise and may also have some use as in wrist-to-paw combat situations. As I understand it though, most hunters prefer to kill from a distance using a high power weapon. As a timepiece, I'm sure it's accurate, but setting the time is a pain: no stem, so you have to push a button combination that only advances the minute hand forward slowly even at the fast speed. Maybe the reason it doesn't have a stem is because they are worried that the mercury for the useless thermometer (no kidding) will leak out more readily. I returned mine a few days after the purchase.I've been a Casio fan for years owing to their logic and affordability. This watch, however, was a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never seen a better watch in this price range","review":"I purchased this watch basically for the looks, but then realized that it had every feature I could possibly want, from a graph of the day's temperatures to a diagram of the cycles of the moon. The two negatives I found were 1)The band is hideous and very flimsy, and the pins that hold it on are practically made of tin foil. However, I resolved this by purchasing a sturdy metal band that added a couple hundred dollars to the appearance of the watch. 2)The digital display is somewhat hard to read when it is not mid-day, but that is what the backlight is for, and you can't miss the silver analog hands. Also, the hands glow in the dark so you technically never need to use the light. Overall, I could not be more satisfied with this watch after a simple band upgrade."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT TUNES FROM THE 80'S","review":"NO ROPE AS LONG AS TIME WAS AN ALL TIME FAVOURITE TRACK.GREAT TO SEE THE CD OUT .

The information and advice in this book *seems* good but my main complaint is that Eric Sink has never started a micro-ISV, and worse, for the sake of the book he did attempt to start a micro-ISV and it failed miserably. He did this near the beginning of the book. I always thought he was going to go back to this later on in the book and apply some of his own advice to his failed first attempt and turn it around but he never did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Musings Geared for Very Small Software Vendors","review":"Though the book has several good insights in it, I recommend it only for micro-ISVs, small software publishers just getting started.I was looking for a more in-depth analysis. What we have here is a reorganized diary of thoughts from a guy who ran a small software firm. There are no charts, tables, statistics, or other quantitative data. The book is also surprisingly devoid of case studies.One virtue of the book is it has some good analogies that illustrate principles of the business.Still, if your software firm is selling more than $500,000 you're not going to find enough material here to sink your teeth in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"Advice is very general and basic and experiences in the book are unique to himself and would not apply to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Show","review":"It's hard to review an item I never received.

I did consider buying the converter for an extra couple bucks after I realized that this was too small for my phone 3.5mm jack, but I couldn't quite get it to be comfortable on my ear and the reviews for the cheaper converters didn't look too promising.

However, even with the ear lobe clamp, the earbud always comes out of my ear within a few seconds. In its original condition, this headset was not functional for me since it wouldn't stay in my ear. However, I made the earbud stay in my ear by taking an old Jabra fitted ear gel and putting it over the ear bud. With this alteration, the ear bud stays in, making the head set work pretty well.The headset that I received was not the headset pictured. What I received is an ugly, red, plastic headset. Tacky.

Its aftertaste was unbearable and the book absolutely had to go. The dialogue and premise are lame. The book simply feels like words on paper.

Gillespie explores all aspects of steamboat travel from the development and construction of the vessels to the personal accounts of steamboat races, accidents and the pleasures of steamboating on the Western Rivers.I found it readable, substantial, and well-informed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy-Handed re-hash of old material","review":"With this book I expected what the subtitle promises -- \\"a lively history of steamboating on the Mississippi and Ohio rivers.\\"But there is little or no new material in this book. It consists largely of old accounts, mostly contemporary with the steamboat era. Most of the extracts are long, and even with spelling and punctuation modernized, they're difficult to wade through due to the obtuse language and the amount of commentary not related to steamboats. The library of any really serious student of steamboat history will probably already contain much of the original source material for these lengthy quotations. Mine does.If you seek contemporary \\"verbal snapshots\\" of a few eccentric individuals who traveled once or twice on steamboats, this book may be for you. For the serious steamboat historian, however, it covers too little new ground to be an important history while, containing too much heavy, archaic language to be an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I got the Norwegian book from this course (Teach Yourself) before and it's amazing. So I was expecting more with this book. I understand that Icelandic is extremely harder to learn than Norwegian, but this book is definetly bad. At least for beginners. I've learned alot more just with free online courses. This book is just alot of grammer, really. And it's extremely outdated.If you're trying to learn Iceland, this book won't help you. Perhaps if you're intermediate, but not for beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I don't understand why the \\"Teach Yourself\\" folks have not updated this work. Granted, Icelandic is nowhere close to being a major world language, but if they can publish modern, pedagogically sound books and tapes for Slovene, Xhosa, and Zulu, why can't they do it for Icelandic?If you want to memorize lists of prepositions, outdated slang, and scads of minor noun declensions, by all means, buy this book. If you're industrious, you might develop a decent reading knowledge of the language. But that's about it. I'll wait for something a little more modern to come along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Icelandic - Teach Yourself books","review":"What a horrible piece of trash PJT has written. Most other volumes of the Teach Yourself series have been updated to pedalogically sound introductions to major (and minor) languages from Afrikaans to Zulu. The Icelandic (as well as Maltese) books are still the old old old versions with new new new and exciting covers. Reminds me of buying a pig in a poke. Stay away lest you have a brain hemmorage trying to learn icelandic from this horrible waste of a good tree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good book....","review":"I wanted to get an idea of what the Icelandic language was like, so I picked up this book. I have found this book to be very confusing.. It does not do an effective job of teaching the language. It's really a book made in 1961 with a new cover and all. It's very small, and not much to learn. But it does give you an idea on how to do some things. This book should've been at least REVISED, if not rewritten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever this is, it's not a \\"teach yourself\\" tool","review":"A frustrating ripoff (and I'm no dummy when it comes to learning languages). In his preface Glendening warns against simply memorizing words and instead recommends reading as the best self-tutorial. Then, as the student's first exercise, he presents the silly task of slotting nouns (a long list of them, none defined, a few not even found in his word-lists) according to declension. The examples he offers in the remaining exercises tend to be laced with idiomatic turns of phrase that (to believe some of the other reviews here) might get you laughed at if you used them. Avoid this book if you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a brief overview, but not for serious study.","review":"The book is written in almost reverse order of what the student will want to know. It is short on every-day examples of speech. It does a poor job of explaining the case structure as a concept; it just says \\"learn this\\". The vocabulary in the glossaries is very limited. Students who have studied German and know about cases (as I have)will have an easier time, but not much. I'd pass...Ironically, the TY series has an excellent Russian book, as well as an excellent Norwegian one. I guess PJ just wanted to do his own thing..."},{"rating":"1","title":"-Out of date, out of touch.","review":"This book is old school in a bad way. There's no possible way that you could learn how to speak Icelandic through this book. For example, he teaches you all 47 prepositions at one time...without any real practice for them. He also teaches you the formal forms for \\"you\\", which aren't used anymore...it's just outdated...horribly outdated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the general student","review":"This book is not like the other fine books of the Teach Yourself series, as it has not been revised like the other language books have. If you want to learn Icelandic this book will not really help you to do so, it has a difficult layout and is not geared toward learning to speak & understand. It's really only a good book for linguists interested in Icelandic grammar. TY books really should publish a newer edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sketchy and Poorly Edited","review":"While this book may be reasonable for linguists or people with extensive experience with Scandinavian languages, it is virtually intractable for newcomers to the field. Grammatical concepts are merely sketched with little or no explanation. The pronunciation guide is extremely cumbersome, listing phonetic symbols without clearly telling students which Icelandic letters represent which sounds. Translation exercises require grammatical concepts before they have been introduced in the text and the glossary is woefully incomplete. Definitely NOT a text for beginners!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like newer John Cale","review":"If you've heard some Cale music in collaborations such as with Brian Eno or have heard some of his later stuff (e.g. Helen of Troy--which is quite good), don't expect the same.

I was hoping for a light humorous book with some insights into Hollywood and California culture, as seen by someone Not From Around Here, but it turned out to be mostly about the author's battles with a dog that pooped everywhere.

It was a triumph over demons ..... it was hope itself. To hear Tim, at home in the bossom of his youth, share his extraordinary chronicles of the longings and failings of the human heart is to experience the extremes of pain and beauty simultaneously. For the moment our own personal emotional landscapes are illuminated by the extraordinary glow of the hopes of the heart and littered by the ruins of love lost.

I understood this time to be the least representative of truth: the doctors symbolized, to me, the desire that many have to explain everything away so that they can live comfortably in their own leisured zones of understanding.

Otherwise, the player will default to the beginning of the last track that was played--in this case skipping back to where you were when you started the 45 minute drive. Even if you have a newer player, if the book is being listened too during a commute to your children's school, they would be unable to take the CDs with them to continue the book in another car on the way home.Aaaarrrgghhh.Note, however, that the translation and performance struck me as being well done (at least for the first 45 minutes!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"headset","review":"well couldnt use the headset cause people said they couldnt here me on it plus made a real loud roaring noice had to get another headset for the phone this is the second phone i have bought of this kind the first one quit working awhile back wont be buying anymore of this type..........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"I had to order this phone twice.

I can honnestly say that the hours I spent reading this book were hours of my life completely wasted. The charecters, emotions and scenes are underdeveloped and extremely depressing.

Sure, at its heart there's Inman's epic journey and Ada's struggles on the farm (and the occasional scrape with assorted ne'er-do-wells and low lifes) but for the most part, it's a slow build to the end. But I, for one, could not put this book down.Frazier's talent for description and characterization carry the story brilliantly through what--in the hands of a lesser writer--would be a tough slog. Although it's been some time since I've read this book (I'll most likely be reading it again) there's one scene in particular that has stuck with me--Inman's interaction with the blind vendor outside the hospital. Again, not much going on there, but the authenticity of their relationship and the dialogue was extraordinary.A great read--one that will stay with you, I promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"No summit","review":"What a disappointment.

For long periods it was, quite simply, boring. Inman's trek across a nightmarish South was more engaging, but still lacked any sort of thrust or dip. After a long time of the author's decision to use underscore intead of quotation marks became not just a strange affectation but actively insulting.

Ada can sit on her porch reading literature and eating warm meals while Inman walks miles through cold mountains, days without food and being subjected to unspeakable cruelties. Eventually, the cruelty of man will reach Ada and this is an important point. I found myself thinking how trivial my life is as a civilian, complaining about the stupid war in Iraq and completely ignorant of the suffering of our service men and women serving there. The message for me is how futile war in general is and how hard it is for civilians to appreciate the sacrifices made. A telling point of the story is when Inman walks by the large plantation houses and thinks how he has suffered so the slave owners can keep their way of life. The story is powerful and dark. At times I thought I could not continue reading the book, but I'm glad I fought through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible and Boring","review":"I'll be brief..This is a horrible book.

The epilogue was sentimental twaddle, bathed in a \\"Waltons\\" family glow that didn't match anything Frazier had written up until then. Also, it is not wise to turn minor characters into major ones in the last 3 pages of a 356-page book.Up until the epilogue, I'd been happy enough with Cold Mountain; its slow pace didn't bother me, and Frazier seemed to have a real feeling for his subject. My only pre-epilogue objection was mild: I found myself thinking, as yet another character was cured of disease by an herbal treatment, of the Pauline Kael line about how she personally believed in the efficacy of some herbal treatments, but that she wished just once a movie character treated with them would kick off.

However, if you like your story to move along at a reasonable pace, skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Humph","review":"I must admit that I began this book with high expectations. I had heard it highly praised. As I read it, I tried to convince myself that I was enjoying it, but in the end, I was glad when I finally turned the last page. I found none of the characters convincing. Ada is probably the worst of the lot. I find it hard to believe that a girl of her background and breeding would have so readily accepted the hardships that she faced. Not that bad behavior should be encouraged, but where were the tantrums? Where were the power struggles between Ada and Ruby? Where were the conflicts within Ada herself? These should have been inevitable. They would have been interesting.

Some readers do love pages and pages of repetitive landscape description, but I actually like for things to happen in a book. I was 200 pages in before I was even interested. I didn't really feel the romance, either. For most of the book, the characters were pretty much unconnected. You would barely think they knew each other. I enjoyed about the last 50 pages or so.

I must say, though, that the ending devastated me. I know we can't expect \\"happily ever after\\" endings, but the author seemed to be heading in that direction, and that's what I desperately wanted for Inman and Ada, especially after all the trouble they went through. I couldn't sleep after reading the ending. I had to read that part over several times to make myself believe that was the way it ended.

Inman brilliantly expresses the distress of a disillusioned combat weary survivor.

The fairy tale journey ... \\"and then he met an old woman ....crossed a river ...\\" and encountered yet another obstacle provides a predictable and unimaginative plot. A flimsy historical romance, it includes politicallycorrect indigenous American mythology with tokenistic delivery. Unconvincing and poorlyintegrated into the body of the novel, his talesof Swimmer are clumsy and obtuse. His somewhat stilted writing style attempts to convey the language of the period, however it is inconsistent. The up-side is the pace of the novel, which successfully captures the slow pace of daily life and travel at that time. I can't believe what sells well in the USA ... the likes of \\"Bridges of Madison ...\\" and \\"A Thousand Acres\\" etc ... are predictable drivel. When will a truly great American writer hit the best seller lists?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I believe it was to drawn out.","review":"This book I feel it was so boring and drawn out that I feel asleep reading it at work. In my opinion it could have been a little less descriptive. If it would have read with a little more action rather then telling about a tree around the other side of the mountain. A few of the passages I did like. The passage I liked was when Inman took the saw and coped the bull into several pieces. If the author would have went into more detail like he did for the one about the cave it would have been a little better. If this story was not for a grade and I had time to really sit down read it.

There was one good point about this book. It was when they encountered this group of North Carolinian hillbilies, I cracked up when I read that chapter.

Meanwhile, his pampered sweetheart must learn to survive through the tutelage of a knowledgeable stranger.

This is fiction, supposedly based on oral tradition, that advances the notion that the population of the Old South consisted entirely of drunken, filthy, ignorant men who filled their days with sex and thoughts of the same. The women, almost always good looking, seem only too glad to accomodate these drunken fools. As I read, I continued to hope that Inman would encounter at least one person who was not drunk, deranged, dirty, or disgusting, but it was not to be.

No glossary or supporting notes are provided to help understand the antiquated words and aspects of life in the 1860's. And the main character, Inman, apart from a thinly veiled name that describes his personality, appears throughout the book as a non-entity - just a faceless man trudging home to the girl he loves!

It is moving, powerful and beautiful. The writing is poetically descriptive, the storyline is captivating, the characters are three-dimensional and memorable. I do not usually read much fiction, preferring non-fiction. Also, I tend to shy away from books that are on the bestsellers list (afterall, some of the poorest writers of our time hog this list, i.e. Clancy, Steele and King). However, I needed some good but not too taxing reading for a week-long wilderness camping trip. This book was a perfect choice. It reminded me of an American past, reminescent of Faulkner's south: a world where man and nature lived together rather than in conflict.

The word choice was rich, but that didn't quite make up for the glacial pace. The theme is basically two sets of characters who are trying to remake themselves outside of the structure of the civil war. They wander from incident to incident, only slowly growing/changing. I plodded through it, kept afloat by one secondary character (Ruby) and the portrait of characters encountered by the wounded soldier as he traveled.

Love in a sense not just of a romantic aspect but also of an essential family love. The colorful characters and heavenly scenary add to the beautiful descriptions that Frazier adds to his book. The detail that he uses propels you into the novel and into the lives of its characters. The action, suspense and even the dull moments of the novel keep the pages turning. This book has been a wonderful window into the world of self-reliance, hope, love and friendship. It is full of symbolism and of themes that leave you intrigued and mystified, allowing the reader to form their own imaginings of the story and its settings. This book has certainly taken me to a wonderful world in all of the seasons and has touched my heart like I never knew a book could."},{"rating":"1","title":"When does this novel begin to pick up?","review":"Although I enjoy adventure novels, Cold Mountain was not one that I would suggest for the avid adventure readers out there. It seemed as though the story did not start to pick up until the fifth or sixth chapter. Even though there were spurts of predictable excitement here and there, the first two-hundred pages of the novel had me frustrated and curious as to \\"when will this novel begin to pick up?\\".It took much vigor to get into the novel and I feel that only the patient type could really get much out of this slow adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tale of Two Tired North Carolinians","review":"Cold Mountain is an interesting story, not of the Civil War, but of two people trying to survive in the midst of the Civil War. The book is widely noted for its imagery, which in my opinion was a bit overdone. If Frazier had reduced the amount of labored poetry just a smidgen, this would truly be a five-star novel. It's a good story about a man and woman of the rural south whose love for each other sees them each through a gauntlet of troubles, that they might be reunited. It deserves to be read because it is a unique perspective on life during the period, partly based on true characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow Starter, Better Towards The End, Stick Through It","review":"This book is a very slow starter, but as it progresses it gets better and better. Like all other books the beginning is a VERY slow start, but it slowly progresses into a very good work. I wish that the beginning could be almost half as good as the end. The ending is very nice when the author makes you think that Inman is alive, but in the truth he truely turns out to be dead. I love how he messes with your mind at the end. The plates was a very nice twist. Stick through the book, and it will turn out to be a very decent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was the best modern literature book written in a long time.","review":"I read this book last year for a book report i had to do overt the summer for school. My sister gave it to me and I thought that it would be alright, as long as it counted. but as I got into the plot, I found it to be one of the most interesting and well thought out books I ever read. It feels as though you are acually travelling along with Inman along his journey. You also feel Ada's anticipation and worries while waiting for Inman. I feel that this is a great book for anyone that likes to read and not just books that are short and funny. I'm 13 and I found that it is not a book just for adults. if you want a good book, this is definatly a book to check out."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is over-hyped","review":"I bought this book with great expectations. Was I sorely disappointed! I was forewarned that it started out slow but eventually would pick up. I was down to the last 10 pages and I was still waiting for it to \\"pick up.\\" Granted the writing is very well done, the message is good, but I never got into the book. I felt like I was reading an updated version of the Canterbury Tales. Every chapter about Inman was about the people he met on his journey. The chapters about Ada were a chore to get through because they were so boring. And the end was just out of the blue. It was way too sentimental and sappy. I do not recommend this book to people unless they are English majors who can appreciate the prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Those who Have Problems Sleeping","review":"Boring, tedious, disjointed, contrived, silly---poorly fleshed out characters evoke neither sympathy or empathy. There are much better \\"reads\\" out there and more salubrious ways to spend your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Again","review":"This book came to my knowledge through a book club that I have recently joined. My past time is reading and collecting information on the Civil War so I was very excited to begin reading this piece.While the writing was a times beautiful and poetic I found it made for very difficult reading. I enjoy reading because I can escape from reality and reatreat into a new and different world. Cold Mountain did enable me to escape but it was into a deep, dark, depressing world that held no interest for me. Ada's dependent personality grated on my nerves and Innman's nonchalant attitude became tiresome. After struggling to maintain momentum and read the book I was very upset at the ending. I felt I should have been rewarded for completing the long novel and instead I was punished. The bottom line is I would not recommend this book to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"I read this book on the recommendation of several people whose opinion I greatly respect. However, I found it to be painful and very slow-going. Frazier seems caught up in gory descriptions of wounds and general civil war gore, rather than quiet yet meaningful relationships. His writing style of using dashes instead of quotation marks to indicate speech made conversations drone on in a lifeless way. It was painful to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not on the bandwagon","review":"I may be the only one in the universe to feel this way, especially considering Hollywood is making a movie, but I am shocked this book has received so much critical acclaim. Purchased for the very reason the movie is being made, awards, I clawed my way through every boring page, if only to say I finished it. The biggest tragedy of this novel was after dragging myself through the dreary, overly romanticized landscape, the characters do not even get a happy ending. Rather, they get a this-is-real-life dramatic ending designed to impress you with the authors grasp of reality.Needless to restate, I was not impressed and will not go see the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going against the grain...","review":"I know \\"Cold Mountain\\" has won awards and the Amazon.com customer ratings are very high. Even my wife liked it. I wish I had the same experience. I found little pleasure in the book and in retrospect wish I never started it. The first third was quite good. Many interesting characters and incidents. Then it started a downward slope all the way to the end. The journey became tiresome, the new characters decidedly less interesting, and the incidents repetitive and bland. I would not recommend this book to anyone.

Hard to keep up with what's happening between all the walking and farming. The ending was the best part of the book, but still all the walking ruined it. I couldn't stand reading the book, I could barely keep my eyes open. I would never recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Finish It","review":"There are some parts of \\"Cold Mountain\\" which are beautifully written, but beautiful writing just cannot compensate for a lame plot (it's modeled on Homer's \\"The Odyssey\\") and stereotypical, lame characters: a sensitive poetic stud in love with an independent and strong-willed southern beauty. Halfway through I did not see the point in continuing, and I just stopped reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow to Warm Up, Still in My Thoughts","review":"This is not an easy book to get into. I read a chapter, put it down and waited a week to come back to it. Am I ever glad I did! It's definitely a story that slowly entangles you. I couldn't care less about the characters until a third of the book had passed, but I'm still thinking about them -- vividly -- more than a week after finishing the novel. I think about Inman especially, perhaps because of the strength of the \\"hero's journey\\" storyline that we know so well, and the briefly spotlighted, yet so lovingly written Veasey. Stick with this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dissappointed with the ending","review":"Truly enjoyed the book. Felt attached to the characters.

My Dad had worked in Wilmington NC, and like many people around the world, I had very little idea of the Civil War from the side of the south, with its horrors, upheavals and dislocations. While darkly written, at its core is a basic story of how war changes people and in this case brings Inman and Ada closer. When I finished listening to the casette I wanted to read the book, and wanted Frazier to write another, and another....."},{"rating":"1","title":"A walk into oblivion","review":"Although the author tried to paint a picture of these charactors, They weren't anybody I would like to meet or know. I found this very difficult to read and I was happy to be done with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific book, but a little too long","review":"Cold Mountain contains incredibly rich imagery - the reader feels, smells, and hears everything the two main characters experience. The characters, and those they encountered, were amazingly well-defined. Their struggles and triumphs were exhausting to read, and dread of the next day's events clouded each page. The only disappointment I had was that the book went on a little too long with same, dark drudgery - it didn't add anything to the otherwise incredible book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous. I recommend it highly to anyone.","review":"I loved this book. Frazier pulls the reader in until you find yourself taking the journey with Inman, tilling the fields with Ada. I found myself actually physically cold while reading this book--which testifies to Frazier descriptive prowess. I especially enjoyed his compassionate view of the oddball characters Inman meets along his journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold Mountain left me cold","review":"After all the hype I was very disappointed. While well written, the characters evoked no emotions from me and much of the story seemed disconnected. Although interesting from an historical standpoint, at times I wondered why the author felt I needed to know what he was telling me. I think this is one book that will make a better movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfying","review":"One word describes the experience of reading this novel -- satisfying. As with the Iliad or the Odyssey, this is not about plot, but about experience, detail and description. All of you Koontz, Grisham and King fans beware -- this is a reading experience of a different sort: not one of page-turning suspense, but one of slow-paced beauty. Allow yourself the time to be taken in by the details. You will be generously rewarded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply one of the most enjoyable novels I have ever read!!","review":"Cold Mountain is an absolute joy of a novel. Set during the civil war, yet written as one man's quest 'home', it is written so luxuriously and vividly, that I often stopped to reread passages just to fully savor the scene described. Both harsh and compelling, it succeeds not only in telling an enduring tale, but also in describing the pure horror, ruthlessness and savagery of man during war and peace. However, Mr. Frazier does not dwell on these aspects... better, he sneaks them in to the story as you are trying to discover the next twist in this fascinating novel. This is not a story of a man and woman deeply in love for many years who have \\"lost their way.\\" Instead, it is a complex story set in the most complex and saddest time of our nation. Read this novel... I hope you enjoy it one-half as much as I did!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow down and soak in the beauty","review":"If you are a person who appreciates the beauty of a harvest moon that casts blue shadows, or of a heron taking flight, then you will savor this book. But if you drive past scenic turnouts because you want to get home in time to watch \\"Suddenly Susan,\\" perhaps you will agree with those reviewers who found Cold Mountain too detailed, too long and lacking the usual happy ending.As I read Cold Mountain I found myself transported completely to the Civil War south, more so than I've ever been reading literature contemporary to the time. That's the genius of this work -- it shows us so clearly what has changed in the last 135 years by its mastery of things that remain constant: the natural world and human interaction. If you've spent time outdoors or on a farm, you'll recognize the truth in Frazier's writing and absolutely revel in its beauty and grandeur. I've not read a more deserving National Book Award winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best novels of the 20th century!","review":"This novel is so outstanding that it defies description. Every paragraph is a love song to the English language. The story is mesmerizing, original, and beautiful. As for the ending, I thought it was superb. I can't guarantee that you'll love it, but I guarantee that I did, and I've read thousands of novels. A++++"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and Disappointing","review":"I struggled to reach the end of this book, stopping several times to pick up more interesting reads. Perhaps this book is historically accurate and the problem is that the period of time in which it is set was, for lack of a better word, tedious, but I did grow tired of the daily and detailed recounting of the hero's difficult journey home. I didn't think he was ever going to be reunited with Ada and after finishing the book, I wish he hadn't been."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO DESCRIPTIVE,WITHOUT ENOUGH ACTION","review":"i STILL HAVEN'T FIGURED ALL THE HYPE ABOUT this book! I must have started it 4 times until I decided i was going to read it completely, so I could understand what everybody was talking about. One question: Did Inman die in the end after all he had endured? Maybe this is what really disappointed me. Ironically, I just finished Uncle tom's Cabin by Stowe and really enjoyed it. Would someone please explain what I obviously missed during \\"Cold Mountain\\"? I read constantly and I really missed something in this book according to the popularity on the Best Sellers list! I would appreciate hearing from anyone!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book did not live up to the hype.","review":"I was disappointed with the story. It was dark and uninteresting. I did not like the way it was written with no quotations so you couldn't seperate when someone was talking. It also had a bad ending. I would never call this book a love story which is what it gets billed as. Save your time. Read something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expectations not met","review":"I expected more from this book. With all the accolades it received, I was expecting a great read, one that I couldn't put down. What I got was just an okay book. The book is overly wordy and too detailed. The detail definitely got tedious. The story was nothing great.I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and very tiring","review":"I found this book to be very slow at best. I was always waiting for something interesting to happen but it never did. I got bored with Inman and tired of Ada's struggles. Thank goodness I borrowed this book & did not buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bridges of Madison County meets Gods and Generals","review":"After reading four or five Civil War novels/non-fiction books on the Civil War, I found Cold Mountain to be a magnificent blend of history and fiction. The story has enough tenderness for the romanticist and enough tense scenes to satisfy those who prefer a bit more action. It's one of those rare books that both my wife and I can enjoy, albeit on different levels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold Mountain? More like Cold Molehill.","review":"I loathed this book. Although Frazier walks the reader through a detailed landscape, nothing can help his plodding prose. I was disgusted with chapter after chapter of \\"Inman had a thought...it was this:\\". The book begins with a trite, English Patient-esque literary flourish and never improves. Frazier's female \\"protagonist\\" was a sniveler and the numerous one-dimensional characters that Inman meets on his ridiculous walk home never surprise the reader and border on humorous with their cliched symbolism. In his novel Outer Dark, Cormac McCarthy flawlessly achieves what Frazier clumsily attempts in Cold Mountain. I challenge anyone to read Outer Dark and decide for him/herself. I am baffled that Frazier collected the National Book Award for Cold Molehill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chick Magnet","review":"Cold Mountain is The Bridges of Madison County meets the Odyssey with a little Gone With The Wind and Fried Green Tomatoes thrown in. It's another one of those \\"she only has to sleep with the guy once\\" books that follows in the foot steps of The Horse Whisperer. While I was reading this book on a plane trip no less than four women came up to me and each one not only wanted to discuss the book but gave me lists of some of their other personal favorites. The stewardess even interrupted her beverage service for twenty minutes to discuss this book with me. I must have had \\"sensitive guy\\" written on my forehead. The writing isn't bad but some of the narrative needs a good disimpaction. The whole Ruby/Ada thing is also a bit kinky. Just what are they doing when they're not in the field picking produce? You don't need a doctorate in comp lit to pick up the message when Ruby beheads the rooster that pecked at Ada's leg. Maybe I just didn't get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"an odyssey worthy of Homer","review":"Although I had heard both good and bad about this book, I was determined to read it and am glad I did. It was two books for the price of one--Ada's story and Inman's. Frazier is quite the wordsmith--the sentence on page 175 about the stars gathering in congress and agreeing to flee is a very provocative way of saying just how desperate and cruel the times were."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it.","review":"Well, it certainly won an award and according to numerous reviews on this site that seemed to be justified. But I certainly couldn't get into it. I tried on numerous occasions and in the end I got about half way through it and then finally gave up for good. I could not get used to the authors style of writing at all. The story itself, from what I managed to get out of only reading half the book, was very depressing and not very interesting in the slightest. But to me the way that it was written will stand out in my memory as completely uncaptivating and a style of writing that, personally, I will always endeavour to avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm on the same side of the fence as Renoir below","review":"I felt exactly the same disappointment that Renoir in her below review felt in reading this book. To be sure, there was some lyric writing, but most of it was buried under piles of boring plot line and sloppy writing. Maybe if you've never read a great piece of literature before you'd be confused into thinking that it's a modern day Odyssey, but my advice to all but the most hard core devotees of slow moving books is to pick up the Odyssey instead. About half way through this book, I realized that I didn't care whether the main character made it home or not. I love Southern writing (like Faulkner, for example), but there are many masters who do a much better job than Frazier."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Barbara Cartland had written \\"The Painted Bird\\"","review":"You get to wishing that some aggressive infection had killed Inman in the hospital and spared you this read. Most first time authors burn this kind of thing and move on, learning from the mistakes. The fact that this slight, tedious romance novel wins awards is a testament to how terrible writing has become these days. I can't wait to not see the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I read this a year ago.....","review":"and I can't remember a thing about it. I have a dim recollection that it contained two very boring characters that Hollywood would probably have played by Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts and that it seemed a lot like a romance novel in disguise.I picked it up because I loved Ken Burns Civil War and books like Lonesome Dove and I thought as I began that it was a little bit of a combination of these, but as I went on I kept visualizing a picture of Fabio appearing on the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like finding a roach at the end of a great meal !","review":"Charles Frazier's \\"Cold Mountain\\" has great imagery,spellbinding stories, beautiful metaphors and delightful chatacters. However I can NOT recommend it as a good read. It is like eating a great meal at a fine restaurant and finding a roach in the dessert (last chapter). I read for pleasure, not for a Alfred Hitchcock shock ending. I challenge Frazier to rewrite the ending and place it ONLINE so I can change the 2 stars to 5 plus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really boring!","review":"Because some professional reviewers give 'good' reviews to a book doesn't mean that the book is in fact good or interesting. However, the public is often mislead or easily persuaded into purchasing these books because they are often described with such forceful words as 'huge, monumental, out-of-this world'. As far as this book is concerned, it's none of these. If it wasn't given to me, I wouldn't have purchased it. When I can't get involved in the characters and storyline after a few chapters - out it goes! There are too many other good books out there, that don't get the attention simply because they haven't been marketed well, or Oprah hasn't chosen them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing book","review":"Interesting style of writing but the story is too episodic and formulaic. The chapters alternate back and forth between Inman and Ada, which isn't the worst thing in the world but it does get wearyingly predictable. This happens to him. That happens to her. This happens to him. That happens to her. And so on. The ending is depressing and need not have been. I disagree with comments about this was the only ending possible. I don't want to give it away for those who haven't read it, but the ending brings it down at least one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book Ever","review":"I've read some bad books in my time, and this beats them all out. This book was long drawn out and boring. The useless details went on forever, and still provided a hazy picture. If you have to read it for school, get the Spark Notes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Read It","review":"Foremost, this book left me all the more resolved to experience life -- to take advantage of the oportunities to really live as they appear. It made me wish that Mr Frazier had already authored a body of similar work I could dip into and draw more from. This is a book about living in our world of connection to those things around us. The author excels at the parsimonious use of language to engage all senses and so bring the tale into the reader's reality. His descriptive language of scent and aroma in particular evoked memory in alternately vivid and shocking fashion. What a gift and skill! Read the book, and read it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Civil War fans","review":"Although the male lead character, Inman, is escaping from the harsh realities of the Civil War, it has no Civil War history at all. It is a rather boring story, and Inman leads a rather unrealistic journey home. With gruesome killings at the turn of every page, it makes the reader become disillusioned with the story being told and the writer himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"SIMPLY OVERRATED","review":"Frasier is a genius with words but that's about it unfortunately. Folks go crazy over this tale because there aren't many good new books around these days. I worked sooo hard getting into the character Inman but it was a failure. He seems strangely one-dimensional while Ada is maybe two-dimensional. And Nature is three-dimentional. Frasier digs nature so much more than his characters that COLD MOUNTAIN should be classified as a \\"nature\\" book (not fiction)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Follow all recipes and you will have a bestseller","review":"I found this book mediocre and stereotypical. I looks like author took a formulas from some books that enjoyed success before and mixed them in a blender: Journey + Horrors of War + Horrors of Slavery + Romantic Story + Chase and Fighting. Nothing original at all. You would loose nothing by missing this opus."},{"rating":"1","title":"details in search of a good story.","review":"I can't understand how this very tedious piece of junk ever made it to anyones' best seller list. The author obvoiusly studied the flora of the region, but there is no interesting ending to this thing. It just sort of stops and does so with an unlikely bit of forced plotting. What a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've never been so bored as I was reading this book!","review":"When I first started to read this book it was extremely boring, I continued reading it hoping it would gradually get better. I was terribly wrong, I could not get into the book what so ever. In the middle of the book I was extremely dissapointed. If we didn't have to read it for school I would have burned it after the first chapter. The ending was a suprise though. I have never been so happy to end a book, as I was when I finished this one. This is a very good bedtime story but warning to all readers, not only will the person your reading to fall asleep but so will you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why All the Fuss?","review":"The first thing I noticed was that the typeface was too small. Then, it went downhill from there.I have no idea why this book is so uniformly loved, I truly don't. I tried reading it but stopped around page 75 or so. When I start a book I always finish it. This is one of the few times where I said \\"no\\". I just didn't care about the characters or the plot.When I find myself flipping thru pages to the back of the book I know the book's in trouble. That's what I did with \\"Cold Mountain\\". Read, flip, read, flip, flip, stop, look out the train window, flip, read, stop. This was my routine for a few days then I gave up.I brought the book back and picked up \\"Underworld\\" and \\"Into Thin Air\\". Now if you want good books, read these!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"Cold Mountain has only two flaws: the ending and the fact that it alternates from gorgeous, splendid, magnificent writing to merely gorgeous, splendid writing. It's quite unlike anything I have ever read before, extraordinarily well-researched, lyrical, beautiful, you can touch the snow and taste the coldness of the creek water. I often find myself thinking about it even though it's been three months and nine other books since I read it. My great-grandmother, who lived in the same general area, was 20 years old at the end of the Civil War. Like Ada, she too was educated, came from a well-to-do family and also had to wait until the end of the war before she could be with her betrothed. My great-grandparents' story end differently but but reading Ada's story made me taught me a great deal about what daily life must have been like for my great-grandmother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gifted writer in need of a story","review":"I won't spoil the ending for you(the author will do that himself), but I would have gladly suffered through a few more chapters if it meant finding a reasonable outcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the quotation marks?","review":"The lack of quotation marks to indicate dialogue made this a very difficult read.

I did have a positive outlook when I started, especially aftering having seen a Sunday CBS This Morning segment about the location. A well written book and an extreme disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"An over-hyped book","review":"After reading all the great reviews of this book and its author I was looking forward to reading this author's first novel. I was rather disappointed. The story is poor and says much to do about nothing. I was at times wondering what the author was trying to say about Iman's journey or experiences. I really feel as if the author should have included a description of him prior to his experiences in the war, so the reader could have have a better idea where he was coming from. I did find Ada's saga more interesting, but a spoiled girl being forced to grow up in harsh times is not unique and I did not find myself that interested in her evolution either. The love story between the two characters was also poorly described and the ending was as predictable as it gets. All in all this was one book and author I was disappointed with and doublt I will read his next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potentially an interesting story, but so poorly written","review":"... and delivered that I never gained much sympathy for the characters or respect for the hard times and environment in which they lived. Luckily I have visited the Blue Ridge mountains, so I could visualize their haunting beauty without the aid of the author's descriptions. The only scene which I now remember vividly was the cruel demise of the bears. As for the ending, I suppose the author was trying to be clever, but I had to read it several times hoping to get closure for 500 or so pages of effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATED IT!","review":"I really hate to be negative about any book and of course I don't want to insult the author, but I found this book incredibly dull. I was barely able to get through the entire book. I mostly skimmed the chapters about Inman waiting for something interesting to happen. The chapters about Ada and Ruby were slightly more readable, but not enough to make the book interesting. None of the characters drew me in. I read this book because I kept hearing how good this book was. I know i'm in the minority but I wouldn't recomend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark and Obvious Piece of Junk Disguised as Literature","review":"This book is a cliched piece of garbage and the author should be drawn and quartered. Not only is it unrelenting in its depravity, it passes itself off as a romance. Most women I know would be instantly turned off by the vulgar and disgusting details in this work. DO NOT BUY IT. If this saves one person $20, good. Give the money to a charity instead. Sometimes it isn't better to go and read a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"No action. What kind of war book is this, no gore.","review":"Maybe I don't understand very moving literature, but I've read more exciting books than this, and yes we were assigned to read this book in a high school english class. The point on reading a book that took place in a Civil War period, is the behind the scenes of the war, hell. Gone with the Wind was even better than this. At least they told a good story about the life in the Confederacy. This story told more of farming, survival, and some sex ( don't get me wrong, I loved the slut scene) but slow never the less. If any one who would want to buy, or borrow this book. You must have a lot of time on your hands, because this book is not what you call a Civil war story."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Journey Without, Two Journies Within","review":"In Cold Mountain, Charles Frazier alternates chapters between Inman and Ada, bringing them closer and closer together as the novel progresses. These two characters, who in the beginning of the novel are ill-suited for each other, each embark on a journey of survival and discovery, Inman's being a literal journey, the long walk home from the war, and Ada's being the figurative one, the journey into adulthood through the trials of being able to subsist on her inherited land. It is the journey that these two people take that melds them into a compatible pair, and as the novel progresses, Frazier lovingly binds them together in a world carefully and flawlessly recreated for the reader. It is a powerful first effort, well researched and carefully detailed. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This IS a masterpiece!","review":"There are a lot of reviews about this book, but I had to write one too because this book is a masterpiece! The people who say they didn't like the ending probably feel that way only because the author gets to choose who lives and who dies. The reader loves the characters so much that they are mad & grieve when a favorite is killed off. But this was the Civil War! No soldier or American went without wounds. This is a book you will LOVE! I am glad I read it, bought it and I hope my review leads you to do the same! You'll be missing much if you never read Cold Mountain. Read it cover to cover!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyman's Journey","review":"Reading Cold Mountain is a tale of Everyman and EveryWoman, albeit set in the Civil War era. As I walked through the journey of Inman, Ruby and Ada I began to wonder if it isn't a classic story of every one's Life. Does Inman (In Man) represent every man's journey? Does Ruby represent every woman's quest for knowledge and experiences? Is Ada the medicine woman who knows more than her education in formal training shows? Although the novel is well written I found it's melancholy tone to be oppressive. I was left wondering why the author choice not to spend more time at the epiphany moments in the book. For example when Inman befriends and is literally touched by the young widow with the hog why didn't he stay longer with her? \\"War is hell\\" is clearly illustrated in this novel. Where is the beauty is left begging..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book, Beautiful Cover","review":"I think Disney has a similar story about a dog ... nevertheless, \\"Cold Mountain\\" was a pleasant reading experience.

If the story were set to music, it would be nothing more than a percussive \\"trudge, trudge, trudge\\" with an occasional banjo and broken violin dragging along. Upon reading the reviews and the initial chapters, Frazier's story of an outlier (deserter) during the Civil War evokes vivid images of pain, suffering, hardship, filth, and all the other accoutrements of battle. The long walk home to his conjured-up sweetheart, a girl he barely knew before trudging off to enlist, is more interesting than the actual reunion. The story is told from the soldier's experiences and then from those of the \\"sweetheart\\". Both suffer, both change in appearance and ideals. It was a terrible time, of course, and Mr. Frazier's award-winning downer employs Murphy's Law to its full extent ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixed Feelings...","review":"After all the hype I had to read this book. As a vacation read, I have to admit it was a slow one. The ending was slightly anti-climatic. However, after I completed the book, the more I thought about it the more I think I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Wife's Gift I had to read!","review":"When my wife gave me the book for Christmas I was thrilled. I had heard so much about it - and #1! But I just finished it - plodded through it - and I thanked her for it but I will donate it to the public library. Maybe someone else will enjoy it. It was depressing and didn't really follow a plot line that I could discover. The words that were written came together nicely at places, but the whole was not complete. Nice descriptions of the mountains in winter. The book was COLD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved the ending.","review":"As soon as the \\"bear\\" incident occurred, I could see what was going to happen - the bear was Inman's \\"totem\\" & when uncontrollable incidents conspired & ended with the death of the bears - well. I was thrilled at Inman's redemption, though, & what better thing could a woman say of a man \\"she doesn't need\\" - \\"I think I want him though\\". I really liked this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"such choice words","review":"The author kept me completely entranced as I couldn't wait for the next vivid description. As an example I personally loved Ada theorizing that the dirty clothes at the bottom of the pile were somehow fresher than the ones she just took off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needed Better Editing","review":"It's a classic theme of a pilgrim traversing a shattered world. Witches, but not as fanciful as \\"Brother Where Aret Thou?\\" and none of the humor of \\"Gravity's Rainbow.\\" Most off the writing is very solid with some excellent metaphors that will stay with you. My biggest gripe is that a couple lines get repeated which clearly should have been edited out.Although Inman is starving, there is a scene where he kills a very bad man in the bad guy's smoke house, then leaves. A smokehouse was literally like a bank, and there is no way to explain Inman failing to take several hams with him."},{"rating":"1","title":"why?","review":"why is this book so boring? i don't need to know how wet and brown and chocolatey and soggy and damp and moist and dark and marshy the marsh was. i feel allowing room for the reader to infer a few details with their own imagination might have been nice. the national book award...really? i was afraid for inman to take his next step or wake from slumber in dread of being subjected to another 5 pages of how dirty and brown and chalky and dry the dirt beneath his black, heavy, worn, creased, leathery boots were. through frazier's superfluous descriptions i was waiting to read about how foul inman smelled, but no such luck. what did i learn from reading this book? quotation marks are our friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored With Ada","review":"First of all, the book was disappointing. I thought that it would be more about the Civil War, but there wasnt much about the battles, just mentioned here and there. Seems like the Author started in the middle of a story.I was very bored most of the time with Ada. I skipped a lot of her discriptions of non interesting plants etc. She seemed to be dumb about everything except looking at birds and weeds and plants. She didnt seem to notice all those years that a war was going on. She seemed blind to so much that was happening.Also, I was very disappointed in the ending of the book. I just couldnt believe it ended that way. Sort of all at once."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you enjoy watching paint dry, this book is for you.","review":"this book had a great story line and well developed characters but the book itself was was a bore. It was so overly detailed, it put me to sleep every time I picked it up. There was maybe one relevant sentence in every paragraph and the rest was just stupid details I don't need to know. This book is filled with stupid metaphors that are often disgusting. This would be a great book if it was cut down to about one hundred pages, and stripped of all of the irrevelant details."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much description","review":"This book had a few good moments to it, but often swerved off, and went into to much detail with the surroundings. Also I didn't much care for the fact that it keep switching from charecter to charecter as the chapters progressed. All in all the book didn't apeal much to me, and I had no interest in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreary","review":"Do not waste your time with the Audio Cassette. I have listened to probably 100 books on tape. Contrary to what the above description says, Charles Frazier's slow paced, drawled, sing song, no inflection reading of his \\"masterpiece\\" only made a long, rather dull book almost unbearable. Don't be suckered into buying these tapes. If you must, get the book and read it. Although, I wouldn't even recommend that. I found the book to be a chore and very uninvolving."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lengthy and BORING travelogue.","review":"When I get to page 60 of a novel and still cannot make heads nor tails of what is happening, something is wrong. This has got to be one of the most over-rated books in modern history. When action scenes require, well, action, what do we get??? Descriptions of the moon for several pages. Give me a break. This is not a Civil War tale, but a lengthy and boring travelogue. And why did the author not use quotation marks to set off dialogue? Some artistic thing?--or was the key on his typewriter broken? Obnoxious and hard to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"This book is not only awful, but it is entirely unreadable. It is purely for pseudo-intellectuals and those who aspire to become one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"I had this book on my must read list and when I finally got around to reading it I was thoroughly disappointed. I struggled to get through it figuring that somewhere along the way something would spark the slightest interest, which would enable me to recommend this book and pass it along to my friends, but this never happened. As a matter of fact, when I finished the book, I was actually annoyed with myself for having persevered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much fanfare, too little on delivery.","review":"Spare me, who cares?

It was chosen by our Book Club and (after all the hype) caused more disappointment than any book I have read in many a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basically an unenjoyable book with a bad ending.","review":"The book was filled with unwanted details and it contained very little description of how the characters actually felt; It said nothing about emmotions, so in my imagination I could only picture the characters as lifeless zombies. The closing of the lengthy book was extremely confusing and I could not tell if the main character died or not. The very ending of the book might as well have been,\\"They all lived happily ever after.\\" It was just not a very good book and I don't know why it has received so many positive comments."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tired, insipid, bore - don't waste your time","review":"The hype surrounding this novel makes me wonder if Frazier is owed many favors by the community of critics. Cold Mountain was a huge disappointment. It appears that the author couldn't decide between a narrative-driven novel and a descriptive one. He ends up failing at both endeavours. The story is long, painful, and liberally scattered with side plots each of which has no apparent purpose. The descriptions are not especially vivid. They are, in fact, not especially anything. Just boring. Don't waste your time on this book unless you are a very serious Civil war buff."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Story read with a Great Voice","review":"Most authors who chose to read their own work end up doing a poor job of it. Charles Frazier reads this excellent story with perfection. I am listening to it for the third time."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE GRASS GROWS SLOWER ON THIS SIDE","review":"This book has a good story line which could be much better than it is. Fraizer writes a novel with great imagery. Inman's journey across the embattled south is an epic one. However, the book's biggest detractor is the slowness of the plot at times. Some parts of the book are quite entertaining and just wish to be finished whilst others feel laborious to finish. If you are a person who is fascinated with the Civil War Era this book is for you. If you are the kind of person that looks for a book which is full of excitement and is nearly impossible to put down, you will be dissapointed by this one. Its underlying plot is of excellent caliber but it is the slowness of some parts of this book that keep it from being as good as it could potentially be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tell me something new","review":"Cold Mountain is generating lots of attention, but I think it is overrated. It uses as its basis a journey -- of a deserting Confederate soldier -- and is thus able to have him encounter a variety of circumstances. Unfortunately, many of these circumstances are trite at best and offer little new insight into the human character. This is not a book I will rave about!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Guide to writing a bestseller ....","review":"Heres a guide to writing the next bestseller -1. Copy several hundred pages out of a really old trail guide to North Carolina2. Add a few dozen recipes for goat stew3. Don't forget to rip out the last few pages just to make sure that the reader is left feeling cheated and bewildered."},{"rating":"2","title":"The author narrates his own novel on audio","review":"I have listened to Charles Frazier's rendition of his own novel _Cold Mountain_ three times, and I believe it to be the best rendered audiobook I've ever heard. Frazier captures the nuances of a man so accustomed to the culture of violence that he can report upon it like an observor, while at the same time serve as an active participant in the story's action and structure. Frazier's accent and tone and phrasing are wonderful, at times hypnotic. He speaks the 150-year old English of the American south--with its anachronistic phrases and vocabulary--convincingly and authoritatively. The oral mode is perfect for this first person epic: it gives it an immediacy a text reading cannot convey, and by its nature doesn't have some of the embarrassing features other audiobooks contain when the narrator must change voices."},{"rating":"1","title":"a man, a woman, a bear","review":"The story behind the story is simple and revealed after the first two chapters of the book. It is a story of two people, one man, one woman, as they each journey towards their individual dreams and find peace in themselves by way of self-redemption and self-sacrifice.The man is a soldier who has self-retired after a \\"fatal\\" bullet and gathers himself as he embarks on his long walk home. On the other side of the mountain, the woman sits alone yearning for help on her farm and wholeness in her life. Each bump in the road for the man is accompanied by a droning parallel of the woman and her farmwork. Will the man make it home and reunite with the woman? Will the woman ever finish her chores? Read this book to find out.Personally, I believe this novel is an admirable attempt to clone a timeless classic, but i fail to recognize the allure and originality of an Odyssey. The senseless brutality and heartless farm scenary contributes to my recognition of this novel as FAIR."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Beautiful","review":"A civil war age odyssey that somehow tackles the contrast of humanity's goodness and evil without being cliche. Wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING....WHAT IS ALL THE HYPE?","review":"THIS could have been a good book, but just could not hold my interest. It was boring for all but maybe 100 pages. If this book was edited down, maybe. A good story line and this would probably make a great movie. There was too much babble, i found it hard to concentrate and enjoy. This book has been winning awards???? I know several people who put it down after 100 pages. It is just not gripping, although it could have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big deal?","review":"I struggled to get through this. I found the language cloying, over-blown and annoying, wrapped around a tenuous cast of characters. Also tripped over several editing errors, which were irritating. I find it disheartening that this novel is being heralded as classic literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"The best lullaby ever written.","review":"This book bored me. I would never have finished it, if I didn't have to for class. Anytime I had trouble sleeping read a page and my problem was solved. The first half was dull no attention grabbing anything it was all boring detail. The book finally got a little better at the end. The ending I think was written the best was it could have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great war novel","review":"I had heard many great things about this book becuase my grandpa had read it and had loved it . He raved about the book alll the time . I was surpirsed though how much this book went into to details about war , not that this was a bad thing but it is not for everyone. I myself enjoyed this novel a whole lot . I enjoyed the two different stories going on at the same time. It made me think a little bit more about things going on. I also enjoyed the ending because I'm still not sure what happened but i got to make up my imagination and thats the best ending a book could have . I was pleased with this book very much so. I can't wait till this author comes out with another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold Mountain Leaves Reader Cold","review":"I must give the author two stars for effort, as Frasier is a very eloquent writer, however, I did not enjoy the story in the least bit. I found it a chore to actually sit down and read Cold Mountain, but forced myself to do so because I had paid good money for it. I would definitely avoid this book, unless you want something that will put you to sleep as a result of a lack of any action. Maybe that is why all so many people liked Cold Mountain...it is a good alternative to sleeping pills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Award?","review":"The National Book Award? For Cold Mountain? The writing style will make you hurl. Can I have my ten bucks back please? Lines like:the teacher was \\"pink of face,\\" and the grasses were yellow \\"from need of cutting\\" will make you sick. I gave up after forty pages. The Book Award people must have had too much wine and cheese, jeez. Hey Frazier, what happened to the friggen war? You know, burned out cities, stuff like that. Inman goes shopping in Carolina? Give us a break! Get Strunk's book and read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR CHILDREN!","review":"This was on my son's 11th grade reading list.

I wish I had known the content ahead of time.Cold Mountain: A Novel"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold Mountain - what a disappointment","review":"Please consider reading other 'historical fiction' based on the time period of the Civil War before putting this one on your reading list. Yes, you get the idea that the War is going on and that people have been affected by it, but page after page of 'setup' from the time period is just too much for me. There is no real climax to the story and only a brief resolution of what the whole novel is about in the first place. Gone With The Wind felt like a shorter novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Work","review":"If you read this book and could not smell the air, feel the blistered feet, and taste the food, it is only because you have not experinced it in life . The descriptions of the walk home and the life at Ada's farm was so real that you had no choice but to read on. Some what of a let down at the end, but then isn't almost anything that is realistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheer beauty","review":"If I could write like anyone it would be like Mr. Frazier. I cried at the end of this book probably more because it was over than because of the ending. Savor each word. You'll read it over and over again. Waiting (not so patiently) for more wonderful books by this author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to understand but the plot is good.","review":"I haven't finished that yet but from the begin to page #300 it has been difficult but still somehow interesting to read. I don't know where do I find the interests parts but maybe it just takes me into the plot while when I or we in the class are reading that. I would given better grade if they just hadn't put so much details to the story. But anyway that book is not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Memorable Epic!","review":"Cold Mountain is a beautifully written story about the struggles of two people who hope, against all odds, to reunite with each other. Set in the Blue Ridge Mountains during the Civil War, it is a tragic and emotional tale of a man's will to go on in the harshest of environments and a woman who never gives up hope that one day he will return to her to continue with the life that the war has temporarily stolen from them. The characters are believable, the imagery is beautiful, and the ending is unforgetable. Cold Mountain is a must-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book, full of haunting images and people.","review":"This book was exceptional. I enjoyed the Lyrical quality of his prose. Frazier puts the reader into the thoughts of the characters with his descriptive narative. I enjoyed being shown rather than being told. One crticism: the characters themselves were better developed than their realtionship. It was as if there romance was woven into the story to justify the importance of following these two lives. Frazier was in no hurry in telling his tale. I do admit, I was at first waiting for something to \\"happen\\". Then, at about midway, I let myself be taken in with the narrative and enjoyed the day to day doings of Aida and Inman. I would recomend this to anyone who enjoys savoring a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do yourself a favor and skip this book!","review":"Cold Mountain started out well and went downhill with the crude descriptions of a sleazy female. If you don't want to read crude and degrading literature, skip this book. The ending stunk as well. I was very disappointed considering the rave reviews it received. If you want to read historical fiction based on the Civil War, try Michael Shaara's \\"The Killer Angels.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed with this book....it is really soft pornography....really bad language and graphic sexual content for which I was not prepared nor do I appreciate. If this had been a hard copy of the book instead of an ebook, I would have thrown it in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Narrator","review":"I have heard so much of this book and decided to get the audio CDs from the library. I was extremely disappointed with the narrator - who also happens to be the author. He sounds as if he is about to fall asleep and seems to have trouble annunciating words that end in \\"w\\" - it drives me mad. He reads in a monotone - no excitement in his voice - he just drones on and on.I am a big fan of audio CDs because I can listen to the stories while doing other things - I'm not tied down to the couch. I have listened to many narrators - Jim Dale for one - and have never hated listening until now. Charles Frazier may be a \\"brilliant\\" author, and should stick with writing - period! Leave the storytelling to someone who has a personality and brings the story to life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, Pointless and boring","review":"Can someone please expain the point of this book?

The ending seem too rushed ,, nothing like the rest of the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold Mountain Leaves Readers Out In The Cold","review":"I chose to read this book for my Literary Analysis class and every chapter felt like torture. What was the point of Inman saying how he felt spiritually connected to bears, then having him shamelessly kill and eat a mother and her cub? There was too much emotionless killing for me; try this one only if you have a bottle of Prozac nearby or are looking for a way to waste a few hours of your life. If you want a book that is truly something to rave about, try MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA. That book deserves no less than five stars, unlike this flat and pointless story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of my time.","review":"This book took forever to get to the point. Once, it got there, I was amazed by the excuriating effort it took to get to such a stupid ending. The ending romanticised premarital sex and a child growing up without a father. What a waste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Harlequin romance in Ulysses' clothing","review":"Okay, the man can write -- every review gives him that -- but the plot is thin, tedious and vapid. Only in America in 1997 could a deserter become a hero -- this thing is PC to the extreme --\\"war is bad, Indians are noble beings living in harmony with the land\\" -- and the soupcon of lesbianism does nothing for the plot or prose. Read carefully this thing is really a womans' book -- a Harlequin romance -- though it is gussied up in some masculine trappings. Despite the groundswell of approval, skip this turkey -- wish I had, and saved my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the worst thing I've ever read...","review":"While very descriptive, most of the characters seem to have been pulled from a Cracker Jacks box o' stereotypes.

I read it practically straight through. The story and the characters are solidly drawn, although not extraordinary. But his language of description is extraordinarily beautiful in it's simplicity. Some of the most beautiful (and economical) writing I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional, well deserving of praise","review":"With a stunning evocative power that ranks it up there with historical fiction gems like 'The Triumph and the Glory' and 'The Killer Angels', this exceptional novel fulfilled all of my expectations from beginning to end. It was one of the best books I've read in the last year, a book well worth your consideration."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars until the ending","review":"I know the ending was poetic. I know the ending was foreshadowed. I know the ending was beautifully written. But it was still a lame way to put down a book that I had not been able to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best read on an empty stomach","review":"If I had to read about what Inman and Ada ate one more time I was going to eat the darn book. Thankfully, the story ended. The author probably couldn't come up with yet one more disgusting discription of roadkill. When Inman ate the bear I burst out laughing. Yes, I know people eat bear but it was just a little farout as to how Inman got the bear in the first place.All that aside, the book is quite boring although I recognize that the author worked very hard on it. He just didn't come through for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"*****An unending bore; a waste of trees*****","review":"I was required to read this novel for junior english and found it hard to pick up, easy to put down. For the first fifty pages Frazier kept my attention with his time-specific writing and characterizations. However, by the four-hundredth page, the terrificly slow journey had left me back in the hospital where the book began. Nothing seems to happen in this book. If history is your thing, try this book, but don't expect too much. Cold Mountain is nothing special. If you want a truly good book try _One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest_ or _As I Lay Dying_; leave Frazier for another lifetime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost on the first sentance","review":"This novel could have been a good piece of work, but was so poorly written. I could only stand reading the first couple words without becoming lost. And what was all the hype about? Obviously, people don't know what a good book is."},{"rating":"1","title":"A badly written, inconsisent, trite,bore","review":"I am cursed with the inability to put down a book once started. I long for this book to end, page after corny page. The characters are cardboard. The writing stilted with colons, like this: leaden. Was this book ever editited or were they in a hurry to get it out in time foir some book event? Example: He;'s eating goat stew on one page that mysteriously morphs into lamb stew. Oh well, only 80 pages left."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad for a first book","review":"I had to force myself to finish this book. After the beginning, wondering why everyone who sees as much as his shadow wants to kill Inman, the main character, and where he got so much money, I had a hard time taking the rest of the book seriously. There was really no charater development. Each character had maybe one quality that they never strayed from: one weak, one strong, one determined. I can see that this story would make a good movie (but I haven't seen the movie) since it is at least a very visual book. However, I didn't particularly care for the descriptive passages in Cold Mountain. Also, the story line is very simple an predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful writing does not a masterpiece make","review":"I suppose that, perhaps in the middle of a nasty stretch of bleak winter in solitary confinement, I might be compelled to try reading Cold Mountain again. The description reeks of self-consciousness. I managed to read the first 100 pages, and could stand no more.I *am* from the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, and it is a stunningly beautiful, sometimes hazily mysterious place. I love it, but I'm spoiled by its lush reality. Frazier obscured the view. I found Ruby far more interesting than either the self-absorbed, despairing Inman or the tiresome Ada.So far as an adventure of the wandering seeker is concerned, The Chess Garden is a much more engaging read."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Long Walk\\" is better","review":"Why is this book so over-hyped? I cannot see the point. Frazier writes competently, but I find it hard to be enthused about his subjects. Maybe I'm just tired of reading about low-lifers and their disgusting appetites and vices. Call me old fashioned, but I don't see the need to wallow in the mud, even if it is elegantly described mud. If you want a compelling story of a heroic journey that is impossible to put down, read Slavomir Rawicz's \\"The Long Journey,\\" available in paperback from Amazon.com for less than $11. This is a true story of the author's escape from a Siberian prison camp and his trek to India. It involves no graphic violence, rutting, or even cursing. Long Walk will restore your belief in the basic decency of your fellow human beings. It is also, in contract to Cold Mountain, impossible to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story, sparse writing, graphic violence","review":"This book was short on information and long on words. Oftentimes, I did not know what the author was talking about because of his use of jargon and very little dialogue.The story was good, but the violence was a little too graphic for my taste. A disappointing ending as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold Mountain was... cold","review":"I had the constant impression as I read this book, that it was always night. This book was extremely dark and depressing. The beginning was interesting but right when it got to Ada I knew I was in for a sleeper. Most of the reviewers said they liked Ada better- in a way I did, I actually knew more about her, but I was thankful when it switched to Inman's side of the story. At least things actually happened. I was very dissapointed by this book. Once again a writer who can write well, but just can't get a story. Overrated. I've been to that area of the US and while Frazier said in his text it was beautiful, he never showed us it was. It was dark, dark, dark! Unless he had a goal of us all buying anti-depressants while reading this, the book was not a sucess. Well, I expected that. Award winning books NEVER are any good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cold Mountain is a great read","review":"The book was great, and I feel it will stand the test of time and become an American classic. I have a first edition copy of the book and even though it's unsigned, I am saving it because I feel it will be a collector's item one day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sit back, relax, and enjoy - a spa for the mind.","review":"This is not a book for the train on the way to work - it should be cherished and enjoyed. I read \\"Into Thin Air\\" and loved every minute of it....I couldn't put it down. \\"Cold Mountain\\" is the kind of book you want to put down...the prose are so rich that you should only be able to take in so much in one sitting...and you should never want it to end. A friend's wife is a speed reader and finished the book in three days...why bother. This is folklore...not Hollywood. Relax and enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just couldn't get into it.","review":"I tried to read this book twice and just couldn't. It didn't hold my interest, my mind kept wandering to things that I could be doing. When I took it back to the library for the second time, I thought I was the only one that felt like that, but our library manager said he had felt the same way. I had really wanted it to be great, because the Cival War times are so interesting to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of my time","review":"author's use of computer thesauras was a tiresome chore for any reader who clears words. story was just another unrequited love tale ala Forest Gump, Bridges and Braveheart.

I kept thinking it will get going soon. It never did. Dragging on ad nauseum to an ambiguous ending, I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"What if they had a war and no one came\\" senario","review":"Cold Mountain is an excellent book for those who have not explored the history of the Civil War (War between the States). However, I found sections of the book leaving me wanting more; more action, more emotion, more something that left me feeling vacant. I did find it interesting how Frazier developed the characters, yet I felt I did more thinking about their strengths and weaknesses than he did. I would recommend this book, but I appreciate the wordship of authors such as Baraba Kingsolver more than Fraizer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story to be treasured with words to be tasted slowly.","review":"Mr. Frazier joins the genre of writers who use the written word to paint remarkably detailed paintings. In the class of Tolkien, Ann Rice and others, Mr. Frazier clearly demonstrates the reality of the Civil War apart from the patriotism of both sides. It is a masterpiece that requires slow reading to form the delicate word-pictures of Inman-Ada-Ruby-the Goat Woman and Ruby's Dad. It is not a \\"can't put down\\" book and yet the images created by Mr. Frazier will linger long after the book is finished. Perhaps in later editions Mr. Frazier will give us better graphics so that we can follow Inman's journey through Virginia, the Blue Ridge Mtns and Western North Carolina with the intimacy created with his wonderful style of story telling."},{"rating":"2","title":"The opposite of potboilers.....","review":"How many trashy potboilers have been written about the Civil War? Probably thousands, but 'Cold Mountain' is the welcome antidote to them all. Not a war story, not really a love story, Frazier's novel vividly recreates a world that is now dead, warts and all. This is not a romantic view of a woman waiting for her lover to return home from the war, but a book that shows the Civil War very much as it must have been. 'Cold Mountain' is the kind of book to be read on a long plane journey or at the weekend - so you can sleep in after staying up til 4am trying to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cold Mountain","review":"Cold Mountain is an vigorous tell about a soldier finding his way home, and a women finding other meanings in life other than having everybody do the job for you. It tells how the two people find their ways in adventure.I thought it was one of the best books I have read in long time. When I read it I got caught up in it and could not stop reading it. It was passionate and I enjoyed every bit of it. I like how the Charles Frazier kept everything alive."},{"rating":"1","title":"It must be marketing genius.","review":"Where was the plot? True, the author turns a pretty phrase and gives a vivid description of what life was like during the Civil War. I think he got so caught up in those tasks that he forgot the plot. I really tried to read every word carefully, but found myself skimming the lengthy descriptive parts while searching for the next \\"plot\\" (and I use the term loosely) development. The ending was the worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN","review":"This was honestly the most boring book I have ever read in my life. Like wading through Jell-O, slow, heavy, never-ending. I can't believe it's so popular."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over hyped and underwriten","review":"This book will appeal to readers who think \\"The Bridges of Madison County\\" is literature. Cold Mountain is a plotless and pointless evocation of an historical era, a task well done, but not worth doing, like listing the best of bubblegum rock. The characters are displayed, but not developed. They are observed, but the reader is not drawn in to see their growth since none is displayed. No one would ever be tempted to re-read this empty narrative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-Hum","review":"I only read this book because my AP English teacher assigned it. It's absolutely wretched. I can't believe DeLillo lost the National Book Award to a piece of crap like this. Frazier is one of those authors who will be famous in their time but unknown to future generations. If you want REAL writing, read Pynchon's Mason & Dixon or DeLillo's Underworld"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was dull","review":"I was very disappointed with this book because everyone made it out to be some great book and I thought it was boring and dull. It was mainly about two characters, Ada and Inman, who's love was put on hold because Inman went off to war. It went on about everything that happened in their daily lives and it was too descriptive to the point where it annoyed me. I would never recommend this book to anyone because I thought it was the most boring book on the face of this planet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cold Mountain as dinner","review":"If most novels were cheese cake, this novel would be razor back steak. You have to knaw on it for an hour for a single bite, and although you know it's good for you because it's nutritious, it still tastes bad. It had such a good story, but you had to sift through so much garbage just to get it. There were some beautiful lines, but for every good one, there were 57448 piontless lines. I really would love the book if I just didn't hate the writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much hype","review":"One of the the worst books I've read in a long time. I saw the potential for a good story there but it was all lost in long and flat narratives. Could not identify with any of the characters and have a feeling I really did not get to know them. Very frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"real time civil war life and hardship","review":"Everyone will tell you that the pace of the novel moves deathly slow, and that's true. However, I think the writing technique was used to reflect the pace of the era. The story of a man fed up with fighting for someting he no longer believes in (if he ever thought he did), Inman leaves a southern civil war hospital and heads for home and his sweetheart. He endures unending hardship. Ada and Ruby (especially) give the book whatever glow it has. What drove me, and the other two women who read Cold Mountian with me WILD was the ending. The book would have benefited from a stronger editorial hand. I would not ever waste my time on another book by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING...","review":"I have no idea why everyone raves about this book. Maybe because Oprah said to? It's long, dull, slow, wordy, and tortuous to get all the way to the ending. I was extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"too modern a sensibility","review":"Although I liked the evocative descriptions, I never for one minute believed I was listening to the thoughts of 19th century people. Frazier made a tremendous effort to make the characters sound like people from that time, but gave them modern sentiments to express. A disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book drags on and on and on.","review":"This book drags on and on and on and on. The story just keeps going on and on. He walks and walks and walks. There isn't any real climax, and the book is just plain boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"<yawn>","review":"I chose this book to read for summer reading at my high school last year. One of the only reason's I chose the book was beacuse I liked the teacher who recomended the book, and usually trusted her suggestions. Boy was I wrong. This slow moving story of Inman (a wounded Civil War Soldier) and his unending quest to return to his lover Ada. Slow paced, wordy and at times downright dull, I wouldn't highly recomend this book to anyone...this could possibly be one of the worst books I've read...however, if you like slow-moving, easy to follow books (or are a fan of the civil war) than this book might be of interest to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Betrays the reader.","review":"The author invites you into his home, feeds you a delicious meal of steak and grits, plays beautiful music, and shows you grand vistas painted by gifted artists of the past. Then all smiles and hugs, as you depart after a memorable evening, he stabs you in the back and leaves you dead on his front porch as one of his war trophies. Avoid this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautifully Written Book","review":"I am an avid reader, and this is my favorite novel of all time. From the first sentence, Charles Frazier's words captivated me. He puts words together in a way that can take your breath away. You understand the characters deeply, while enjoying prose that reads like poetry. I could only read one chapter per sitting, to be able to savor each one. I also enjoyed it because I think it gives you a little insight into the author -- his view of nature and life and people. It is simply a wonderful work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lyrical and literate","review":"I knew nothing of this book when I read it. By the second page, I knew it would be one of my favorites. Frazier's writing manages to be lyrical yet spare, and the story is gripping. Imagine my shock when, upon finishing what I thought was my own \\"find\\", I discovered it was on the bestseller list at #1"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read...","review":"So why give it only 4 stars instead of 5? Because i saw the movie first and loved it, and since books are usually better then the adapted movies, i ran to the local bookstore and bought myself a copy, and i have to admit that in this case i enjoyed the movie better."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it","review":"Charles Frazier has told a story about war that is not often told. He brings to life the story of civilian life during the Civil War. Frazier's character development is outstanding - even lesser characters are vivid such as Teague, and his band. I enjoyed the use of story telling by characters as a vehicle to supplement the experiences of the two main characters. Frazier's description of events from what people ate to what they were wearing brings the events to life. I look forward to the film - please, no Matt Damon as Inman!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most overrated book I've read in a while.","review":"What was all the hoopla about? This was dull, dull, dull. Two bland story lines, one a little compelling, the other not at all. Episodes of extreme cruelty and brutality aren't any fun at all, though they do break up the monotony. I felt this author was too enthralled by his own writing, going on and on and on about, for example, how dark the night was. Okay, it was a dark night. Move on, please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cold Mountain","review":"Excellent read! Extremely interesting, well written, and great details. Many aspects I'd never considered before about Civil War daily life. Well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"one false move","review":"Probably four and a half stars, but that doesn't seem possible to do. I think the person who compared it to \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\" is very astute; very similar. Writing is really beautiful at times, oft times, very lovely way of describing nature too, again and again; and there's a lovely bit how Iman's clothing, in separate bunches drying in front of the fire, were like items in a museum, each given their own space and value. Numerous examples of seeing things in a unique way. If I followed things correctly -- plot giveaway, minor though it is -- if that is Iman's child at the very end, playing around the fire, I could have done without that. Iman should live in Ada's mind only as a memory, a season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cold Mountain / Cool Price","review":"An exceptional book at a great price. With \\"Kindle\\" Up and coming as the Library you can hold in you hand; Real books,be it hardback or paperback,are going the way of 8/tracks and cassettes. Good to know you can stillget a good value for your buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dull and predictable","review":"This book was not only plodding in pace but also dreary beyond belief. I didn't care AT ALL about any of the characters, and I doubt I'm the only one who saw what was going to happen to the main character half-way through the book. The only reason I gave it one star is the attention to detail the author gave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not play this tape while driving.","review":"This audio cassette edition of Cold Mountain is a perfect example of why publishers should hire trained actors to read. Having written a book does not make one best qualified to read it. The tired, monotonous drone of the author's voice, together with the overly flowery, bombastic writing style, will put you to sleep in minutes.I own several Random House books on audio cassette. The books by John Irving, Jane Smiley, John Berendt, and others, are all well written and beautifully read. But this publication, full of childish metaphors, verbal discriptions of B-movie special effects, and single trait characters, is one I could have done without."},{"rating":"1","title":"My cold mountain review","review":"I didn't really like Cold Mountain that much. It was boring and stupid. I don't believe that there was a Civil War in the first place and now Charles Frazier isn't letting it go. The book had to many pointless characters and very little plot. It seems like he wrote it in his sleep. I think that Charles Frazier wrote one to many books! He should of stopped while he was ahead. But beside the fact that the book had no plot, pointless people, boring chapters, and a stupid ending, I liked the book. I probably would of had more fun diving into an empty pool then reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold Mountain will make you sleepy.","review":"This book was one of the most boring books I have ever read in my life. It didn't catch my attention until the very end, when I knew I wouldn't have to read it anymore. It didn't have any part that really caught my attention because I'm one who reads romance, not books about war or anything of that sort. If I had to give a recomendation, I'd say if you are lacking in sleep, read this and you'll fall asleep quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Socialist Realism","review":"It is hard for me to believe that someone in North Carolina could write a book that is a perfect example of Socialist Realism. It is a story of a proliteriat peasant woman who reforms bourgeois woman into a better life on the land. The hero has deserted an army fighting a war he does not understand. He meets only problems in the cities. The war could have been World War I instead of the Civil War. The army could have been the Czar's army instead of the Confederate. Are the mountains the Carpathian or the Urals? To me the plot is so unreal that it fits Socialist Realism. Lenin and Stalin would have loved it. I did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huckleberry Finn was definitely more interesting!","review":"Frazier's tortuous and rambling account of a Confederate soldier's adventure through the North Carolina landscape was like a tornado of depressingly long and boring descriptions. I am a fan of the succinct, and I believe Frazier worked too hard to try to impress either the reader or himself! The encounters that Inman experienced left me with a negative view on his character. In fact, all of the characters in Cold Mountain lacked not even a semblance of integrity or strength. Ada reminded me of Diane Chambers from Cheers!!! Only Ruby came closest to standing upright. I must say that this novel does an extreme disservice to the people of North Carolina and the South in general. I am no history buff, but I would dare say that this story does not present the real South, either during the time of the Civil War or the present."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of time","review":"I picked up this book on the basis of all the wonderful reviews that it has recieved, but instead of finding the intriging story that it promised to be I was, bored, sickend and utterly dissalusioned by the content of it. I did not finish it - it wasn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DREADFULLY BORING!","review":"I buy audiobooks based upon the reviews I see. The reviews on this audiobook were way off base.

The plot was dull. ( how exciting is an endless sroll thru. the woods? )The author jumped all over the place with no continuity so you were constantly turning back to reread the last few pages because you were convinced that you had missed something. Do yourself a favour take a big pass on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look up \\"boring\\" in the dictionary, & you'll find this book","review":"I tried so hard to enjoy this book. I felt I had an obligation, as many friends and relatives had recommended it, and as I am from North Carolina, where much of this novel takes place. But it was torture. After countless hours of reading about this poor man trekking through the woods, and about this poor woman trying to survive on her own, I just gave up. Don't believe the hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written and thoughtful...","review":"Contrary to the other negative reviews on this book, I absolutely loved reading this book. I thought it was beautifully written, the words so rich and palpable that I could taste the Southern world created by Frazier. It's definitely not a quick read, definitely not about the Civil War and not a fast-paced story. But what it does offer is a beautiful story about two lovers who, due to unfortunate circumstances and bad timing, do not realize how much they mean to each other until it's too late. There are also other interesting stories along the way where Inman, the male protagonist meets plenty of different, amusing characters. This book isn't for everyone but there are ample rewards to those who are patient and read it to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfule novel","review":"Charles Frazier has written a novel that succeeds on a number of levels. The story itself is interesting; following the Oddysey-esque journey of a man fleeing the Civil War (and the man it turned him into) to recapture his life. We also meet the woman he fell in love with before the war interrupted everyone's lives.But the true success of the novel is the language. It is beautifully written, perfectly capturing the mood the writer is looking for.If you are looking for a book that will briskly while away a few hours, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a beautifully written account of life during the end of the Civil War, buy this book and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fascinating journey that goes nowhere","review":"I enjoyed this one up to about half way but then ran out of patience with it. The last half became a real struggle. The low rating is because it failed to live up to its early promise.Inman's journey was for me the most interesting aspect. It shows us the normally unseen harsh and unpleasant side effects of the civil war with fascinating and sometimes repulsive detail. I am looking forward to seeing the movie 'Ride With The Devil' for another slant on the 'home guard'. The problem was that after a while his endless series of hair breadth escapes got a bit much for me. I could not identify with a man who seems to shrug off his daily near death experience and just keep trudging on.Ada's exploration of farming life tended to become a grown-up 'Little House On The Prairie'.Enjoy this book for its great description of the life and times but don't expect any plot progression or deep human insight."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERHYPED AND BORING","review":"THIS IS A BOOK THAT I STARTED WITH ENTHUSIASM--WHICH I SOON LOST.

The characters are not really developed enough to make us care what happened to them, and the plot is extremely thin. As such, it is way too long and I found I had to force myself to finish. I had to read it several times to make sure I caught everything. Frazier is a novice writer and it shows. His style needs a lot of work, to say the least. Reading \\"Ada said,\\" and \\"Ruby said,\\" tacked on to the end of every sentence was irritating. For all those who think this is \\"literature,\\" try Umberto Eco's, \\"The Name of the Rose.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"This audio version is not suited for automobile...","review":"I wish I could say wonderful things about this book. Others speak so highly of it. But when we tried to listen in the car during a long trip, we found Mr. Fazier's voice too soothing. His soft, Southern-accented voice may -- as others have noted in their reviews -- indeed suit the material. But it does not provide enough drama to be engaging on an interstate highway. So, drivers be warned. Select something a bit more dramatic if you're seeking diversion from highway monotony. This reading of a story about a journey may not be the best choice to accompany you on your journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Monotony Than Marvel","review":"My teacher said that 50% of this class would like this book, and 50% would hate it. I am the 1% that makes it 49 1/2% - 49 1/2%. There were parts of it that I liked and parts of it that I hated. The characters were entertaining but their situations were predictable and frustrating.

She had a bunch of books in the front of the room that she made us pick from. I'm not a big book reader but their are some good points about the book but over all I am not a big fan. If you like to read war books and you are all for wars do NOT read this book. This book is a bout a man (Inman) who dose not won't to go to war (Civil war) and runs away numerous times. It is an anti war book. It also starts out to slow for me I like books that start with an action seen and ends with one. If you're the kind of person who likes love stories then you should read this. It is about a man who tries to find his way home to his girlfriend Ada."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointed","review":"I read Cold Mountain and I was dissapointed in how it ended. The book had me for most of the beginning(even though it dragged a little at some points), but at the end, after Inman traveled for so long and endured so much, for him to just die before Ada and he had a chance to have a life together! It ruined the book for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNREADABLE AND UNINTERESTING","review":"I found this book PAINFUL to read. The author's style is incoherent. Unlike some who's reviews I have read, I did not HAVE to read this book. I chose to. What a mistake -- and no one to blame but myself (and the so-called \\"critics\\" who loved this mess).

No stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most meaningful book that I have read in years","review":"This was a novel about alienation, most importantly becoming alienated from who you truly are and the long and difficult journey to find yourself again.

But is slow moving, tedious, often off on a tangent. The ending is a tragic farce, a let down and a disappointment. Buy this book only if you have a lot of time on your hands and don't mind a meander in the woods. I did find the language amusing. Frazier apparently read a lot of Civil War letters to render that period's stilted and long-winded style of speech and written communication. I am amazed that critics fell so in love with this work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold Moutain- 2 stars","review":"I thought Cold Mountain was very boring. The book was better in the beginning but towards the end, it only got worse. When Inman was the main character in the chapters they were boring and Inman only walked. When Ada was the main character they were at least a little bit more exciting. I give it 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Horrible","review":"Full of flat, uninteresting, unlikable characters. No plot, just random bits of action, the same civil war stories, like the aurora borealis sighting before the battle. And most incredibly annoying of all, THERE ARE NO QUOTATION MARKS AROUND THE DIALOGUE. Couldn't even force myself to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was definitely not my favorite book.","review":"Cold Mountain had WAY too much detail in it for me. He (Frazier) would go into his details and I would get very lost. Then his little rehashing of the past also threw me off. I noticed that everything the characters said would not be in quotations, and that was confusing also. I'm not sure if I could consider this a book good for teaching in school, because you have to admit, that scene with Junior was very graphic, and not really anything I wanted to read. Also, the scene with Tildy, the big whore. I didn't find any part of the book offensive, but I would understand if someone else did. If this book was made into a movie, it would be about as long as Schindler's List... and that is one very long movie! It needs more action and less BSing around all of the time.

I fully understood the already-established relationship between this and THE ODYSSEY, being as how I read that, too. I found this tale to be even more understandable, since the Civil War is one of the most important periods in American History even today. I really enjoyed getting someone's opinion of the war who was actually there."},{"rating":"1","title":"A 'local novel' or 'book-next-door'.","review":"From all the plaudits lauded onto this book my expectations were high. Not so my praise at the end of the trudge. Yes it has good historical perspective and characters but it does nothing for our region or its readers other than soak both in dullness.

Which is not to say the book was bad...exactly, but I do wonder why the author had the narrator use mountain idioms throughout--it gave one the feeling that everyone involved with the book (author, characters, narrator) was in cahoots to sound as backward as possible. After a while it started to sound as if it was a parody of that culture rather than a description. Also, I was irked that he had the characters use so, so many quaint similes and metaphors in describing anything that came to their mind.On the positive side, the book had charm and poignancy in it's descriptions of Inman's and Ada's struggles with their reality and I could feel, at times, the horror of the war, and the beauty of an isolated mountain meadow.

Apparently well-researched, the author juxtaposes the viewpoint of a Southern soldier with an intellectual preacher's daughter, both weakly committed to the cause of the Civil War. Both rescue their own self-worth through the strength of others, hers positive, his negative, but both powerful images. The book takes unpredictable twists and turns as it jumps back and forth between the two worlds created by the separation of war. The reader who enjoys detailed, graphic description will be enthralled, and will take with them a deepened understanding of the sacrifices of war, as well as the specifics of existence during the Civil War. This book requires a mature but adventuresome reader for true appreciation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overall disappointing.","review":"I looked forward to reading this book; as I got further into it I was struck with the constant references to excrement, human and otherwise; graphic killings; and a series of distasteful, totally unredeeming characters that Inman meets along the way. I stuck it out til the end hoping the end would be worth it; it wasn't. I had suspected the outcome; and was disappointed to find my suspicions correct. Pluses for the book were the female charcters, Ada and Ruby. Also the extensive research and authenticity with reference to vocabulary of that time, names of flora and fauna, and things like kinds of tools. The brutal treatment of ordinary citizens during that time and the efforts taken to hunt down the outliers do have a lasting effect on the reader. But overall, I was disappointed in the actual story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Although I am sure that this novel accurately portrayed Ada and Inman's lives during this Civil War period, I found the character development lacking in that I couldn't muster sympathy for either of the two main characters. The most interesting personalities, in my opinion, were Ruby and her father, and then only marginally interesting. I was disppointed when I reached the end of this book, unfortunately, and felt like my time would have been better spent doing/reading something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read This Book!! It is a God!!","review":"I read this book in AP English class. At first I wasn't happy about reading a book about the Civil War, but after I got past the first couple of chapters I realized that I was going to like it. Charles Frazier is a brilliant author. He mixed an innocent Romance with a not-so-innocent war. The charcter developement was perfect. The events in the charcters lives effected the charcters personality just right. The description in this novel was beautiful. The only thing I didn't like about this book was the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"n/a","review":"i began reading Cold Mountain for my Honors English 11 class. the book begins slow, continues to drag on like a patient on a morphine drip and then finally, ends. at first many people complained about the description, but i didn't really seem to notice. the mental picture Frazier created for the reader did not enhance nor did it lower my opinion of the book. in fact, the book, in itself, despite the slow and tedious pace, was alright. the only thing that didn't do it for me was the ending. i absolutely despised it. it was not nearly as horrific as it should of been, or as it was foretold to be. not that i'm a sadist or anything, but when you write a novel as depressing as Cold Mountain, you should bloody well follow through with a tragic ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book of bad endings, and mostly dead good characters.....","review":"This Book was interesting, it started off wit something to grab most peoples attention. It gave you a good promise for a storyline. But in the end, delivered a horrible ending, yet that was well backed up. For even though the ending was stupid, unthought out, and short, it was well given. For there was little to change, without changing the most of the storyline, and character development. But, there was shining light in this entire book, that was good and funny....Veasey. Veasey was a good, funny character that gave the book a spin for a while. Simple review of this book, if you like a lot of storyline, and maybe a bit of wonder, don't read this book, but if you like some love story, coming of age, or jorney tale books, it's for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Detailed and descriptive language, long but directed","review":"The writing seemed to drag at times, and I put the book down several times before being able to finish it. The wait was worth it as the last several chapters developed into a more interesting story, or at least a clearer picture after a long journey. It does show a time when people were more determined and could do almost anything. Touching ending with the hope of something beyond the present. Was life as valued during the past, or do we guard it more today?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly over-rated and not that great a read.","review":"I was very disappointed in this novel. After all the hype, I found it uninteresting. I did not become invested in the main characters and was tempted to quit reading it about a halfway through. I was most drawn to Ruby and her determination and inventiveness in drawing a living from the land. That is what kept me reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow beginning, but worth hanging on for the ride!","review":"This surprisingly sweet story begins rather somberly, and maintains that tone throughout, with overlays of sweetness and surprising sentimentality. Although I cannot vouch for the authenticity of the writing style, I felt as if I were reading a book written in the 1880's. The surprising ending may leave some readers (this one included) a little jarred, I feel that this work certainly was worth the ride. I tried to read it last summer, and was daunted by the feel of the first chapter; my civil-war historian friend BEGGED me to try again, and I'm glad I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Beginning, Predictable Story Book Ending.","review":"I was disappointed with the ending of \\"Cold Mountain\\" , it seemed to lose the drama and become a predictably rosy romance novel. It is hard to believe that this novel has been a best seller for so long, or is it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Graphic,long, and off the subject","review":"This book was supposed to be about the civil war! Well at least the first two chapters were anyway. Some of the chapters were funny and the charicters themselves were fun and interesting,but other than that I didn't like the book. It's two stories into one which is fun,but in my oppinion, the Inman story is funner than the Ada story only because the Inman stories were adventurous-he actually went out of the house. Ada stayed in the same area at all times wining about how her life was so boring and feeling sorry for her self. I wouldn't have read this book if I didn't have to. I thought the book was all right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Novel","review":"This was an incredible novel. The wonderful descriptions and details of the scenery and battles makes you feel as though you can smell th blood from the wounds and hear the cannons fire. This novel contains all of the elements of a supreme novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful read","review":"I always try to read a book before I see the movie. However, when it came to Cold Mountain, I saw the movie first at a friend's house and then decided to read the book. Although the movie was very good, the book was exceptional. I found the characters so real to life that I found myself thinking about them as actual people. The romance of Ada and Inman was wonderful and even though most people may say that two people cannot fall in love with so little contact, I absolutely believed that it could happen to them. The supporting characters were also complex and real. It is truly a masterpiece. READ IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfying Journey","review":"Simply one of the best books I've ever read. Beautifully written in a style that seems entirely authentic to the period. If you've never read a book that placed emphasis on developing character instead of plot, this book will either leave you cold or it will change your expectations of good writing forever. Altering one word would do it injustice. This is one book that will surely stand the test of time. But enough cliches--get this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is for lovers of literature and history","review":"This book will be appreciated by those who enjoy the passage of time and the joy of learning. The characters learn about themselves, the world around them and the political climate of the world they inhabit. The reader learns about nineteenth century life, food, economics, customs and beliefs in rural, mountainous North Carolina. Cold Mountain does not read like a television sitcom - there is no gratuitious laughter or predictable endings. Instead, Frazier relates the lyrical, sad and joyous existence of Ada and Inman during the Civil War. If you want predictability, instant gratification and cheap, shallows guffaws, then by all means tune into MAD TV. If you want your perspective on history, southern culture, gender relations and war to be challenged, then read this book carefully and savor its beauty. In this book, art truly imitates life. Read Cold Mountain and experience a life outside of your own time, place and perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sublime","review":"This novel is extraordinary. Although it has been compared to Hemingway's Farewell to Arms, Shaara's Killer Angels, and Cormac McCarthy's work, the novel stands on its own as one of the most beautiful written works of this century. Each paragraph is in its conception and execution a precious gem, structured as tightly as a short poem. The plot (like the character Stobrod's fiddle) is akin to a jazz composition, discordant and lyrical, hopeful and despairing. Keep your first edition of this novel for future generations; they will thank you for it"},{"rating":"1","title":"book review","review":"Cold Mountain was such a detailed book that it was hard to read at times. There are so many little things that go on, thus so much to remember.Inman's journey was the most exciting part of the book. I can't believe everything that happened to him throughout it though. Getting caught by the homeguard and escaping, encountering Lila, Lula, Junior, and almost dying a number of times. All of the people he met were different, and he learned something from all of them. Despite everything that happened to him, he still makes it home to Ada. Nothing for him goes as planned, and maybe thats better for him that way.Ada is still my favorite character, even though she did get kind of boring. I blame that on her situation. She did practically a 360 from being a helpless girl who doesn't know how to do anything, to a woman who can hold her own on her farm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold Mountain....ugh....","review":"Cold Mountain was very well written. The characters were very memorable and amusing. The book was very descriptive in almost every action a character did. That was the doing and the downfall of the book for me. Though his writing gave me a clear picture in my head the undeniable use of external detail made the book drag and made it londer than it actually is.Ada was probably my favorite character. Her parts were very comical and entertaining along with ruby on the farm. The Inman scenes were also good but he just kept walking which made him tedious and boring. If it wasn't for the good ending i would have given it 1 star instead of 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"A long-winded piece of trash","review":"This book came highly reccomended from many dependable book magazines but I thought this book was a complete disappointment. The writing is very long-winded and many of the supposedly-moving scenes appear inane and unrealistic. The use of unnecessarily big words does not help to ease the fatigue one gets from reading this book. 'Cold Mountain' takes itself all too seriously. The result-- a heavy-going piece of trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasted my time","review":"I never did get a feel for the main male character. He goes through many trials. At one point he encounters a mother bear with a cub, the mother bear goes over the cliff as it tries to protect her little one. I found myself wishing that the character had gone over the cliff. Then I wouldn't have to read about him anymore. You can figure out the end before it happens. It's just too drawn out... The female characters are interesting, and more developed, but not very realistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Deal","review":"Sometimes you just need to hear an author read their own words to get the full impact of their work. The writer can sometimes deliver nuance, emphasis, or dialect that you might not hear in your head. Charles Frazier's understated delivery may not be dramatic, but it accumulates force through the persistent rendering of the longing for home that pushes the hero through unendurable trials as he tries to make his way back from the horror of the Civil War. A beautiful book read with patience and passion - so much better than the movie!Cold Mountain"},{"rating":"2","title":"I rarely give 5 stars...","review":"I chose to read this book like I choose to sneak a bowl of ice cream late at night; a sort of guilty pleasure. I was not disappointed. I found the story compelling and the characters engaging. I finished in half the time I expected, as I found myself sneaking away from life to indulge. I enjoyed it as much as anything I've ever read from Hemingway, and in much the same way.I listened to this one (from Audible), and while many complained at the author's reading of his own book I couldn't imagine a better way to experience it. As someone raised in the rocky mountains, for three days I found myself describing the world around me in Charles Frazier's twangy, metered, and gentle southern voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go See The Movie","review":"I started this book 3 times before I (FINALLY!) made it all the way through. With all due respect to Charles Frazier (writing anything is difficult), I did not like the book. Inman can't seem to make it home no matter what he does - in fact, he travels in reverse! Will he NEVER get there? Have you ever heard of quotation marks when someone speaks in a book?!? Of course the ending is depressing, can't have anything but that in \\"modern\\" fiction.I heard the movie was \\"great!\\" Go see it and save your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cold Mountain is a great anti-war book","review":"Charles Frazier understands war. This book is about a young man (Iman) who joins the ranks of the Confederate Army only to find that war is both savage and senseless. In time...surrounded by death he rejects the war and seeks the love of a young woman he left back home in the peaceful region of \\"Cold Mountain.\\" Ordinarilly I read nonfiction. A friend insisted I read this book. I'm not disappointed. This novel deserves all the fanfare. It is a richly detailed story that highlights the anquish of war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Literature","review":"It warms my heart that literature this good is being written today. A modern classic. What's amazing to me is that this is a first novel. I can't wait to read Frazier's next book. He brings a new voice to historical novels, weaving introspection and the survival tales of two lovers, he keeps you reading with hope until the very end. Lovely language is just the icing on the cake."},{"rating":"2","title":"mocking bird","review":"i found that this story was a beautiful balance of war and peace. how the charcter has to over come the horrors of war to be at paece with the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ken Boire author of IN THE COMPANY OF FISHERS","review":"Stunning! This is a destined to be a great American work of art. How can it be that a first time author is able to create a story told as if each letter were cast iron? This story is amazingly crafted, beautifully constructed. The words are whispered into the reader's ear and scenes are painted into his brain. In a sense the story is simple and probably happened hundreds of times during the Civil War. It is entirely believable and even more so due to the reality of the characters and places. The reader can almost smell and hear what is happening. No need to summarize the storyline or argue it is unique since the beauty of this work is in the telling. Who wouldn't want to be able to write like this? Five Stars from Ken Boire, author of IN THE COMPANY OF FISHERS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want to get depressed?","review":"If this book hadn't been given to me from a friend who wanted to know what I thought of it, I would have stopped reading after 50 pages. Yes, the book is well written, but on almost every page there is only hardship and bad luck. Every character in this book is fighting against something all the time. I couldn't believe it. And I just KNEW what the ending would be after the first few chapters. Yes, life can be tragic, but it's not this kind of struggle and I simply can't believe that during the Civil War every single day was so bad. I get enough bad news in my own life; why do I need to read about other's here?"},{"rating":"1","title":"From a great start it's all down hill.","review":"If you like Ken Burns version of American history, or wish to know the value of a plot outline this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful until the last 14 pages","review":"In Cold Mountain, Charles Frazier creates two wonderful characters, Ada and Inman. Inman, a deserter from the Conferderate Army, is on his way home to his beloved Ada. Ada is struggling to manage the farm after her father's death. Each is on a course of discovery and growth: Inman, to learn to live again, and Ada, how to live life competently. When they are reunited, it is wonderful. Unfortunately, Frazier falls victim to the typical modern novel syndrome: happy endings are impossible, happiness on earth is merely fleeting. Ada and Inman have a few short days together, and then no more. Bridges of Madison County in the Civil War. What a waste. It could have been a truly inspiring book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would you like to go to sleep?","review":"The only reason why i kept this reading this book, is because i was hoping it would get better or interesting. This book had me very conceived. The characters were boring and not well written. Regardless that this book was written very well in language, but on the other hand, the story line was very stupid. At night or even during the day, i tried to keep my eyes open to read it, but the plot, theme, or whatever you want to call it, just made me fall asleep. My suggestion is to whoever is reading this, buy the cliff notes, and save yourself the time of reading this novel"},{"rating":"1","title":"highly overrated--very slow!!","review":"Even though this book is well received and supposed to be very good, I found that it is one of only 3 or 4 books that I completed ONLY because I kept hoping for it to get more interesting. It never did! I found it boring, slow-moving and it was a chore to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoroughly Boring--Better Reads on this Subject Elsewhere","review":"I'm a lover of both good literature and words but this book left me with nothing but confusion as to why something like this would get so much attention, praise and awards and novels like Lee Smith's Fair and Tender Ladies are not as well-known but superior in all aspects. If you want to read about the mountains and if you want characters and writing that truly touch the soul, check out her books, available on Amazon, and leave this one behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great writing, poor story.","review":"Charles Frazier has a true mastery of the English language. He stands far above other contemporary authors in that respect. \\"Cold Mountain\\" is his illustration of this talent. The sounds of a perfectly crafted sentence or paragraph can make me smile in this book. However, there is a key element missing, one that caused me to dislike the book overall. Regardless of how beautiful a book is written, if it doesn't have a good story then it fails. I had trouble turning the page. I figured it must get better if it is going to win the National Book Award. I was wrong. It is a poor and extremely predictable story. Never did I feel the love between Inman and Ada, never did I feel any desire to keep reading. I gave it to colleagues that thought I must be crazy because of all they had heard as well. They agree. Wonderful writing, horrible story. It's too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"A supremely long drag with little character development.","review":"The only mildly interesting character in the whole book was maybe Ada, and the highlight of her metamorphosis was when she finally killed two turkeys. Boring, inconsistent, the book reads like a bad rip-off of A Pilgrim's Progress and Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. The killing of just about every animal in North America, save the wolf and the panther, is richly detailed every two pages. Had I known that this was the ultimate epiphany of the book or the author, I would never have read it. I want my money back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"The strength of this book for me was in Frazier's description of the natural world and the details of daily life for rural people in the Civil War days. He obviously did his research. In the hands of some writers, all that detail could be tiresome, but Frazier does it well. It was a bit grim at times, but realistic, and also unconventional as far as civil war novels go- you know, novels where the jacket or back cover says something like \\"a sweeping saga of a family torn apart by war\\" with one brother fighting for each side, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sometimes spectacularly vivid, other times overdone","review":"A story about Inman, a southern soldier in the American civil war walking home across the southeast towards Ada, his love, among the dangers of war and desertion. The book is rife with description of the nineteenth century American landscape, sometimes spectacularly vivid and other times overdone. Using only sparse dialogue, Frazier creatures a beautiful love story of two individuals looking for survival and love amidst the turmoil of war."},{"rating":"1","title":"The audio version is very poor and earned my lowest rating !","review":"\\"Cold Mountain\\", the book was one of the best I ever read. It likely will become a classic example of the best American literature has to offer. The audio version is too poor to endure to conclusion. It is read in an arrrogant southern speech that approaches monotone and seems never to make an attempt to use changes in voice inflection or tone to differentiate the speakers. It sounds more like a volunteer reading to the elderly or blind in a hospital than a professional presenting a book-on-audio. Mr. Frazier did not do his wonderful book justice by attempting to present it himself. Also, the CD version I purchased from Random House had many technical glitches and minor recording errors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anything he can do, she can do better","review":"SPOILER ALERT - DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T FINISHED THE NOVEL!Not bad - but so politically correct I nearly threw up. All the men (except for the hero) are idiots; all the women are self-sufficient (eventually) and the last thing they need is a man, except for the bare essentials (which is symbolically illustrated in the lovers one-and-only tryst, which spawns a lovely little girl). Your move."},{"rating":"1","title":"MEDIOCRE","review":"I read this book, it was okay but the story flashed back to much, and I couldn't folow all of it but I read all of it anyway.

I can't believe I read the whole thing!!!","review":"I happen to live about 40 miles from the actual \\"Cold Mountain\\" (on the Tennessee side of the NC/TN state line) very near the Pigeon River mentioned in the book. The descriptions of the flora and fauna, the terrain, climate, etc., was real and very well done. However, this book was the most slow and tedious, slow and tedious, slow and tedious, slow and tedious, slow and tedious, slow and tedious read imaginable. The writing style-no quote marks, no italics, no indication of rising excitement, etc., made this book flat, flat, flat. My husband (who, unlike me does not have dyslexia and can read very fast) also found it very taxing and tedious! There was a lot of useless verbiage to fill out the 360 pages of a 25 page story.Jeanne M. Daniels, Hartford, Tennessee"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold Mountain","review":"It is hard to beleive that this book has such aclaim.

Others reading this book have made the same comments."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORRRRINGGGG!","review":"At times, this book reads more like an essay, and some of its passages are beautifully written. In the end, however, it's a dull, overly long, drawn-out tale about nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The tape edition was outstanding...","review":"The reader on the tape editon was wonderful. His slow reading added to the beautiful writing. He captured the southern writing and life. I don't think I would have finished reading this book, had I picked up the hardback.

The lyrical quality, his wonderful, descriptive words and phrases. The subtle use of humor. Ada and Ruby's relationship. Colorful Stobrod with the beauty of his music depicted in sharp contrast to his persona.This book will make you laugh, cry and grimace. It is beautifully crafted.

As an aspiring writer, I let this book take my perception of nature, of American history, of romance and war to a new level. I read Cold Mountain in bed at night and on the job (!) for many weeks; for as you may find, the depth of his descriptive ability is lost in a quick skim. For the reviewers who didn't get it, I ask that they read it again, put some effort into this novel; try to visualize Inman walking down the road, feel his desire to get home and find his love. Give it a chance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This novel is overrated","review":"This author uses the language anyway he choses. It does not matter to him that he made up some of the words. Also, he uses a lot of negative symbolism toward African Americans being depicted as crows. Not since Walt Disney's Dumbo of the 50's have I seen this. His narrations are too long making this a boring book. Many are being caught up into what this book could have been, no wonder Frazier has failed so many times before this. He cannot write."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold mountain, cold characters, cold plot","review":"While this book does have some interesting characters, you never get inside the main character. You met him recovering from injuries from the civil war. You never learn where he came from, anything about his family, his beliefs, his feelings. He meets several difficulties as he tries to get home, and I found myself routing for his end. The female characters are more vibrant although its hard to understand how one of them loves Mr. Dullness from nowhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm glad that's over with","review":"Reading has taken up more of my time as I continue my life as an educated unemployed american. I had the misfortune of taking up my time reading this \\"novel\\". I can't say that I am educated enought to care what the difference between a novel and a good story is, but I can say this book was not well. I don't really care how much Frazier knows about the civil war era, his use of their vernacular, however that's spelled, is annoying at best. The conclusion is trite and very un-surprising. If you liked 20000 leagues under the Sea, you'll like Cold Mountain; a bunch of meaningless events occur and then it ends. No one learns anything - that is unless you didn't know war is bad - and the characters have serious flaws. Unless you are a 12-year-old girl, take my advice, don't read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH MY GOD!","review":"This book is an alright book for reading in class but not one I would want to read on my own. It was torcherous and excrusiatingly mind wrenching. I do NOT reccommend this book for the average reader and would never recommend it for anyone younger than an eleventh grader. It's hard to understand and no one in this time period can really relate to it. Other than that the book is fine, I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book makes me wish I was illiterate.","review":"Although I'm sure Charles Frazier is a very intelligent man I think he lacks common sense. Making an factual account of the Civil War is an excellent idea, but, not when you drone on and on about absolutly nothing for the first 150 pages. Yes, I'm aware it takes the whole beginning to tell the reader the basic jist of the book, yet most books begin to pick up and take interest after the explanation \\"fluff\\" . What was Charles Frazier thinking when he wrote EVERYTHING with description! I'm postive there was some great wonderful underlying symbolism in this book but I couldnt find it in all the OVERLY used description. My final complaint is, EPILOGUE: vomit! Charles Frazier obvioulsy stole that chapter from Disney's writers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"When I picked up this book I was really looking forward to a good read. Boy--was I fooled. I kept reading hoping that it would get better and it didn't. The author makes up words and describes stupid stuff--like an in-depth description of the food being eaten. The plot sucked and by the end of the book I really could care less if Inman ever got home! Let alone to his \\"true love.\\" There was nothing going in that direction. First book I ever threw into the trash after I read it. I was so disappointed in it that I won't even see the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"This book was just trying too hard. Trying to be poetic, but it wasn't. Trying to be introspective, but it wasn't. It was pointless. I am very disappointed in the calibre of judging for the National Book Award.

Dull, predictable, with a metronomic structure of \\"his chapter/her chapter\\", I couldn't wait for it to end. I admired the skill in getting the language right and all the research it must have required (hence my extra star) but as a work of imagination, power or even entertainment it is severely lacking.

The book is way too boring to keep my attention but for some srange reason it did for awhile.The author, Charles Frazier, dragged on into too much detail, telling unnecessary things that had no sense.I think the book, chronologically, stunk because i lost my place more than once trying to keep up to where the next setting, and plot were heading. From the looks of what type of problems his characters faceed, the author was probably a problem child with these expierences. I have not read the final chapters, but i'm not really looking forward to it. It stunk! Overall, I think Siskel and Ebert would give this book a negative review, but since that's not a option, and they're in a good mood and so am I, I'll give it a 2 star, for effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold Mountain left me cold, indeed.","review":"I found this to be the most metronomic book I ever read.

It was an assignment for our 11th grade English class. I could barely stand the first half and fell asleep at least seven times a page. If you make it through the first few chapters then it gets good. You couldn't tell Ada loved Inman until near the end. I think Charles Frazier could have made it better by just telling about Inman and Adas past and just skipping to the middle. After you get there then the book makes up for the pointless beginning. Over all it was good book and it eventually holds your attention. I can't express how bad the beginning was, or how good the end was. I liked how he kept you hanging on until the last word(not exagerating). But I think I would have liked the happy fairy tale ending, because we can't always have that in real life."},{"rating":"2","title":"I lost my book and barrowed a friends to finish.","review":"I can't find to many books that capture my attention, but \\"Cold Mountain\\" is one of the few. The only reason I might have not enjoyed the book as much as I could have is because I had to read it on a schedule. I'm not a person that can stick my nose into a book and keep reading until I'm done.Anyways, I think that the way Charles Frazier makes you feel about Inman and Ada, and the way he makes you hope for the happiest ending, and then brings you back to reality with the fact that all stories in life ,or books don't always have happy endings. I won't tell the story just incase you didn't read and your just checking the reviews to see if you might be interested in reading it. I recomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I will definitely read again on my own!","review":"Cold Mountain is well worth reading. We just finished reading this book in my high school English class. In the beginning of the book, I thought I would despise it, but by the end I really enjoyed it! I liked how the author researched and used the words spoken during that time period. It created a powerful effect. It was cool to see the transformation of Ada: from a socialite from Charleston, to a dedicated farmer. I also thouroughly enjoyed Inman's desperate journey home. From being shot at in a boat, to being buried alive, his stories were very emotional. By the end I wanted to cry, but I knew that it was the only realistic ending possible. It made me finally realize the atmosphere created during wartime. I really liked this book, and I would definitely read it again on my own."},{"rating":"1","title":"How dissappointed was I by this book!","review":"Okay, I may very well be completely alone in my opinion of this book, but I was vastly let down.Although Charles Frazier manages to collect an interesting tale out of the lives of his ancestors (The only reason this book got more than a star) he tells the stories with such a clinical lack of emotion or depth, that I found myself not giving a damn. After all, he doesn't care about his characters, why should I?Not to mention Frazier's blatant use of little literary tricks (like no quotation marks) for no apparent reason other than it looks cool. I can't believe this is the book (And soon to be movie) that has swept the nation. Try reading Graham Swift if you want real books about the demise of a nation during the 19th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"my real rating was 3 1/2 stars - i couldn't decide.","review":"if you don't like detail on top of detail on top of detail, then don't read this book. However, if you want a behind-the-scenes look at some of the oddities of the civil war, as well as the trials and tribulations many of our forefathers took in finding their way home, then this is what your looking for. I also thoroughly enjoyed the many different characters Frazier brings to life - Stobrod especially. good book Charles!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Agonizingly Tedious.","review":"Individuals are obviously polarized regarding Cold Mountain. Reading it was as boring a chore as I've encountered in a long while with no redemption at this novel's end. Perhaps the movie is better; one can only hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left cold","review":"It is hard for me to understand what people find so compelling about this overblown, overwritten, underedited book that rambles on and on endlessly and, for the most part, pointlessly. The characters do not change or grow in any significant way, we never get even the slightest insight into their thoughts or motivations and ultimately we are left with a good deal of sound and fury signifying nothing. How or why this won the National Book Award is beyond me. Compare this with the Booker Award winning novel Disgrace by J.M. Cotzee, a well crafted, compelling book. If this is the best of American writing, we are truly at a low point in terms of American literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and boring","review":"I know this book received lots of critical accolades, and I consider myself a learned, well-read person - but I could not get through this story. I have owned the book since 1997, tried to read it 3 or 4 times, and never got past the first chapter. I finally forced myself to read it prior to the movie coming out, and I could barely finish it. Nothing happens! A guy walks away from a hospital and heads home, while a woman he barely knows tries to scrape together an existence during the Civil War. It is inconceivable to me that, even during a more innocent time, anyone could or would sustain enough passion for 4 years to have him make the long trek home based on a total of \\"100 words\\" spoken to each other (actually, the \\"100 words\\" comment may be from the movie, not the book.) I really wanted to like this (and actually liked the movie), but, unfortunately I thought the book was awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!!","review":"Cold Mountain is possibly the most pointless novel I have ever read. The ending was fanominal but besides that... it stunk. Between all the walking and farming in the novel- I lost the whole point! The author also uses TOO MUCH DETAIL!! It is so boring that you end up reading the same sentence 47 times before you realize you aren't getting anywhere (kind of like Inman in some parts). So if your interested in all the particulars of a maple leaf- then this book is for you. If not... don't bother.I don't understand how the end of the novel could be so good and the rest of the book could be so bad. So here's my advice- read only the last 3 chapters. I promise- you're not missing much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Raised in the Country?","review":"This story starts with the Civil War, a lot of blood and guts, and pain. If you can get through the first few pages it is an excellent book. It takes place in the Blue Ridge and Smokey Mountains. I soaked up the description of the land like a sponge, fog, mist, hills, valleys, green foliage, and squeaky snow. Ada the woman and Inman the man have a hard time coming together, the work is hard, surviving with no food or shelter. From Ruby- who knows how to live off the land, to Teague- the leader of the guard looking for deserters, to Pancy- the addled banjo picker, to the goat woman, the people in the story are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Southern Lit.","review":"The novel Cold Mountain is a must read. I could not put the book down. I really liked the details of the scenes and I could picture was going own. I feel though that the ending was a little rushed. I chose to read the novel for a southern literature class. I am very satisfied that I did. I also enjoyed the novel because of South Carolina towns and North Carolina towns in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!","review":"I first heard about this book on NPR and knew I had to read it(Or have it read to me!)The book is an interesting look at the horror of war told by two people who must cope with it--but in different ways! Inman and Ada must make separate journeys to the same goal, both encounter obstacles and find allies and adverseries along the way.The only thing that kept this book from geting 5 stars was the ending seemed a bit odd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snore","review":"Don't be fooled by the literary prizes and movies - this is a boring book. You could just read the first half and not miss anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORRRRRRR-ING!","review":"Talk about a labor of bore! This book was horrific. It is so bloody slow. I have no idea how it won so many awards because it is nothing more than a 356 page descriptive paragraph. If you're in jail, by all means, indulge yourself. If you have a life, don't waste it on this overhyped recycling fodder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book","review":"This book was just one of the slowest books you will ever read. It drags out everything, and puts to much importance into things that don't matter to the book at all. If you like books don't read this one"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! A beautiful work with a wonderful story.","review":"Cold Mountain was an excellent tale of both a man embarking on a journy to make it home from the war and the struggles of a young women trying to live in the rugged mountains of North Carolina. Frazier told the stories of these two individuals with amazing description and emotion. The reader cannot help but feel that they are right there working alongside Ada or hiking though the mountains with Inman. I was very impressed with Frazier's ability to be able to create a story that was so well written and so captivating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, detailed, and romantic","review":"The author utilizes many pages in developing very detailed images of the trials and tribulations of the main characters. I was not captured by the emotional and love interests of the characters for each other by their expressed thoughts during the book. While on a positive note, the conclusion captures the reader with a story which is quick moving, active and romantic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story, not well written.","review":"Yes, it's a good story, echoing many similar stories to be found in the south. My wife's family has such a story of a family member, wounded during the civil war, walking back home, many miles and hardships, but with a happier ending. The writing, however, has too many factual errors, and the language is strange: not always modern, but never 1860s, with some regional expressions, but not consistent. Then the author is in love with two words, modal and seamless, used way too many times, even if they had been appropriate. I expected to come across proactive, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful Detail","review":"The topic is good, although I could not understand why the author chose to be so exhaustive in describing the surroundings, atmosphere, mood, and every possible occurrence. I found the detail to be waistful and bothersome, and took away from a possibly good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth reading!","review":"I rated this book as less than the best because (1) I prefer those rare books that invite the reader to think along with and argue with the author and (2) because I thought that he gave in to the beginner's inclination to kill off an attractive character just for dramatic effect. What I liked best about the book isn't often mentioned - his powerful evocation of scenes. His descriptions of the violinist and banjoist were beautiful; I didn't need a movie to \\"see\\" or \\"hear\\" the musicians. I also appreciated his mostly subtle descriptions of attraction to Ada - I don't need a graphic description of a roll in the hay. Some of the younger reviewers apparently can't place themselves in the era that this book represents. He also made frequent reference to one of my favoite books - Bartram's Travels. His descriptions of flora and fauna were, again, evocative of Bartram.I would recommend this book to any reader who is beyond the gothic and romance novel stage."},{"rating":"1","title":"depressing and pointless","review":"It is slow to start and goes downhill from there. I read on and finished it only because the reviews had been so good. I kept thinking that it would get better, but in the end it was very disappointing and unsatisfying. The reviews were misleading and I'll never again buy books that those reviewers recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rewriting Cival War History?","review":"It was fun to see what that kooky preacher Veasey would do next, but I was a little put off about the discriptions of the Confederate Generals on Maryes Heights. The authors agenda was to make them look like war mongering asses who thought of the men more as chess game pieces than soliders. \\"The two generals spent the afternoon up on the hill coining fine phrases like a couple of wags.\\" I guess Mr. Frazier is more of a CW expert than Catton, Gallager, Robertson, Sears, Headley, etc..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Love Story","review":"This was a beautiful love story in the tradition of great Breaux novels. I cried every time I read the third chapter. I would like to have seen more written about Herren."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flowing prose and thought and emotionally provoking.","review":"It has been a long time since I've read and enjoyed every word of a book. Each chapter is like a self enclosed story to be savored like a fine wine. A full bodied story brimming with emotion and realism. If you like more action and thrill, then read King's new Bag of Bones, his best work in years or Brad Steiger's new Alien Rapture which is rumored to be a blockbuster movie. Each is a different sub-genre, but never-the-less, excellent reads. I recommend these books highly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"When I started this book on the beach, a man came up to me and said \\"This is the most boring book I've ever read, he's walking, she's learning about herself, he's walking, she's learning, he's walking, it was so awful I couldn't finish it\\" and I was like \\"Whatever buddy, I'm reading here\\". Meanwhile, 6 months later I thought to myself his guy was right on the money, he's walking, she's learning... BORING. I think maybe if the author hadn't drawn it on and on for so long, then I would have liked the book more.Also, the no quotes thing made it very hard to understand when someone was talking, which was very irritating."},{"rating":"2","title":"A monumental, great work of literature.","review":"Charles Frazier's Cold Mountain is one of the most powerful, grim, but realistic novels I've ever read. The unique style the author employed is ingenious and effective, the story dramatic and powerful. The natural and historic detail, how much of it even relates to the story, is astounding. It will be difficult to find a new book to take the place of Cold Mountain, a novel that belongs in the Harvard Classics collection, among some lesser works already part of that collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I thought I was missing something significant about this book until I read the other reviews. I'm with the people who gave this book one or two stars. Too descriptive and not enough action. This must be a novel for people of higher intellect."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated, slow moving litany of civil war times","review":"I was quite disappointed after all the rave reviews, including a few of my colleagues who liked the book----I skimmed the last 100 pages just to convince myself that I wasn't missing the good part---there never was a good part for me; A good friend of mine just started reading it this week, and had the same impression; she is not going to finish it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"I read this book on the recommendation of friend I trust. She loved it. I hated it. It has Oprah Book Club written all over it, and by that I mean books which try to sell you mundane and commonplace happenings as Great Thoughts. It's The Bridges of Madison County all over again. I just don't get it. And don't think it's because I'm not smart enough. I'm a historian by trade and I can tell you--this book is bad.I could go on and on about how poorly written and how contrived it is, but the thing I find most disturbing about it is his treatment of women. Ada goes from an intellectual to a farm wife, learning what the Really Important things in life are: cooking, cleaning, and working in the fields. Such a lovely view of women. I feel sorry for Mr. Frasier's female counterparts in his academic department."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was my Honors English Profesor thinking??","review":"The truth is that I only read the book because it was assigned to me. Before I began reading I believed that it was going to be a really good novel and love story. But as I was midway through the book I was disilusioned by the slow pace of the book. I said to myself to keep reading despite that because maybe the compensation would come later through a really wonderful ending. This never happened. How can you end the book so abruply in a few pages after having read 350 pages. It just does'nt make sense. In addition I believe that Ada would not have accepted Inman back she did'nt need him, she was her own person. As for this being a \\"love story\\", I disagree. They never really expressed any love towards each other, only lust. In conclusion, I believe that it was'nt a terribly bad novel but I am sure that he could have done a much better job in finishing the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Walk","review":"At times I felt as if I was trudging through the pages as Inman was making his way home. But just when I was tempted to put Cold Mountain down, it pulled me back with an unexpected twist -- a chilling or heartbreaking encounter. I cried when it was over. The last few chapters are some of the best. I loved this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frazier is no Cormac McCarthy THANK GOODNESS!","review":"No story is perfect but Frazier conveys in what I measure at enjoyable descriptory proportions. I enjoyed this book immensely and will read it again. Too many readers of today have the movie mentality...give it to me and give it to me now. This is a book to be savored and enjoyed and requires you to listen and watch the characters closer than you would in a comparable piece of literature. This book is not for everyone....."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of valuable paper","review":"\\"Cold Mountain\\" began slow and didn't get any better. Though I enjoyed the section describing the Goat Woman, I would have to say this is the only section worth reading. I also the ending is ambiguous. It appears the author simply got tired of writing and just ended his story with no focus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is that all there is?","review":"How can Mr. Frazier craft his words so well yet say so little for so long about nothing. My expectations ran high after reading endless reviews of praise for Mr. Frazier's first novel, however, after plodding through the first 100 pages, it occurred to me that it is difficult to like a book when you simply don't like any of the characters. Ada is weak albeit much more interesting than Inman, but where is the late night, can't put down page turner I was anticipating? I cannot understand all the critical acclaim for this vapid piece of work, but I guess that's why there's chocolate and vanilla. I would not recommend this as a great read, a good read or even an okay read but a \\"read at your own risk\\" type of read. Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful.","review":"I had high expectations for this book after all the hype, but once again, reviews and accolades mean very little. The characters are unlikeable and uninteresting, the plot is predictable, the events are ridiculous, and the writing is tepid and formulaic. I gave up after about 100 pages. Don't waste your time and money, not when there are so many truly wonderful books out there to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adds a New Dimension to the word BORING","review":"By the time I got two-thirds of the way through this book, I couldn't have cared less what happened to Inman and Ada. The story just goes nowhere.

Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Inviting","review":"Not every story has a formula Hollywood happy-ever after ending.COLD MOUNTAIN is one such book.This is not a book about the history of the Civil War.The trials and tribulations in the lives of Inman and Ada create feelings of empathy for we of the modern day.I found myself falling backwards into that era with every page turn.So much so, I almost wanted to stay, hardships or not.Charles Frazier has not only captured certain facts, he has implanted himself in that time tunnel for all and sundry to read through his emotions.I thoroughly recommend this book.It is an extremely special story.- Yvonne Bornstein, Author, Eleven Days of Hell"},{"rating":"1","title":"too pretentious","review":"The author seems to be too busy trying to write beautifully to also tell a gripping story.

The author and characters are SO out of place with their times; the proto-lesbian relationship, the omnipotent secret-police NKVD Home Guard units, the goofy protagonist.The author's writing style is warmed-over Cormack McCarthy. I know it's his first book, which is why I didn't give it 1 star, but it is not an impressive first effort.All I can figure is that this would be considered \\"great literature\\" by people who mostly read \\"bodice rippers\\" and are members of Oprah's book club."},{"rating":"1","title":"Style triumphs over Substance","review":"I bought this book after reading kudos and praises for it from many sources.

Some of his \\"style\\", like not using quotation marks, annoyed and distracted from my enjoyment of the story.He did obviously know a great deal about the time period he was writing about, but his plot line was predictable and pure formula. The final showdown, if not the depressing results, was obvious from the midpoint of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you like bad travel magazines, this is for you","review":"This book is the new version of The Bridges of Madison County. It's fine for those who are not looking for literature or even a well written book, but a major disappointment to those who believe that a National Book Award should be meaningful. Looking back over the last ten years' winners, however, it is clear that the National Book Award has become meaningless and seems to be selected by magazine editors - not particularly good ones either."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible; this year's \\"midnight in the garden of good ....\\"","review":"The publishing industry dupes us yet again.

Just do the rest of us a favor and keep your opinions to yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, dull, and gruesome","review":"First, the good news: Ada and Ruby are well-drawn, thoughfully written characters who develop over the course of their story. Unfortunately, the story about Inman doesn't measure up. To begin with, the geography is impossible to follow--a real failure in a book about a journey. Inman meets far too many vicious people to be believed, and the muck and mire are overplayed. While some of this may be realistic, the level of overkill results in a book that is unpleasant, uninteresting, and not particularly worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"I kept waiting to get to the good part!","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book and I was very patient in waiting for the \\"great story\\" to begin. Unfortunately, by the time I was done waiting - the book was finished. The characters were dull and the long walk was just that, a long boring walk. The ending was also very anti-climatic.

Overall it is a very good book. It is well written, and seems to effectively capture a more personal side of the civil war. The author is extremely effective in bringing the characters to life. His writing is very descriptive, and beaitifully portrays the nature and scenery of cold mountain and its surrounding area. Frazier shows the different affect that the war had on both the men, and women. He has a very enjoyable usage of language. Throughout the course of the book he shows how both of the primary character, Ada, and Inman, struggle to get over the past, and push through their far less preferable present.

The first is \\"Innocence\\" by the original Renaissance group, which later became this Illusion group. The album is wonderful. They also made one other album when they were still Renaissance, entitled \\"Illusion;\\" hence, the name of their group when they reunited about 5 years later. The album \\"Illusion\\" was made in Germany and I think is pretty tough to find. (I have a copy of it on vinyl.) Illusion also created one more album entitled Enchanted Caress,\\" which I just recently discovered. \\"Isadora\\" is certainly a beautiful song, and your father made an excellent choice in naming you after it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep, brooding, mellow but progressive","review":"This is the most wonderful of albums I've heard in that style and period. As I understand it, the personnel came from an early incarnation of the English group Renaissance. This album seems better musically grounded than most of what I've heard of Renaissance but darker and not so flamboyant. While the composition tends to be not so wild, the electric guitar, piano and synthesizer do get intense in relation to the overall mellowness of the pieces. The vocalist, Jane Relf, sounds possibly classically trained and operatic. But the writing style is on the progressive end of folk-rock. The album drips with drawn out emotion. Released 1977."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cool and that's no Illusion","review":"Melodic and ethereal in parts and rocking in others. Think of a sophisticated latter day Fleetwood Mac.

Every song on this album is great. Nothing to skip over. I saw Greg Kihn in concert 7 times (one time when he was the opening act for the Tattoo You Rolling Stones tour.) This is the album before the release of Jeopardy and I still like this one better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rockihnroll Is Greg Kihns Best Album","review":"This is Greg Kihns best, and most cohesive album. It's an album that is plainly, simple rock and roll. It came out during the new wave craze. And people were itching for some simple rock and roll pop melodies again. Greg Kihn is best when he write love songs. When he tries to take on political, or deep subjects, it doesn't work. His voice has a folky sound to it with a unique husky whisper. Every song on this album from Sheila to the Breakup Song, Have catchy hooks, and yet a feel of familarity. It is like you are hearing music from earlier era but with new energy. My only complaint is that no record company has reissued this classic album since 1994. Rumor has it that some of his most popular albums will be reissued soon. Then we can get rid of the scalper's that want outrageus prices for his CD's. I'll wait patiently!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED the cassette","review":"I think when this first came out I bought the album then had to have the cassette to play in my car.Most of my friends fell in love with this music too.We cruised around that summer playing this all the time in the car. Females and males both loved this music. I own all the Greg Kihn albums I could find.This is still my favorite. It is a crime that the whole batch of their albums is not available on CD or for download.You might not like a lot of their music but there are some real gems that never got airplay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gabby Pahinui is the King of Slack Key","review":"This album clearly demonstrates why Gabby \\"Pops\\" Pahinui holds the undisputed title of King of Slack Key. Not only does this album present him, in all his slack-key glory, but also the talented Ry Cooder and Hawaiian musicians Atta Isaacs, Sonny Chillingworth, Randy Lorenzo, Joe Gang, Manuel Kapahu, Bla & Cyril Pahinui.This album delivers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"True sounds of Hawaii from the Master","review":"Gabby Pahinui put slack key guitar on the map. While the art form began evolving in the 1830's with the Hawaiian cowboys, Gabby became synonymous with Hawaiian Slack Key Guitar. In 1974, Warner Brothers recorded the legendary guitarist and singer with his seven piece band. Gabby and his fellow performer Atta Issacs were later to make famous Ry Cooder's Chicken Skin Music. Ry Cooder sits in here. This warm and soft music melts guitars together, and the vocals tell the story of Hawaiian history in the words and tones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply life changing","review":"Extremely motivating.

Unfortunately, for me, the heavy-accented, preach-from-the-pulpit style of presentation irritated me so much that I lost all sense of its content. What little I did absorb might have appealed to audiences of the 70s and 80s era, but his repetive humdrum was not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"Didnt work.

It works OK with low-power devices like scanners and flash drives. However, to run a high-power device (especially one that doesn't already have an AC power adapter of its own, such as Seagate's FreeAgent Go external hard drives), you need to obtain the AC power adapter (available separately) for this card. I don't know, myself, where to get one, so I'm going to find another USB PC Card that does have a power adapter included. Avoid unless you have power adapters on hand for all your high-power-using USB devices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Compatible with Standby","review":"If you use Standby in Windows XP the card will not be recognized when you resume from Standby. This means that in order for any connected USB devices to work after resuming, you must first pull out the PCMCIA card, reinsert it, and wait for it (and your connected devices) to reload. If you leave your computer on all the time, or if you shut down all the time, this card works great. Dynex free support was completely unhelpful, but they do offer fee-based support for their products to those who don't mind spending more money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't work with the new Toshiba Laptops..","review":"I bought this to add a couple extra USB outlets to my new Toshiba Laptop..

I am a computer tech who builds systems and networks, not a computer beginner."},{"rating":"1","title":"handy, but doesn't seem to work very well","review":"I got it to power my mouse, but nothing more. The listing does not mention that it requires external power to run pretty much anything. It comes with a power adapter that plugs into your other usb port (or you can buy an ac adapter separately). In any event, even with the power adapter plugged in to my existing usb 1.1 port, I could not get enough power to run a wireless 802.11g usb adapter through the dynex card--it turned on, but kept losing the signal. So now I've still got my wireless connection running on the slower usb 1.1 port. But if I ever need a place to plug in another mouse (which is the only thing I could get to run successfully through the dynex usb 2.0 port) then I suppose I'm all set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!","review":"Hi,My only reason for the purchase of this product is to transfer large files to/from my USB flash drives at greater speed on my old laptop(s).

AND it's a Dynex!","review":"A surprise by the Best Buy - owned Dynex company: a product that works, as advertised, for more than thirty days. Seriously, I must be the only guy left with a PCMCIA slot on his laptop, but after two USB ports I wasn't able to use a USB mouse AND external drive at the same time (the drive needs two powered slots). This fit the bill, and it still works months later."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"It's been quite a while since I purchased this product and it works flawlessly-- I don't even think about it being there any more. It charges my iPhone and any other phones that plug into the USB port.

I'm not one of them. I found Weltner's characters unsympathetic and the plot boring. Sorry -- I may be a \\"Hoarder\\", but I much prefer Amy Tan, Lydia Minotoya, and Joy Kogawa, all who wrestle with issues of multiculturalism without flattening the issues into flippant sound bites."},{"rating":"1","title":"reinforces sterotypes","review":"The jeist of Ms. Wongs story is that her protagonist is somehow able to transcend her own inherent predjudice against white people by ending up with a white boyfreind. This would come off as ironic if the protagonist was a bit more self aware but she's neurotic and self absorbed and essentially not cute..though shes trying to be. With the exception of the Grandmother (who is a gem) the characters of this 20 something story come off as too adolescent to be interesting to an adult reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst book ever","review":"I bought this book thinking it would be interesting, especially since I thought I could relate and I live in the Bay Area. But this book, by far, is the worst book I have ever read. Half way through, I was ready to chuck it, but I wanted to see it through to the end. What a mistake!Lindsey is annoying, judgmental and actually rather racist herself. Who judges a person on their name and corduroy pants and assumes that he has an Asian fetish? As a fellow A-A woman, I can relate to a few things she goes through, but not to most. The narration is terrible and there are no characters that are truly likable. The story is vapid, choppy and flat out terrible. Don't waste your time on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy This Book For Kicks!","review":"I read The Dim Sum of All Things a few years ago and I still carry disdain for this book today. (A \\"hoarder\\" was actually taken by the cover and bought it for me.) I don't regret reading the self-absorbed Wong Keltner's story, though this was the first time I ever felt annoyed with an author and wanted to stop reading a book. I persevered, quite proud of myself, and realized this book is great to have when needing to reference a poorly crafted story. I am half-Asian and aware of the old \\"hoarders\\" that eye my sweet Asian mother, but I found myself rolling my eyes at the author's need to push this fact to her audience. We get it Wong Keltner! You are so quirkly Asian. Anglo men flock to you because the slant of your eyes! Seriously, I wouldn't want to reward such horrible story-telling, but buy this book to get your hate on or to balance your palate after reading the great Amy Tan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough dialouge and BORING","review":"I bought this book at a used book store, thank goodness I didn't pay full retail!The voice of the book is way to much inside Lindsey's head. The parts with dialogue had way more potential to make it a good read. I skimmed the last half because, like another 1 star poster, I can't not finish a book once I start. I didn't even care once she got to China, at that point I was over it.Her relationship with Micheal was strange, I never understood why he liked her since she treated him so strangely and on occasion obnoxiously. What was his motivation? Was he really a \\"hoarder\\"? Eh, I don't really care, but it would have been nice to have it shown to us.Don't waste your time on this book. The cover is cute and drew me in, but that's about the only thing I liked."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a fabulous, riveting book!","review":"What a fabulous, intelligently written, fun read. I am smitten with Kim Wong Keltner's penetrating insight and humor as well as her ability to generate a visceral response from this reader. This book is a delight and will leave you wanting more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucks","review":"She's a sellout. And who the hell came up with this little blurb in the book description??? \\"Where Asian cuties meet the white guys who love them?\\" Nah nah nah, i get enough asian man hatin' from maxine hong KINGSTON and amy tan. Welcome to the club, Kim Wong KELTNER, just another self-hater. Isn't there a 0 star option???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor representation of young Chinese women","review":"I just finished this book tonight and i wasn't that wowed. It's had some fun sections but most of it was a little too much soul searching chinese while looking down upon white males who may like asian females. One major mistake in the book that bothers me is that the grandmother Pau Pau is named that. As being a fellow asain, i would think the author would know that title \\"Pau Pau\\" is for the father's mother not the mother's mother. I didn't notice it until i finished the book. Seeming to know alot about the chinese culture and living in SF, i would think the author would know the proper title of a grandmother on the mother's side is, Jia Pau, not Pau Pau! Also i love how the main character easy forgave her love interest when given a cheese hello kitty toaster oven. LAME!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"First 12 pages great and then downhill","review":"the discussion of Hoarders had me laughing out loud, but then I realized the book slipped back into every ABC stereotype i'd ever heard,complete with inept and/or gay Chinese men no one wants, the self-loathing \\"ethnic\\" character, the money obsessed Asian...and others I don't have space to mention. Besides all that, the novel switches voice between 1st and 3rd person...I just wasn't impressed. It's a step above the romance novels I used to get at the 2nd hand store for a dime, but not filled with 3 dimensional characters, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm bummed that I bought the sequel and this book at the same time","review":"This was a nice, fast read and kept me awake during my commute but in NO way should be compared to Amy Tan.I found the cliches and overly descriptive scenarios very dull and annoying. Seemed to me that the author was trying too hard (as if overboard description makes for good writing).The character of Lindsey was shallow and ran away from anything remotely unsafe. She annoyed me also.I found the characters of Pau Pau and Michael were most endearing, though.I bought both \\"The Dim Sum of All Things\\" and \\"Buddha Baby\\" at the same time. \\"Buddha Baby\\" was very similar to \\"Dim Sum\\" and annoyed me for the exact same reasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racist.","review":"I became disgusted by all the racist comments in the book and after about a hundred pages into the story,I started to put a check on each page that contained a racist comment.Especially about Caucasian men. Almost every page is marked.I believe that if this book had been written by a Caucasian or African American it would have started an outcry from the reading public. As it should."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book....definitely buy this one!!!!!","review":"This was an awesome book! Being a \\"twinkie\\" myself and who also married a \\"white devil\\" made this book a great read, and so relatable! I loved being able to relate to Lindsey Owyang, and being able to understand all the chinese that was being spoken. I found myself laughing every other minute. I could not put this book down...in fact I read it all in one day! This is highly recommended, and I am hoping for a sequel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful. Truly awful.","review":"Manages to be dull and angry simultaneously. To say that the book has only a single note would be kind, as most one-note books do a far better job of working through the various connotations of their subject matter than this one. Ms. Keltner's idea of approaching the Chinese-American experience seems to be to surround her nasty protagonist with an unending serious of poorly conceived characters whose only purpose seems to be to spout something implausible so said protagonist can have internal rants that come across as rather offensive as well. (\\"Loot Summer Palace long time ago! If foreign devil don't take, communists smash!\\"- this is supposed to be funny? Or insightful?) Lacking in humor, a lazy, inconsequential plot, and featuring a surprisingly sour edge to it, all wrapped up in thoroughly pedestrian prose.Steer clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read -- Buy This Book!","review":"I tore through this 300-plus page book because it was so enjoyable. A true only-in-San Francisco coming-of-age story, Dim Sum offers a wry, 20-something take on what it's like to be caught between cultures: Chinese/American, carnivore/vegan, etc. The writing is deeply poignant in parts, side-splittingly witty throughout. Anyone who has felt disconnected from their family history only to discover that it lives on inside them will relate to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible and hypocritical","review":"This book seems like a series of complaints. The main character complains about some Asian-Americans are too \\"Asian\\" or \\"not Asian enough\\". It is as if she can't find a happy medium to live in. A guy she goes on a date with is into fast cars and karaoke, which is supposedly too \\"Asian\\". But a guy who can't use chopsticks well enough isn't \\"Asian\\" enough.The author seems to like to add name brands of clothing into the soryline as well. I don't think the public really cares that the character is wearing something Kenneth Cole or Gap. Is she trying to promote something that I'm not aware of?Perhaps because I am also Asian-American, and can't understand why someone would write a book of complaints about being Asian-American. Maybe it is because I don't entounter these problems on a daily basis like the character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Book","review":"Contrived and with too many things that just do not ring true. Lindsey is Chinese-American, living in Chinatown, with her Chinese grandmother, grew up surrounded by Chinese relatives and yet is so clueless about basic, everyday things....? She is constantly having to have things \\"explained\\" to her (e.g. food, customs)by her brother, cousin, etc. It reads like a bad TV movie. She mistakes \\"lion-dancing\\" for \\"line-dancing\\" at a New Year celebration? Just silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"She seems very self-hating","review":"This book was overly concerned with chinese-ness and with everything else in the world being opposed to chinese. The author hates men who admire chinese women, hates non-chinese who admire chinese art, fabric or food.The protagonist is so very self conscious that I never believed for a minute that she would actually let Michael close enough to see the \\"real\\" her. Also her anger at a column entitled \\"The Slant\\" as an anti-asian statement (toward her, no less) was ridiculous. She was a journalism major! Surely she could see outside of her ethnicity to understand the a \\"slant\\" is an individual view of an issue.Lindsey was offended at a non chinese having, using or admiring objects and people of chinese heritage. Lindsey's self-loathing of being chinese has dampened my admiration of the culture, art and people. How can I know if someone like Lindsey is scorning me for buying a gorgeous imported teapot from Costplus?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I reading the same book?!","review":"This book was just awful.

Not an easy task for a penniless orphan raised in a scholarly environment. Enter Patrick Sherbourne, a devilishly handsome lord, all too anxious to grace her entrance into society. With Patrick at her side, Victoria makes the acquaintance of three more \\"P.S.\\" gentleman.

The band has made a fine progression and is able to combine the electronic aspect of their music with their well known metal guitars better than ever before.Also, the band has added some musical influences from the far east, which to my mind fits the music very well.The production is very powerful and heavier than on its predecessor \\"Eternal\\".

They began as a slower paced Black Metal outfit and slowly evolved with echo-like industrial atmospheres.In \\"Reign of Light\\" they go way beyond ... too beyond. The songs have a funky, uplifting feel to them and in a few Vorp/Vorphalack even attempts to rap! The album sounds so commercial and MTV-friendly I wouldn't be surprised if the song \\"High Above\\" ended up on the soundtrack of the next Vin Diesel/Angelina Jolie Sci-Fi movie. Had they limited production qualities by a few notches, as they did on other albums, this may have turned out OK, but \\"sell-out\\" is written in so many places it's too obvious even to take lightly.Listen to a few songs.

I recently showed this movie to my nieces and nephews and they really enjoyed it, espcially Jinx, the \\"handyman\\" robot in the movie. It's a good movie for everyone in the family.

They will think they're seeing a action movie and will be sound asleep from boredom before the first hour. It also is useful to deter them from chasing the dream of being an astronaut in the same manner that Captain Planet works to make children hate all enviromental rhetoric. They associate an unpleasent time with NASA and the space program and saves you the difficulty of a child chasing the microscopic job market of NASA.I seriously doubt any child could endure a movie this bland for more than an hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sensitivity. No support","review":"This is a great idea, but a poor implementation. I loved shortwave radio as a kid and this is better. I received my unit in December, 2006, and it worked just fine out of the box, but only if I kept it in the same room as my Wi-Fi base station. When I moved it to my bedside, two rooms and three intervening walls away, it stopped. The signal strength indicator dropped to 0-1 bar. BUT--my Sony laptop resting next to it would pick up and stream flawlessly any radio station, showing 4-5 bars of signal strength. It's clear their Wi-Fi circuitry lacks sensitivity, at least compared to my Sony.The seller replaced it with a new unit. It performed the same.

However, it has been unstable from the beginning and the slow response from AE was to contact my local distributor in NY. My distributor does not answer emails and when they do answer the phone and take a message for someone to call me back, they never do. I think this radio must have a hardware issue as it crashes from time to time and requires a complete reset to get it going again. It's frustrating and time consuming. I can't reccomned this product. The Receiva site often has similar complaints for brief periods until they delete them. The logic behind this just escapes me. They are killing a great idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING TO BUYERS","review":"The item does work out of the box as long as you do not try to upgrade the software.

How long does it take. I do not know. A call to the company in England was not helpful. They did not answer my e-mails so I called. They said that they were aware of the problem and suggested I return it to the seller for replacement. When I suggested that they send out a recall notice as the product has a major defect the last word from tech support was f**k you! The sound quality is not great for music. Acceptable for voice.

My wife calls it \\"futuristic\\". I call it \\"retro\\". It uses steam pressure so there is no pump. Pump failures have limited the life span of other machines that I have bought (usually failure occurs after 1-1 1/2 years of use). The boiler produces steam and when the pressure on the gauge is ~.8 bars you lift the lever and release the hot water through the coffee. Steaming milk is very easy. The espresso/coffee tastes great. We've made multiple lattes at once with plenty of horsepower to spare. You do need to ensure that you don't build up too much pressure (by inadvertently leaving it on) or leave too little water in the machine (you can see the water level in the sight glass). Engineers will likely love having a machine like this in their home. A side benefit while you are drinking your latte is that it is great tool for teaching kids simple science concepts."},{"rating":"2","title":"the coffee leaks before the lever pulls down, and i feel no resistance while pulling the lever","review":"I've tried every different grind, to the finest my grinder can offer (its a $300 grinder, i think this should be sufficient), and the result is always the same: When I pull the lever arm up, about half an ounce of coffee spills out, then pulling down the lever arm offers no resistance, and as a result, its just a totally black shot with no crema. I've varied the grind and tamping pressure, and have no results.Maybe mine is broken. Did anyone else have this problem?EDIT: It turns out my Grinder, though expensive, does not grind fine enough.

I was excited when this book was released because it had been a few years since Peretti had released a book. Bottom line, this book made me think that possibly it wasn't Christian fiction. I found the plot weak and the book boring. A huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't expect this","review":"I did not expect to read such a disappointing book, to say the least; since I have thoroughly enjoyed all the other books I've read by Frank Peretti. I got through about 150 pgs and could not believe that not even 24 hours had passed in the story line. Peretti is a very descriptive writer, which I normally like, but this time around he dragged out the events of the story waaaaaaaaaay to much. I was hoping this book would scare me but it is very predictable, and the whole King Kong/Bigfoot plot was a cop out. Maybe I am desensitized but this book did nothing for me. I will admit I could not finish reading it. Although I did skip to end to find out how it ended and besides it being a stupid ending, nothing was really that different from the 200 pages I skipped. I started longing for the end not far into the book. This is a surprise disappointment and I don't suggest you get this book unless you like King Kong/Bigfoot type stories that are about 200 pages too long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, what can be said?","review":"I will be the first to admit that I have never read a Peretti book before Monster. I am not sure that I will read another one after this.As a Christian fiction book, it is good. As a straight up fiction book, it is annoying. The first thing would be the speech of the charecters. The stutter of one of the main charecters nearly caused me to p-p-pull my hair out. Being a Bigfoot mythology fan though, I would not be detered by it. Secondly, I do know it is a Christian fiction book, but man, every time somebody's shoelace came untied they were asking God why? This, I could not get past.I guess I would say that overall, the story was interesting. The charecters were about the most annoying I have been exposed to in a very long time though."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have read the Acknowledgments page","review":"The author first two acknowledgments are the Discovery Institute and Center for Creation Studies.

At times we had an occasional glimpse of the great Peretti writing we love but for the most part the story line was just barely ok. I would have quit the book had it been anybody but Peretti, I kept thinking it's got to get better. This is the first time in a Peretti novel that I was able to guess the outcome about half way through the book and get it right!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Monster was fairly good classic Peretti book","review":"Basically, a woman, Beck, goes backpacking with her husband, Reed, and gets kidnapped by a family of animals wich are a cross between human and apes. The rest of the book is about unravelling where the ape/humans came from, who created them, how to catch/kill them, and weather Beck is still alive. A good book, plenty of action to keep your interest, and a pretty easy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best.","review":"If you have never read Peretti, please start with The Oath. That, in my opinion, is his best work. This is his worst, again, in my opinion. I get the impression that, as with many authors who make it big, they went back and published an earlier written work that was not his best because they felt his name would sell it. Do yourself a favor and leave this slow, convoluted story on the shelf and read any of his other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could have been taken from today's headlines","review":"Evolutionists and Creationists face off in this suspenseful and much anticipated novel. Once again, Peretti takes his readers on a roller coaster ride with unexpected twists. Just when you think it's safe to unhook your safety belt, you discover the ride isn't over. Sadly, the story line could have been taken from today's headlines...deception, murder, mistrust, and finally truth winning in the end. Peretti is less \\"Christ-focused\\" in this novel than he has been in the past. His frequent supernatural twists are left out. He offers no Gospel-sharing here, either. I didn't get the usual creepy goose-bumps while reading \\"Monster,\\" but was still left on the edge of my seat. This is another must read for Peretti fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"A HUGE disappointment","review":"Wow.........after waiting all this time for a new Peretti book we get this. I find it hard to believe that Frank Peretti wrote this book. I've read everything he's ever written and loved each one. I kept on reading and reading this, waiting expectantly for it to suddenly explode into something profound and wonderful.......something with a plot........something with meaning. This was the biggest waste of time read....if anyone else had written it I would never have plodded all the way through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak story, weak writing","review":"I came into this expecting something like This Present Darkness, but was very disappointed. The plotline and writing are amateurish. It reminded me of the hacky writing you'd find on a third-string forensics procedural (i.e. Crime Scene: Scene of the Crime). I would skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"I picked up this book because the author was recommended. Maybe I should have read a differnt book by Mr. Peretti. The begining of the book was interesting and built up a good amount of suspense and mystery. As it went on it became just plain silly. Nothing really scary and the suspense was quickly gone, so it was easy to loose interest. I forced myself to finish it in hopes it would get better, but it got worse. It probably would have made an excellent short story, but the book dragged on alot. I will try one of his other books before giving up. Maybe the next one won't disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Getting Through","review":"Peretti's Monster started off with a bang in the beginning then slows down to a snails pace in the middle. There were moments I considered stopping the read for something else but I am glad I trudged through the slow moments because the last 100 pages and the climax were worth the wait. I kept hanging on the last few chapters to see how Peretti was going to tie all the pieces together & he did a masterful job in doing so. Please know this is a good but not great book. It is fun and deserves it place amongst Peretti's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"I have read several of Frank's books and was waiting with great anticipation when I heard that Monster was being released. Peretti has an incredible way of making you feel as if you are a part of the story. He has a unique ability to give a lot of emotion to words on paper, hence my enthusiasm for his newest release. I wasn't impressed, though. Way too many characters that were underdeveloped for my taste. They seemed like more of a distraction. And in all honesty, I found the story to be very lacking and lame to have a \\"Christian\\" label attached to it. It starts out with good intentions, but it doesn't sustain its promise as you get deeper into the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put this book down!","review":"An Amazing read, that keeps you wanting to know what's going to happen next.

He focuses on issues not touched in his other books, but danger still lurks around every corner, and I wondered and guessed, with my heart in my mouth, what would happen next until at last I reached the final page.Unlike other Christian fiction on the market, Monster (and all Peretti's works, for that matter) gives you something you can take away from the story. It penetrates deeper than just the skin. He dives right into issues, and gives you food for thought. You come away from the book feeling like you really got something from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"What on earth happened here? The story started out fine, complete with mystery and creepy atmospherics. The author seemed to build a genuinely dark and dangerous protagonist in the mythical 'Bigfoot' creature. Suddenly the plot went downhill fast--one of the main characters gets abducted by these things and dragged around like a rag doll. This was a bit lame. But when she began to name the 'Monsters' after O.T. Biblical patriarchs (Jacob, Isaac, etc) it got downright silly. All sense of true danger, realism, and mystery vanished, and I quickly put the book down. Yes,it was just...silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I really enjoyed all of Frank Peretti's previous work.... Prophet, The Oath, Piercing the Darkness/This Present Darkness. Not this book. It's really just boring. He gives everything away rather shortly and the suspense and thrilling aspects of his previous work are entirely absent in this. I didn't even finish it and have no desire to revisit it. I would not recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"Wow! Although, not his normal style, Monster is a very enjoyable read by Frank Peretti. When I opened the cover, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. The surprise is who the actual \\"monster\\" turns out to be. Although not along the same lines as his \\"Darkness\\" books, this is a must read for Peretti fans. - Cynthia M. Hickey, author of Pursued By Evil and A Dream Fulfilled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Written Very Well","review":"Some of the details in the story were just downright confusing. The dialogue was often choppy and didn't flow in a cohesive manner. The character development was pretty weak - we never really did get the full story on Beck's stuttering issues. Also, Beck and Reed's marriage seemed to have much more back story to it - alas, we'll never find out about it.Not a very good read. I only finished it to see if it got better at the end. For really well written Christian fiction, I recommend Stephen Lawhead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Great book as far as scary books go. Not much on the spiritual side of life but a good book anyway. Don't judge a book by its cover because if you do, you will probably not pick this one up. There are some graphic scenes played out but other than that it gives a sound story of deception, corruption and the good guys winning in the end. I wouldn't recommend this book for a younger audience because of the intense descriptions but should be okay for teens and older."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular","review":"I must say this is my first \\"Frank Peretti\\" read........

Being a sucker for a good monster tale, and after reading the inside jacket synopsis, I bought it expecting a ripping good horror yarn. Instead, I found a jumbled tale with multiple hazy characters that were not well developed at all. I found myself having to refer back a few pages every now and then to remind myself who a certain character was, and what they were supposed to be doing. Had I realized this was a work of Christian fiction, I'd have saved my time and money. The anti evolutionary theme didn't become obvious until I was well into it, and I forced myself to muddle through until the feel good ending.

Beck and Reed travel to the wilderness to get away from it all, but unbeknownst to them, a deadly beast is prowling and killing anyone who dares to stand in its path. That's all true. But Monster is so much more than just another survival story. Peretti is a master at character development, and by the climax my palms were sweating, my breath bated, body tense with expectation. (I actually listened to the unabridged audio version of this book, and I'd highly recommend it as Frank does an incredible job with all the character's voices.)If you've wondered if Monster could really be all that it's hyped to be, wonder no more. It is. And if you're still wondering, let me whisper one word - Sasquatch. Interested now? Good. Crack open Monster and be ready to experience a sleepless night of page turning.

It literally moved me to tears, the resolve, giving up and starting again, the great patience and unbelief...(to say the least, I dont want to give it away) This is a master piece from beginning to end.

You'll see...."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFUL","review":"The warmest most beautiful dub album I have heard. Fantastic vocal arrangements and as mentioned by a co-reviewer the incredible Lee Perry Dub Cow. Words alone can not express how this record will make lovers of roots and dub feel.

Later I purchased \\"Heart of the Congos\\". What can I say. Believe it or not, this is the only reggae album I own, i'm clueless of the genre, but this double CD emits a spiritual beauty that transcends style. Up there with the holy blues of Blind Willie Johnson and the cathedral sax blast of Albert Ayler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Artistic","review":"This Congos release doesn't sound like any other reggae release.

It clearly states at the beginning of the disc that much of the middle of the race is missing. Unfortunately, though, there is no indication on the outer package, or on this webpage, that the race is incomplete.

It is simply not a history of the Chessie system: it describes the formation of the system, but that's all: the rest of the book is just a topographical description of the routes which largely covers ground already dealt with in previous books in the series.Production values are also not up to scratch. In particular, there's a large map that purports to show the components of the system but is actually nothing of the sort. One wonders how a bloomer like this got through the production process. There are also more literals than usual, especially in captions. The saving grace, as aways in this series, is the quality of the photos, but that's not enough to compensate for the other deficiencies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book On The Right Track","review":"The Chessie System book is everything I thought it would be and more.

Last Christmas my wife bought me a two year subscription to Classic Motorsports. As a British car nut, I knew that Grassroots Motorsports had purchased British Car Magazine to form Classic Motorsports but had not read the new magazine.Classic Motorsports has every bit of the coverage on British cars that Brit Car did, the bonus is the coverage of cars I haven't read about. I find myself looking forward to reading about old Alfas, Datsuns and Volvos on top of my beloved British cars. There is coverage on the US cars, but the balance is dead on.So if you like classic sports cars, and are looking for information outside of the typical pony car mags, check out Classic Motorsports.

Classic Motorsports was my best Christmas present of 2005."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best $24.99 Ever Spent!!!","review":"Classic Motorsports Magazine and its sister publication Grassroots Motorsports are in my mind two of the best automotive publications out there. The articles are very informative, and written in a way that any enthusiast will enjoy them. No matter what their level of ability is.

The VCR has good picture quality and some good features, but has serious drawbacks. Like the previous reviewer pointed out, the display on the VCR itself is useless, it doesn't even display the channel that the machine is on (you are forced to use the TV screen) which makes watching one program/recording another frustrating. The motor/tape transport is extremely noisy, even during normal playback. The included remote, while good, is frustrating to use, as the \\"volume\\" feature works only when 'TV' is selected. This forces you to constantly select between TV and VCR when watching a tape. Also, the machine is SO light that it slides all over the cabinet, we were forced to put rubber feet on the coasters. Consider other options before buying this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing new hear, not worth the effort","review":"Hank just rehashes old stuff. Some of it's good, but he also resorts to some substandard items and tactics. Kind of embarrassing at times, plus he uses material from young-earth radical Henry Morris, well known for his deceptions. For good, intellectial studies of the topic, see the books by Behe, Denton, Phillip Johnson and Hugh Ross."},{"rating":"1","title":"A simple book for simple folk.","review":"Hank has written an easy to understand book for those who have trouble understanding one of the most easily understood subjects in science. He shows very clearly that he lacks even the most basic understanding of evolutionary theory. He tears down \\"a\\" theory of evolution, but one that bears almost no resemblance to evolutionary science as it is known and practiced by real scientists. This is a book for those who need to believe that they are the focus of the universe; It helps them to ignore their hairy knuckles, appendix, tail bones, canine teeth and bad backs. Every argument he presents can be downloaded for free from fundamentalist web sites. Lucky thing for me it was a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a worthwhile purchase.","review":"\`The Face' will perhaps convince the ignorant or reinforce the opinions of the already-convinced, but anyone with even a moderate familiarity with the subject of evolution will see through Hanegraaff's points. He trots out old arguments that have long ago been refuted by evolutionary scientists, and, by using ad hominem arguments against his opponents (i.e., personal attacks -- he calls Stephen Jay Gould \`pitiful', for instance), he falls into a logical trap that he himself warns his readers against using themselves in discussions with evolutionists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply misleading","review":"I read Mr. Hanegraaff's book on the urging of my Creationist brother, and after fully analyzing it, researching the science, and tracking down the qoutes used, I decided there is only one thing you need to know about this book: it is designed to intentionally mislead people who do not know very much about science.Anyone with a layman's knowledge of evolution will see through this book immediately, but those who are less well informed can be easily swayed by the misqoutes, bad science, distortions, and outright fabrications contained within. I must hand it to Mr. Hanegraaff, however, as he is a propagandist of the first rate."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poorly research compendium of Creationist dogma.","review":"Hank Hanegraaff continues in the Creationist's tradition of misquoting, quoting out of context, or simply distorting the truth to make it fit his belief structure. In \\"The Face...\\" Hank implies that Einstein and Leonardo da Vince supported the Creationist's viewpoint. Rather implausable as Einstein's God certainly did not resemble Hank's. And da Vinci's writings indicated that he did not believe in a universal flood. In fact, Leonardo da Vinci is described by some as one of the first evolutionists.Hank's review of the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics is very unique in that his 2nd Law has little resemblance to that employed in Physics.In short, the book is excellent fiction!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"As a Christian I am embarassed","review":"This book is an arguament to discredit evolutionists that aren't Christians. It does have some valid points though. He takes the credit away from these points by stateing something crazy. It isn't even focused on the Bible anymore. It is focused on making accusations with no basis. Bieng a Christian evolutionist I wanted to read something with some integrity...I obviously read the wrong book. of course, if you are new to the subject this book can easily convince you that evolution is wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Good as the Book","review":"Having already reviewed the book I would like to go on and add a couple of comments on the audio version. While the material was well presented and Hanegraaff has a clear speaking voice, there were times that the background score began to drown him out. The music could have been better chosen and more subdued. The majority of the important text from the book is presented however, and listeners will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Good and the Bad","review":"I purchased this book to learn the basic flaws with the theory of evolution. The acronym FACE is a good reminder of issues that we all need to be aware of.I was disappointed by the extras that I didn't bargin for. For instance, the book is 240 pages long - only 90 pages (38%) of the book focused on the topic evolution. The remainder is focused on - introduction (7%), other issues - (55%), and notes (33%).I did learn a ton from this book. However, I gave it a low rating due to the fact that 62% was not related to the book's purpose - The farce of evolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloated Dogma","review":"I got it for free, and that is good because it is a terrible book. I wanted to give it ZERO STARS. Laughably bad, Hanegraaff uses personal attacks on Darwin to discredit evolution theory. All the quotes are out of context. Even the caption under Isaac Asimov's picture was funny. \\"Evolutionist Dr. Isaac Asimov...\\" really? is that what Asimov is known for? The whole thing is twisted and stupid and I'm embarrassed for Hanegraaff. The logic is totally flawed. Hangraaff credits Darwin with the Nazi Holocost. Wow what a leap! Kind of scary though, since a lot of people believe what ever they see in print. This book is really full of hot air, I have to put a paperweight on it to keep it on my desk. It doesn't even discuss present day evolution theory at all. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real eye opener to Scientific Fraud for evolution","review":"This book is interesting in that it shows the scientific fraud, fakery, and outright lies that have permeated the world in the name of valid science. Hank Hanegraaf shows, with hard science, the complete Fraud that is evolution. He shows how it would be, for all intensive purposes, statistically impossible for even one amino acid or protein molecule to even form on it's own, by chance. Also in the book are the many examples of archaelogical fraud used to \\"advance\\" the case of evolution, but in reality just show us that from a purely archaelogical viewpoint, evolution has no basis for fact. This book is an eye opener, and in the words of Hank Hanegraaf himself, \\"If you begin as a creationist, you will become equipped to demonstrate the farce of evolution. In addition, your confidence in the Christian worldview will be solidified. If you begin as an evolutionist, the shaky pillars of your worldview will be underminded.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye Opener","review":"Hank Hanegraaf does an outstanding job in this book. He clearly explains that Evolution should not be taught as fact and is a theory that many people believe. No science has ever proved if you having nothing, you can make something. Therefore, a Creator (God) is the only reasonable answer. The book is easy to read and understand. The book ponts out many myths and errors with the teaching of Evolution"},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Awful","review":"How do wingnuts with simple 8th grade science and logic get to write books?

However, this book does not live up to the author's potential. In the books mentioned previously he was carefull to throughly document his statements, but he does not do so in this book. Instead, he jumps onto the very popular bandwagon of Creationism without knowing anything of science. This one fact causes the book to be ladden with assumptions that are never throughly researched or documented, which leaves much of the book giving opinion, but no strong evidence for the case of creation. Unfortunately, I was disappointed that in writing this book he choose to leave his objective mind at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is itself a farce and a disgrace.","review":"While browsing in a Christian bookstore recently, I noticed this book's provocative title and was intrigued. I spent some time with it, and found it to be quite as ludicrous as the disappointed reviewer of 10 June 1999 from Portland, Oregon, has described (see below). There's no need for me to repeat that reviewer's detailed critique here, as I agree with each of the points made. This book does not deserve any reading at all, let alone a careful reading.I returned \\"Farce\\" to the shelf, and moved on to find a book on early Church history. The author whose book I selected seems to know his subject quite well, which is quite a bit more than I can say for the professional debunker Mr. Hanegraaff."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book clearly exposes the fairy tale called evolution","review":"Mr. Hanegraaff does an excellent job, showing the fallicies of the argument for evolution. He presents clear & concise scientific data to refute the theory of evolution. Kudos to him for this great work,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This book is about as bad as it gets. Whether you support evolution or disagree with it, you won't find anything in this book that suggests an intelligent analysis of the controversey. The author has been caught in several instances of plagarism. His best defense of this book would be that he stole it from someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly","review":"It is hard to understand why some want to see evolution as such a big issue. Christians would be better of letting it go and fight other battles. This book illustrates how pointless it is. If you reject evolution you have to reject 1. The theory of continental drift 2. The big bang theory 3. Carbon dating 4. Most contempory Geology 5. Most modern theories relating to the universeThe only people who fight evolution are those who have no knowledge of the implication of what they are doing. That is rejecting most of what is our modern understanding of the world.Religion can exist with evolution but when it rejects it, it puts itself in luny land."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book on evolution.","review":"Hank Hanegraff, the Bible Answer Man has written a great text on the issue of evolution. Some on the amazon reviews, make really bad assertions about how bad this book is or outdated etc.. One writer states that if you reject evolution, you would have to reject, all of science, computers, and the advances that we as pepole have had because of good science. All science was founded by a creationist or Christian except Darwin's theory.

Just to give two examples, there are Probelesodon and Massetognathus, with both reptilian features (lower jaw comprises several bones, jaw joint formed between articular and quadrate bones) and mammalian features (teeth specialized for different functions, lower jaw with prominent coronoid process, double condyle at back of skull for neck articulation)Another tough one to argue away is the incredibly detailed, 50 million year record of evolution of the family of the Equidae (Horse)..."},{"rating":"2","title":"An original writing style; very compelling and readable, FUN","review":"\\"High Drama in Fabulous Toledo\\" is a funny, readable, delightful novel from an author I will be watching.

This movie starts out honoring that code. The killings happen around a annual harvest festival when college kids converge on Devil's Lake. The last one happened 20 years ago, now they are happening again. Same murderer? Copycat? There are a number of suspects: The family of the convicted murderer who claims their son/brother was wrongly accused. A new guy in town, son of a former resident. The old sheriff who believes they are connected. The deputy who is jilted. The creepy town pathologist.After 8 people are killed the sheriff proclaims, \\"\\"Although there have been nine murders, we're not ready to say that any of this is connected.\\" The movie just wasn't that great.

I figured out the ending about 15 minutes before the ending, yet I was pleasantly surprised. I figured that the young resident junior was guilty, but not his father until the very end. I love these low budget movies as long as the acting is good. There was way to much killing and too much in the same manner. What this movie lacked in budget, it made up for in plot and ending. The acting was well done. You almost knew what would happen to the girls'deputy boyfriend, almost as an act of redemption.Since we have been desensitized to these slasher flicks, it takes somthing outstanding to stand out.

It's berry-ish, but not overwhelmingly so. It's not quite sweet enough for me so I add one packet of Splenda to make it perfect. I find it to be soothing and calming, if that's possible for a cup of tea, and drink 4 or 5 cups of it in the course of a day - even have a cup just before bedtime.

Where this volume falls flat is the blatant amorality of the ending -- the rabbit's runaway bicycle causes several mishaps, but rather than apologize, wabbit jumps back on his bike and rides off, shining on all the upset critters in his wake. Yeah, maybe the ending is unexpected and unconventional -- it's also a terrible message to give little kids. (Ha, ha. Scr*w you!)

I struggled with Toshiba to get the item repaired. The standard phrase was \\"it is out of warranty.\\" Finally, Toshiba relented and the item was repaired. Lo and behold, I shortly thereafter experienced the same problem. Same story from Toshiba. I am now attempting to get it fixed (only two Toshiba repairshops in SC)under the extended credit card warranty (1 year beyond the original). It is hard for me to understand 2 out of 3 bad sets (I have not heard from my other Son)unless it was either a \\"lemon lot\\" (no QC)or they are dumping questionable product on Amazon.com.

I have seen cheaper DVD players handle the layer change in a seamless manner.

However, it glosses over their ideas and only presents them as compared/contrasted to the movements with which they were associated.The history leading up to the meeting is interesting but is presented in a somewhat scattered way. And while it does give a a great deal of insight into the personalities of these men, it never really gets into the philosphy too deep. In that sense, it reads like an A&E biography. An intriguing bit of fluff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent piece of research","review":"Having read some of the reviewers before me, I ought to warn the reader the book is more about a research of the surrounding facts of the Popper/Wittgenstein confrontation than, as some of the naive reviewers seem to have expected, an in-depth account or opinion of the philosophy of both.The book is true to its nature and in that sense it is outstanding indeed. Seldom will anyone obtain, in one piece, such a detailed portrait of two of the most outstanding intellectuals of the XX th Century. It may be curious to ascertain that these men, despite being born and educated in Austria, came to expose their differences before the english speaking world, where political tolerance has been rooted for centuries.It is a gripping read and one that will make you re-live with passion the beautiful tradition of philosophical awe, love for logic and the un-ending quest in search for the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"unsatisfying treatment of Wittgenstein and Popper","review":"I probably echo a lot of reviews on Amazon when I claim that this book is treats the philosophy of Popper so lightly that there's little mystery why books like this do not get written about modern academics very often. The authors do a number of things well: they portray post-war King's College, they show how Wittgenstein's students reverence for their teacher, and they illustrate Bertrand Russell off to the side, not being of much consequence. That being said, I really did not get a feel for what Popper and Wittgenstein were arguing about, what their lives' works were, and after all these years, who turned out be in the right. If one wants to find out what modern philosophy \\"is like,\\" this book does not seem to be much help.This is an attempt to popularize a core conflict in modern philosophy, without all that bothersome thinking. I recommend Magee's \\"Confessions of a Philosopher\\" or Scruton's \\"Modern Philosophy\\" as alternate choices."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book of personalities","review":"A student of philosophy will find this book interesting for its descriptions of prominent personalities (including Russell), but this book does not contain any particularly profound discussions of philosophy. The ideas of both Wittgenstein and Popper are given a shallow explanations; in addition the basic ideas of some other philosophical schools that came and went are discussed. However, the lives of these men are interesting, and the the author's commentary on the historical importance of the ideas of these men is also interesting. In addition this book gives Wittgenstein fans some helpful information on the evolution of Wittgenstein's ideas that may not be apparent from the paucity of documents that comprise Wittgenstein's writings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five guys named Tympany","review":"The LOUIS JORDAN * LIVE JIVE CD is a French import.

It has been replaced by very similar-sounding MIDI music.I personally didn't mind the edits; however, one pivotal scene towards the end of the novela's run has been inexcusably shortened. [SPOILER ALERT: A heart-wrenching scene in which Maria's children discover that she is their mother was edited without explanation. The powerful scene, as originally aired, showed the climax of Maria's story as her children went through the stages of denial, anger, and final acceptance. The DVD version hurriedly skips over the surprising revelation, and the viewer is left to conclude that the children accepted her immediately while the storyline continues elsewhere with \\"business as usual.\\"]As a bonus, LA MADRASTRA: AÑOS DESPUES is included in an edited format as well, tying up loose ends after the finale of the main telenovela."},{"rating":"2","title":"La Madrastra","review":"Was a very exciting dvd.

This book was written in the very early 1940s by a professor of Agriculture at Texas A&M University and has been in continuous print to this date. You can believe some what North of A&M in the Texas Panhandle Farming in the early post Dustbowl days was nigh impossible. This book was useful to our folks up here in that day.

So, if you want modern information, this isn't it.

Like he does! All of the three stories have a foolish and pessimistic end, which you would never expect. The first story tells about a couple, where the husband died. He wanted to live on and so he followed the instructions of the doctor and allowed, that the surgeon takes out his brain of his head as soon as he died. The joke about this story is, that his wife who was always against this idea and she wanted at the end even take the brain home. And Dahl uses so many medical expressions, that you nearly fall asleep by reading it. The second story we don't even remember, what it was about! The third story is even more macabre than the first one and we would never recommend it to people who are still a little bit normal!Olivia & FabienneIf you want to tell us your opinion write to: bianco@mails.ch"},{"rating":"2","title":"a great read","review":"I enjoyed every story in this book. My favorite was Parson's Pleasure. I was laughing so hard, I had tears coming down my face. Lamb to the Slaughter and Royal Jelly are great too. Dahl is a pleasure to read. Try reading some of his sentences out loud. His adult books are just as great as his children's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"THRILLING","review":"We really liked reading this book. We admire the fantasy of Roald Dahl and about his black humor we had to laugh a lot. But sometimes he writes in great detail and the story becomes too long. We read this book at school and otherwise we read here an other kind of books. So it was refreshing to read something different. The first moment when you read this book you think its a total non-sense. But then, thinking about it, you see a message. Every story is a metaphor. The title fits because the end of every story is very surprising. We can recommend to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay if you've got absolutely nothing else to do","review":"I ussually like Roald Dahl but this one just doesn't follow in his other books greatness. For one thing, the charecters stunk. Each one seemed to be alike with the description he gave. Also, it was written so long ago that it is very confusing, and has no relevance to everyday life. This book draaaaaaged on. It seemed like an eternity before I was done. One last thing, is it just me or was this book twisted? Do i really want to know what happened to the skin of an old guy? Uhhm, i don't think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsense","review":"We find this book has no sense and that's why we have given this title to the text. The story is very cruel and bloody: We are not very religious but it is against every understanding of moral and ethics. All the endings are pig dummy and absolutly stupid. The only plus point the ends have is their surprising character. We were shocked about Dahl's ideas. How is it possible to have such a morbid fantasy? In a way there are good parts, too. The situations are well described and you canreally imagine the scenes. We don't recommand this book, however, because you can use your time in a better way.

Like O Henry, Dahl's short stories have gripping plots and a twist at the end. The author seems to be fond of betting. Quite a few of the stories revolve around bizarre bets.My favourite tale is Lamb to the Slaughter - a murder story and how the frail and semingly harmless victim concealed the murder weapon. Most of the stories live up to their claim of being unexpected, but not everyone is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Great Book I Ever Read!","review":"I used to think books were boring.

It's a great tool since it allows you to tell it how much you are smoking and then it will tell you when to smoke and when not to smoke. It's relative to the Pavlovs Dog's Theory. Everytime you hear the chime go off in the program you are supposed to smoke. After about 34 days, the chime never goes off again and you don't think twice about smoking.

Irredeemable on almost every level, it's truly notable for two things: it contains some of the most poorly written dialogue ever screened (the \\"I want room service!\\" speech will have you hiding under the couch); and it goes off the rails quicker than \\"Showgirls\\". Keanu blows his first line - \\"We've got ice\\" - and it's all down hill from there. Reeves has improved immensely, and director Robert Longo is probably still in therapy, so perhaps we'll never see its like again. Like most people involved in this, they both claim it was destroyed by studio interference and panic-stricken re-editing which undermined the narrative structure.

The opening scene with him in black silk boxers in a king-sized bed with black satin sheets was worth the rental price for me. But good looking actors and above average special effects don't make a bad movie into a good movie; there has to be a plot! The plot is completely unbelievable and boring.

It would be easier and more effective to just save it on a disk and ship it UPS!I give it one star for Keanu's and Dina Myer's performances (she is also great in Dragonheart with Dennis Quaid by the way!) and the other star is for the special effects.A movie has to have an acceptable premise or it will flounder.

Made by a Canadian studio, with a Canadian star (yeah, Keanu is unfrotunately for me to admit, a Canadian) and it's based (ever so LOOSELY) on a book by a Canadian author. What someone forgot to do was look in on the production and see where it's director was spending the Canadian money, because it wasn't on the movie. The company up here that made it is more used to making some artsy movies (and they never have to worry) than an action flick, and I guess that's why this movie sometimes feels like it's trying to be artsy.

Secret information is handled through mnemonic carriers, people who store the info in their brains. Keanu Reeves plays Johnny, a carrier who stumbles upon a package that could save the human race. But that's not all: a group called the Yakuza and a crazy priest are after his head! Perhaps the only reason to watch this movie is for Dolph Lundgren as the priest. While his screentime is very limited, he's a very memorable part in an otherwise forgettable movie. As far as cyberpunk goes, \\"Johnny Mnemonic\\" could work if there was more action. That's not to say it doesn't work; this movie is very watchable. But it drags a little, especially at the beginning and the action is not very exciting. As a ... B-movie, this film is not that bad.

Not only is the acting, plot, dialogue, and directing terrible - but in the end the whole world is run by a FREAKIN DOLPHIN. A big plastic looking fake dolphin. I want my money back.

The dark, oppresive atmosphere of William Gibson's future comes across rather well only to be spoiled by blunt and unimaginative acting. The special effect sequences suffer the same fate and come across more like a poor advertisement for the land of tomorrow than an accurate depiction of Gibson's view of the Internet of the future.

This film has an interesting setting and background, taking place in the future where a disease is wiping out the population and one man holds the cure downloaded in his mind. However, the film fails to realize just how cool of a premise it could be and we are thrust into a laughable story with corny dialogue and bad acting. Dolph Lundgren makes a fool of himself as a mercenary priest out to kill main-character Johnny. The action in this movie fails to generate anything exciting and the script fails to give us characters to care for. The movie is watchable for the most part, but it lacks drive and flow.

If you are into something mellow, by all means lay on your couch and chill to this album. I wish \\"Hello, I love you\\" could have been twice as long. It is a great song, but very short.

As compared to what came before, Waiting for the Sun is muddy sounding and unimaginative. Really, the only decent songs are \\"Hello, I Love You\\" and \\"Love Street\\". But even these are average. The most interesting song is \\"Not to Touch the Earth\\" which was taken from a longer song cycle called The Celebration of the Lizard. For some reason only one song of this cycle was recorded on this cd. It can be found in its entirety on The Doors In Concert double cd set which I highly recommend. The inclusion of a studio recording of this work would have pushed the bad songs off and Waiting would have been if not good, then a really good cd.

And you won't beat the price anywhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Basic 4 Head VCR","review":"This is a very basic no-frills VCR but it plays pictures back very good. At this price you can't beat it. If you have old tapes that were recorded in the LP (4-hour mode) you will find that all RCA VCRs play tapes back recorded at this speed better than any other manufacturers' units. RCA was the last manufacturer to offer LP recording capability before all manufacturers discontinued to offer it. RCA remembers and at a good price."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Japanese cookbook!","review":"I'm very passionate about Japanese cooking and have many cookbooks. This is the best, it does not only give you all the classic recipes from sushi to terriyaki and tempura, but the book also contains a lot of healthy excellent dishes.The background of the ingredients and the recipes the author gives is so interesting you keep on reading. Unfortunately there are few pictures but that should not keep you from buying this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"great fun","review":"I'm hardly an authority about japanese cooking, but I love this book.it contains tons of recipes and a lot of background information about ingredients, cutting and cooking techniques, and meal planning. the recipes are easy to follow and Booth adds plenty of information about ingredient selection and preparation, plus cultural background and personal anecdotes. this book does what a good cookbook should. it doesn't just talk about food, but introduces you to another culture and its way of life.my only complaint is that I wish the book had more pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Gem of a Book","review":"Author Shirley Booth is a good writer. Initially I borrowed this book from the library, but after I read it for a few minutes I realized what a little gem I had in my hand. I just had to buy it! I am enjoying learning about Japanese food and its origins, and I have had fun making some of the recipes. Good work, Shirley Booth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"its worth the high price tag","review":"Its worth the high price just for the opportunity to repeatedly blow your brains out at high volume to the title track \\"scorching beauty\\" this song is as energized as \\"da vida\\" and is INTENSE! KILLER jam ..the rest of the CD has its ups and downs but the song scorhing beauty will blow you away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious","review":"Opinions are like noses, everybody has one. In my opinion this album is worth about 12 cents tops. If you are expecting this to sound like the wonderful Metamorphosis or In A Gadda Da Vida you will be sorely disappointed. This sounds like some desperate, shrieking garage band. Go to youtube and listen to some of this dreck before you spend you hard-earned money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Common Business Sense, Southern Style","review":"Much like the author, I have all of the standard business and management books in my collection. The Simple Truth summarizes the relevant principles of them all in a concise and well-organized fashion. It is very easy to read and provides some excellent food for thought (pardon the pun). I'm in the IT business and I find the Simple Truth is just as applicable for technology as it is for hospitality. This book is now the most referenced title in my collection. Great job Alex!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best from Reznor in a long time.","review":"What happens when Reznor starts reading Chomsky? Year Zero. An apt artistic expression of apathy in politics and the decay of American society through it's acceptance of the decay of rights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad NIN","review":"Having all of his previous studio releases, and having seen him live in concert twice, this one feels like the leftover stuff that didn't make it on With Teeth, its just not worthy of his previous work. It not intriguing or moving, its just annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing industrial sound","review":"I didn't start listening to NIN until With Teeth, but then got their other albums after that because I liked them so much. After listening to Year Zero, I can understand what people mean by a \\"return to their old sound\\" - I loved With Teeth, but Year Zero has the electronica in it that I think With Teeth didn't have as much (comparatively, of course).Simply a beautiful album, and the backstories that you can look for in each one just sweeten the deal. My favorite ones are the kind of Indian-synth sound of \\"Good Soldier\\" and the practically demonic sounding anthem of \\"God Given\\".I'm looking forward to Trent's next brainchild already. I hope he keeps up with this vein, but in my opinion, everything he's put out has been great, just great in different ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emotionless","review":"The problem with never studying any of the instruments you're mimiking on processors is the resemblance here on this album. Everything is pushed together, almost to an irritating cyclicing, over-dramatization. Music needs emotion in order to do anything at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD just plain SUCKS","review":"I awaited this with great anticipation, and to say I was disappointed is quite the understatement. In an attempt to support the whole futuristic theme, track after track is laden with seemingly endless electronic robotic noises - making every song sound exactly the same. The whole concept album thing is not revolutionary in the least, and the fact that every song hacks on the government isn't neat or cool or clever or demonstrative of any type of deep thinking. It's riding what the band thinks will be a profitable wave like many, many others before them. How about something positive? Of course not, positive things don't sell. How about at least something original with even a small degree of genuine musicality?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Memorable","review":"I was not impressed at all by this album. The songs sounded too much the same. No stand out songs that I would really care to hear again. Im not a HUGE fan, but if I was I could still be objective. The songs are heavy on sound effects, beeps, scratches, etc.. and way too lite on creativity and melody. Most people like NIN because they are able to make industrial music more than just industrial music. They give it dynamics that others can't. They have always taken it to the next level. To me, this album sounds like it could have been made by anybody. Nothing was memorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"big let down","review":"First of all, I'm a huge fan of trent, I think he's a huge talent, but this album simply blows. All the songs sound the same, lyrics are pretty dumb and lifeless, and it overall sounds rushed and sloppy. the fact that he's writing about politics makes me cringe.listening to this makes me realize why it takes trent 4 years to make an album. if it takes 4 years to make another great album then do it. With Teeth was wonderful, what the hell was this?skip this one and listen to The Downward Spiral, Pretty Hate Machine, The Fragile, With Teeth, or any other NIN album other than this stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happend?","review":"I can't believe this is a NIN album. I ended up liking one song off the whole album. I had high hopes for this album but maybe Trent should have chosen a different route. The overall base of the album is kind of silly in my opinion. I ended up throwing the album after listening to it. I have no idea where it is and don't even care. I hope this isn't what the future has in store for us with other albums, because that is what looks bleak."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dastardly Mistake? Right?","review":"I'm going to make this short, and true to the point in context. This album, is a flunk. Trent Reznor's tribute to himself on his own album. I have never heard the combination of I and God in the same sentence on any other album than a Creed multi-platinum hit.... and that is not a complementation to him at all. The lyrics of this album are at an all time dull low. About the only thing salvageable from this album has to be the instrumentals. If they kicked Reznor out of this CD, then it would be quite a piece, but yet he sing on...and on....and on. 2/5 because I appreciate ONLY the instrumentals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trent Reznor's opus","review":"This is the master's best album yet. A concept album with an end-times theme predicting America's fate using its current state of affairs for reference. Trent Reznor has stepped outside of himself this time and written about the human race as a whole instead of just his personal predicament. This CD is worth a listen even if you were never a Nine Inch Nails fan before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Certainly, a NIN album","review":"Trent did it again. This concept album is excellent. The Alternative Reality Game (ARG) that preceded its release was also excellent. The political background of a post-apocalyptical not-so-far future, every song telling a piece of the story, that completes the information given by the ARG. It will blow your mindAlso, the CD is thermosensitive. It changes from black to white, revealling some codes that also are into the ARG."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Change from most of Trent's creations","review":"Trent has changed his style just enough for Year Zero to be slightly techno - but still quite impressive! I always love at least three tracks on each CD (sometimes more), though Year Zero has six that I play continuously. Also great for cardio workouts :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Year Zero is a masterpiece. Be sure to listen to it at least a few times through with headphones to really hear it. )"},{"rating":"1","title":"shame on TRENT.","review":"trent is NOT what he used to be.it's a new sound. a different sound. sounds like some dude who just got garageband and found the distort button.... and i hate to say that about trent because \\"the fragile\\" and \\"downward spiral\\" sit at the #1 and #2 spots on my all time list. he's a music genius, but YZ certainly is not.i wonder why it's so popular, and that could be attributed to his clever marketing campaign... maybe the music is a little more poppy or mainstream... maybe the slough of super fans will go out and buy it, like it, talk it up regardless of it's music prestige simply because its a nails album and it must be liked.i personally thought this album sucked and was by far his worst... 3 decent tracks at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've tried to like this album, but ...","review":"NIN has been a staple in my music library since the release of \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\". His music, beats and lyrics are phenomenal, usually.I have found 3 songs that I can stand to listen to in this album. Most tracks appear to be poorly mixed or have very annoying samples played over them.\\"Year Zero\\" seems more like a first album than an 8th album. His music definitely took a step backwards in this case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Year Zero","review":"Genius. Amazing. Brilliant. I love it. I am a huge fan of NIN and although this album has a different style it's still great. If you are expecting it to be like the fragile you may have to give a few listens before you like it. Keep up the awesome work Trent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really shows how lacking With Teeth was....","review":"I loved Beside You In Time, as some of the songs off With Teeth are alot better when played live...but I have to say this album is a true return to form for Trent Reznor....deftly combines everything he has touched upon in the past (Hard industrial guitars a la Broken, the darkness of the downward spiral, and the soundscapes of the Fragile) and created a true masterpiece. The CD art and thermal layering on the CD itself are worthy of a NIN release(unlike the simple design of With Teeth). The themes are engaging and interesting and startlingly relevant in the world we live in today. I am anxiously awaiting the North American tour!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One more great CD in my collection","review":"It's very rare that a CD nowadays gets me excited, but NIN has done the job with Year Zero. I've listened to it several times, and I still hear something different each time. It's got Quality and Quantity both musically and lyrically. Trent Reznor has a way of matching his words with his music, so you can really feel what the message is. I strongly recommend this CD and I guarantee it will spend a long time in your CD player before you even get the urge to find something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I used to be pretty into Nine Inch Nails about 15 years ago. I've got to say though, that this album is pretty much a disaster for me. I don't want to listen. The only song worth repeated screening is Survivalism.I haven't decided yet if that's because I've grown out of the genre or because Trent Reznor is getting worse at making music. I am not a music fanatic but I know what I enjoy. Year Zero is not what I enjoy. It's too far from music and too close to pure cacophony."},{"rating":"1","title":"98% chimp","review":"As a consumer and a long time listener of NIN, I'm quite embarrassed that I purchased this swill in trust (previously unheard). This cd sounds as though Trent thinly scraped his barrel of noise scraps and taped them together with lyrics of generic propaganda. Compared to Trents' previous work and potential, this cd pales as a cosmic gag reel. The final blow was to charge $17, which is also my shame, as I actually paid it. In keeping with his 'message', the artist is not exempt from playing his audience for the approvingly blind, deaf and gullible monkeys we are."},{"rating":"1","title":"The song on the radio is IT","review":"The only good thing about this CD is the song they play on the radio. Too bad, really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lifeless NIN","review":"This album just sucks. It is terrible. It has absolultey no life. Reznor used to be able to strike an emotion just through the music. Not on this album. He needs to get back to hating himself and not the world. And he needs his old band back. Charlie and Danny were the ones that made Nine Inch Nails - Nine Inch Nails. Stay away from this album. Stick with The Downward Sprial. Reznor's last good album."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolute garbage","review":"There are no melodies or solid guitar riffs in any of the songs on this album. Heaviness is not to be found either - everything is a soft drone of mostly random noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please reinvent yourself","review":"Dear Trent: I appreciate your interest in the current state of our political system. I'm angry, too. But honestly, the current political atmosphere offers nothing for us to sink our teeth into. I wish it weren't so, but there it is. I know you can feel it. We all feel it. Whatever is happening out there, it drains us of our ideals and saps our strength. This means we must look elsewhere for sustenance. If you stick with political lyrics, even your diehard fans will fall away. I don't want you to disappear. Musically, you pack as much power as ever. Please find a way to connect with us again. Give us something to escape into.With that said, I can't get enough of the MUSIC on this album. Vessel contains one of the best instrumentals you've created in years. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"I'm sorry but this album is no creative masterpiece. Compared to most of the crap that comes out these days it is OK at best. To put this album up there with Pretty Hate Machine, Broken, The Fragile and The Downward Spiral... HELL NO. With Teeth sucked especially the singles off of that album. This album IS better than With Teeth, but that is about all it has going for it. I guess if you were 8 years old in 1994 you might think that these albums are great, but the Nine Inch Nails glory days are over. It's almost as if he is afraid to make loud abrasive music again. If he put as much energy and thought into the music of this album as he did in the concept of it, it might be good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced coaster of audio prozac","review":"Ive been a NineInchNails fan since i bought Pretty Hate Machine in 89. This is NOT a good album. at best, it's background music for when you are doing something else. there is nothing about it that will stick in your head after you turn it off other than how poor it really was. The whole album sounds like a collection of crappy b-sides that didn't make the last album. I wont try and convince myself to like it like some others seem to have done. that this could be rated higher than \\"With teeth\\" makes me think the rating system is useless. Save your money and if you are a fan save yourself the dissapointment you will feel after having heard it.Those of you giving it 4-5 stars need to really ask yourselves: would you rate it that high if it was put out by someone you don't like or are you just saying it's great because it says nin on the front?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Since Downward Spiral","review":"This is the best album I've heard in a long time. The musicianship on this disk is fantastic. The production is fantastic. I've spent hours listening to it with headphones, trying to figure out what he's doing and there are so many subtle layers that I just come away with more questions. Not only does it sound great, but the songs are great as well.This is my favorite NIN album since The Downward Spiral. I've liked them all, but this one is special."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've heard it before when it was better","review":"This cd takes the worst parts of The Fragile and the worst parts of Pretty Hate Machine and combines them to create a mediocre concept album. Now I'm no Nine Inch Nails basher, but this cd doesn't have much going for it. The concept is alright, but the music doesn't stand out or provide enough oomph to make the cd enjoyable. The Fragile was filled with tracks that had no lyrics and no real concept, but they were broken up with great tracks like We're In This Together Now and Starf***er. This cd takes that idea, with an entirely different concept, and doesn't deliver on anything memorable both musically or lyrically. NIN's last two albums, With Teeth and Year Zero, show Trent Reznor treading water. It seems as if he has become a parody of himself. This cd isn't horrible, but it is not even close to being as good as The Downward Spiral or The Fragile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre by NIN standards","review":"At some point, every industrial band makes a concept album about a bleak vision of the future. So I expected something brilliant, or at least interesting from Trent Reznor. This is neither brilliant, nor interesting, nor even thought-provoking. If this is Trent's vision of the future, the future sounds like 1990. There are a few decent tracks on here, to be fair, but if you know and love NIN's earlier work, this is pretty tame stuff by comparison. I've listened to it several times now, and it's NOT getting more interesting with repeated plays. Worst of all, it really doesn't have even one standout track that sticks in your head afterwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than With Teeth and The Fragile.","review":"This is the best NIN since The Downward Spiral. The dark, in your face themes of TDS are not evident any more, but this cd has lots of variety in song types. Some are more like metal, others are heavy with synth beats and are groove-driven, still others showcase the softer side of Trent Reznor. All in all, this was what I was looking for from NIN for quite some time. I'm glad that the next one should be out sometime next year too. 4.5/5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"I believe.","review":"If I had time I would write more; instead, I offer this -- listen to \\"Vessel.\\" It doesn't matter if you're here accidentally while seeking Avril; doesn't matter if you love NIN or you've lost faith; doesn't matter if you spell your name President Capital G.Hear \\"Vessel\\" and let everything you thought you understood about music be cast to rubble by the stark new reality this one track calls forth.Then listen to the other 15 tracks. They are Vessel's shrapnel.Thank you, TR.TMan"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this if you thought \\"with teeth\\" was horrible.","review":"I was completely disgusted with the prior album \\"with teeth.\\" I thought it was lacking creativity and any form of intensity that NIN has always brought for me.Now, I'm proud to say that this is absolutely my favorite album from Reznor...ever! Every song has bite to it. For example, just when you think a song climaxed, a screeching futuristic guitar solo from hell chops everything up, there were times when I would just skip back over that part just to hear it again. Many other bands will soon follow little bits of evolution that are placed throughout this album.Thus, if you're looking for something FRESH out there, and 1,000 times better than \\"with teeth,\\" pick this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight through excellent","review":"This album is great begining to end. Each song is nice and flows perfectly. I really enjoyed it. Its an album where you should listen to it shraight through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice return to form","review":"I bought Pretty Hate Machine when it came out and I allways felt that at least for the power of his singing, Trent Resnor never quite a chieved anything as good. Nopw I know that some of the later albums are harder buut soemthing was lacking. Here, he has managed to combine the harder sound with his previous pop edge. Indeed, besides being quite heavy on distortion and noise, there are actually even some tunes! It starts off brilliantly with the instrumental tour de force HYPERPOWER! It is clearly better than his previous efforts and is really recommended. On the other hand if you take heavy industrial techno, it follows a model and does sometimes lack in originality. A group such as Numb did this way before the first NIN album, but...It is still great for those who like this kind of stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"YEAR ZERO!!!","review":"YEAR ZERO could very well be Trent Reznor's best album of all time, HOWEVER, Pretty Hate Machine, Downward Spiral, and The Fragile are too classic of albums to say Year Zero is better right now, BUT 10 years from now YEAR ZERO may end up being Reznor's best!! By the way i love 'With Teeth' i think its very different from any other Reznor album. Year Zero has so much depth and creativity, im so surprised how good it came out!! OUTSTANDING WORK TRENT!! can we expect another new album 2 years from now????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, empty...","review":"I've never been a fan of NIN, and this album just raises my dislike for Trent. This album is boring, repetitive, empty, and musically lacking.Trent should stop focusing on a fictional message and start focusing on making good music with depth and originality. Repeated distortions and one-note synth presses aren't going to cut it for me. In order for Trent to get my attention, he's going to have to pull something really, really great out of his hat for me for his next album.For now, I find NIN still repetitive and uninteresting. Not impressed at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"I usually LOVE NiN....","review":"I got the new cd and tried to introduce NIN to my girlfriend, but what came out was far worse than I could have imagined. There are a couple quality songs on the album, but ALL of them are ruined by ridiculously high-pitched beats or abrupt, annoying sound effects that really didn't need to be in the song at all. As hard as it was, I listened to the entire cd.Sure enough, I take the cd out and put in \\"With Teeth\\" and \\"Downward Spiral\\" and my girlfriend goes \\"Oh yeah, now THIS is good!\\"I didn't even care if my gf liked it or not, I was just shocked that a NIN cd could make my ears bleed like that... I've been listening to their stuff (all of it) for 10+ years now, if you are unsure just download a song or two or borrow someone else's cd, listen for yourself before you pay for this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal!","review":"Trent has definitely done it again with this concept album for the end of civilization. Overall, the album is as intellectually stimulating as it is musically stimulating. The jacket itself is rather gorgeous, the lyrics are hard-hitting, and the music is rough and raw. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another very good album","review":"Nine inch nails have awesome albums as this one. The production is for another time excellent and you can hear industrial music with the correct depth in sound. The tracks gives you a cool <> feeling. This album reminds me The fragile a little bit. The vocals are really great (I love the tone , pitch and the color of his voice) . If you are familiar with Nine inch nails you will probably like this album . Its not a masterpiece but a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but Different","review":"i will admit i was dissapointed with this at first, but it grew on me. i am one insane NIN fan. i have been trying to collect everything by them!but anyway this album is OK for the most part. different but still good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transcendent album","review":"No question Trent is a genius, and Year Zero puts him right back where he belongs- At the top of his Genre.It truly seems that he has grown past the almost monotonous dark anxiety quality of song and lyrics that haunt his imitators and had him previously sounding like a parody of himself as on \\"With Teeth\\" and instead transcended to a higher, more universal plateau with Year Zero.It might be a negative to his following to say he's grown up, but...Yet the music has never been more intriguing and elevates him to the top of Industrial once again.Year Zero, to me, is his masterpiece. It kicks, it screams, it shows Trent is back in form and better than he has ever been.One of the best albums this year, by far."},{"rating":"2","title":"great music","review":"As usual Trent turns out a great peice of work. Enjoyed every minute and can't wait till they start touring in the US again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something?","review":"I've listened to this quite a few times & it just isnt all that good. I dont understand all the 5 star ratings. The production value is fantastic as to be expected from Trent, except theres not much here that hasnt been done before & done better. This would make a great EP but as a full-length album its boring. How Trent sells so many records is beyond my comprehension. The concept for the album is awesome I just wish there was good music to back it up. I appreciate With Teeth alot more now(not that good an album but I was never bored)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Let it begin with Trent Renzor!","review":"A masterpiece in the making....a revolution in music. Its simple beats contast with some complex guitar movements, brings back old school into 21st century music. With some music nowadays, sounding repeative and boring. Here comes a new sound from Trent Renzor!The first song \\"Hyperpower!\\" just brings you into his visionary world of 2022, emotions high, marching of troops, the world now in complete control of the goverment. Freedoms lost and now hope gone.\\"God Given\\" a favorite of mine, because of its funky beats, then retro turns your attention to religion.\\"I would never tell you anything that wasn't absolutely true that hadn't come right from his mouth and he wants me to tell you.\\"This record has to be Trent Renzors best by far!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album, some nice change ups.","review":"Trent reznor is on the ball these last couple of years, releasing with teeth and now Year Zero, both solid works. It continues much of the same progression and style of music he has had recently, with some good change ups from a harder sound/rock driven music to a more toned down, lyrically driven music as well. I am starting to warm up to his newer material, but Still find myself going back to the classics, Pretty hate machine, Broken, and the downward spiral. Worth picking up, some solid material that really is a blend of all of his years work."},{"rating":"2","title":"not as relentless as some of his earlier work, but good","review":"This album finds NIN more introspective and pointed...gone are the songs that seem to just lash out, even the anger is tempered. With Teeth fits my mode more, as the songs themselves are well constructed but don't always stick in my mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trent, what's up??","review":"I'm a huge NIN fan. I've got tremendous respect for Trent but...this record sounds like he fired his crew and threw his quality standards out the window. Either he's trying to get out of a record contract or he's desperate for money. So Sad..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trent Reznor makes me cry","review":"I am a huge NIN fan but this album is probably the most horrid thing I have ever heard. After listening to this CD for the first time my ears began to bleed and I cried for hours after hearing the horrid sounds. This album is as big of a let down as Tool's 10,000 days album. I would suggest avoiding this Album like the plague. Like I said am a huge fan of NIN... or was. If they release crap like this I have a feeling there fan base will completely die. The 5 star reviews you have seen for this album are the extremely hardcore fan base that would give 5 stars to an Album with Trent Reznor talking to a finacial consultain for 53 minutes about the money he just robbed from his fans for buying this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"unlistenable","review":"First off let me say I love nine inch nails, the downward spiral, pretty hate machine, the fragile, and with teeth are all incredible albums....\\"year zero\\" however, is one of the worst albums i've heard in the last decade. It seemed like the album just kept getting worse as it went along....I can honestly say i liked absolutely 0 songs on this album. And honestly, i don't understand how anyone could truly enjoy this garbage. It's beyond terrible.....words can't express exactly how bad i think this album is. It's really no surprise to this fan though....As far as i'm concerned Reznor has completely sold out....just look at the man now....what ever happened to the trent who wore surgical gloves on stage? Now he's like a bodybuilder and he shaved his head. Don't get me wrong, i'm glad he's happy now but he should really just retire because if this what the future of NIN holds i'm not too excited............."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone give this guy a drink","review":"Oh my goodness......the slow and steady march into the world of annoying, pseudo-deep thinker, wanna be cutting edge again - aging rock and roller continues on.......this time it's really bad.

I hear he's doing a duet with that guy from Nickleback..... a cover of a Fall Out Boy Song. Awesome. Way to go Reznor, you're so deep I can't even understand.

I'm not sure what the goal was, but they did not bring their best to this album. I guess it was hard given that previous albums have just been so great, but this was a let down. No flash, and no feeling. Where's the apathy? It's not all bad, but set your expectation down a notch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album from start to finish","review":"This may be, dare I say, almost as good as Downward Spiral. I'd prefer more soundscape, less vocals, but that's just my taste. The album still rocks after many plays -- should hold up well through time."},{"rating":"2","title":"another great record from NIN","review":"NIN has always something to say with their new recordings.This record is not Pretty hate machine or the downward spiral but is the return of NIN's more electronic way, with slow, hypnotic and noisy songs with the incredible voice of Trent Reznor making it more enjoyable"},{"rating":"2","title":"More from the master","review":"As many have said before, this album is Trent's return to what he does best. It's one of, if not the best album NIN has put out. Ever. It's a strange mix of \\"musical noise\\" and angst driven lyrics. It's so stunning it completely blows my mind.It's vastly different than With Teeth to many's delight. I enjoyed With Teeth because it was a masterpiece in it's own right, but it doesn't hold a candle to Year Zero.I'm a little worried about Trent's next album. How can he top Year Zero? We'll just have to see how things unfold, but until then, grab your copy of Year Zero to sate your NIN appetite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I'm diggin' Nine Inch Nails's latest release. It's original, it's fresh, and it ROCKS!Take a listen- you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, but different","review":"This is not the same as NIN's other music.

This octopus has held up and she loves it. She tore off the little tentacles quickly but the rest is still great.

However, when I bought a replacement on Amazon a couple of weeks ago, it didn't last more than a day before my golden retriever, a sporting dog with a gentle bite, separated part of the bottom of the toy. I ordered another replacement last week on Amazon. My dog had it for less than 20 minutes before the same exact thing happened: part of the bottom-side of the toy perforated. To the manufacturer: did you change the materials, the design or the manufacturing process? This item is much less durable than the version we got a couple of years ago. And the version you are selling now is unacceptable in terms of durability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately...","review":"Though this JW pet toy is fairing marginally better than the poor chicken (only the tentacles have been chewed off, which was expected, & the squeaker ripped out), it still is not worth the money that I paid for it.

Be advised that this is another toy that will fall victim if you've got a strong-jawed pet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fetch toy; not so much a chew toy","review":"I purchased this for my 50lb pit bull mix. I mainly use this toy to play fetch. It's great for this activity because it bounces awkwardly and unpredictably, making for a more interesting game of fetch than a traditional tennis ball.However! If your dog likes to chew, they will have the little nubbly legs off this octopus in no time. My dog just chewed them off and made a mess -- the pieces were small and I don't think they'd cause harm had he swallowed them. Other than that, this toy has held up well. It's his favorite toy, but like all toys, he's never unsupervised with it, so I haven't given him the opportunity to rip it apart. I don't doubt his ability to, either.Pros: Wobbly shape makes it fun for fetching, dog loves the squeakerCons: Pieces easily chewed off and the toy itself can ultimately can be destroyed if your dog is motivated enough! If your dog ingests large pieces, I can see the potential for an intestinal blockage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Squeaky Octopus","review":"This is the only squeaky toy my dog could not destroy in 2 minutes.

I didn't send it back for a replacement even though I bought two of them. Blue runs around they yard with them but it it's not the same.

Without her favourite toy she was ready to slit her doggy wrists. We now have two identical replacements from Amazon.The toy is durable and fun. It is a soft, rubbery toy with a built in squeaker. Unlike the Cuz products we have owned the squeaker is firmly placed and continues to squeak after years of use. My dog likes to lay and chew this for hours yet it is without punctures or tears.The shape lends itself to unpredictable bounces when thrown and the soft, rubbery texture makes it quite bouncy (not as bouncy as the hard rubber Kong toys). The shape also gives it a natural handle for easy hand throwing.I can find nothing bad to say about this product.

Grimms was a comedy rock outfit led by Neil Innes (Bonzo Dog Band/Monty Python) and Liverpool poet Roger McGough, and also features Mike McGear (Paul McCartney's brother, from The Scaffold), Andy Roberts, Adrian Henri, and others.This CD combines two different Grimms LPs, \\"Grimms\\" and \\"Rockin' Duck,\\" and both mix comic songs with comedy bits and brief humorous poetic readings. This is classic British humor of the day and is essential for fans of the Bonzo Dog Band, Monty Python, the Liverpool poetry scene of the 60s, or 60s/70s British humor in general.

However, there should be a warning on the cover explaining that John Martyn has unfathomably re-recorded some of his classic songs, and in the process murdered them slowly. What possessed him to do it? True, his voice has changed over the decades, and perhaps he thought he could bring something new to the old favourites.

The second set of batteries only lasted a week. It looks like it's cheaper to order batteries from the company.

These batteries are not easy to find and getting the ordering information before we even opened the book made us feel like this was another money-making venture for BE. Anyway, my daughter played with it for 10 minutes and that was it (she can sit with her books for much longer). Even after a few weeks, she shows only meager interest in this book.

It's missing some crucial remixes though like the Happy remix, The Pledge remix as well as a few others. There are also four new songs (to my knowledge). Of these new songs the best one by far is Still On It ( the single) feat. Paul Wall & Method Man. That song is a banger with both Paul Wall & Method Man gettin busy on the mic. The other three songs are cool as well but I seem to be feeling Found It In You the most.

Lids that I have seen at the pet store and elsewhere fit the smaller cans, but not the slightly larger ones. Anyway, these Petmate lids did fit both size 3 oz. cans, along with two sizes of larger cans. HOWEVER, the plastic is so stiff and hard that they are next to impossible to snap on and off. They were basically unusable and I threw them away.I also ordered another brand of lids (OurPets) for small cans and they are a dream. They fit both sizes of small cans and are soft and easy to put on and take off.

Thirds sounds as if everybody involved was just tired and confused, trying to find a new musical direction (knowing that Joe was soon departing). Nevertheless, there are two classic tunes on this album Walk Away and Midnight Man that are what I call the swan songs of what was once a great power trio. However, only two good songs on an album cannot carry the rest of the mediocre to bad tunes presented here. Unfortunately, the James Gang just went down hill from here and the rest of their recordings are simply a waist of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I GIVE THIRDS 2","review":"I bought this cd for one song, \\"Walk Away\\" which was one of their best known songs. I was hoping since that particular song was so good that maybe the album would harbor a few more gems. There wasn't. The rest of the album is like an anti-climax. I would suggest a greatest hits instead. If you see this cd just turn your pretty head and walk away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yadig?","review":"The James Gang's third and most sumptuous album. Yes, its true - if you want guitar histrionics you're better off with \\"Yer Album\\". If you want psychedelia, check out sophomore effort \\"James Gang Rides Again\\". But if you want simple, classic '70s West Coast rock - this is the place to come. As well as rock staple \\"Walk Away\\" you also get funky instrumental \\"Yadig?\\", Joe Walsh's beautiful \\"It's All The Same\\", and the Eagles-esque \\"Midnight Man\\". But the band save the best for last. The final two songs on this album, \\"White Man / Black Man\\" and \\"Live My Life Again\\" are epic flights of fancy: very much of their time, yet somehow timeless. This is an album every fan of Seventies rock really should own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great old rock and roll!!!","review":"I love this album!!! Have loved it from the first time I heard it many years ago. Many of the songs just keep getting better every time I hear them, like \\"Midnight Man\\" and \\"Live my Life Again\\".

I'm so glad now I did. The reason I loved The Ground She Walks Upon was because Niall was allowed a bit of vulnerability which I find appealing so I wasn't sure if I could like Vashon. BUT Vashon's personality is totally acceptable given his tough background. He sees falling in love as a weakness he cannot afford...something that will negatively impact his sharpness of instinct...a life or death issue in his circumstances. I feel, frankly, that this story has a much more intense emotional undertow *sigh* than, say, When Angels Fall, which I liked but felt was a bit light on real emotional depth\\\\interplay between our hero & heroine.

I have been watching NASCAR since 1984 and I know personally this is not what was televised. Even some of the newer races look this bad.

The audio is crisp and clear and easily understood in a car environment. The stories are entertaining.

In the frustrating, insulting and dangerous days that follow, each learns the startling truth about the man they're goint to lynch.His Brother's Debt - Cassidy can draw faster than a snake can strike. So why is he afraid to leave the back country?

A brilliant compilation from a talent that is still fresh and original after 20 years as the new track (Resurrection) shows. The only criticism which stops me giving this collection five stars is the strange inclusion of a clunker like 'Suburban Dream' at the expense of the infinitely better 'Was Ezo'. Now what does it take to get a record company to release their back-catalogue?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collection","review":"I've been looking for a good compilation album of Martha and the Muffins.

Hope so!"},{"rating":"1","title":"INDIANA WITH A RUSSIAN ACCENT","review":"K-19 THE WIDOWMAKER is certainly earnest in its attempts to show the loyalties and courage of a motley crew of Russian submariners, but director Kathryn Bigelow (Near Dark)shows no imagination in her limp and flaccid handling of this adventure tale. Since it's obvious the characters are Russian, why didn't she just let them speak in English instead of having reputable actors embarrass themselves with horrible accents. Peter Saarsgard as the noble Nuclear Reactor dude is the only performer who brings life to his role. Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson are abysmally ineffective, and by the time the movie reaches its overly sentimental ending, I was glad my investment of time in this klunker was over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been a lot better","review":"1. I'm not an expert into the actual historical events that took place but via the various reviews on this movie, this movie is another in a long list of Hollywood movies in which the \\"based on a true story\\" idea is extended beyond reality.2. With the above being said, I can accept the semi-fictional account and just sit down for a good movie, but the problem with this film is that it's just not that good of a movie in the first place. Ultimately, Harrison Ford's portrayal of the Capt of the sub is just lousy and unconvincing.3. Anyway, it's decent enough to rent, but nothing beyond that. For a good sub movie that actually written and acted well--> go for the classic Hunt for Red Oct."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like military suspence movies but","review":"This movie was painful to watch, most of the actore in the movie have the cheesest fake russian accents I've ever heard. Harison Ford fades from cheesey fake Russian accent to cheesey fake Irish accent to his normal accent and it .... Liam Neison fades from I don't know what to his normal accent. These are both actors I had respect for and that respect has been weekened because of watching this movie, they should be ashamed. However I gave this movie 2 stars because I really do like the story despite it being far fetched in some casees, but far fetched is Hollywoods specialty."},{"rating":"1","title":"failed to capture the theme","review":"the film is not good. the director says in dvd feature, that the sacrifice of the sailors who prevented the meltdown of nuclear reactor were the heros and saved actually the world. so, we don't see it in the movie. it's very boring with all kinds of already seen images and sequences of sub-marine-movies. harrison ford produced and has a leading role. this is another factor which destroyed the oppurtunity to tell a good story. the story becomes to an ego fight between the captains (actors) etc. Yes he needs a comeback and has to destroy the true theme of the story. sacrifice of the regular men who died. we don't see no real emphasis with those men, where they came from, their women and how was the life under this system. too much? no they just shouldn't focused on every screw of the sub but on the life of those sailors."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 thing kept me from watching this","review":"why would russians speak in broken english?????that alone ruined it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ambitious but lacking in depth","review":"The film is based on a story that actually took place during the Cold War in the early 1960s. The acting is uneven, and we don't fully understand how the situation in the submarine could possibly have an impact on Soviet-USA relations. We wonder what motivates these soviet soldiers to risk death, they just do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very compelling film.","review":"When I first saw this movie I really didn't know what to think. Its portrayal of nuclear disaster aboard a ship is sometimes a little too real, and this movie is definitely one you do not watch for \\"enjoyment.\\" That being said, I love this movie, and here's why.1. It's a true story.2. It is extremely patriotic--even if it's patriotism displayed by the \\"wrong\\" country. How can you not appreciate service men suffering and sacrificing for their country?This was well-produced in my opinion, and I feel the only flaw was Harrison Ford playing a Russian. If you get upset very easily do not watch this film as parts are very disturbing, but I appreciate this film very much for the values it displays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rip-roaring intensity from start to finish","review":"Based on a true story of a Russian nuclear submarine with a reactor that has run a-muck, and threatens a tentative peace between Russia and the United States during the cold war. Ford and Neeson are up in arms over how to handle the crisis when the reactor cracks and starts to leak its deadly radiation. It is one roller coaster ride after another. The hardest part is in the knowing that these men lived this insanity, and in the glory of their undertakings were forced to keep silent about it for some 30 years.This was a well done movie, an edge of your seater from start to finish. You can't go wrong with this as a pick for a night out...enjoy. Kelsana 8/6/02"},{"rating":"1","title":"Relentless music and depressing","review":"Other reviewers have mostly covered it.

What were they expecting? Anything put out by Hollywood is meant to entertain, not educate. Movies such as this are BASED on true events, not actual retellings of the events.I thought both Harrison Form and Liam Neeson did outstanding acting jobs, and yes they even made believable Russians.I also thought the film did a good job of portraying the Russian military as human beings, rather than just the enemies we learned to despise during the Cold War.So see this movie and leave all expectations of a history lesson at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good! Watch it!!!","review":"This is very fine \\"sub\\" movie. First of all, it does not have the costumary \\"USA x Russia\\" battle, or \\"German x Allies\\" batlle. It's a crew fighting to survie, about two captains with different ideas. Just it.Liam Neeson steals the show here, and it was delightful to see Harrison Ford play a cold-war era Russian! Delightful!I enjoyed the pace of the movie, the recreation of the sub and the extras. I just did not like when Neeson'c character Polentin suddenly changes his views about Ford's character in the middle of a mutiny, a mutiny mainly inducted by him when confronting a lot of the captain's orders in front of everyone of the crew! Weird change of events!Other than this, it's a highly, I repeat, highly enjoyable cold war drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tense drama","review":"A Russian submarine captain, played by Liam Neeson, is replaced in his command by Harrison Ford. Neeson is expected to stay on the ship under Ford and he shows his noble side by doing so without complaint. Ford's mission is to take the sub to an Arctic region in order to test a missile which is onboard. He shows a reckless disregard for his crew by pushing his new submarine to the limits and threatening everyone's lives. When a leak in the sub causes radiation to spread, Ford refuses to save his men by appealing to Americans nearby. A mutiny is threatened and the two leaders come face to face in a confrontation. Both Ford and Neeson are very good in their roles and they provide a lot of tension with their opposite views of how the ship should be run. My main objection to the film is the sudden and unexplained change of heart that Ford's character goes through, but all in all, this is a good film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland and uninteresting...","review":"This film has its moments, but they are few and far between. I've rarely seen a film that is this lifeless from beginning to end. I actually admire Hollywood for making a picture based on the true story of a Russian submarine because, after all, heroism knows no single nationality. However, the film does stereotype Russians more than a little, and, worse, it never really hits its stride as a movie. It drags on and on, and by the time the end credits roll, there's really nothing to talk about. It's already forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Advertised Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1","review":"Came Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1 and that is the only thing about this movie that is right.

I actually spent money on seeing it in the theater. Quite a mistake as hours later I felt like I was robbed not only of my money but my time. This movie claims to be based on real events but is so obviously (and overly) dramatized that I felt sad for the Russians who were ACTUALLY involved with the incident. Poor acting (Harrison Ford at his lowest), poor directing (this movie DRAGS), and a poor script (blatantly Hollywood).

I have seen the story done before in a drama documentary starring Rutger Hauer, which was shorter and therefore more compelling. Since the stricken Russian sub is offered help by the Americans, we are never really convinced that the fate of the world is in the balance, so we are left with a lot of coming and going into a room that makes you vomit. Nowadays, also known as a cinema. Either way, not terribly dramatically compelling.Ford's fee was apparently $25m plus a cut of the profits, before you think he may have been doing this film for art's sake.

(Notice I did not say \\"comrads.\\")3.It is a story of government cover-up to save face at the cost of human lives and careers.4.As a submarine movie it compares nicely to Das Boot, Run Silent...,Enemy Below, etc.5.It is a great companion to Hurt Locker, Kathryn Bigelow's other war themed film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Das Boot is better","review":"As it stands, this movie is not bad.But, if you have ever watched Das Boot, you will probably agree that this movie is two things:1. Inferior2. The same thing, more or less.I mean, there are differences, mainly the sub here is nuclear (or nucular in Bush-speak), but there are several things that make this movie inferior:* it came after Das Boot, reflecting Hollywood's lack of creativity.* Harrison Ford's Russian accent [is bad].* The language is English, whereas my fav. Das Boot release is the original German with subtitles.* The main actors don't even look Russian for the most part.There were certain scenes where I noticed a very obvious duplication of Das Boot scenes.

Anyone that has a sister...good relationship or bad...will relate to this book/movie. I loved the book so much and couldn't wait to watch the movie.The characters were cast VERY well. It is difficult to get used to Cameron Diaz playing a dispicable character, though, when you are used to her being so fun-loving and everyone's favorite friend. She plays the part of Maggie Feller to perfection. Toni Collette does a great job and being the responsible older sister, Rose, who feels responsibility to care for her loser sister - even when she hates her the most.

You'll laugh and cry and to me, that makes for the perfect chick flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Sisters Everywhere","review":"Usually I read a book before seeing the film adapation, and especially given how much I've loved Jennifer Weiner's books, it was unusual that I saw this film prior to reading the novel. I think this film adapation was a lovely tribute to the original novel, filled with emotion, pathos, and triumph.The relationships here are portrayed in a nuanced and emotive manner, and although you can readily see each character's flaws, you root for each of them, hoping for the inevitable moment where the various tangents intersect.So many times a \\"heart flick\\" like this one winds up disappointing, but no so with IN HER SHOES. I teared up, felt angry, and generally ran the full emotional range while watching this movie (several times, I will add.)If you're looking for a movie that does more than entertain--one that makes you examine your own familial relationships--this one is the ticket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon has as \\"Kids & Family\\" recommendation?!?","review":"Amazon placed this on my recommendations list as \\"Kids & Family\\".

They spill their guts in scenes that are suppose to be sad, but laced with humor. Everyone realizes they should treat each other better and learn to understand each other.The middle is the only part where a couple of interesting things happened - the beginning and ending where completely awful. And there was really no resolution to the title \\"In Her Shoes\\" other than Cameron Diaz's character taking and using (and ruining) various pairs of shoes (yawn).

My daughter and I then went to see this movie and we were both disappointed. The first problem is the casting - it is just impossible to see Cameron Diaz and Toni Collette as sisters. Collette never had a smile on her face and it was impossible to believe that she was an intelligent lawyer. Diaz's acting ranges from a to b (as Dorothy Parker once said about Katherine Hepburn). Shirley MacLaine was also woefully miscast as the grandmother; she barely phoned in her performance and never took on the role. This viewer was always conscious of watching Shirley MacLaine. There was also a problem with Curtis Hanson as the director; the movie just did not have the light touch of a romantic comedy and it dragged. On the other hand, Mark Feuerstein was one bright spot, even if there was no chemistry on screen between him and Toni Collette.I'd suggest saving your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Film!","review":"At first the film didn't appeal to me much, but it turned out to be a wonderfully uplifting film with a terrific script, incredibly great acting (not only the leads), and with plenty of humor and love.

These are certainly attractive, and I like being able to microwave things without worrying about the container being too shallow. However, I'm having problems with the lip area of the mugs chipping. Two mugs, bought at different times, have both chipped, making them unusable. They were not abused in any way, and other CorningWare I own hasn't chipped even though I use the pieces frequently.

I bought a set for my home as well as the office. It will hold an entire can of soup although some of the larger cans, Chucnky, Select Harvest, etc... fill it to the brim.

When properly dimmed down I get way more. The battery life is still not great I would rather have bought with a bigger battery - but you have to buy it in addition to the unit and it ain't cheap.Not quite ideal for the car but it is a big enough screen that it can be used there. Great for planes and hotel rooms.

Tried it out right away and, sure enough, the sound was just no good. But, I did take a recommendation from a review and buy a Boostaroo (which I will use on the unit I did buy). Bought an Audiovox 1680 (tried the Audiovox D1700 but it skipped terribly) and I LOVE IT. It's a little heavier, but really works well.

The recording of CDs from 3 sources (the built-in changer, a mega-disc changer connected via optical cable, and the receiver) has worked quite well. Non-digital sources require you to babysit the operation to insert track markers (left to it's own discretion, it treats bits of silence on a track as a new track).

Several sex scenes were very explicit. In addition, the language included much bad language. The plot included assassinations, and the movie was bloody. Some of what was in the movie is too explicit to explain in this post. I love the actors and actresses in the movie, and I was very disappointed to find them in such a movie.

We look down our noses in arrogance and disdain for those not as committed 'to the work' as us.We're a sad little lot of legalists, all the while thinking we're keeping the 'standards of the faith' and being the 'pillars of the local church' but in reality receiving the just and stinging rebukes of the Lord Jesus Christ.

The error, common to most of this genre, is the flawed protestant theology leading to the very hypocrisy and self-righteousness which concerns the author. The fault lies in equating the terms conversion and salvation. Conversion being repentance and faith, the start of the journey....salvation-the hope and end of the journey....IF you pick up your cross daily, IF you obey all I have commanded and IF you endure to the end. The book is riddled with the common errors of the faith alone, once saved always saved crowd. It's called the sin of presumption and is the same old lie from the garden....you shall be as gods. He is right to be appalled at this imitation christianity. He recommends C.S. Lewis' Surprised by Joy. I recommend to him and his readers, Patrick Madrid's Surprised by Truth. A good start for the journey home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pharisees Beware!","review":"Layer by layer, this book strips away everything that makes one a \\"good\\" Pharisee: self-sufficiency, self-righteousness, hypocrisy, legalism, perfectionism, a judgmental spirit, arrogance, selfishness, pride. What remains in the end is the true spirit of Christian life and service: utter dependence on God's grace, deep and ongoing gratitude for His salvation, renewed respect and compassion for other struggling souls, humility, honesty, faithfulness, generosity, patience, joy, amazement. This book is excellently written and shows profound insight into the parables and other teachings of Jesus, many of which were directed at the Pharisees of His day. Everyone who reads this book will be fundamentally better for it--even the truly recalcitrant Pharisee who may start the book thinking it was written about someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"headache","review":"THe book was okay.

I know we are all sinful at the heart and are capable of even murder but some the chapters seemed to create areas of guilt that mature Christian should have overcome through Christ. Even though I know that we all sin and need to be examining ourselves daily for cleansing I did not feel cleansed after reading the book. It felt like a pharisee rebuking another pharisee.

John Fischer has given true insight about the grace of God. I am divorced and was really down about my situation and even in going to the church for help I was faced with very judgemental people who saw divorce as an unpardonable sin. God has used this book as a tool for me to know that I am still loved by God regardless to my divorce. We judge others and in that we see a little pharisee in ourselves.

I was confident in my purchase because the item is listed as sold by Amazon rather than some eBayer or no-name merchant.You can buy the exact item Amazon shipped to me much cheaper on eBay, and if you want to spend this amount of money on an \\"official\\" purchase the Nokia adapter looks much more compact (which is saying something, since it isn't compact at all).

Unfortunately, he had the head off of the t-rex within 10 minutes, and he swallowed it before i could get it away from him. From now on, it's all about durability, and nothing about looks.

This wasn't the case she had the head and tail chewed off before I knew it. In less than an hour it was missing both ends. I'll have to go back to the wishbone because she takes longer to wear those down. Keep in mine my dog is a very strong chewer she can destroy things quickly so if your dog isn't a hard core chewer it might be ok for you but otherwise try something without small ends.EDIT- Just got worse had to call the vet due to bloody stool and this is the only thing I can think of that caused it"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT durable","review":"I received this product in the mail yesterday.

We go through 2-3 sets per year and have have no problems, with the exception of an occasion bit of gum bleeding (very slight) when someone gets a bit carried away. Well, that, and having to confiscate the toys when we're trying to sleep, since their chewing enjoyment is a bit too noisy for nighttime!After months of use, I take the worn down toys away and replace them, and I regularly check to make sure there are no sharp edges or larger parts that look as if they could break off and be ingested.If you have a dog that loves chewing, I've say to give them a try, at first with supervision.

There are very few toys on the market that they cannot destroy in minutes. These chew toys are one of the rare exceptions and best of all, my dogs go bonkers when they get these toys. Hours and hours of chewing enjoyment and they pick the dinosaur shaped bones over their regular Nylabones every time! I think they especially love the unique shape and the bumps must be soothing on their gums.The only downside is that little tiny particles can break off - so you'll want to watch for that. I suspect this wouldn't happen if you have a mild/medium strength chewer. However, if you do have destructo-chewers like mine, know that the little specks that break off are no where big enough to be choking hazards - they just make a little mess on the carpet after a hour chewing session - so that means vaccumming after they're done chewing and removing the toy after it becomes unrecognizable as a dinosaur."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dinosaur extict within 20 minutes of chewing","review":"I was so excited for this product, it's the first toy I've bought my new rescue dog.

I would echo that. Mr White tells the familiar story of Nelson at the battles of St Vincent and Teneriffe in a new and exciting way that really brings the events to life. It is always easy to visualize the scene he is describing and his abundant use of pictures (many of them never published before) helps with this.He has also done a lot of scholarly research into original sources, many of them only recently discoved. As a result, his view of the battles, and Nelson's role in them, is very different to the traditional one in the older books. He makes it easy for the reader to follow all these new insights, by explaining them in special 'boxes;' so as not to interrupt the flow of the main narrative.This is without doubt one of those books that changes our idea of great events. If you are at all interested in Nelson, get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A GOOD PRIMER","review":"I agree with the post that said this book is an excellent primer. It's not for experts but for beginners. From a beginners standpoint it covers covered calls, protective puts and a combination of the two, which is called a collar. These are conservative strategies, as I understand it. Mr. Jardine also tells the reader to trade with the trend, that is, use bearish strategies when the market is trending down and bullish strategies when the market is trending up, and gives examples. The book is a quick read and I recommend it highly for those who have never gone through a bear market and want to know what they can do in one."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONLY 38 MINUTES OF MUSIC!","review":"This CD is a rip off.

She does a good job of building a world, but it's not one either I or the characters want to live in.One of the odd things I noticed is that while the narrator is supposed to be a guy, his personality feels like that of a woman. This may be one of the hazards of writing in the first person where the character is the opposite gender, but it was a bit off putting.The idea is ok, if dystopian, but in the end, I felt that the main insight came early in the book, where the narrator observes that it is strange that so many people want to be someone they aren't, when the main asset they have to offer is their own uniqueness.

There is no suspense, more of just an explanation of how the would-be dancer Alis has mysteriously appeared in some of the old movies. It's a required SF explanation (so that the story can be called SF) but really it's hard to be curious when you just want the thing to end, please -- by this point in the story you know it's not going to get any more interesting.It seems that Willis put all her energy into coming up with the SF premise and watching old movies so she could insert little descriptions of scenes into the text.

As a sop to ecumenism, the Rabbi of Baltimore is allowed the moral high ground and Lee is cast in the role of the pious gentleman (the greatest of southern myths).The excercise in alternate history is a peculiar one: there has to be a semblence of credibility in the plot line; otherwise, it's just random musings with no real consraints until the internal logic of history is abandoned.

Not only a womens persepctive but a women who was a muse to him. This book does not paint a glorified Picture of him...or a star struck tragic picture of him. It is about Susan and her plight with life, and him being a big part of it. The book is extremely poetic, very dark, sad, melancholy...but above all MOVING. I read it in less than 24 hours. I applaud Jennifer Clement"},{"rating":"2","title":"s.","review":"This is a surprisingly light read of a heavy topic that gives a unique, inside view of life with the artist, Jean-Michael Basquiat. It is an even better book when read as a success story of a woman who ultimately left an unhealthy relationship. Since it covers her childhood as well as her relationship with Basquiat and her attempts to move away from him you get a little bit of insight as to why she would be attracted to this type of person. When you finish the book you will have learned about the sensationalized artist but you will also learn a story about a very successful woman who wasn't quite as interesting to the public only because she was strong and overcame adversity instead of wallowing in it. She is probably not as famous as her ex-beau because she didn't die of an overdose, but such is our culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for anyone interested in Basquiat/his work/his life","review":"After viewing the Jean-Michel Basquiat's documentary film, The Radiant Child and viewing the motion picture based on his life, Basquiat I became instantly drawn to Basquiat's life story and his work. I bought this book for more insight on the man and the artist. This book is a quick read and it really does a great job in providing snapshots into the life of one of the greatest, most innovative visual artists to ever live. Whether you are conducting research on Basquiat or just want to know more about him, this book is a must-read.

I will probably send it back since for this should certainly not happen after a few pulls from the sheath."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great survival knife","review":"I've used it for few months now and must say that am quite impressed with it. I got it after my Bear Grylls Gerber knife fell apart late last year after 2 days of use.Decided that I need a solid knife more than i need the fancy bells and whistles Bear's knife came with.This one is slightly larger, heavier and most importantly better built.Mine came with sheath that included 2 leg straps. I'm mostly using just one of them to secure the knife to my leg and belt but it's nice to have versatility of attaching it with 2 straps in other places.The knife is nice and sharp and retains edge very well.Couple minor drawbacks:- it's really hard to pull out of the sheath- the handle started peeling right on the bottom where it meets the edge, don't know if it's from rubbing on the sheath when inserting/pulling out or whether I actually scuffed it somewhere while chopping a branch or something.Overall I'm very satisfied and hope this knife will serve me for years without any major problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice knife","review":"The handle is very comfortable, the look of the blade is fantastic.

This knife was just what I was looking for. ~5' blade, near full tang (slight separation from the end cap and the tang if I understand correctly), general purpose blade design, descent weight, and good sheath. The handle provides a good grip with bare hands and with gloves. The sheath is somewhat more than my civilian needs require, but the multiple carry options are nice, as is the built in sharpener. The knife arrived on the stated date, in good, new, condition. Lastly, but not least (American made was a prime purchase criteria), this knife is made in the USA (Portland OR).

The blade is shorter than I'd expected, but it's probably exactly what the specs say. My fault for not paying attention when I picked it, I guess. Also, the blade isn't as sharp as sharp as some of my other Gerber knives. I can probably sharpen it and get it up to par, but that's not what I'd expect from a Gerber. The knife has a good weight to it, the pommel is solid and the sheath is good. The straps on the sheath appear to be durable. All in all, this is a good knife.

I did little more than hack at some branches, but when I returned home I noticed the plastic bit on the handle that immediately surrounds the base of the blade (the tang)was pulling apart. Needless to say, I was very disappointed after spending quite some time researching knives and reading positive reviews about this one. I emailed pictures to Gerber and they were polite, but offered no solutions.

It's a monster. There is nothing about it that I'd add or change.The sheath is great. The knife snaps in and stays put. You pull it out with your hand on the knife and using your thumb on the sheath. The sheath has some nylon snap locks that can wrap around the knife handle to help on it in. I cut these off as I don't think they are needed.The sheath also has numerous ways that it can be mounted. It's a drop-leg sheath with a single strap wrapping around your thigh and the top connected to your belt. Or you can use the two included straps, no belt needed, to strap it to your thigh.

I will take this on every backpacking trek from now on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Survival Knife","review":"This is the densest knife I have ever held; by that I mean it is very heavy duty. The serrated blade cuts through anything, including tree branches. The grip is comfortable, and has the attachment points for using it as a spear head. The sheath is also heavy duty and has an integrated sharpener. However, the sharpener is not inside the sheath. It is built in so that it sharpens with the knife perpendicular to the sheath. This is actually a good thing because the sharpener is exposed and can be used to sharpen other knives. My only small gripe is with the sheath \\"leg-drop\\" set up. It rides very high, pretty much at belt height, rather than down on your thigh in true \\"drop leg\\" fashion. But that can be easily fixed with a little stitch removal and re-stitching to your liking. Overall, great knife and survival tool! A must have for outdoors-men or prepper's. Definitely an essential item to have in a bug out or hunting kit."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Quality","review":"I was looking for a great military style knife and every bit of research I did pointed right at the Gerber LMF II. Because I collect many different styles of knives, this fits the bill if you want a military/ survival type knife that will hold up to anything you put it through. Arrived very sharp, although I ran it through my ceramic sharpener and could now easily shave with it if so desired. And apparently, everyone that buys this knife feels the same as I do. Great product, extremely well made and high-tech looking. You can't go wrong with this Gerber.You may want to check your local and state laws prior to ordering this knife. It's not a pocket knife and could potentially get you into hot water in the wrong situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged Product","review":"The knife arrived in a ripped Gerber box.

The Ion is a discussion between Socrates and Ion, an interpreter of Homer, who tries to argue that he knows everything in Homer's work, but Socrates shows that only experts know about what Homer writes. The Meno is a discussion about virtue, and whether it is teachable. This dialogue contains Plato's famous doctrine of recollection and Meno's Paradox about knowledge. Socrates ends by arguing that virtue is not teachable, but instead is a divine gift.

Webster's breathy and smoldering embrace on all these cuts leaves the listener yearning for more (and a bottle of Merlot)!

Do not try this program unless you can commit as it will kick your butt. My father and I did the program together at the age of 53 he was able to lose 25lbs himself. I will say, completing this program at the same time someone else did in my house really helped keep me motivated. I can't wait to start P90X."},{"rating":"2","title":"Power 90","review":"This is an excellent product.

Excellent product, I brought it in the hopes of losing weight and gaining muscle and so far it is working spectacularly. And for anyone wondering if they're \\"too fat to be able to do this,\\" I was 6 foot tall when I started and 273 pounds!

It requires you to stick with it for 90 days straight."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO boring-- for the very beginner","review":"This product really coddles you from beginning to end with the types of foods you should eat to the sequencing of videos. The problem is, if you have had any moderate exercise in your recent past, this will likely be too easy. I've only done it for a month now, and haven't gained anything significant beyond what swimming was giving me before. I would recommend this only to someone who needs to be on a regimen that will get them off the sofa and inform them of what to eat. It's really for someone who is totally out of shape and can tolerate monotony. I immediately had to start with the second 3-4 discs because the 1-2 were beyond easy. I get bored easily if I'm not challenged, and after a month, this is no longer challenging to me at all. I'm going to start P90x this week, so hopefully that builds the muscle I'm looking to build."},{"rating":"2","title":"good program to ease into shape","review":"This is a good started program to get into (or back into) shape. I'm not exactly a couch potato, but quit running several years ago after knee surgery. Since I've taken years to get out of shape, I'm not going to make it a race to get back into shape.I appreciate Tony's no pain approach. No pain no gain is fine if you're in Marine boot camp or doing MMA training, but I'm just looking to get into good (not great) shape.I didn't give it five stars because they should have included something for proper form for the yoga poses and some of the other moves and exercises. You wouldn't want to see it every workout, but it would help make the workouts effective.The exercise part of the program is not a weight loss program. If you want to lose weight, get ready to be hungry. One good doughnut will blow all the calories you burn in one of these workouts. The dietary guides will help, but are pretty slim."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works if you do","review":"My cousin's husband lost 20 lbs doing this and didn't change his diet, just put in the time.

Simple as that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to get back into things!","review":"I was looking to jump-start myself back into a workout program and decided to go with Power 90 as the P90x seemed a little advanced. I am in my late 20's and started at 5'11/238lbs. After 2 months I have seen drastic results. I am 210lbs. now and hope to get under 200 by the end of the last 30 days (before moving onto P90x). I think the program is great and starts out hard but you easily adjust after a bunch of workouts. Combined with a restrictive diet and protein shakes, I found this program to work quite well. I can't wait for the P90x. Only negatives were that realistically this is only 2 different workouts the entire way... it becomes quite monotonous and boring. Tony's cheesy humor is funny the first 30 days, but gets real old. Terrible music in background and visual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Terribly boring.

Originally I was going to do P90X, but after doing a little research I realized I was way too heavy and out of shape. Power90 starts out gradually, and allows you to progress at your own rate. During the workouts, Tony repeatedly encourages you to push it, but also tells you to do what you can and realize that you are making progress and burning calories by doing what you can. After a month and a half I started mixing in level 3-4 a couple times a week, and at 2 months switched totally to level 3-4. Overall, if you want to get in shape but recognize that you need to start out gradually, this is the way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works very well as long as you are commited!!","review":"I bought Power 90 many years ago and never committed finishing it.

I have lost 30 lbs, 6 inches off my waist, and 5 inches of my chest. I feel better than I have felt in a long time. In order for this product to work you have to make the commitment. You have to eat well and you have to stick to the workout plan. The hardest part about it is not the workout, it's ignoring the voice in your head telling you that you \\"don't have time to do it\\" or you are \\"too tired to do it.\\" If you can get past the mental barrier, then you will keep coming back for more.

This Christmas special was done in a cozy atmosphere which was presumably a living room with fireplace, tree and goodies placed everywhere. At the same time there were tables outside of that living room area where people sat to listen, almost a cabaret like setting. While I find nothing at all wrong with Clay's voice and selections of Christmas material to sing for us, I find it odd that so little interaction went on between his \\"guests\\" and himself! His musical guests, on the other hand were warm and friendly but it was Clay's show and I believe it was his responsibility, in such an intimate setting to interact just a bit more with his living room kids and adult listeners at the tables. He also needs a dresser...badly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and Classy!","review":"I love this DVD and looked forward to playing it again this Christmas season.

I love that he was able to include so many other singers in this project--not just famous ones like Barry, but groups of singers as well. This is sure to become a classic. I hope that he will soon do a new Christmas special. He has changed his look so much that it would be fun to see him in a new special with his updated look.

It is concise and well organized, she thinks like I do! A pleasure to read--not just for the information contained but because of the easy and logical format.There is little else I can add about the book itself that has not been previously covered by other reviewers. It starts in 1492 and covers systematically each of Jerusalem's Big Three, devoting a section to each, up to current date. It makes so much sense to write it that way! It was an easy read for me because of this format and the best book I read of 2002! I have given this book away 4 times already and am on my 5th copy now."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars, except...","review":"it gets a little bogged down at the beginning. Otherwise, it seems to be historically accurate, and it is one of those books that stimulates thought.This is my 3rd Karen Armstrong book to read. From a satisfied reader, it sure won't be my last.Kudos, Karen."},{"rating":"1","title":"An atheist perspective of religion","review":"Religion has more often than not been taken for personal vengeance in human history, although evaluating religion in the same light is an error in itself. This book is another attempt at presenting the atheist's view (who, by surprise, had been a nun in her past life) mingled with a dismal portrayal of history of humanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Confusing and Demoralizing Treatise on the Major Religions","review":"This book screams out, \\"Please God, I want to believe in you but I can't!\\" Armstrong was a nun and now doesn't know whether she is Buddhist or Muslim, so how can she be objective about the major religions? She is writes with very little insight. She presents an evasive, ambiguous, and confusing theory of religion. Not a good book to read if you are interested in any of the religions she discusses, or should I say dissects and rips apart?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very confused lady","review":"The one star is for two reasons:First, I can't give anything lower, which is stupid.Second, she is an easy read.That being said, Ms. Armstrong is one confused, mixed up, and disillusioned lady. It seems that all, or most of her books end up discrediting all religions but Islam. Maybe she gets a \\"kick\\" out of suicide bombers, terrorists, killers, torturers, beheaders, and the like. Even though she dislikes most fundamentalists, she loves the Muslims. What a convoluted brain! Or maybe she has her head so buried where the sun doesn't shine that she actually doesn't know what's going on in the world today."},{"rating":"1","title":"More pop social psychology babble","review":"Let's see, \\"modernization\\" and \\"Western consumerism\\" (whatever that is) were long thought to be the bane of religion. Now, we have a study that says these same things are what spur religious zeal. Hmmmm...the ultimate tautology it seems. Basically \\"consumerism\\" can explain anything you want it to. Maybe the author should tell us what a \\"non-consumer\\" culture looks like (do people just produce stuff and leave it sit around). This book is methodologically unsound and theoretically vacuous. Try again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous book - everyone should read it","review":"Karen Armstrong really tells you things you should know about the way religion has developed over the millenia. From my viewpoint, this is the most informative she has written yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Informative and Enlightening","review":"Even though there are some pages that are difficult to comprehend, anyone with a high school diploma should be able to understand it fairly well. I learned much about the main fundamental religions, especially Jewish and Muslim viewpoints. I would recommend this to all literate people and perhaps that would help them understand how to achieve peace on this planet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Study","review":"This book is a \\"best choice\\" for studying the history of fundamentalism. Karen Armstrong is a very thorough historian. She does her homework. And she writes well enough for the ordinary student to be able to understand. In other words, she doesn't try to be too \\"intellectual\\". I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good, objective read","review":"I've been impressed with Karen Armstrong's work since I read \\"A History of God.\\" \\"The Battle for God\\" and \\"A History of God\\" both provided well written, objective insight into the foundations of the three major monotheistic groups and the influence they have had on the modern world. I particularly liked reading \\"The Battle for God\\" since the attacks on September 11th. I think this is an important learning tool for both theists and non-theists in understanding the history and motives of fundamentalist groups. Karen Armstrong's writing style is fluid and robust, as well as easy and enjoyable to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enlightening Read - Totally Engaging","review":"Having not as yet completed the book, I felt compelled for the first time to comment on this informative book. Karen Armstrong has elogantly and clearly detailed the evolution of the three monotheothic religions by masterfully integrating politics, history, technology (modernity) and its impact on logos and mythos in the search for rationalization. This is a must read by all who wish to understand more clearly fundamentalism as we have come to know it today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another worthy read by Karen Armstrong","review":"I will give a disclaimer here. I am an big fan of Karen Armstrong. I have read most of her books. They have been part of my own spiritual and intellectual journey for many years. Many are often recommended to my friends, family and colleagues.Ms. Armstrong does an excellent job of laying out the struggles, challenges, and issues related to the ongoing \\"Battle for God\\". In an age fraught with fundamentalism, fanaticism and religious bigotry this book brings some perspective to understanding the issues. One hopes that the \\"combatants in this battle\\" will take time to read this very good book and reflect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Overview of the battle for the name of God","review":"This is an easy to read view of the way we are all battling to say that we represent the true God.

In light of the current events worldwide, this book does an excellent job of explaining the religious agitation both here and abroad."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Key to Understanding Our Modern World","review":"Armstrong's insights in this book offer us so many glimpses into the motivations behind our modern actions. Another truly magnificent book in Armstrong's truly magnificent oeuvre. She treats the fundamentalists with a wonderful mixture of respect, sympathy and criticism. In all, a great read, highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor and biased historical narration","review":"The book should be retitled \\"The battle of Allah\\" . The biased and non-scholar review of this supposed historical book reflects the writer's own frustrating experience with nunhood. I might understand her frustration, but she must study thoroughly the principles and teachings of different religions, assess and compare prior to writing books that express her conclusion. Ms Armstrong, I urge you to study islam thoroughly including Koran, Mohammed biography and his sayings that all regulate muslim's life. I assure you that you'll find \\"surprises\\" . God bless"},{"rating":"1","title":"very faulty","review":"Fundamentaly flawed. Armstrong makes demonstrably false claims such as \\"Paul never claimed Christ was God\\" or \\"Christ never said he was God\\". She never deals with the fact the Christ claimed--humbly--to both \\"Son of God\\" AND \\"Son of Man\\" (Daniel),the Messiah. If you read this book, read also the Kreeft and Tacelli's \\"Handbook\\" and other refutations of her historical assertions. And read the Gospels and Paul's letter's (Phil 2:6 for example)carefully seeking truth. Armstrong even goes so far as to say that Christ is an \\"abrasive figure\\" in the Gospels. She attacks Margaret Mary Alacoque (sp) with angry zeal. Then she claims that Paul had no theology, but only an emotional zeal. She really hates Christianity profoundly and irrationally but defends Islam to no end. She seems to have deep wounds from dealings with broken Christians that she brings into her work as a historian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Armstrong is a politically motivated apologist for Islam","review":"Armstrong is a politically motivated apologist for Islam, who does not respect facts if they get in the way of her personal crusade to insist that Islamic fundamentalists are neither fanatical nor dangerous. She and her publishers and promoters - the politically correct -- have done us all a great disservice by pushing her books to a prominence they do not merit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of adequate references and a slanted prespective","review":"Ruth Armstrong's entry regarding the Babi Religion and the Baha'i Faith is grossly inaccurate. In one passage she claims that the Bab stated in the Bayan that there is no life after death. Yet, she never provides a direct quote from the Bayan nor does she reference it. In the Bayan it is clearly stated that the soul ascends to the spiritual realm after death. She only provides one or two references about the Babi Religion and the Baha'i Faith and from that she derives profound conclusions. Speculation is not scholarly and it should never be presented as the truth. I strongly recommend that Karen Armstrong investigate this topic more thoroughly. She just hasn't done her homework and that is irresponsible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"There is no question that fundamentalist religious sensibility has been on the rise in all religions over the last 50 years and, likewise, no doubt that this has been a period of rapid cultural and technological change. Armstrong's book makes no particular contribution, however. It does not reflect any nuanced views even of the historical antecedents of this recent era. It strings conventional and dated scholarly conclusions tediously with a glib assurance. The world, even the world that generates fundamentalists of so many religious varieties, is more complex unfortunately than Armstong's narrative."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong wax","review":"the pot is nice, but i specifically bought this kit because i wanted the hard wax... which it says it comes with... they sent me the \\"original\\" wax, which i can't even use because of skin sensitivity... really annoyed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This book was overall very disappointing. Written in a very chaotic and amateurish manner, the narrative constantly kept striking me as naive and superficial. Add to this the religious ignorance (and intolerance) of the writer and his profound lack of familiarity with non-christian religions and atheism alike, and you get a reading that is anything but inspiring to anybody who can think critically.Although the personal accounts of his experiences under communism and during his escape ring somewhat true to a Bulgarian reader like me, they are not related in a way that could 'save' the book.

If you are hoping to recapture at least some of Crosby and Clooney's collaborative magic from their \\"White Christmas\\" movie days, forget about it.

Norton is a \\"musician's musician,\\" and is by far one of the best living harmonica artists of our day, as well as an innovative songwriter. These albums were unavailable for years...all I had was a bootlegged copy on cassette, which I completely wore out. I am SO delighted to have access to this music again, and on CD! I really enjoy all of Buffalo's songs, but my favorites include \\"Nobody Wants Me,\\" \\"Eighteen Wheels\\" and the infectious \\"Hanging Tree.\\" Norton is also offers some of the most dynamic live performances you will ever see.

The James Gang created an eclectic masterpiece which contained many of the ingredients that Joe Walsh would later contribute to The Eagles sound on \\"Hotel California\\". Here you have the country rock charm of \\"There I Go Again\\" and \\"Garden Gate\\". \\"The Bomber\\" is a fierce rocker that contains at the core a display of slide guitar that will send chills up your spine. Joe Walsh was always one of the best slide players with that unmistakable signature sound and this is a perfect testament to his artistry. \\"Tend My Garden\\" stands out for its delicate melodic beauty and its tender lyrics. It's a memorable moment that Lennon and Mccartney would approve of. Other highlights include the sexy rugged groove of \\"Woman\\" and the manic boogie of \\"Funk 49\\".

Fans of the comics will be let down by the casual treatment of Professor Xavier's death. Fans of the comics will be let down by the casual treatment of rogue taking the cure. Non-comics fans will be like, \\"why the hell does Jean just stand there all the time? Where did all the really important characters from the previous movies go?

The original X-men director went away to do Superman Returns (so he could film an actor who looked like Mr Rieves R.I.P lift things)Whoever the new guy just couldn't seem to create scenes that worked.

I was especially disappointed with the special effects. In this age of technological advance, I would expect the effects to provide a spectacular visual experience, but they did not even come close. Great movies are memorable. Even good ones leave us with a \\"takeaway\\" message. They inspire the audience to move forward and yet to always remember that one line or that one character or that one scene. This movie possesses none of those qualities.

A vital ingredient was missing--a central character whose development was key to the plot. There were a lot of characters but we really didn't spend much time with any one of them.The result was a somewhat flat action film. Yes, there was a struggle that needed to be resolved but it really was not amplified enough. The ongoing metaphor of mutants as the marginalized citizens of our society still worked.

Do yourself a favor and forget this movie ever happened. I gave this movie 1 star because 0 stars wasn't an option. I'd say it was the worst movie ever, but I already gave Matrix Revolutions that distinction, so let's say this is the second worst ever, or the worst movie to end a trilogy after an amazingly good first two films."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather spend the evening with my \\"X\\" girlfriend!","review":"I'm sorry, maybe my expectations were too high-but this movie sucks. Every scene feels chopped, like what we were supposed to see was about to happen, but we never quite got there. The extablished characters do not grow and the plethora of new characters are unnecessary. The beloved \\"fast ball special\\" sequence was lamer than I thought possible. Kelsey Grammar was wasted as Beast, and the power of Phoenix was not used or explained to satisfaction. I liked the first movie, loved the second, and was absolutely heart-broken by this third; more like a train wreck than an adventure film.

Anyway, the film was mostly devoid of any real emotion and the actors seemed to just be there because they had to be. Jean is rarely seen struggling with her Phoenix counterpart.

But theres Spike haired man and tattoed women and wierd haired mutant. The action is great but why, why kill off a main character off screen! The only main character that I felt sorry for was Proffesor X. The only new villains added should have been Juggernaut and Pyro. And Juggernaut is awesome. He brings back memories of the best villain(besides Ian Mckellan)in the X-Men franchise. Yep, its Toad. Overall not much of a story but good action sequences. I was expecting more but when Singer left you knew X-Men wasn't going to be the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"GAD!!!!!","review":"Oh,my god!

I've followed them all my life... some 35 years. I've watched all the different X-men cartoons on TV. That's why I hate to say that I'm horribly dissapointed with this movie. This story completely ignored the cartoon plot or anything I know about Phoenix. They killed 3 of the superheroes, all of who died for no good reason. The movie felt like I was watching friends get murdered. I'm going to watch Xmen I and II and pretend like Xmen 3 was never made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak movie, bad TiVo \\"unbox\\" download","review":"We downloaded this to try out the new \\"Amazon Unbox\\" service for TiVo owners. The 105-minute movie took about 5 hours to download over DSL. The video quality was pretty awful -- any horizontal panning flickered badly, and there was a lot of that here. Relatively still scenes were fine.Other reviewers have explained the movie's faults pretty well. It had the fanciest special effects of any in the series, but little of the charm. Easily my least favorite of the X-Men movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"X-Men The Last Stand Blu-Ray","review":"I had read a lot of different reviews of the Blu-ray disc, some good, some bad. After watching it myself I can say the picture can look grainy at times but it appears to be the way it was originally produced. That aside i would much rather have this movie on blu-ray than DVD. I've seen the DVD version and it is much worse. The grainy texture does not distract from the movie what so ever though."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC MOVIE!","review":"This movie is a slightly more realistic version of the comic books and animated series.This movie is the 3rd of 3 movies and a major event that was hinted at in the first 2 movies finally, all out mutant human war, which is cut short by the X Men.3 major charactors are eliminated in this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"X-Men - The Last Stand (Widescreen Edition)","review":"A good X-Men movie, not as good as the 1st movie, but better than the 2nd movie. The choice of main movie characters has always seemed odd to me, and this continues in Last Stand. At least Rogue plays a very small roll in Last Stand - which is good because she is one of the weakest characters ever!! Overall tho, Last Stand is a fine finish(?) to the X-Men trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty close to perfect","review":"Sequels are rarely as good as the original, but this one comes close. Didn't need some of the language, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Collector's Edition!!!!!","review":"The Collector's Edition was a let down to say the least. All they did was take a regular widescreen X-MEN THE LAST STAND in the regular DVD CASE and put it in some nicer packaging and throw in a COMIC BOOK and charge you about $10.00 DOLLARS MORE. You are better off just getting the regular version and save yourself about $10.00 DOLLARS. I would think if you are putting out a COLLECTOR'S EDITION you would think it would be a 2 DISC SET , especially for the price. I was not Impressed at all!!!!! 1 STAR for a BAD COLLECTOR'S EDITION , 3.5 STARS FOR THE MOVIE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low value product (not a movie review)","review":"Rather than review the movie, which I like quite a bit, I'm reviewing the Collector's Edition package. All the CE includes is a slip box case and a mini-comic book compilation. In the compilation, only one is new, the remainder being old stories. The CE package also includes the standard widescreen package, clamshell case and all. It is EXACTLY the same.Why exactly does one pay for the extra junk? I did because I didn't read the description carefully enough. You shouldn't. Get the standard WS version and save $10. The movie is the same and so is the transfer. Great movie by the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy ending to the X-Men series","review":"Brett Ratner screwed up with this movie. If Bryan Singer had stayed with X-Men instead of moving to the horrible Superman movie, it would have been better. And who gave Ratner the right to bring X-Men to an end. I can say a whole list of things wrong with this movie. First off, Professor Xavier and Cyclops die. That's not supposed to happen. Beast was only in this one, so technically he was only in one X-Men of the whole series even if he is a major character in the X-Men series. All in all, this movie was a complete failure with to much CGI. Don't leave any comic book movies to Brett Ratner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie is great, but don't bother with the Collector's Edition!","review":"As a DVD collector, I was more than willing to fork over the extra ten dollars to pick up the X-Men: The Last Stand Collector's Edition. Unforntunately, I have never been more disappointed.Don't get me wrong, the movie is pretty good, and worth picking up, but the Collector's Edition is definitely not worth the money. The only difference between it and the regular widescreen version is a fancy box and a mini-comic book. No extras, no special features disc, nothing. Really, who would pay ten bucks for a comic book? Don't let the pretty packaging fool you; the regular version has all the same material on it as the collector disc. I hope this will help someone save a little money."},{"rating":"1","title":"X MEN: THE LAST DUD","review":"X Men 3What can I say, the negative reviews were right. I really wanted to like this movie. The first and second were excellent. But much like Blade Trinity, this was a huge let down. Where to begin?1. The movie was only about an hour and a half long.2. There were too many characters introduced.3. They were all very generic, only there to service the plot (Multiple man is a perfect example).4. No character development to speak of, even from the returning cast.5. The plot was promising but extremely thin and almost non existent.6. The use (or lack of use, rather) of the Phoenix was embarrassing.7. The action was a bit over the top.8. \\"The Last Stand\\" was very disappointing, if you catch my double meaning.Why bother going any further, I think I made my point. I just hope Brett \\"Rush Hour\\" Ratner isn't involved in any of the spinoffs. On a good note, I will be buying this when it comes out on DVD, but only to complete the set."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic","review":"X-Men last stand is the best of the X-Men franchise.The storyline and special effects are superb.I can not imagine a reboot can top this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Boring Boring","review":"I loved the first two films, but they blew it big time with this bomb. From cliche lines like \\"What the...?\\" to Halle Berry's consistently wooden performance (the woman might be pretty but she couldn't act her way out of a speeding ticket) this movie might be worth renting, but you probably would never want to see it twice. Worse than bad, it's just strangely boring. Major characters are killed and we just don't care. Blame the director and Hollywood's catering to talentless Halle. I'm hawking my DVD to the second-hand bin first chance I get."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"You have to watch the movie as a story of it's own, I love comic books but, separated it from the stories I have read and the changes I feel worked! I was chewing my finger nails because I knew someone was going to die but didn't know who. I think all 3 stories worked well there was a progression from learning to deal with their abilities to defending humans. I wouldn't mind see a spin off showing where Wolverine and Storm or even Rogue came from (but don't use Halle, she did ok but I think a younger actress with a little accent would be better). They have quite dramatic past if done according to the comics. I hope they do not make any more as I think it should be left alone so spin offs could be made relating to it, I think that would be better.Can someone tell me it there are special features on the Stan Lee Collector Edition?And when is X-men Evolution season 4 coming out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worst of the X-Men movies but still worth a look","review":"I think what Brian Singer did with the first two movies was amazing and when he wasn't on this one I was prepared for disappointment. I went into the movie expecting the worst so was happy when the movie turned out better than I had feared.Jackman is great as Wolverine (again) but most of the other characters are very under-used which is sad since this is probably the last time we will see them for a long time. I also feel that the bastardization of one of the greatest ever comic storylines was a terrible disservice to the X-Man franchise. But, with that said, the story does keep the movie going and kept me interested throughout.As for the Blu-Ray transfer, it is great; a crisp brilliant picture and great soundtrack and extra features make this a disc well worth owning."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Could They????","review":"I can't believe the ego that it must have taken to manipulate the XM universe this way. I can't believe they killed Xavier, Scott (Cyclops), and Jean, nullified the powers of Rogue, Magneto, and Mystique, (none of whom would choose that in the XM universe I know and love), and to not include a character (and a budding romance) for Gambit (with Rogue, of course). Bobby can have Kitty - that was one of the rare scenes I liked. I also liked the Kitty/Juggernaut scene near the end, and it's scenes like that that made me give it even a 2. Lastly, what the heck was wrong with Hugh's hair through most of this movie? It looked terrible - nothing like how good it looked in the previous two movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Of the three, the best","review":"Me and all my friends agree, best one yet. After the action packed message of equality and battle against genocide, you are left excited. My friends hope for yet another sequel, but I have heard the actors conclude the trillogy complete, their contractual obligations complete.I grew up reading comics. Out of all the comic books they have made movies out of, the X-Men holds the most immaginitive, story rich environment for me. Maybe Batman holds a close second. My only critisism would be that developing all the characters in a two hour movie can not be easily done. How do you do justice to the decades of character development covered in the comic book, and complete a story line? Dispite that, they have done a great job in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ratner is a hack.","review":"They took what was potentially a very compelling storyline and then gave it to Brett Ratner. He capitalized off of the popularity of Singer's work on the previous two and then took the story and character development absolutely nowhere. It was a decent watch, though very disappointing, considering what it could have been. Though the previous two weren't classics, they were definitely better done and more interesting than this one ended up being."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stan Lee's endorsement has no value now","review":"This is the worst possible concept that I have encountered in all my years of following the X-Men. I am so disgusted with the directors \\"vision\\" that I can not even embrace the few good aspects that did surface. If the movie had been about topics that were not already defined I would not have been as disappointed but it USED the Pheonix theme but with a totally unacceptable change of story line.Jean Grey became the Pheonix due to alien intervention and challenges. SHE WAS NOT MENTALLY UNBALANCED DUE TO HER POWERS. Also, killing off Xavier after only 3 movies only proves that the director had nothing in mind but making a name for himself because he sure didn't produce a product that X-Men fans can embrace.I can only hope that, as with the Superman movies, the next X-Men movie will carry on as if this one was never made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Collector's Edition Review","review":"This was a waste of money. Unless you really love fancy packaging and simply cannot live without the new comic book by Stan Lee (it's drawn like the originals), then you can go ahead and get this.Most of the deleted scenes will leave you scratching your head. There were a couple that I just don't know how they didn't make the cut. The rest are simply fillers, and I actually felt the money being stolen from me as I was watching them.THE ALTERNATE ENDINGS ARE NOT ENDINGS. They are post credit endings, that would replace or go along with the original. They last just as long. When I heard that this had THREE alternate endings, I couldn't wait to buy it. Man was I dissapointed.I love the movie, but this is just about the most well produced and presented [..] I have seen. Get the regular version, you're not missing anything with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Watch 1 or 2, don't waste your time.

Far superior than \\"The Fantastic 4\\" for example. Perhaps it isn't as good as X - Men 2 but I rate it higher than the first movie and it follows on from X-Men 2 very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great... if you are clueless about the X-men","review":"They've completely ruined the trilogy by making this film. The Phoenix kills 3 of the most important X-men and adds a bunch of fake ones? Great idea. Let's alienate the fan base that made the first two films a hit and go for that Barb Wire demographic. Um, no. Bad idea. They made Juggernaut a mutant and he goes along with the program... have the producers/writers/director ever read an X-men comic? People that have seen the movie that didn't know about the story seemed to enjoy it. I hope this kind of crap doesn't happen to the Spiderman series or the next of the Batman Begins films. Hollywood always seems to ruin what we love... just give them time. The original Batman movie was good... then a few movies later the biggest piece of crap ever made, Batman Forever, arrives. Will you guys ever learn?"},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding me","review":"I am a big fan of the first two X-Men movies so I bought the third one -- was not able to get to the theatre because of illness. I watched the thing one evening and was absolutely stupefied. It was not so much at the bad quality of the script (although it was genuinely awful), but at the fact that an abortion like this could be released without any damage control. I mean, they must have spent millions and millions producing this -- couldn't they have spent a few thousand on a competent script editor who would plug the gaping holes in the story line. (My favorite was when they left the Angel in New York and flew their jet to California, and the Angel shows up in Cali in the next scene to make a diving catch of his dad).All in all, a movie worth watching so you can see how genuinely bad movies can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the extra money!","review":"When I picked this up I did not realize that the only difference that this edition had was the added comic. The comic is a cute concept about Stan Lee meeting X-Men characters, but is not worth the extra money and I doubt that it would ever become a collector's item. I had hoped that there were more extras than that for the added money, but sadly no. So stick with the movie editions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story is good, directing is bad","review":"I love the X-men series and the story and acting in The Last Stand are good. Unfortunately you can really tell that they used a new director. It's too bad because of the three movies this was my least favorite. Not a great way to end things.

While I throughly enjoyed this movie (after the first X-Men movie came out, I pre-judged it thinking it would be horrid, not the case at all) I do think that this movie missed its potential.I liked the addition of all the new characters, but I believe it may have prevented some of the story development. After watching \\"Last Stand\\" I would really like to see a 4th X-Men movie, but believe there will only be spin-off movies (Wolverine, Magneto). Plus some fairly major characters die so I think they'd be forced to do a pre-quel.Anyway, this is a good movie that you should definately see, especially if you saw the first two.

Many of the same guys return for a final fight to preserve mutants from extinction. The addition of the Beast played by Kelsey Grammer was a nice addition as well. The plot moves along nicely and is not overwhelming with action. My biggest complaint was there was not a good villian or foil for Wolverine. In the first movie he had Sabertooth and in the second he had Deathstrike and Mystique. In this one he deals a bit with Juggernaut, but I would have liked to see more Wolverine humor. Regardless, it is well worth seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Teenage Angst","review":"I thought the first two movies in the series were pretty great. Yes we know that most of the mutants start to have problems when their powers manifest around puberty, but most of the tragedy of being a teenager was pushed to the background in favor of the plot and the struggle between Dr. Xavier and Magneto and the philosophies they were trying to instill in their adherents. This last one though, was way too cheesy. Let's put as many special effects in as we can, focus on as much teenage angst as we can, and then have a big fight scene at the end, with Keley Grammar in blue fur. Pass please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sequel","review":"This was an excellent sequel and usually that doesn't happen. The tradition & characters were carried through as a true fan would hope.

Firstly, nothing much happens for 30 minutes, and you get bored waiting for the action to start. The characters are completely obnoxious, and represent the worst of the 80s, so this is 30 long minutes. When people finally start going missing its anything but entertaining. The horror scenes look like high school kids did them. The ending is a big April fools joke, that really caps off this lame effort. Maybe the movie is trying to be clever, or make fun of this silly genre, but it isn't entertaining at all. Although the film is well produced it has little to recommend it.

Better than Total Recall? I don't think so. Maybe I wasn't in the mood, but this movie struck me as old hat. The helicopters and some of the other hardware was neat, but the \\"plot\\" was tired.Arnold is yet another average schmoe, working at an average job (OK, he's a chopper charter pilot) .......... Enter the bad guys, Arnold's family is threatened, and the schmoe is transformed into a super-hero. We've all seen it so many times, it's hard to buy anymore.The only wrinkle is the cloning, so we get TWO aging super heroes instead of just one. I was literally nodding off on the couch during the finale. Unless you are a hard core Arnold junkie, I'd recommend you pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second verse, same as the first","review":"...this movie starts with biblical scripture and blends it with a current event or issue. In this movie, creation is blended with the issues of cloning. This movie gets us to ask ourselves the question of whether it is right or wrong and what other questions must be answered...Unfortunately, this movie seems to be borrowing the basic layout of the previous films and adapting it to the new story-line. As a result, this movie gives you a feeling of deja vu. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh, nice try.","review":"While this film attempts to be thought provoking and surprising, it is really just stupid and predictable. Throughout the whole movie, you can already imagine what is gonna happen in the next 5 minutes, it's that kind of movie. Definetly Arnold's worst, and speaking of Arnold movies, anyone seen Total Recall lately? Recall Corporations? Re-Pet Corporations? Noticing a similarity? There's even more of them, from the opening bedroom scene to the big chase scenes, this is simply a rehash of a much finer work. Instead of informing the viewer about both sides of the cloning debate, this movie takes on the opinion that anyone who wants to clone is an evil megalomaniac out to destroy human kind. I myself am strongly anti-cloning, but since when did other people's opinions become invalid? Think about that when you are hitting the non-helpful button. Try Total Recall instead, or the almighty Terminator, some movies where Arnold doesn't grin every 5 seconds."},{"rating":"1","title":"All the extras ripped out. Basically a standalone movie now","review":"Columbia has just announced a rather surprising downgrade and street date change for the upcoming The 6th Day DVD. Poor Arnie, he just can't get a break lately, can he? Columbia will be dropping \\"The Future is Coming\\" HBO First Look special, plus the 10 featurettes, the 3 storyboard-to-film comparisons and the 2 animatics. The remaining features still on the disc include the isolated music track with composer Trevor Rabin with commentary; the \\"Re-Pet\\" infomercial, talent files, production notes, trailers and TV spots. Columbia is lowering the price of the disc to $24.95, and will be removing the \\"Special Edition\\" banner from all advertising and the packaging. The street date has also been bumped to 3/27."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's nice to see the big man back","review":"First of all, this is NOT Total Recall and strictly speaking it's not better either, but don't let that put you off! Arnie plays his usual good guy (but he's getting slighly better folks!) who plays an old fashoned pilot that fears even cloning pets takes away some of our humanity. He then ends up having to fight for his identity, as usual there are chases, fights and some great special effects. I thought that Arnie checking for wrinkles in the first scene was quite funny, obviously a side joke hinting that he might be getting too old for this s**t. The bottom line is that this is the best Arnie flick for many years and proves that there is plenty of life in the ol' dog yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've been better","review":"Schwarzengegger's return to action didn't fare much better in this clunker about a regular joe named Adam Gibson who co-runs a helicopter business. Gibson learns that he's been cloned and the \\"replacement\\" that is living out his life, means he must be exterminated by a prophetic businessman and his group of dastardly cohorts. This film, while not bad, just seems flat and uninspired. Schwarzenegger's return to action doesn't do much and it seems that the standard action sequences take place with at least one mandatory car chase. The only real amusing scenes involve the continual cloning of the businessman's henchmen, and a scene involving two Arnolds at once, but rather than that, it just seems out of place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps Totall Recall 2 would be more appropriate?","review":"Funny that I didn't see too much about this movie when it came out...I guess the critics were a little finicky that week. Great all around Arnold movie...the plot is believeable and compelling...The acting, on par with what you'd expect of this type of movie...Arnolds one-liners were kept to a bare minimum, the comic relief came from the supporting cast of characters, which at times had me rolling... Action scenes were first rate, and the special effects excellent... Some of the ideas for advancements in that time were very innovative, but had you thinking that they could be just around the corner...Excellent all around action movie that I'd recommend to anyone...not just Arnold fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for DVD owners!!","review":"The 6th day is a good movie. The Acting is typical for the Genre(Big tough guy with emotions about his family)but the special effects in this one raise the level a little for future action movies. 6th day managed to pull off some simply stunning effects. If you are an Arnold fan (and if you are reading this review you most likely are!) then this is a must have on DVD. Not only do you get to see the movie but you get an inside look at how they made the special effects.

Oh, and my dad actually met arnie!Peace"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Idea","review":"Were are the old Arnold's movies like Commando, Predator, and Running Man? This one was annoying. I did not like the story, and I did not like the action. No humor at all. Special effects alone are nothing. What I particularly like is Arnold's humor. Red Heat is a perfect example of what I am talking about. While watching this movie I did not even smile. It left me with a bad feelings. Now, I am going to watch Commando to get my feelings back."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was more like the 7th......","review":"And on the 7th day God rested, right? Well, that's what happened to me while watching this movie. They try to sell you this sfx-crafted, explosion-overloaded, Schwarzanegger-acted,ridiculously-scripted piece of crap like a high quality movie. It's as good as Last Action Hero, if you liked that one, then you'll love this one!!!

The plot has more holes than a swiss cheese, the dialogue seems to have come from other (boring) movies we've all seen before and Arnold is far from at his best. His age is showing, the moves are gone, and we're just left with his acting ability - which says it all. The only remotely interesting character is the bad guy, played by Tony Goldwyn. When he's not on screen you might as well go for that snack or hit the bathroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great in spite of Arnold","review":"Like almost all of his entertaining works, this one is good in spite of Arnold. He is a horrible actor, but as usual a great surrounding cast saves the film. The co-stars are brilliant, the cinematography is first rate and the script is surprisingly good. The theme of the movie works well, and this one is fun to watch more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arnold x 2","review":"Not a masterpiece, but action with Arnold Schwarzenegger is never boring, and in this flick it is two of him.

I can just see the screenwriter coming up with the idea - \\"Hey, cloning is gaining public interest, let's make a cookie cutter sci-fi/thriller about it.

It is noticeably nicer than light from ordinary lightbulbs, it gives things a nice kind of warm glow.

The problem is keeping track of where you are and what positions you've already visited. You can't just randomly twiddle pieces because with 60 moves you'll never get even one piece out.This was fun but somewhat frustrating.

Sartre was a blind, vulgar dunce...a man who endorsed terrorist violence (Fanon; the fashionable murderer Che G.)and pulled a treadbare, shoddily second-rate 'philosophy' over the eyes of intelligent people who should really have known better. A falsely profound, bourgeois Philistine--that's Sartre in a nutshell."},{"rating":"2","title":"The classic--what did you expect?","review":"I just had one comment to make. Several people here have complained about Sartre's verbosity and repetitiveness. Well, Sartre was a French intellectual and ontologist, and a philosophical student of Husserl and Heidegger.

For readers of Hegel, who have problems grasping his perplexing and often counter-intuitive employment of the negative, Sartre offers a perspective of the negative dialectic that seems relatively straight forward.

Sartre intentionally writes in an academic, obscure, constipated way that makes you wonder whether it is due to your limited mental capacity that you do not understand what he is saying, or that he takes so much pride in his superior self that he does not want to be understood by the many. The trick when you read Sartre is to recognize in his writing those parts that correlate with the experience of your own everyday life. Doing so, you will be able to find some practically useful wisdom in Sartre's thinking. After all, every philosophy of life should fundamentally relate with our everyday existence, otherwise it is not philosophy but some sterile theory destined to fall in limbo."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor Has No Clothes","review":"This book is a confused and tangled mass of almost utter nonsense. Take the time to think about what Sartre is \\"saying\\" and see if it makes any sense. I found it to be utterly incoherent and unilluminating.

This edition is terrible. It omits some of the central passages of this classic. For instance, the beautiful section on the 'Patterns of Bad Faith' are deleted. If you carefully read the inside of the jacket, it does say it is an abridged edition. That would not be bad if they deleted unimportant sections. Instead the publisher deleted key sections which they reprinted in their edition of Essays in Existentialism. So you are forced to buy two of their books.If you want a copy of Being and Nothingness, get the Washington Square Press edition or the Routledge edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review from a layman","review":"If you are just getting your feet wet in ontology then this book will be very challenging and often frustrating. As you slowly become accustomed to the terminology and basic ontological concepts, the book becomes more and more readable and enjoyable. If you ever felt you were all alone in your existential dilemmas, then this book will provide great comfort. Everything is here in this book if you are willing to take the time. Contrary to an earlier review, this book makes perfect sence and every concept is backed up with logical analysis. Sartre is very good about providing clear and concise examples to all of his concepts. This is not a philosphical treatise on ethics so it is hard to understand why an earlier review labeled it as dogmatic (that person must be referring to a different work by Sartre). A dogma based on nothingness is hardly any kind of dogma."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's the translation of Hazel E. Barnes, but has a lot of typos","review":"It is good to have a Kindle version of a good philosophical work, but it is rendered useless when you find a lot of typos. Some of them: in the original says \\"interiority\\", this version, \\"inferiority\\"; not one time, but several. Even if the work is based on the translation of Hazel E. Barnes, this errors can lead to misunderstanding of the key statements of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for horse racing fans and non-racing fans alike!","review":"This book is incredibly well written and exciting through to the very end. My husband has no interest in horses or horse racing but listened to the book on tape on a recent trip. He was inspired to give me the book because he liked it so much. It is one of the best books that I have ever read. I found myself transended into the depression era where horse racing was at it's peak and I sat in the stands next to the thousands of fans as each race was brilliantly played out. My knuckles were white with excitement the whole time. At times I found myself laughing out loud, cheering, and I even had an occasional tear run down my cheek. This book even interested our teen-aged daughter so you know it has to be good!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hillenbrand knows horses.","review":"From a former professor of equine science, I can say definitively that the information about horses and the backstretch has the completely authentic ring that only someone who has BEEN THERE can fully portray. Aside from the technical excellence, this book is meticulously researched and the narrative is that of a master storyteller. I'm terrifically impressed by this author, and I'll buy anything she writes from here on out."},{"rating":"2","title":"I read it in three days!","review":"Unbelivable book. I couldn't put it down. I have been a horse racing fan since I was a kid, thanks to a dad that brought me to the track as a young girl. I actually bought this book for my dad for Christmas, but decided to read it first before I gave it to him. This book is rich with detail you feel like you know the characters and have a front seat at all the races. The research that went into this book is exhaustive and you can tell Laura truly cares about her subjects. For anyone on the fence about getting this book b/c they don't know about horse racing, let me assure you this book is simply not about a horse, but instead about amazing people that came together for the love of horses, racing, and the American dream. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seabiscuit comes alive!","review":"I didn't expect to like this book to the degree I did. I'd read the reviews of course, but thought, no, it's just about this horse. Well, this horse seems more alive than most people, then and now. The prose is magnificent. The details are riveting. Who thought one could care about the injuries to someone 60 years ago that I'd never heard of? The helpful hints on how to lose 10 pounds overnight could be used by everyone who has a wedding to go to. The picture of this horse and his people is magnificent and something I couldn't put down. Hillenbrand spent 4 years on the research. I even read the research notes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An American legend of a book","review":"This is definitely a great book. With this effort, Hillenbrand proves that she is a master at bringing history to life, breathing life into an era gone by. I have to admit, I'd never heard of Seabiscuit the horse until I read this book, but you certainly don't have to have lived in the 1930s to appreciate this book. Hillenbrand spares no details, and apparently conducted excruciating research before writing this. The characters- including the horses- are richly developed and vividly brought to life. The reader comes away with a moving feeling of what it might have felt like to be involved in horse racing in the 1930s. Highly recommended. Avery Z. Conner, author of \\"Fevers of the Mind\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!","review":"Excellent, excellent book. I was cheering out loud during the race scenes (while sitting in a Dr.'s office waiting room). I couldn't put it down -- the details were excellent and I felt like I was part of the characters lives. Very well written. Best book I have read in quite some time!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Than A Horse: A Hero and Inspiration for All Time","review":"No one could have made up characters this interesting. The story is riveting from start to finish. In 1938, Seabiscuit was the biggest story in the country -- Roosevelt and Hitler took a backseat to this unlikely hero. Seabiscuit didn't look like a winner and perhaps if it hadn't been for the intuition and talents of people like Smith, Pollard, and the Howards, he would have remained just another horse. But Seabiscuit had heart and courage -- he may have been a horse, but he was a hero for all times. And the story of Seabiscuit and the important humans in his life serves as a reminder to all of us to look beyond the obvious and to never give up. Read this book. It is fabulous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised to like the book","review":"I was surprised that I liked this book. I don't particularly care for horses, and picked it up only because I'd just read Dick Francis. While the book is undoubtedly primarily about horses and horse racing (and thus loses some steam about 2/3rds of the way through unless you REALLY care about horses and horse racing), it's also about the advent and success of the automobile and about the individual characters who were involved with this particular horse and its competitors. *That* I found interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seabiscuit","review":"What can I say?

It is a Horatio Alger story. Seabiscuit and those around him rise together from hard times and obscurity to the pinnacle of racing, taking on all comers. It is especially a story about that trait that we Americans prize most: Courage. Seabiscuit had it, his trainer had it, his jockey had it. No wonder all of America loved the horse. He was us, or at least what we strive to be.Hillenbrand tells a remarkable story here, her research is exhaustive, her pictures are painted brilliantly. The love she has for this horse and the people around him comes through on every page. Just an incredible read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Seabiscuit","review":"I have read few books where I wanted to contact the auther when I finished and compliment the person on a spectacular read. So was the case with Seabiscuit. I have never sat in the saddle watching a race develope before my eyes. Hillanbrand's description of the races Seabiscuit ran especially the one with War Admiral are vivid, breath taking, and put you the reader, in the position of watching the race develope. I could not read fast enough to learn of the outcome. The people that made Seabiscuit successful,the Howards, Tom Smith, Pollard, the jockey were well researched and developed.This is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"seabiscuit","review":"I didn't read this book, it was a birthday gift to my father. I do know that it has been very enjoyable for my dad, who is an avid horserace fan. My father, who is not one to talk on the phone, has made it a point to tell me how much he loves this book. So, if there is a horseracing fan in your house, or anyone that likes horses in general, I think this is a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"This is the best book I've read in years. Everyone in my book club will read it! I actually held off reading it at times, because I didn't want it to end. What a superb writer Hillenbrand is. Thank you for the joy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a winner","review":"This narrative leaps out of the first paragraph in the same way Seabiscuit learns to bolt from the starting gate. From the start, Laura Hillenbrand draws the reader into the story with colorful, taut writing. There are no meaningless side stories in this book - each detail weaves itself back into the tale of a horse who beat the odds to become one of the greatest athletes of the 20th century.This story is gripping even if you have no interest in horseracing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seabiscuit","review":"Seabisquit:I found the writing boring. I am not a fan of non-fiction. I tried reading it for a book club"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much background info at the beginning!!!!!","review":"Long, boring, and just plain slow. Those are the words that come to mind when i think of this book. The first 100 pages are background of the owner, trainer, and jockey. I found myself slogging through them barely able to stay awake. However, once it finally got to the racing part of the book it got more interesting. But unless you avidly follow horse racing you'll find yourself lost and re-reading passages over and over again. I would have put this book down if I didn't have to read it for a school reading project."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the all-time great horse stories!","review":"Not only am I thrilled with Seabiscuit, his owner, trainer, and jockey, I am also thrilled with Laura Hillenbrand. What a story, and Ms. Hillenbrand has breathed exquisite life into it all over again! Truly, I couldn't ask for a more outlandish equine hero in even a Hollywood race film, but to consider that this is a true story is absolutely mind-numbing. Good work Laura AND Seabiscuit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than fiction!","review":"This was a page-turner like none I've ever experienced. The story was fascinating; the writing was magical. This book enters the \\"recommend to everyone\\" section of my library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"Laura is a great writer. She does her home work and tells a great story with the facts available. I read Unbroken and enjoyed that too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I bought this book for my son, who is in a correctional institution. He is an avid reader, and said this was one of the best books he ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've EVER read!","review":"I absolutely love this book! Laura Hillenbrand has a way of putting together a ton of facts and great research into a very readable format. My Kindle was smoking by the time I was done! Awesome, highly recommend!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves the Sterling Reviews","review":"I'm not a big history buff or nonfiction reader, but I have to say that this is one of the most entertaining stories I've ever come across -- it really reads like a good novel. The writing is superb, the characters are rich and lively and funny, the pace is quick and the level of detail in the research is truly amazing. Most horse racing books are about either horses or gambling, but this delves more into the more universally appealing subject of the wonderful, oddball characters who got together to campaign this horse. At the same time, you really end up rooting for the little horse, too. I really couldn't put the book down. Highly, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"First let me say this is undoubtedly the most interesting and enjoyable book I've read so far this year. What this book ultimately accomplishes is serving up a piece of unique U.S. history, that most people know very little about, in a readable, even dramatic narrative.The author does a tremendous job of taking the story of an ungainly underdog racehorse - Seabiscuit, his owner Charles Howard, the taciturn trainer Tom Smith, and the colorful jockey Red Pollard, and blending it into a dramatic story.I knew nothing about horse racing prior to reading this book (other than being a casual watcher of the Triple Crown series on TV every year). But you don't have to be a horse racing fan to enjoy this wild, fun ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best examples of storytelling that I have ever read!","review":"Laura Hillenbrand makes horse racing fans out of everyone. More than simply a biography of a horse, this book portrays the spirit of a sport as it tells the tale of an owner, a jockey and a thoroughbred champion that captivated the nation.This book was a great way to give historical insight into the life and times of the time period when automobiles were coming into existence and the USA was fighting bad times. Hard to believe a young female writer could be the author of this enjoyable read without missing the details of the lives and times of the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A heartwarming story!","review":"One of the things that really gets you about Seabiscuit is that it is the type of story that if it were not true, would be considered bad fiction. It is sentimental and yes even downright sappy at times but the fact that it is true makes it very moving and, at times, uplifting. The story features so many twists and turns that again were it all not true you would not believe it.Laura Hillenbrand is a great writer and makes each of the principal characters, including Seabiscuit, realistic and believable. The story told is one of redemption and success and of people who in almost any other situation would never meet, but forget a unique partnership that is literally one in a million.This book can not be recommended high enough and I would add that it is one of the best sports books of all time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SHORT AND SWEET","review":"There are so many wonderful reviews so I'll keep this short and sweet. Seabiscuit by Laura Hillenbrand is one of the best non-fiction stories I have ever read. I was enthralled from beginning to end. The research is amazing, taking the reader back to a time long forgotten. And if you love horses...oh my!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book, Then sit down and read it to your children,","review":"Laura Hillenbrand take us back to a simpler time in life when hero's were hero's and our country was desperate for something to hang onto. Out steps a half blind jockey, and old mustang breaker and a crooked legged horse. What a wonderful story of the little guy winning...But it's not a story it's the truth. I couldn't wait for the book to come out and I found it at the Gift shop at Santa Anita. Christine Crocker (the manager) said as fast as she put it out it was sold. I work for Santa Anita and the history of \\"The Great Race Place\\" and Seabiscuit took my breath away! Seabiscuit's Staute still stands in the beautiful walking ring watching the horses go to the track and George Woolf's staute greets the fans at the South Gate everyday. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, Laura Hillenbrand for the beautiful piece of histroy written with such love for the industry. You are an insperation to us all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ready to let go of my paperback copy","review":"I just purchased the Kindle edition. I have one bookcase in my home so paperbacks are generally given away after I have finished reading them. I have kept this book hidden. When I read the novel I read one chapter a morning on my train commute. I did not want the story to end. I still have not read the final chapter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A first-rate read","review":"I'm no fan of horse racing. Yet I found this to be an extremely well-written, great evocation of the times and a subculture. There are lots of very specific images that have stayed with me for a long time after reading the book. My only complaints are minor: Hillenbrand sometimes uses a bit too much racing jargon without explanation, and I would love to have more photos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seabiscuit; An American Legend","review":"I couldn't put this book down. The book is a compelling story, well written-and all true. Laura captures the texture of the sport, the people, and the time, and weaves it into THREE 'Rocky' stories. An amazing book about an amazing athlete, and amazing people."},{"rating":"2","title":"An OUTSTANDING book and get ready for the ride of your life...","review":"...because at times you will feel YOU are the jockey on the beloved Biscuit! This book tells you all about the owner, the trainer and the jockeys and you will find yourself, as I did, becoming tense and nervous before each race. This book has it all: background information, wisdom, talent, humor, love, suspense and most of all HEART. Even if you are not a fan of horses or horse racing, it is an outstanding book about the horse that caused another Civl War in America in the 1930's---A MUST READ!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just about the horse","review":"Hillenbrand tells not just the story of a great horse but the story of America in the late 1930s. The nation was still in the process of recovering from the Depression and it wanted a diversion and a great story. Seabiscuit provided both. Hillenbrand's depiction of the whole long-gone racing world of the era -- the reporters, the track owners, the jockeys, even the stable boys -- and of the public hungry for news is brilliantly done.Seabiscuit would not have succeeded without the trio of men who surrounded him -- the owner, Howard; the trainer, Smith; and the jockey, Pollard. Hillenbrand portrays each of them as an American unique.This book could have been 40 pages shorter without losing its impact. But it is still a riveting read and a great accomplishment."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie and book","review":"If you love horses, great storys, learning more about different eras or regions - this is a great story. I enjoyed it! Great pictures, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific!","review":"I resisted reading \\"Seabiscuit\\" until just recently. I thought, \\"Who wants to read a book about a horse?\\"Then I read \\"Unbroken\\" and was blown away. I then concluded I would read anything about anything by this author and be rewarded -- she is so talented. She could write a book on the accumulation of dust and I would read it.Ranking the two books -- I would give \\"Unbroken\\" a 10 out of 10 score and \\"Seabiscuit\\" 9.9999999 out of 10. My father-in-law was in a B-24 over Europe during WWII when it was shot down and he became a German POW. So all of the info about B-24s and POWs gave \\"Unbroken\\" a tiny edge for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jerry H","review":"Laura Hillenbrand takes research to the highest level for several years. Then she has a gift for telling a story equal to Patterson, Grisham, Brown, Child and the like. As readers / students of history, we are treated to interesting, related facts which make events more exciting. Seabiscuit is a page turner and her other work, Unbroken is so good, it's why I bought Seabiscuit."},{"rating":"2","title":"My book club loved it","review":"I facilitate a book club for residents at a retirement home, and this was one of our favorites out of nearly 50 books. Members felt like they were taken into the story and kept moving with it. They didn't expect to be so drawn into \\"a book about a horse.\\" They didn't expect to feel such a bond with a horse jockey, either. Our discussion of this book was one of our liveliest sessions.Because they loved the book so much, we also watched the movie together and loved it, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seabiscuit is a page turner!!!","review":"This was such a great book! It was a page turner and did not drag on like a lot of historical books do! this is a great heart warming story that every one needs to read. The movie isn't even close to the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The phenomenal Seabiscuit . . . .","review":"What do you say about a non-fiction book that revolves around an obstinate but spirited race-horse with an awkward gait, his ex-bicycle mechanic owner, his reclusive mustang breaker trainer and his alcoholic and accident prone jockey? Superb, wonderful, terrific, awesome and superlative - that is what you say. Ms Hillebrand can take a bow for bringing to fruition a tour de force story of a struggling era and of an inimitable race-horse and three diverse characters who helped in making America believe in itself again. + 60 years after the fact her pages had me shouting for Seabiscuit down those home runs and forever on I will look at race-horses, their jockeys and this sport with completely new eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"I cannot say enough good things about this book!!!!!","review":"It was a great story. I love horses but know little about horseracing. This story was touching and well written. You can't help but root for this funny little horse. This story crawls into the minds of the owner, trainer and jockey and shows you how luck and determination can make a champion.Very inspiring story even if you aren't into horseracing."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've read in a long time","review":"I'm not usually a big fan of the non-fiction books, but this is one startling exception. Being from the Bluegrass State, I've always heard about the great horses like Man O' War and Secretariat, but I didn't know nearly as much about Seabiscuit. The way Hillenbrand writes about this horse is absolutely amazing. You forget you're reading about a horse at all because her descriptions and the way she talks about Seabiscuit make you forget she's writing about an animal. This is easily one of the best books I've read in quite some time mainly just because it feels as though it's a throwback. It's almost as if you're in the grandstands for one of Seabiscuits races. The stories of the human counterparts are intersting as well, but you can tell the real passion lies with the horse itself. Seabiscuit was an amazing horse and this is a very worthy book about his remarkable life and racing career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enthralling story about a small horse and an unlikely team.","review":"This masterfully written book tells the enchanting story of a undersized horse named Seabiscuit and his racing career that held the attention of an entire nation.This book wonderfully describes the time period when the \\"Sport of Kings\\" was the number one attended sport in the country, and the hopes of many blue-collar, down-on-their-luck underdogs had a true working class hero in Seabiscuit, his owner Charles Howard, trainer Tom Smith, and jockey Red Pollard.I used to joke that horses were only good for glue and violin bows, but now thanks to this book I have a greater appreciation for these magnificant horses and the sport of horse racing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seabiscuit Is An American Classic","review":"Seabiscuit is an instant classic. It's sure to become one of the most beloved American novels of this generation. First-time-author Laura Hillenbrand's story, in connection with this novel, is almost as amazing as the Seabiscuit story itself. Like the amazing cast of characters about whom she writes - a tragic entrepeneur, a washed-out drifter horse-whispering trainer, and a half-blind failed jockey - Hillenbrand has found redemtion - in her case from a debilitating illness - through the rejected undersized overweight half-crippled racehorse who becomes the biggest hero and news story of the late 1930's, and the country's most beloved purveyor of the American Dream."},{"rating":"2","title":"I could hear the pounding of the hooves as I read this.","review":"I am not an autobiography reader, but this book just swept me away. I absolutely fell in love with Seabiscuit and not being familiar with his life before this book, I was on the edge of my seat during each race. Laura Hillenbrand wrote this so beautifully, I would definately read any other autobiography she wrote. It was written like a novel and kept you engrosed like one also. LOVED IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Depression Era History","review":"Dad liked this book, because it was not just a book about Seabiscuit, which he wanted, but also an interesting tale of life during the Depression."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sold on Seabiscuit-mania","review":"I must admit I couldn't get past page 100 of the book, but if it doesn't hold your interest by then... Maybe you have to be a \\"horse person\\" to get it. The book was extremely well researched and well-written with painstaking attention detail. I certainly know more about the secret lives of jockeys than I ever imagined (which was quite interesting). Overall, I had to push myself to get as far as I did in the book-for a book club meeting-and don't plan to finish. None of us could see what all the fuss is about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seabiscuit: An American Legen","review":"I could not put this book down. It made me laugh and it made me cry. This is an example of excellent storytelling infusing American History with a story of the ultimate underdog. Don't miss this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First Adult Novel, BEST Adult Novel","review":"Seabiscuit was my first and best adult novel. When I got it I kept on procrastinating reading it. I thought that it would be really boring after all and that it would be all dry paragraphs loaded with dates. It was, in fact, quite the contrary. Written in a story-like way, Seabiscuit was a page turner for me, and I'm sure will be the same for anyone else who reads it. It is an educational and fun-filled novel about one of the greatest horses in history. And whether or not you are an equine fanatic, you'll LOVE Seabiscuit."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Gotta Have Heart!","review":"This book is an outstanding work. I picked up the book after a friend recommended it, and relished every page. Laura Hillenbrand captures the emotion of horse racing better than I ever thought possible. More than an account of a great horse and his caretakers, Seabiscuit is a story about heart. The author does a great job of capturing the intensity of the race; but more importantly she captures the heart that characterizes Seabiscuit the horse. Seabiscuit answered \\"the question\\" when it was asked of him. This book does the same. We should all have such heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Runaway Winner","review":"Seabiscuit is a big winner. WINNER in sports books and any other kind of book. I am an avid reader and avid sports fan. However, I seldom read books about sports because there are not that many that are very good. Laura Hillenbrand has written a story that will hold you spellbound even if you are not a sport or racing fan. I found the jockeys, trainers, owners and everyone else to be interesting and the actual races themselves gave me goosebumps as I read. I don't know if I ever read a better book on any subject. Can't wait for movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tale, Hillenbrand's okay","review":"Hillenbrand's writing style didn't grab me so much, but it's a great story anyway. I knew virtually nothing about horse racing beforehand, and suddenly as I read this I found myself very caught up in all the War Emblem fever when he won the first two legs of the Triple Crown.An entertaining, somewhat even educating read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page turner for lovers of horses and horseracing","review":"It's a well written history of Seabiscuit but after a while it lost my interest. For someone with more passion about horses and race horses in particular, this would be quite a page turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enter into the business of horseracing","review":"A detailed account of the background of horseracing and all that is involved. Tells the story of how a horse and rider became famous. Puts you right there with all the information which makes the reader appreciate the story all that much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Gotta Have Heart","review":"The author did an unbelievable amount of research to write this book. Check the list at the end of the book.How the owner, trainer, horse and jockey all came together is an absorbing story, and has a great deal of general history too. The author is a master of describing a horse race. Some of her race descriptions are almost like seeing the race. This book is a masterpiece of writing as it shows the dedication and drive of all the people involved and especially the heart and gameness of Seabiscuit. There is a good insight into the life of jockeys as well as their mounts. No horse lover should miss this book. I stayed up late to finish it in one read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it's just me","review":"I have never watched the movie version. Heard great things about the movie. Decided to get the book. I almost bored myself to death after a few chapters. Maybe it's just not my type."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rooting for Seabiscuit!","review":"As someone who isn't a big fan of non-fiction, I actually enjoyed this book. There are some dry spells as the author gets into the nitty gritty of racing but an interesting read about a singleHorse that captured the attention and hearts of an entire nation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sea Biscuit; An American Legend","review":"This book is for people interested in a darn good book, not just horse racing fans. It is well researched and beautifully written. The characters come alive. The book is a piece of American History. Don't miss this wonderful story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An uplifting tale about an American Hero","review":"This is not only a story about a race horse, it is a lesson in history. The details in this book are so interesting and accurate that everyone will learn something they didn't already know. I must admit that I am a horse lover, but never into horse racing. I have enjoyed this book so much and believe it or not it is very difficult to put down. You will really get pulled into the story, feeling for all of these people (and animals) that really existed and lived this fantastic story. Please buy this book and share it with a friend. It's awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for horse racing fans","review":"I gave this book to my husband (a mad horse racing fan) as a gift and after he finished it he pressed me to read it saying he thought I would enjoy it. Well, gentle reader, \\"enjoy\\" is too mild a word to describe my reaction to this book. I missed my train stop once because I was so glued to the story. I would never have believed that a book about a racehorse could make me cry, not once, but three times. This horse had a heart as big as all outdoors and Laura Hillenbrand has done him justice with her brilliant portrait. I cannot recommend this book highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly Written Thoroughbred Bio","review":"I heard about this book on NPR and mentioned it to a friend who owns a thoroughbred. Then I heard another review on the radio. The story stuck in my mind. Both my friend and I ended up buying a copy. We both loved the story and are circulating the book to our fathers and various other friends. I highly recommend this book as a Father's Day gift to any Dad who lived through the Depression. I don't usually read nonfiction and I am no fan of horseracing but I was hooked on the story from start to finish. This is the way nonfiction should be written -- with attention to detail and documentation of facts and quotes. The author really made the story come to life in a big way. The hardest part reading it was when I had to stop right in the middle of a big race. There were a couple of days when lunchtime could not come fast enough. I was even tempted to call in sick! The last race was very emotional and I had to explain to coworkers why I was crying over my lunch."},{"rating":"1","title":"An embarrassment to the book","review":"The book was a five - but this edition, as it turned out, is a hardbound paperback. The inside margins are very narrow, and the stiffness of the hard binding make it a chore to read the book, thus the book is embarrassed by the binding. What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad movie, Worse book","review":"Saw the movie years ago, and thought it so boring. Read the book a few days ago, and was even worse!Why did this book do so well? There was just no staying-power.I am sure that Seabiscuit was an icon in his days, but this book just did not highlight his glory to justice.Definitely a book more dear to those who know more about horses than I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seabiscuit","review":"It arrived with five discs and the first one has nothing to do tith the story . It takes too long to get to the main story ."},{"rating":"2","title":"its a book?","review":"Oh man, Can you say greatest movie ever!!! I didnt even know it was a book. My favorite part was when spider man started to shot webs at the other horses. The end it great when he's like talkin about how his horse is to small and he's to dumb or somthing. go see this now!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book of the Year!!","review":"I absolutely loved this book. It was interesting to get to know the players (owner, trainer, & jockey) but it was even more interesting to get inside the heads of the horses. I always knew they were smarter than given credit for. I read each race while sitting on the edge of my seat. I wept when Seabiscuit lost and I wept when he won. When he and War Admiral finally raced I was filled with anticipation - I felt like I was there watching it myself. What a beautifully written book. You do not have be a racing fan to enjoy this book but you will be a fan afterwards!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Read","review":"This is the first book that I was able to read after the movie.

The horse doesn't even turn up till about a quarter of the way through the book!If you're not a horse person, my advice to you is - see the movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"why do people think this book is so great?","review":"when by bookclub choose this book, I thought ok I'll read it.

I won't end go into detail. It's so obvious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it","review":"A nonfiction history of horseracing. Reads like a textbook. If you like that sort of thing..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well researched, even better written","review":"Seabiscuit is the story not only of a horse but of a small group of people whose lives intertwined primarily because of that horse. The author creates richly vivid biographical portrayals of each of these people, crafting one story at a time a series of vignettes that mesh to comprise a mosaic of real people in a real world usually overlooked and obscure. She not only illuminates that world but brings it energetically to life. It is so inspiring and well written that it is difficult to put down this book. Even the acknowledgements, which I invariably skip, is full of poignant revelations. And the centerpiece of the story is a magnificent racehorse, who became, once molded by the people who loved him, one of the greatest of any era. Read this book! It is uplifting and will leave a lump in your throat when you finish. It is one of the rare tomes that the reader wishes would go on longer than it does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves All the Praise","review":"I've been hesitant to read non-fiction after far too many encounters with boring accounts of history throughout high school and college, but I tried this one and LOVED it. It was so exciting--not at all like reading a textbook. One of the best things about Hillenbrand is that she helped make some of the details of racing understandable but at the same time she didn't talk down to the reader either. She seamlessly provided information about the era while telling the story of Howard, Smith, Pollard and Seabiscuit. It certainly lives up to all the hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"Larry's Picks","review":"Outstanding quality of book and one of the most wonderful stories I have ever read. Hilldebrand is so gifted it is hard to measure her against any other author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, but hard to find","review":"I purchased this book out of town on my sister's highest recommendation (she reads everything). I can't wait to pick it up whenI get home. It's so much more than a book about a horse. The characters are so interesting,and it's exciting every time a race starts. I'm one third through and purposely reading slowly. I do want to know why it's #1 on the New York Times Best Sellers Non-Fiction...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even if you've been kicked in the head by a horse...","review":"Even if you have not a shred of interest in horses or horse racing (I sure don't), you will love this book, assuming you have any heart and soul whatsoever. The initial exposition bogs down a little in places, but it's all necessary information. You'll come to love the horse, feel real compassion for the jockey, and just generally have a great read. After you've read it, look for the PBS special on Seabiscuit and see that runty, huge-hearted animal in action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great writing, fun story, heartbreaking, too","review":"The sad part is about the treatment and lives of the jockeys.As another reviewer said, a sequel devoted to that subjectwould be welcomed, at least by me. The jockeys were little more than indentured servants, nearly slaves, and got paid relatively little for their pains. And pains they all had! Mosthad near-death experiences, and were so devoted to their calling that, like Red Pollard, they lived to ride again despite the most hideous accidents.Charles Howard, Tom Smith and Red Pollard were men of character. You don't see that much these days. Talk about risk-takers! And, of course, the horse, of course...and we're not talkin' Mr. Ed. Seabiscuit truly was one for the ages.I have never been interested in horse-racing before reading this book...but I am now."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hard-bound paperback...","review":"I've not yet read this book, so my rating only reflect on the physical quality of the edition I purchased. The \\"library binding\\" edition does indeed have a rigid, durable binding, but in all other respects is identical to a paperback edition. The dimensions of the page are small, and the book is printed on very inexpensive paper that is likely to yellow very quickly. The binding also is so close to the printed margin that is difficult to read the beginning of each line.

By page 40 I was thoroughly disappointed and angry that I had wasted my time. But I have to admit - I'm not at all into the races, and although I like all animals I have no particular affinity to horses. I wanted to like it, I went into it with an open mind, but while there were some interesting passages, I wasn't spellbound by this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seabicuit, one of my 2 favorite books I ever read","review":"This book is amazing! My friend told me to read it and I gave in. I didn't want to read a book about a horse! ( I'm a guy). But after reading this book, I truly know what they mean by never judge a book by it's cover. The characters, even the horse, become so real it sucks you in. When a race comes you feel dramatically involved. I am still in awe of how good it is. I don't want to give ay of it away, so I will just say this : IT IS SO GOOD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational and Heartwarming","review":"I am a horse owner and love and respect this animal immensely, which only added to my enjoyment of this book. I thought the movie was great, but the book is even better. The story initially may seem slow - with the introduction of the main characters and their background and history; however, that does not detract from the fact that this is a fantastic book. Inspirational, heartwarming, and, in my view, a classic. A book for everyone. If I could rate this greater than 5 stars, I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you want to cheer!","review":"This story takes us back in time to the 1930's, a time of much turbulence in the world. This work, however, focuses on one horse and his important people. Together with owner Charles Howard, trainer Tom Smith, and jockey Red Pollard, Seabiscuit makes sports page history. The story reveals it just as it happened. We get to know the people and Seabiscuit first, and then we follow this horse's training and racing days. The story is written in such a way that the races seem like actual play-by-plays. It's often hard not to jump up and yell \\"Go, Seabiscuit!\\" as the races are run on the pages of this book! Well researched and lots of fun, this book is delightful reading for any animal lover or fan of sports history."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable story well told","review":"Seabiscuit fills the place in American Mythology that can only be attained a true \\"Rags to Riches\\" story.Laura Hillenbrand has recovered a true American story that warms us to the dream of what this country wants to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Story, What a Horse!!","review":"Being a horse owner and having heard tales of Seabiscuit, I was naturally drawn to the book when I say it on the shelf. But I must say it was considerably more than I expected. I don't remember when was the last time that I was so drawn in not only by the book itself, but especially by the characters it features.I fell in love with Seabiscuit. I must say that his life is an inspiration to me. Yes he was just an animal, but his life serves as a great object lesson. No, he wasn't a pretty horse, and no he your typical high spirited race horse. Anatomically, he should not have been able to run like he did, nor would he have, had it not been for the faith Mr. Howard and Mr.Smith had in him. They saw the potential there, and never lost faith.

It is extremely well written and every detail plays a role in this compelling story. The characters, both human and equine, the places and times, and the races themselves, are brought vividly to life. I am no race fan and doubt I ever will be, but if I ever again see a horse race, it will be with a new sense of appreciation and history. My original copy has been passed around a lot and is now lost in the shuffle. I will just have to replace it because this book I will definitely read again."},{"rating":"2","title":"STUNNER!!","review":"If you haven't figured it out by now, this book is a winner. It's a page turner, not because every event has you on the edge of your seat (which they often do), but because you become so invested in the ebb and flow of the lives so well illustrated in this book. One of the truly rare books that honestly captivates you. You'll end up wishing you were there in the Thirties rooting Seabiscuit on from the grandstands. Who hasn't heard of Seabiscuit? Now, you'll know the rest of the story..."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Rate and A Must Buy","review":"I loved this book, I love horses, and I love gambling. I was there in every page.

I highly recommend this lovely book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best horse stories ever","review":"What a wonderful book. A fascinating look at horseracing and a horse who ran for all he was worth. It's a must read even if you know nothing about horse racing. You cannot help but feel part of the era and you cannot help but love Seabiscuit just like everyone else did during his lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gloriously told story of Seabiscuit and his handlers","review":"After reading the incomparable biography Unbroken by Laura Hillenbrand, I knew that I had to read some of her earlier work. Seabiscuit did not disappoint. Ms. Hillenbrand spent years researching the history of the famous and highly celebrated horse, Seabiscuit's owner Charles Howard, his trainer Tom Smith, as well as his jockeys Red Pollard and George Woolf. Every detail of how the perfect marriage between horse and his handlers came to be is laid out in brilliant storytelling. Once Seabiscuit starts to become the champion that everyone know knows and loves, the narrative gets very interesting. You read about all of the up and down cycles between the men behind Seabiscuit and the horse himself. It's an exciting ride to the very last page full of drama, heroics, pain and celebration. It's an incredible and true journey decpicted with great care and attention to detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"SeaBiscuit: An American Legend","review":"I read a lot of books, and this is the only book, other than the Bible, that I have read and then immediately started over and read again. It reads like fiction, but is actually comprised of a very skillful weaving together of thousands of facts. The greatness is in the details. There are realistic descriptions of the life of jockeys at that time, which were hard in many ways, and the details were not glossed over to make it easier to read (so be warned that these were not pleasant), but that reinforced the sense of authenticity about it.Seabiscuit: Special Illustrated Collector's Edition: An American Legend"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money........","review":"I found myself wanting to turn this insult to good western movies off before it was complete. However since I just wasted $4 on the rental I wanted to give it every chance to redeem itself somehow, it did not! Bad acting and a slow moving plot made this movie a real pain to get through. Val Kilmer was the only asset this movie had going for it and it was wasted.

Regrettably, this low-budget \\"Revenge\\" production is just an attempt to capitalize on the Earp name. It lacks both historical and fictional qualities. It failed to provide an adequate script.

The only point of interest is the fact Val Kilmer is, most likely, the only person to portray both Wyatt Earp and Doc Holiday. In this movie, his character as Wyatt Earp is little more than a bit part. I did like the bit part Trace Adkins played and the colorful, but ever so small, portrayal of Doc Holiday by Wilson Bethal, who I was unfamiliar with, but nonetheless kicked it up a notch in his brief appearance. Shawn Roberts played the younger Wyatt Earp, poorly. He was upstaged by everyone in my opinion. I actually felt bad for him.Cannot, in good conscience, recommend this in any way."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE BAD WESTERN!","review":"This movie is bad. I never expected it to be historically accurate- so spending time on this point is a waste of time. To get to the point: 1.Badly written 2.Badly acted 3.Badly directed - the sets were bad, the costuming was bad- this movie looks like it was filmed on a weekend (maybe just Sunday). The good: 1.The cover (I bought it with great expectations) 2.It has an ending.As far as the ending goes, I'm not sure if Val Kilmer died at the end or just fell asleep- it did look lke he was in pain- as I and my son were also. I can't imagine a western being any worse- I'm sure there is one- I just haven't seen it. This movie was so bad I actually threw it away- the idea of giving it to anyone went against my better judgement."},{"rating":"2","title":"i thought it was good","review":"i thought it was a good movie and i dont like westerns all that much i heard it wasn't close to the real story of wyatt earp's story but the acting was great"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"I tried hard to like this movie but the story was disjointed, the acting poor, and the action sequences were cheap. It could have been good but Hollywood took too many liberties with the story. For example there was a recurring anti-gun theme. One victims family would not allow guns in the house or teach the child how to use a gun. In 1878 Kansas? Really? There were still bands of Indians roaming the countryside killing settlers in the area at that time. Everyone including famers, ranch hands, and kids, where armed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wyatt Earp's Revenge","review":"Great movie....because my son (Daniel Booko) is in it!!!!

The true story is so badly handled that it is barley recognizable. The boy playing Wyatt Earp always walks around with his hand on his gun, ready to draw it from a cross draw holster that I don't think Wyatt ever used.(Yes I mean \\"boy\\" since no one except Trace Adkins looks over 19) They continually get down from their horses on the right side, not the left, which in reality means the horses are well trained. Maybe the human actors should take lessons from them.

Bottom line is I should have bought the DVD for a few bucks more. That way I can take the movie anywhere and watch it on any DVD stand alone player. In regard to \\"Wyatt Earp's Revenge\\" It sucks.

Why he associated himself with this fiasco is the unanswered question. The opening scene shows a supposed cowboy bad guy, who doesn't know how to ride a horse. The horse, by the way, is still in it's winter coat that has never seen a curry comb or brush. None of the main actors have any horse savvy and it's only the extras that know what they are doing. Then you have the young Wyatt, portrayed by a person who is knee high to a big fat judge. Wyatt was a tall(6 foot) individual. Whoever cast this movie needs to go back into training for another job.

Now it does trap phosphates, nitrites and nitrates as it states on the box. Water tests are coming up practically zero for each range but at the cost of many fish. Arowanas are especially sensitive to this stuff. Please be careful when using. I will never use this stuff again. I bought it thinking it would help remove some phosphates from a freshwater tank with an algae bloom issue when all i really needed was a UV clarifier/sterilizer.

The 3-CD holder is a mechanized tray that opens to the CD you select... or at least, it did for the first year. Then one day, while exchanging CDs, the mechanism fouled up and refused to stop attempting to open, close, and shuffle the disc trays. It did this constantly while plugged in, rendering the tape player and radio useless (unless you like hearing a mechanized whine along with your favorite tunes). I forcibly removed the trays, to no effect. Mind you, I had used the CD feature, at most, 12 hours in that year of ownership! This system was in cherry shape, and had no reason to fall apart except for poor workmanship and/or shoddy materials.The cost to ship or drive to a Philips authorized repair facility, plus labor and materials, will be well above the cost of a new shelf system. When the time comes to replace this system, Philips is automatically scratched off the list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Buy","review":"I have gotten 2 of these stereo systems by 2 different companies; Sony and Panasonic. I've returned them both. The same manufacturer MUST produce these, they are nearly identical. They claim they play both writable and rewritable CD's; but they don't play either; they skip and snag through the whole thing. The changing mechanism is loud and clumsy (I'd be afraid that would break quickly). I have not tried the Philips, but like I said, they are identical to the one Sony uses and Panasonic. They look nice, great for a kitchen or bedroom and that's their draw; but if you're looking for a reliable, long-lasting system that will play your mixed CD's; they are worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Several significant annoyances","review":"I bought this system for use as an alarm clock as well as a mini audio system in my bedroom. Based on several issues, I've decided to return it. 1. The panel is way too bright. At its brightest setting you could easily read a book. At its dimmest, it still casts significant light. 2. The clock itself is too small to read unless you're very close to it. 3. The speaker cables are very short - 6 feet?, and they don't detach from the speakers, so they can't be replaced. 4. The CD mechanism is very loud, slow and clunky. 5. The buttons on the remote are small, mostly identical, and poorly labeled. 6. Sound is OK, but not impressive. If you have no intention of using the alarm functionality and don't might the brightness, it may be an OK choice, but I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I can pretty much echo all of the positive things people have said about this system. The sound is wonderful and the look is stylish. Initially, I was looking for an alarm clock that would allow me to wake up to CDs, but wanted more sound than the typical alarm clock offered. In the time I've used it, I have grown to love the \\"wake up\\" timer feature--it is a little hard to learn how to use at first, but after awhile it sinks right in. There is even a snooze button. There is also a great sleep feature.I agree with the reviewer who complained about the dim backlight. The lowest setting is a bit brighter and I wish the backlight turned off as well. In addition, the CD Changer mechanism is definately \\"clunky\\", but let's not forget this is a lower end system. Phillips decided instead to focus on the sound and style, and having experienced those things, I don't mind the clunky changer. And those are the only two gripes I have."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 cd changer fails","review":"The 3 CD changer started jamming after a couple of years of very low intensity use (2-3 times a week). I had to open it up to rescue my CDs and it then worked for a while, but started jamming again. It then seemed to work if I only used one CD at a time, but eventually it jammed again. There seems to be no obvious way to disconnect the changer itself, and forget about replacing/repairing it. The electronics and motor are still fine - it is the mechanical components associated with the changer that are a problem: They are all made of plastic, and will eventually wear down (the teeth or gears or belts). My decision for next time - no changers."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD changer died...","review":"Like others wrote, CD changer was fine for about 2 years, then started acting randomly, until it refused to open or close at all.

I tried this system out in the store and was extremely pleased. It tunes in all the stations I want and then some. The tuner has a great auto station preset feature. The sound is excellent for the size - actually very enjoyable. It doesn't sound 'cheap'. It has good bass and treble (both separate and adjustable). The MUTE button is great to have when the phone rings. A readable backlit display, intelligently designed remote, 3-CD changer (1 gets old fast), tape player and other bells and whistles round out the system. It's beautiful too. All I can say is 'Way to go, Philips!'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but lacking adequate bass response","review":"The Philips system is a great buy for the price, but does have a few drawbacks. The speakers are necessarily small in this class of equipment and, therefore, lack adequate bass response in comparison to larger speaker systems. The Philips system does have an output for a user supplied powered subwoofer, and I recommend that this be a serious consideration for a potential buyer. The setup for the tuner is quite confusing, and the automatic setup is totally worthless, so that the user has to figure out how to do it manually. The remote functions are also confusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD changer problem","review":"After a lot of research (including reading information on this site), I bought this system. After setting it up, the CD changer drawer refused to open. It seemed like it was jammed.

A random defect or a design flaw? Now I am not sure whether to exchange this for another one or get something different.Other minuses include the tiny button size and the fact that the CDs takes a long time to start or for the CD drawer to start - I noticed this in the store.

Hughes is a poor thinker and an abominable art critic. He consistently mistakes artistic innovation as \\"poor quality\\", often evaluating art which occupies an interstice between established forms by rigid and inappropriate terms.(His particular condemnation of certain artists reveals his unfamiliarity with their actual work; he perpetuates misrepresentations of the artists that were, in fact, conceived by the right wing.)

Of his CDs, this Wes Montgomery tribute is my favorite. In describing Ritenour's feelings towards Montgomery's music, the liner notes open with the word \\"Intoxicating,\\" and, in fact, that is the precise word I would use to describe this effort. It's been in my collection for about four years, and I can still listen to it for hours on end without tiring. The album has just the right touch of bluesy funk to complement the jazz, and has as much feel as it does sound. If you appreciate hard-hitting jazz guitar, you'll love Wes Bound.As an aside, \\"Waiting in Vain\\" is quite off character in relation to the rest of the album and, therefore, could easily mislead those who recognize it from radio play.

I remember being warned in a prior review about this but thought that I would never do this. It happened and now it cost me $55 to fix this (I am still under warrantee but they will not cover this). I consider this a bad design as it is easy since there are three trays to mistakenly add a CD on top of another. Do it once and you pay. Their warrantee service also is not very accomadating.

Unfortunately, on the second evening of listening to my new stereo, two CD's were placed by accident on the same tray. Instead of rejecting the tray as most sound systems do, the MC70 swallowed both CD's and jammed. After finally finding a repair shop, I found out that not only were the CD's jammed in the machine but that the entire tray had broken and that a new part would have to be ordered (under warranty). I have now been waiting 2 months for this part to be shipped by Phillips and the part has still not arrived (supposedly the part is back-ordered - I suspect because this is a common problem...)As putting 2 CD's in the same tray is a error that occurs to everyone once in a while, I would strongly caution potential purchasers of the MC70 to think carefully about buying this system because of this serious design flaw."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Place And Time","review":"Dr. Etheridge captures the place and time of his coming of age extraordinarily.

This book's one redeeming feature is its treatment of recent Free Exercise cases, particularly its call for a broader range of religious exemptions to generally applicable laws.

Carter says \\"we would do well to reclaim the venerable idea that religious faith can be our best guide for political action.\\"I disagree. Politics is for ALL people and not ALL people believe in the mythology of religion. Why should those of us who believe that religion is merely a crutch for those who fear death, and is pure fiction made up in the minds of those who are too afraid to accept and feel the reality that they are merely the body and will die some day for good (no after life - sorry!), have to live under the rule of religious belief?Politics and religion should have no over lap at all.

This album originally came out in 1984 as an LP on Takoma Records, shortly before John Fahey's own (and fine!) label went broke. It was a damn honest and straightforward attempt to bring back the energy of Folk-Rock to Gene Clark's music, and it surely does! The \\"Rain Song\\" alone is well worth buying this album, but furthermore we hear a truly tuneful rendition of \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" (several verses), the stunning \\"Something About You Baby\\", the mystical \\"Blue Raven\\", the trucking \\"Rodeo Rider\\" and other gems.

I expected the book to discuss in details of the issues related to embedded linux. And to a degree, this book is like a dictionary of all the terms you might encounter during the development and only a few direct examples. And given how fast the Linux kernel, open source packages evolve over time, the examples given in this book is totally outdated.A lot of the topics talked about in this book you probably already faced on the desktop, and would be totally useless to someone who has done projects like LinuxFromScratch.to sum up the new stuff in this book in a few words:Hardware: x86 or ARM, with flash and JFFS2 and UBOOTcross compile using gcc, uClibc, busybox, TinyLoginThe book feels like someone outlined everything and wrote one skin deep paragraph on everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very valuable resource","review":"Entering the world of embedded Linux development was a daunting task not too long ago, since information was spread thinnly across the web, and books were not readily available.

The author does a good job presenting the material and nicely presents concepts that non-experts can quickly grasp. The book covers: basic concepts, hardware support, development tools, kernel considerations, and file management topics. It also covers bootloader, networking, and debugging tools. I would have preferred more coverage on the debugging tools. Yaghmour did a good job in explaining his ideas. I did not need to refer to other LINUX books to have terminology explained.

He shows a couple of the most simple chord progressions and then shows some minor scales to solo over them in the style of Carlos Santana. What I found to be the most disturbing was that the instructor is playing a Telecaster through a Fender amp. Really? Is that the best effort you could put into the \\"sound\\". Carlos plays a PRS through a Mesa Boogie. He used SG's in the earlier albums but always plays with humbucking pick ups for that smoother warm sound. A Telecaster is a twangy country clean sound. At a minumum he could have borrowed one. This is one of my peeves because you see others do it too. They use the master's name and then solo over a backing track in his \\"style\\".

One of his biggest hits, and his first number one, \\"I'm Real\\" with Jennifer lopez. Also missing is the single version of \\"Put It On Me,\\" which featured amazing vocals from Lil' Mo. How can they have left that one off? That was the HIT version of the song. That is unacceptable. Also missing is his first big big hit, \\"Between You And Me\\" with Christina Milian. Also missing are the hits \\"Down Ass Bitch,\\" \\"Down 4 U,\\" which was another top ten hit, \\"Can I Get A...\\" with JayZ and Amil, and \\"Rainy Dayz\\" with Mary J. Blige.

He also covers the types of hounds and hawks used during the hunts, the various types of game that were hunted as well as the techniques used to catch them. I really enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't use them!","review":"The envelopes came all unglued so anything I would have put in them would have fallen out. The bottom seam and the seam that goes down the middle of the back of the envelopes were both unglued."},{"rating":"2","title":"Presumed Guilty: The Tim Wilkes Story","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. If you live in South Carolina you will find this book very interesting and especially interesting if you live(lived) in Winnsboro. Some of my family members grew up near Tim and knew him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dynamite setting & a killer close","review":"If you haven't read any of Deborah Donnelly's funny and romantic mysteries about wedding planner, Carnegie Kincaid, start with her first book, Veiled Threats, and read all four in order. In Death Takes a Honeymoon, Donnelly takes full advantage of the Sun Valley setting with hunky smoke jumpers, a palatial resort, and a completely unexpected climax. Carnegie, by turns romantic and catty, is a delightful companion. Her own romance has more twists and turns than a two-lane road to Post Falls, and I'm dying to read the next installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wedding that almost goes up in flames","review":"Donnelly's unique plots, quirky characters, true-to-life settings, and lively prose make her Wedding Planner series as addictive as chocolate.In DEATH TAKES A HONEYMOON, the fourth installment, Carnegie Kincaid leaves her Seattle houseboat behind to attend the wedding of an old friend in Sun Valley, Idaho. Poor Carnegie soon has a lot on her cake plate: the sinister death of her smoke jumper cousin, her commitment-shy boyfriend, a self-centered celebrity bride and her pill-popping mother, a flirtatious groom, and an annoying rival wedding planner. Woven into the mystery are intriguing facts about smoke jumping, but they never get in the way of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this book","review":"I know writers love to keep readers guessing on what happens to their characters in mystery series books but Donnelly has lost a reader with her latest installment. When you read a series like this you become emotionally invested in the characters and to have an ending such as this made me feel cheated and angry. I feel its a blatent attempt to force the reader to buy the next book. In my case it made me feel betrayed by Donnelly and as such her books are now on my \\"DO NOT BUY AT ALL COST\\" list.The book itself felt choppy as if it was edited hastily and was too long so they couldn't finish the story line and would continue it in her next. Miss this one and you won't feel cheated out of your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best entry","review":"I read Death Takes a Honeymoon in two days and the more I thought about the book, the less I decided I enjoyed it. Were there any likeable characters at all? The story was very uneven and there wasn't enough development of Julie, one of the most interesting characters. By the time I got to the cliffhanger ending I decided I didn't really care what happened to Carnegie and Aaron after all. What I did enjoy was the change of venue to Idaho. I was disappointed enough in this outing between unlikeable characters and disjointed plot that I am not sure I will continue with the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"No cheap New Age relaxing","review":"I don't know what kind of music connoseur is someone that first compares Bley to Winston, and second in such a way knowing Paul Bley as a decisive figure both for Jazz Avantgarde and modern Piano Trios. This CD is one of the all-time landmarks in jazz-Piano Solo CDs, and Bley shows in a very convincing way all his strengths: his privilleged technique (though he doesn't show off his style is rather elegant), his playing with the piano strings and resonances, his romantic feeling (despite the extrem slow motion), and his mastery at driving different atmospheres in a similar context. If you don't connect with this CD at the first listening, just patience, and you'll get reward!!. Hightlights from the critics: Ida Lupino, Harlem.

Ron Holiday tells the story of his life with Joy, his wife of over 40 years and later partner Chuck Lizza.

I will no spoil it by telling it in this review!Ron's real life story telling sincerely had me in tears many times. It's beautifully told and his love for Joy is so plainly seen!!!! His dedication to her and their animals is an inspiration! There's a special place in Heaven for Ron Holiday!!!!Dear Ron...if you ever read this; I hope you make it to Thailand!!!! I'll pray for you!

There is one small section on bracing. There are so many other books out there on Scoliosis that take a more holistic approach.This is a good book if you know you are getting surgery for your scoliosis, but that's about it. I was very disappointed.A much better resource is this brief pamphlet/book put out by the Scoliosis Care Foundation called The Scoliosis Desk Reference. It is very succinct, w/o any bias for treatment but clear and thorough on the facts, screening, types of scoliosis, treatment options, descriptions from scientific literature, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"essential for the collection","review":"This CD came out when Jesse was at the height of his creative powers. He was tourning as opening act of the 1974 CSNY reunion tour (and by most reviews playing better than the headliners) and producing some of the best music coming out of northern california. Mining some of the same jazz influenced ground as Van Morrison, he merged the singer songwriter with light jazz.This disc is a followup to Song for Juli. While Juli may have been a little stronger overall, here Jesse takes a few more chances. California child opens with a bit of bright cali-pop breaking immediately into the moodiness of Grey Day. The title tune is a feel god anthem, mining the same spiritual territory as Get Together.Arguaby Jesse had a five year run of creativity that anyone would be proud of. This is the peak of that period. Highly recommended. This goes in and out of print, so get it while it's available"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Music Lover","review":"The first half of this album (the California Suite) is a religious experience for me. Grey Day and Light Shine both have passages that make my soul soar and my hair stand on end. It seems positively Pagan. Crank up the stereo and let it take you away.The rest of the album is fine, but not nearly so great as the first half. Even if the rest of the album were missing, the California Suite would easily justify the cost of the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Both volumes now on iTunes","review":"Actually both Hedy West (with bonus material) and Vol 2 are available via iTunes. Don't follow the links from the Vanguard site (which only has the latter title) but go direct to iTunes and type in a search for 'Hedy West'. These downloads will do until we finally get a decent CD reissue of the original albums.I first saw Hedy on stage in the mid-1960s and these two albums (plus the 3 Topic Records ones) capture her old-timey, folk and American gothic perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"It all sounds so smart","review":"Browning's book--title and subtitle combined--sounds provocative, interesting, engaging. Then again, I suppose he's learned how to write a headline over the years. This book degenerates into a long, rambling account of all the great sex Browning has had--and then makes an even more telling turn, if not a dangerous one. Browning moves from the personal to the general with fluidity--and there's the rub. The argument is something like this: \\"I find community this way, so we all find community this way.\\" It's that \\"so\\" that bugs the daylights out of me. It reminds me of Martha Stewart: I make a cake this way, so you must make one this way. Ugh.

I learned a lot about the camp life, terminology, food, clothing, discipline, etc of the average Union soldier in the Civil War. However, it would've been much more interesting if the author had woven more first hand accounts, or personal stories of others into the book. This book is a bit dry. For example, instead of writing, \\"We made pipes and rings as mementos\\" he writes ...\\"was the making of pipes and rings as mementos...\\" (pg 67). I was left wanting to hear the author's story, including the battles he fought in, trouble he got into, etc, while he also brought out all the incidentals of life in the Union Army. I felt the author was standing back describing something somebody else (but nobody he really knew) experienced. Still, if you've got a substantial interest in the Civil War, this represents a lot of information on camp life in one book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Lite","review":"Im a firefighter from Chile, and i bought this lite for its reputation among my partners at the firehouse. is really resistant and the light that goes out from the lite is very helpful in smoke and dark enviroments.Nice product.See ya."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Formed","review":"There is not a lot new to be said about Robert E. Lee and Ulysses S. Grant. They are, undoubtedly, two of the most documented men in History. What is more important, when tackling this subject, is presenting the subject matter in an interesting fashion. In this regard, Gene Smith succeeds.By alternating chapters, between each of his subjects, the reader follows the lives of two men as they grow and develop. All the while knowing, they are destined to meet in ultimate contest.Even more than the book's interesting structure, I was impressed with Smith's well formed thoughts. The narrative is never disjointed or piecemeal, and all details are presented in context to the two men's lives, manifesting in a highly readable work.I laud Mr. Smith for an excellent effort. And I encourage readers, whether new or old to the subject of the Civil War, to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Highly Readable History of the Civil War !","review":"In telling the stories of Lee and Grant, Smith is really writing a neat book on the Civil War.

A good starting point for anyone interested in the Civil War or just looking for a good basic overview."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of a Kind, I hope.","review":"If anything, _Bayswater Bodycount_ is a good piece of shlock filth.

But it would be better if it was an actual memory size capacity so I could fit more pictures on there by resizing my photos to a smaller resolution. It's so easy to batch-process a bunch of photos and reduce their file size just by resizing for something so small like this.Anyway, the reason for the 2 stars is because this scratches easily. I don't have this attached to my keys, it's way too big. So I clipped this on to the zipper of my breastpump bag so I can look at photos of my daughter while I pump at work. It had a scratch across the front within a few weeks and it totally ruins it. I have no idea how it go there.

With 3-4hr charge time, should be able to show plenty of people favorite photos of kids, grandkids, vacation spot, family, ect.4 star because it requires charging only by USB port. Recognize at this price point a charger could not be supplied, but a solution to work with a common charger style would be nice. Especially when this is a gift for those not tech savvy, or actually without a computer (grandparents and parents - yes, no computer).Nice requirement to hold down On/Off button to turn on - no accidental battery drain.Recommend using something like free IrfanView to mass convert desired pre-cropped pictures to 128x128 byte size. Not sure how well the included software does it, or how slow it would have been.But when already done, the upload is very quick.

These type of electronics will be sold under many different names. I believe you should buy the cheapest you can find. This way if it does stop working you have lost the least amount, because the truth is the there is only pennies different between ones that may be $10.00 different in retail price. The internal workings are basically the same for each. I bought several for my granddaughters for stocking stuffers and they are still working more than a month later.

If you have a system running Tiger - Mac OS X 10.4 - as I luckily have, you will have no problems using this Keychain. It seems to me that Coby's support is just a twee bit lacking. However, I find little fault with the chain itself. I think the quality of the LCD display is more than acceptable, and it's simple enough to use. What I do not like about the keychain is that you have to tell it to charge the battery once you plug it into the included USB chord (which, of course, needs to be plugged into your computer, too). That should be automatic, IMHO. Also, while it is charging, it endlessly cycles through it's stored pictures. On a frame this small, that just seems a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute technical junk!","review":"I bought this as a Mother's Day gift for my wife to put the kids' pictures in them. I saw all the mixed (though trending toward negative) reviews, but for just over $10, I figured what the heck. Now, I wished I'd heeded some of the comments. This thing would not get recognized in Vista SP1, constantly connecting then disconnecting with that oh-so-catchy USB jingle. There was no software CD provided. I tried everything I could to get my computer to see it, following the directions in the packaging plus some of those given in these reviews.

Within seconds of plugging it on my laptop (which operates Windows XP), it recognized it and a window opened up. It wasn't too difficult to figure out how to transfer your pictures from the PC to the keychain. On the left of the screen you browse the location where the pictures are, click on the picture and then click 'Add' and the picture will show up in a box in the right side of the screen. It comes with two pictures, to delete them just click on the picture and click 'Delete' on the top of the screen. You can even crop the pictures. The picture quality is not mind blowing but they look very nice anyway (kinda lookslike a 1.8 mp picture quality.Bets part is that it comes with a rechargable battery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed!!","review":"I just recently purchased this photo keychain.

The package claims compatible with MacOSX, but that is not very specific. Turns out you need 10.4.x. I contacted their tech support and was emailed a different version, which did install. The interface is relatively easy to understand, but primitive and awkward. The device itself is nice looking, but the other hassles make it not worthwhile. The biggest annoyance of all is battery life. It only runs a couple of hours on a full charge. Do charge it overnight though as the manual recommends or you won't even get that. It's funny - reading thru the other reviews, people either love this or hate it.

Spent hours trying to get the software to load using the USB cable provided but to no avail. Finally the next day I called Coby Tech Support for assistance. Well you can guess from the other reviews that they should NOT be called Tech support as they are NOt technical at all. The best answer I got from them was to jam the USB cable into the keychain with all my might and hope for the best. If that didn't work them just return it as this is a known problem with these keychains that the USB cable stinks and doesn't work properly. The software loaded fine but they need to redesign the whole USB thing to make this a better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at any cost","review":"Good luck with this product and with Coby tech support.I bought two, one powered on while the other did nothing.Neither transferred and the software bundled was horrible, rarely did it recognize the product that would power on.I tried on XP Home, XP Pro and Vista...

When I click on the available places to look for photos (like Mac HD), nothing happens.Furthermore, I was very embarrassed that one of the people I gave it to as a gift got the software mini-CD stuck in his laptop.

They had me open two of them to check. They then suggested that I return them. I am hoping that Amazon will let me send them back even though they are opened.

I never could get these to work on my Mac, so I simply copied them over to a network drive and used their driver/software under Parallels. That worked great. Too bad that I couldn't get it to work on my Mac though.

You have to have the device plugged in and then start the software after clicking on photo update on the device. Then you may add and edit your photos as needed.

Each picture had to be manually cropped using the software.Once the photos had been selected and manually cropped, the keychain worked, although the battery did not appear to hold a charge very well, and there is no \\"auto off\\" feature. There is an \\"Auto on/off\\" feature which allows you to turn the device on at a specific time and off at a specific time.

With that said though, don't expect the software or instructions to be great quality; they're badly written, but definitely understandable. The one major concern I have with this keychain is the battery life. I haven't completely tested it, but it does appear to drain very quickly when constantly browsing, so don't expect to go flip through your photos for hours on end.

The characters played by Tomei and D'Onofrio are people you actually care about; that alone makes the movie superior to 99% of what passes as romantic comedy these days.

A nice bonus is the believable relationship Tomei has with her parents, especially her Mom (who gives her daughter a pep talk about love that is one of the best scenes in the movie). Finally, a special nod to Holland Taylor, who just gets more terrific with the years, in a crucial supporting role.(One word of warning: if you ever do get a chance to see this in the movie theaters, don't.

We did not make it very far into the story, as it was so foul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time travel? Really?","review":"I stopped watching when she started beating the crap out of him. I love Marissa Tomei, but I couldn't finish this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful movie","review":"What an awful movie. Horrible acting of the main male character combined with a degenerate plot. I walked out after giving it 30 minutes of my life, and was followed by another family member in another 5 minutes. My husband made it till the end only to find out if it was worth the suffering of watching it. He said he was amazed to find out that the ending made the movie even less intelligent to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good actors---weak story line","review":"The acting was superb but the story line was pretty weak. The movie would have been a lot better if it were a lot shorter. It seemed to go on and on and I guessed some of the surprises before they happened. Watch it if you're curious. I don't think it deserves all the rave reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indie and Sci-Fi should NEVER mix.","review":"I'm a sucker for a good love story, and this was definitely not one of them. Yes, I will give the actors credit for making the most of their parts, but I watched this movie with a raised eyebrow the entire time, and never felt a true connection to their relationship. This is mainly due to the fact that the storyline was completely unrelatable. If it takes high dollar Hollywood to ensure a good love story (most of the time), then so be it. This movie, however, I found to be almost painful to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the reviews from the people that gave this movie 1 star","review":"Not sure why some people said this movie kept them smiling, as it is not actually trying to be funny most of the time. Marisa Tomei has tears in her eyes more often then a smile on her face.Pretty slow and nowhere near as good as all these Amazon reviews lead us to believe. Even at just $2.99 I feel we could have found something better to occupy our two hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"Tomei has been one of our favorites actresses and we bought the DVD on that basis. Wow, has she gone downhill. Dumb story line too. Have gotten rid of the DVD since we have absolutely no inclination to watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"B - Movie -Don't waste your money","review":"This a B quality movie. Good actors in a poor quality movie. Very slow, dumb movie. I do not understand the other reviews that say good things about this movie. Don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Film About Time Travel That Will Waste Your Time","review":"I guess I don't share the artistic sensibilities of the other reviewers that have posted their reviews. Nonetheless I give this \\"little\\" film two thumbs down - way down - in fact if they were any lower they would be hell. That's how far down. While the story's plot is intriguing, its execution would be considered cruel and unusual punishment for the audience. Long slow moving story about a man from the future returns to the past to save a girl's life. Painful, unfulfilling and a predictable ending. He saves her life - hopefully revealing the ending will save some of you from wasting your time watching this like I did. Now I wish someone from the future would come back and save me from watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"One god-awful movie...a waste of time","review":"We had never heard of this movie before, and we thought, 'Marisa Tomei, Vincent D'Onofrio, in what appears to be a romance story....might be pretty good.'Nothing could be further from the truth. This is without a doubt one of the worst movies we have *ever* seen. Incoherent story line, nothing in it to hook your interest, *bad* acting (especially from these two usually great actors -- what were they thinking when they agreed to make this pile of *&%$#@%?).Our only conclusion was that (1) they did it just for the money, or (2) whoever edited the thing left the coherent, good acting/scenes on the cutting room floor, and spliced together this mess with the leftovers.DON'T waste your time on this --- you've been warned!! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves to Be Better Known","review":"A low-budget movie based on such a far-fetched premise could have been a disaster, but great acting by Tomei and D'Onofrio (as well as supporting actors like Taylor) makes it emotionally-believable. The subdued soundtrack and hand-held camera work also fits well; and careful editing makes up for the lack of action or special-effects wizardry. Despite the time travel premise, this is not a \\"sci-fi\\" movie: it's a romantic comedy along the lines ofKate & Leopold--with a lower budget and more subtlety. Although Anderson'sNext Stop Wonderlandis a better picture, Happy Accidents has some of the same charm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet comedy romance - No Spoilers","review":"Its not your average predictable movie. Always enjoy Vincent for his quirky being and twitching, came in handy for this part. Tomei is very beautiful and easy to follow through the movie. This is a nice rainy day movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"terrific romantic comedy/time travel story","review":"Happy Accidents is a charming romantic comedy starring Vincent D'Onofrio as Sam and Marisa Tomei as Ruby, who is tired of dating losers. When she meets Sam she dares to hope that her string of bad luck has run its course -- until Sam tells her that he is actually from the year 2470 and has come back to the past to find her. Should Ruby go along with his fantasy/delusion, as her friend advises, or dump him?This is a fun comedy. The leads are terrific and the supporting cast is flawless. DVD features are minimal, but the commentary with writer-director Anderson and star D'Onofrio is entertaining. Subtitles are also available in Spanish, and that's about it.Great date film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and touching","review":"I'm not a Maria Tomei fan. But here's a film that not only makes her look truly lovely, it gives her an opportunity to shine. It also has Tovah Feldshuh (who in the past has regularly played a deeply annoying attorney on Law & Order) giving a fine, controlled performance as Tomei's mother. The movie, of course, is D'Onofrio's. His character is just so unpredictable (light years beyond his over-the-top, yet immensely watchable geekiness on L & O Criminal Intent) in every way, that without any evident effort he makes the movie entirely his own. Is he a time-traveler, or is he just charmingly nuts? There are hilarious moments, warm and touching moments, confusing moments--all leading to a hugely gratifying conclusion. The editing is tight as a tick, the performances are all spot-on, and New York actually looks like a place where you might want to live (as long as you don't mind relaxing in a state of danger). Catch this one!Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Accidents is a real gem","review":"I'm a Marisa Tomei fan, so I was inclined to like this movie, but I was unprepared for its inventiveness and clever scripting. Ms. Tomei's performance was nuanced and engaging as was Vincent D'Onofrio's. This is essentially a two character play, and without their ability to make us believe in what we're seeing, the whole movie would dissolve into drivel. While that might be true of almost any movie, this one in particular has a plot that's a bit far fetched, so credibility is central to enjoying and appreciating this film.I promise you, unless you're a dyed-in-the-wool meanie, you'll just love this story and the two performances that deliver it. This is really an undiscovered gem of a movie.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic . . . with a great back story.","review":"I was searching for something to give me a good Vincent D'Onfrio fix, imagine the joy of finding a movie with him AND Marisa Tomei!!This movie is every bit as good as \\"My Cousin Vinny\\" was. Very good cast, very well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky Romantic Comedy","review":"If you like the main actors, you will most likely like the movie. It's quirky, it's different, and has humor incidents probably more women than men will identify with. I would say more of a chick flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"charming and addictive","review":"Take a break from all the high budget special effects movies and enjoy a wonderfully charming movie with a heart and a brain. It's not your typical sugary sweet romance. Instead we're given a treat of quick and funny dialogue exchanges and a suspense factor that will keep you hooked til the end. Listening to a couple argue had never been so much fun. Tomei and D'Onofrio are great. I rented the movie on Netflix.com and couldn't bring myself to return it until I had my own copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grab it, before it goes back from where it came","review":"Like Vincent D'Onofrio's John Malkovich-meets-Rain Man time traveler, this sort of popped up in my local video store one day, seemingly out of the blue, and charmed the heck out of me. I had never even heard of it, which is too bad--it's a haunting little movie that deserves a much wider audience.Before I get started, a question: Why is Marisa Tomei so marginalized? Between this and \\"In the Bedroom\\" she has given us 2 excellent recent performances; why no major gigs? Is it her incredibly low hairline? Her non-starlet proportions? Honestly, that's all I could think about after watching her--it can't be her plentiful talent.Anyway, this is a very well-done time-travel piece a la \\"La Jette\\" or its modern counterpart, \\"12 Monkeys.\\" If, like me, you're a sucker for the genre, by all means, buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album that's very enjoyable","review":"I really enjoy this album.

They do give a nice light, so I gave them 2 stars, but they aren't worth it if they don't last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap but don't last","review":"These bulbs just don't last long. I installed probably around 20 in various fixtures throughout my house. Some faster than others, they started to die a premature death. I'm not sure why they go so quickly, but it's just not worth using these bulbs. The color is ok, but nothing to write home about. It certainly does not make up for the fact that these must just be made cheaply and burn out very fast.I will not be buying more, nor would I recommend these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"Maybe I got a bad batch. But one light went out after two weeks of intermittent use. The other two are still working after four weeks but I am wondering fit its worth the cost. A bit disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great bulbs, only 3 of 4 worked","review":"The bulbs are great. I have to give 1 star because 1 bulb out of 4 burned out the moment I turned on the lamp. Others worked fine in the same lamp, so I have to assume it was the bulb. So - you might not be getting as super a cost deal as this appears to be. Packing protection in the box was minimal for a light bulb. This may be the culprit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings out the colors of woodwork","review":"My home has an extensive amount of red oak woodwork. These bulbs make the wood look substantially deeper and richer. I think that a lot of the mixed reviews here are due to the environment where they are used. I can imagine that the difference is not as noticeable if they are used in a room with white walls and beige carpet. However, when it comes to bringing out the deep, rich colors of woodwork (especially darker woods) these bulbs make a major difference in my home.Enjoy them while you can still get them - I don't know if GE will have an equivalent product when the U.S. ban on incandescent bulbs begins to take effect in a few years and we are only allowed to buy Obama bulbs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont use on a dimmer! Horrible Buzzing/singing noise","review":"I would say the the light is different. Like those people who put the blue headlights in their car trying to be like an expensive car? Not sure if its better or worse, just different. I am using the 75 watt flood lamps in 6\\" recessed can lights in my office. I have them on a dimmer, and have tried several very expensive dimmers in an attempt to make the horrible filament buzz go away, to no avail. I will never buy these bulbs again. They are really cheaply made, and also have a very short life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good representative book on Forest Green Glass","review":"As a casual collector of Anchor Hocking forest green glass over 30 years, this was my first ever book I'd ever gotten (or seen) dedicated to my favorite type of glass. I was thrilled to see that nearly everything I had was represented and it gave me better background about the items. I used it that very weekend to recognize a small green vase I would otherwise have not known was anchor hocking (had gold paint on it). But don't use the prices as indications of the real value of the items, unless maybe yours are new-never-used still in original boxes. you couldn't sell your collection fo the prices listed I don't believe -- I'm still picking them up for just a few dollars at \\"junk\\" stores,and yard sales.

Each sentence is powerful and creative. I don't often read a book twice let alone study and then buy a book for long term ownership. Of all thousands of books read I only own a few. This book has hundred of insightful observations regarding American culture possibly from a Marxist/ Freudian perspective. Everytime you read it there is more to it. It's like reading hundreds of books all in one volume.

We got this as a gift, assuming it would be like \\"Bill Cosby\\" clean comedy with Christian themes. The DVD is about 1/2 interview/commentary, and 1/2 staged comedy. Except for the ending statement about the comedy being intended to encourage the (Christian) audience, the little encouragement in it came primarily from the struggles shared during the interviews. Although much of Brad Stine's material could have been funny, his fire&brimstone yelling-preacher delivery conveys his apparent ignorance. I also found Brad's (and his wife's) goal for him to be immortalized a bit vain. The team in general had mostly funny material, though where's the creativity in constantly degrading family members, church groups, or other people-groups ? Ron Pearson's material seemed the most creative, and was very well delivered. Jeff Allen and Tony Griffith also had some good material and good delivery."},{"rating":"2","title":"These guys are amazing!!!!!!!!!","review":"Review by Adrian EssigmannMy kids watched this video so much I finally had to limit them.

ALOL are far more hardcore influenced as well, there are quite good \\"dancey\\" bits. The artwork is pretty nifty also, done by Jacob Bannon. There are also some great pearls of genius thrown in there if you LISTEN TO THE ALBUM MORE THAN ONCE.

A Life Once Lost occupies a place on the sonic soundscape that resembles their Pittsburgh area cousins Zao filtered through the complex rhythms of Meshuggah.This record exhibits many of the qualities of what would later come to define the genre of \\"Djent,\\" namely the metalcore re-imagining of de-tuned math-metal by Meshuggah.

The first three were historical romances in which she nailed it. She clearly forgot the formula which made the trilogy so popular. The way the characters came together was way too contrived even when you want to suspend belief because you're reading for entertainment--not to mention the unnecessary addition of some characters becoming \\"joined\\" mentally with others. Well, there I did mention it. It seemed clearly created to add some drama that was more difficult to create in modern day than in the fifteenth century apparently."},{"rating":"1","title":"LETDOWN!","review":"What a disappointment. Iris Johansen's past books have been so entertaining, that she has become an author whose books I purchase even before reading the cover notes. This story seems to have been merely thrown together, however, not fully developed. The dialogue is grossly bland and silly, with the storyline extremely far fetched and contrived. I found myself skimming over passages wanting it over and done with. I think Ms. J should revert to plots that are more realistic, this paranormal stuff, especially with such shallow underdeveloped characters doesn't fly. This copy of the book is definately on its way to the thrift store, it's not at all a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Final Target","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I should have waited for the copy at the library! The character development was poor and a lot of questions remain at the end of the book. Somehow the characters didn't seem real to me. The Search, The Face of Deception, and The Ugly Duckling were MUCH better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money!","review":"I am struggling through this book. I paid for it and I will read it. It is one of the most ridiculous books I have read in a long time. I have read other books by this author and enjoyed them. I realize, now, that they all have the same theme. The sexy, dangerous man involved in questionable activities who obviously has a feminine side because men do not think the way she has these men thinking. Then you have the female in the story who barks orders to this dangerous man in what is supposed to come off as macho, I guess. It is just plain silly! This book is disjointed, unbelievable and down right amaturish. But, I WILL FINISH IT!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a RIOT!","review":"At first I was annoyed at having bought a book so poorly written but now it's become quite the thrill for me. I actually laugh out loud at the silly plot. Pure cheese. It's a wonder some of these books actually get printed. I may have to give it a whirl myself now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my type","review":"There's no doubt the author attempted to imbue Melissa with strength, but it turned out sounding more like fool heartiness. I stopped reading when the book fell off into the cliche of when the brave but foolish woman charges out into danger and falls right into the bad guy's trap. Of course, the hero comes to her rescue. Also, Melissa's convenient psychic connection with Cassie means that she is quite typically saddled with a child. How respectable; please pardon my retching. My impression of Melissa was of a woman who was crazed by her emotions into reckless behavior while Travis came off sounding like the typical dark hero: cool, in control and desperatly trying to restrain a madwoman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'd read many other books by Iris Johansen and enjoyed them thoroughly. This one, however, was a chore to get through. The plot was constrived and highly unbelievable and the characters were underdeveloped and boring. The only reason I finished the book was that I was hoping it would get better and it never did. Too bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Iris Johansen's best work","review":"I'm a fan of Iris Johansen, but feel this particular book fell short of her usual talent for story telling.The strongest and most likable character in FINAL TARGET is the hero, Michael Travis, who is a smuggler and a thief and uses other people to do the majority of his dirty work.The heroine, Melissa Riley, struck me as harsh and irrational and I found it difficult to care for her. Her past and her motto of living life to the fullest was a bit overplayed.The plot was a stretch, at best. Kidnapping the President of the United States young daughter is ridiculous.I also found the dialogue stiff and formal--not natural.However, a character that has shown up in other tales by Ms. Johansen, Galen, is, as always, charming. He is a fairly minor character, again, in this tale. And, honestly, the talents he possesses are far-fetched, but he's likable enough you won't hold that against him.Shelley Dawn, author ofSweet, Sweet JessieandDark Nights"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me!","review":"I probably made the mistake of reading this book right after the Wind Dancer trilogy as I had read that it was a sequel. That was probably a mistake as i enjoyed the trilogy tremendously. The books were beautifully written, fast paced but not too rushed, emotional. Then came Final Target and the great disappointment. I must admit, I read the book about halfway through, then skipped most of the rest to read the final chapter. I just could not bring myself to finish it properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring boring boring","review":"Stopped reading it halfway.

There is romance inher story but she keeps it second to the thriller, as in my estimation she should. She has always written top flight books and she just gets better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Iris needs more time to write and edit","review":"I liked the two main characters but they really needed more development. Michael seemed cool but it was confusing what he did in life. I liked Melissa in the first two chapters then her character became weird. Of course there is nothing wrong with Sean Gaylen. Iris should continue savorying his character and not blow it with a quick story. I think she needs to stay away from quick writes hardbound versions and go back to what made her books really tempting and that was great character development, a suspense that was real and some heavy substance. I wouldn't recommend this book in hardbound version. It is too pricey per word."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Formulaic","review":"I actually liked the first few books by this author that I read. But when each succeeding book is basically the same, with basically the same dialogue, it gets a little silly. There is always the brooding, dangerous, slightly illegal hero, with the strong, decent but also slightly illegal sidekick and the heroic, plucky, basically perfect female lead, who always reluctantly falls in love with the brooding hero, all the while saying \\"bull\\" and \\"damn\\" and \\"hell\\" (these sure seem to be her favorite dialogue words) alot. If you like repeating that formula like groundhog day, you'll love this book; otherwise a time-waster."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hero with Real Feet of Clay and a Heroine You","review":"Yes the plot was a little over the top, but I willingly went along for the ride, enjoying it most of the way. I was hooked right from the get go, concerned for Cassie as sees her traitorous nanny and her Secret Service protection killed and worried about her when she goes into the catatonic coma. I found myself hoping psychiatrist Jessica Riley and her sister Melissa could get through to her and I didn't find the mysterious Michael and his mysterious connection to Cassie so far fetched at all. Maybe the sweeping saga is too much for this book, I don't know, but I liked it. I especially liked the fact that both the Secret Service and the horribly evil Deschamps are after our heroes at the same time. And I also liked the connection between this book and Johansen's Wind Dancer romantic trilogy, so five stars it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"bland - don't waste your time","review":"Lacks intelligence needed to support a true thriller - stereotypical situation with an absence of character development and plot depth.

I have been waiting for another of Iris Johansen's books since I finished The Search and I must say, this was not what I thought it would be. The characters in the story were really weak and one dimensional. Also, the plot was too unbelievable for me to enjoy. I think communication through dreams is something Kay Hooper would write (and probably with better success). I hope her next book is closer to reality, like most of her previous books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Convoluted tale that wasn't overly believable","review":"Heard the taped version of Iris Johnansen's FINAL TARGET,a somewhat convoluted tale about a kidnapped girl who justhappens to be the daughter of the President of the UnitedStates . . .

I alsofound Carolyn McCormick's narration excellent; in fact, muchbetter than the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"Basically, here you have a romance writer trying to produce an action thriller. Very bad idea. There's a wildly implausible plot hanging on the idea of a mysterious psychic connection between two of the characters.

I can usually suspend disbelief enough to enjoy a book of this kind, but not if it's completely off in goofyland, as in the case here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I really enjoyed Ms. Johansen's past novels. Final Target, however, falls short of expectations. While the plot could have been interesting (had it been developed), the out-of-this-world, ESP aspect was a real turnoff.

I don't like her writing style at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Disappointment","review":"As an extremely avid reader, I can usually find something good in every book I read, but this book was not one of them.The plot, characters and storyline were totally unbelievable. I never grew to care about any of the characters, although the main male character, Michael Travis, was tolerable. The female characters were just obnoxious.The telekenetic aspect was ridiculous and grew tiresome very quickly. The political aspect was just way too much -It got boring and confusing. The characters had absolutely no chemistry together and I had a hard time telling who the main character even was, Melissa or Jessica. The entire book just seriously lacked any sort of substance.I stuck it out until the very end, hoping it would get better, but no such luck.

There was no character development, so you have no idea what is going on with them. The dialogue is cheesy, and it is just plain boring!

Luckily, I picked this up at the library and did not waste any money on it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to the standard set by previous books","review":"This book did not meet the expectations set by having read the previous mystery/thrillers by Iris Johansen. The characters lacked depth and seemed to be thrown together. The book only skimmed the surface of the story. At first, it was difficult to tell who the main character of the story was, and the twist that occurred was a rude and disruptive way to establish the main character.The book had some great elements: The Wind Dancer, the president's daughter in a catatonic state, a submject who had experience with this kind of rescue, an enigmatic hero, a ruthless killer. These should have made a great story, but didn't.I am a die-hard fan of Iris Johansen who was very disappointed in this book. I may have to go back to read some of her previous books just to regain some joy in her wrting. Her previous books, The Ugly Duckling, And Then You Die, Faces of Deception were MUCH MUCH better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I liked this book a lot. There is adventure, science fiction, drama and female heriones who actually help save other people.(I'm tired of the story line of the male hero with the dingy female who keeps messing things up.) The book surprised me with different plots and kept me on edge. I read it every free moment in two days. (I'm a mom and work full time.)The main character dies and the story ends up with the point of view of another character. I don't think I've read a book before that did this. It actually flowed well even with the character change."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum","review":"This is a very so,so thriller.

The story did captivate from the first few pages... but I think the author needs to purchase a thesaurus. How many times can one use the phrase \\"She narrow her eyes\\" on someone's face or \\"She moistened her lips.\\" Didn't any editor pick up on this? I was getting annoyed each time I saw the same words over and over. If you pick up this book, do me a favor and keep track - I can't bare to re-read this... I didn't find that I [cared] about any of the characters - especially Jessica. She seemed a little too closed-minded for a shrink. I wanted to finish it rather quickly just to move on to something better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gripping Read","review":"I disagree with some of the negative reviews I've read. I really enjoyed this one by Johansen. While it doesn't contain her more popular characters, it does introduce you to some equally compelling new ones. I read this one rather quickly, as I could not stay away from it for very long. The story sucked me in rather fast and definitely held my attention. If you like great suspense drama, you won't be disappointed with this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Destined to become a great doorstop.","review":"I'm sorry - but this book was very, very mediocre. Not only were the characters unconvincing, but everything from the dialogue to the story settings to the plot was way overdone. I got a headache from rolling my eyes at language like \\"Cassie's scream tore through the room; Michael wasn't the kind of man to show his feelings; Melissa's eyes went wide with terror\\". Everytime you turn around somebody's having some sort of melodramatic episode. It wasn't long till I was checking to see how much longer the book went on. Save your time and money: read the synopsis above and be on your way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I just recently read Iris Johansen's The Search, and I expected a book of similar quality out of Final Target. Unfortunately, I found that this book far undershot that goal. I was interested in the beginning, partly because the story was at least somewhat intriguing. I was a bit surprised that the author altered protagonists partway into the book. That threw me off, because that sort of character development is entirely unusual. I am not sure if I am allowed to say this, but I'll try... I also did not find any reason to actually like all the main characters, and I found the villan extremely unconvincing. At one point in the book, I found myself hoping something would happen (ie, all characters get shot) so that I could stop reading it. The only reason I completed the book was because it was so short, and I am extremely obsessive about finishing books. All in All, this book is not worth buying used. I hope her next books exceed this one in quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Implausible, a real disappointment","review":"This story was just too convulted, implausible and just plain boring. Too much going on with Michael Travis with the Russians, the CIA, Deschamps. Began to be unbelievable when the President actually allows an unsavory hero to be at the same location as his daughter who is in a catatonic state (like there's no place else in the world to hide out!)yet tells the Riley sisters not to talk to him. How they are able to sneak out of the US to Amsterdam, another implausibility. Couldn't wait to finish it so I could move on to another story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the plot???","review":"This book started with a bang--the attempted abduction of a First Daughter, treachery by a trusted nanny, and the introduction of characters who seemed interesting at first glimpse. Unfortunately, the plot falls apart--too many unrelated and unbelievable subplots--the CIA and manmade Russian diamonds, a mysterious mental link between the President's daugher and her 'rescuers', and a golden statue with alleged special powers. There's also a lot of soap opera type dialogue about strong women, living life to the fullest, sharing 'joy' and seeking revenge. The main characters are never brought fully to life and a promising beginning soon becomes muddled.Although I'm a fan of this author's previous books, I will definitely not buy any new offerings....and I'm very glad that this one only cost me the 25 cent library reserve fee!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great read, exciting and good characters","review":"great story! i like the development of the female lead, her romance, the intrigue - it was just too short!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Final Target","review":"I've always love Iris Johansen's writing.

Happy read!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected MUCH more","review":"This was the first Johansen book I read and it might well be the last. Actually Final Target was not that bad, but very close.The main flaw of the story was the lack of any background. Not only characters' background, but also information about the trauma condition and all the psycho-related things going on.And they were hardly believable. Toward the end it turns almost ridiculous.I was amazed by Johansen's lack of vocabulary. First the book has no descriptions whatsoever, that would establish some kind of mental picture of what and where the action is taking place. But also Johansen keeps using the same and the same words and phrases thorughout the whole book. Her characters \\"shudder,\\" \\"stiffen\\" and \\"twist their lips\\" at least a couple of times in each chapter.As if the book was written overnight. No editing at all.If I can employ Johansen's style to comment on her book:\\"Bland. Plain. Boredom.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"SNORE....this is an Iris Johansen book???","review":"I love everything Iris Johansen writes or I guess I should say loved.....everything she wrote before this one. It was all I could do to finish it. I agree with a previous reviewer that it is not up to her usual par and also very convoluted. I would recommend any other book by her but if you just have to read this buy it used or get it from the library. Hopefully her next one will be as good as her previous books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great variation on history!","review":"This is a very interesting variation on times in 1745. You find yourself transported to a fantasy world that is vastly different than the history we know. The story is shorter than most full-size novels (around 3000 locations on kindle), but it reads like a full book. It is very well-written, flows smoothly from beginning to end, and has great character development. Willie has a knack for writing in a way that you see the story like a movie rather than reading it.I really enjoyed reading this novel and look forward to reading the rest of the books in the trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extrordinarily Angry","review":"I purchased this kit to use on a rebuild for an existing motor. I stored it very carefully so that I would be confident in the contents. When I received the motor back from the machine shop, I pulled the pristine box from the shelf and began sorting the gaskets. The only issue was that the head gasket was bent right down the middle of cylinders 2 and 3. The fire ring around cylinder 3 has lifted away from the surrounding material. While all of this would be under pressure once assembled, I cannot in good conscience use this gasket. Which means I'm stuck with purchasing an additional gasket that I should have absolutely no need for. To add insult to injury, Amazon's return policy does not allow for any modification to the order now that I'm outside of the return window.

Each word is well-chosen, effective, and yet easy to read. At one point in the book, he alludes that he has written poetry previously. Each of the 39 chapters is a few pages long, presenting a brief essay on something related to garlic farming in New Mexico. There's an obvious love and care that he gives to his work (both garlic farming and writing), and he's able to show respect for others who have not chosen this path. The book also presents some information about how garlic is grown, but it's by no means a gardening book. It's a descriptive story of the cycles of the growing season. Like in his other excellent book, Mayordomo, the author also shares his community with us - talking about how farming, farmers markets, irrigation, and such intertwine a community, even one that contains members who originally went there to \\"get away from it all.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"One of my favorite books...I tend to \\"re-read\\" books every so often, and I figured it was time I got my own copy.

The mix is the worst of any of the original-lineup Byrds lps that were reissued. Compared to \\"Notorius Byrds Brothers\\" and \\"Younger Than Yesterday\\", \\"5-D\\" sounds like sonic sludge - everything is wrong with it aurally. Even the bonus tracks sound bad, so this is a combination of original bad production, and bad CD remastering. Ugh.Aside from those production gripes, the music and playing is fine, and a lot of it is underrated.If you're new to the Byrds, I would recommend you get NOTORIOUS or YOUNGER THAN YESTERDAY rather than 5-D.

In the white light of contemporary guitarists like Hendrix, Clapton and Jeff Beck, Jim McGuinn's incendiary 12-string solo on \\"Eight Miles High\\" has never received its due credit, and yet it remains the definitive fusion solo of our time. John Coltrane's ghost was in that studio sippin' a cool one with Django Rheinhart. No subsequent guitar god short of John McLaughlin has ever come close to burning up a guitar neck like McGuinn did on \\"Eight Miles High\\". David Crosby seemed to be in perfect sync with McGuinn with compositions like \\"I See You\\" and \\"What's Happenin'? \\" The Byrds went into a new zone with \\"5D\\" that carried over to the jazzy compositions on \\"Notorious Byrds Brothers\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Best of the Byrds...but","review":"I personally feel that the Byrds represent the best of the 60's and certainly are the most important American band from that era.

I personally feel that \\"Younger Than Yesterday\\", \\"Tamborine Man\\", and \\"Notorious\\" are their supreame creations. However, any CD with \\"Eight Miles High\\" on it is worth having.

Chao is able to capture the political repression and the nature of the outdated attitudes towards women during that time.

I'm sure other books by Ms. Boynton are as well, although I don't own many of them to read to my 9 month-old daughter. And I love singing and dancing and being no-limits goofy with my daughter. But this book is terrible. Lyrics to a children's song should still have the same basic qualities of other songs - they should make sense when said, not just sang, and they should further a story or an idea in some way. This song has neither quality. Seriously considering just removing it from the tiny person's library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Children's book","review":"Sandra Boynton has many clever and entertaining children's books available. This is certainly one of them. However, I add the following caveat: you would probably not enjoy reading it to your child if you are a traditional male or a person that would prefer not to express affection openly. I certainly hope that there are some other males out there that are comfortable with more openly loving on their child. I just wanted to make sure that you know what you're purchasing. The book is composed as a love song to your child from the perspective of a mother dog to its puppy (mother to child). If you don't enjoy expressing overt affectionate feelings toward your child, you probably won't enjoy reading this book to your child. If you do, however, it's a good opportunity to lay a couple of good kisses on the 'little puppy' that you love."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have!","review":"Our whole family adores this book.

Yes, books should be fun and have colorful illusrtations, but I would rather read something that has a story/plot.

Mr. Cale's songwriting is excellent, what a wonder he is. One very pleasant surprise was the late Billy Preston playing organ and piano, the recording and engineering brings out the punch in Mr. Preston's playing.

I am a parent of a high schooler and highly recommend this book. David does an excellent job of preparing the reader for the temptations of \\"Sodom\\" found on many college campuses (and many high school campuses as well). He teaches the reader how avoid the temptations by establishing the habits of a godly lifestyle. This book would be very helpful for any young adult ready to go out on his/her own, college bound or not. The same temptations are there in and out of college."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Must-Read\\" Book","review":"I wish I could have read this book 15 years ago! College lasts such a short time, but makes a significant impact on the rest of your life. David does an excellent job of describing the pitfalls that await students the minute they step on campus. He then provides them the tools to avoid the traps, and not just get by, but Overcome! I like his significant use of Scripture as the foundation for everything he says. His writing style is personal, easy to read, and very easy to remember. He engages the reader immediately and keeps your interest throughout.Should be a must-read for every Christian student who wants to make the most of college, not let it make the most of them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of books (or movies) with the word \\"Club\\" in the title.","review":"If you loved that Cassavettes movie Husbands, you may like this book though. In fact, I bet Michaels was a big fan of Cassavettes and that movie in particular. I thought that there was some good writing in this book, but it was too self-indulgent and kind of childish in attitude. I much preferred his earlier novel Sylvia. But I can see how The Men's Club was a huge influence on lots of macho writers who came later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"A young dog and his woodland companions teach us the importance of family and friends in our lives, and that loyalty and courage can come in all shapes, sizes and species. A beautifully written and highly entertaining story that will make you both laugh and cry, A Friend Indeed was a joy to read. A must read for youngsters and adults alike!"}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},N={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],x={key:0},H={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",N,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",H,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",x,"See more"))],8,O)):b("",!0)])}const B=d(M,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-455b6cff"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/42.md","filePath":"guide/42.md"}'),R={name:"guide/42.md"},P=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(B)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
