I'll admit, when I heard samples of this, I thought Rod had sold out. However, he's taken his 80's sound (Which had run it's gambit) to the next level. It's a new sound, a little contemporary, but it's still 100%, CLASSIC ROD STEWART! All in all, this is one of his best albums of the last ten years! WELCOME BACK, ROD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"This is not the best Rod Stewart album. I enjoyed it but I would not recomend it to a casual fan. The title song is not very good it is not Rod's best style (although he's better at it than *NSTYNK. My favorite tracks are 'I Can't Deny It' 'Loveless' and the duet with that Helicopter Girl.Although this is a very good CD, out of his last three albums (When We Were The New Boys, this CD, and It Had To Be You...The Great American Songbook) When We Were The New Boys is first and this is last.If you are a big Rod fan buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't deny it....it's really bad","review":"Don't buy this disc...It stinks. No, I'm not talking about Rod's voice...I'm talking about over-production, overuse of electronic, synthetic, sampled garbage. Rod has real talent...he should use it. If you like \\"Every Picture Tells A Story\\" or \\"When We Were The New Boys\\", stay away from this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta Love Rod !!!","review":"That Voice- That Style- That Charisma.Rod has one of the most unusual voices in the industry. The fact that he is still around belting out the tunes is proof that the man is doing something right. This CD is so chock full of great songs. Some deep, some light but most of all just right. The single, \\"I can't deny it\\", just grows on you and your are snapping your fingers and doing a little shutterbug around the house. If you love the sounds of Maggie May and some of his older works, then you will like this CD because it's modern yet still very much Rod without all the extra mumbo jumbo to cloud over his voice.I rank this right up there with one of the must have CD's for the year. It's on the heavy rotation along with Sade and David Grey. Get this, you won't be sorry !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Boy Meets Vampire?","review":"This is your typical \\"boy meets vampire\\" book. What am I saying? No, it's NOT! This is the Christopher Moore version, which means it is off the wall-crazy.Tommy, a nineteen -year-old from Indiana, moves to San Francisco to be a writer. Jody, who has just become a vampire, latches onto Tommy to do her bidding in the daytime. Romance (or at least sex and bloodsucking) ensues.Tommy, who works the nightshift at a local grocery store (just until the writing thing takes off), tries to help Jody learn what vampires can and can't do by reading all the best-selling vampire books. There is also a hunt for another vampire who is trying to frame Jody and Tommy for some brutal murders committed in the bay area. Tommy's crew from the grocery store takes time off from their past times, such as turkey bowling, to help in the hunt.Along the way Moore brings his brand of humor to the club scene, dating, vampire lore, and turtle care. This is a funny book that has a surprisingly interesting plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"I had fun with this one","review":"Listening to the dialogue and interplay between the characters is what sets the tone for me in Christopher Moore's Bloodsucking Fiends. Vampire stories really aren't my thing, even lighthearted ones such as this, but watching Jody figure out what to do next while Tommy tries to keep up with her made this a good read for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Comedic Novels Ever","review":"This book actually had me laughing out loud on crowded rush-hour subway trains, so beware if such behavior embarrasses you. As comedic novels go, this is one of the greatest. I also think it's Moore's best work, and I've read them all.I particularly like how the vampire and her human boyfriend test the limits of her powers, (like by seeing how long she can hold her breath underwater in the bathtub).I've bought copies of this book for at least five people I know and every single one has enjoyed it. If you like comedic novels, or want to buy one for someone, this is as close to sure thing as I can figure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny novel with some flaws","review":"Like an earlier novel by Moore that I read, COYOTE BLUE, this one will stimulate a loud laugh on every page. If I have one complaint about it, it is that it's over-researched... you can almost hear Moore pull out the index card every few pages, and say... 'it's time now to do women's magazines.' 'Now it's time to do night crews at supermarkets.' And so on. Also, in both COYOTE BLUE and BLOODSUCKING FIENDS, he seems to have problems with endings. But, hell, CB was only his 2nd novel! His situations are so funny and his observations so cruelly sharp that you'll keep reading, even if things annoy you... such as the hero of BF suddenly apparently dropping about 75 IQ points just so his idiocy can stir up the plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreadfully witty vampire romance","review":"I averaged better than one laugh out loud per page, so I'll submit my first online review ever and strongly suggest you pick this one up. Expect to finish it as fast as you can make time.

It is a veiw into the atmosphere in the bay area. The five (or six) wongs in the story are heartwarming, it brings a tear to my eye just thinking of that romance. I suggest reading this book just to stop and smell the Peary."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Didn't Like Airplane Either...","review":"I will not give up on Christopher Moore entirely, just yet. I was told by a woman, whose opinion I trust, that he is very funny and that Bloodsucking Fiends is the worst example of his humor. That's a relief because I didn't find this funny at all. It was too much for me. It reminded me of the movie Airplane. Slapstick on paper. Just too ridiculous and silly to actually be funny. Hoping for better luck next time with this author..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't know what to expect...","review":"With all the vampire stories out there right now, I really didn't know what to expect. I entered this book very cautiously. Here we have a young lady who is trying to get used to life as a vampire and a young, nieve boy just trying to find his way in life. Mix all of this together along with numerous other charcters (alive, dead, two legged, four legged, etc.) and what do you have?? Another Christopher Moore book! I enjoyed reading it, but when I reached the end, I realized that I really like what I just read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"I only gave Bloodsucking Fiends four stars because I read many of Christopher Moore's books and I enjoyed Lamb and Coyote Blue better. Still a great book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bloodsucking friends","review":"My son (15) and I have now both read this book (I have started 'you suck', and the boy is badgering me every day to get me to finish it so he can have it). It's a great anti-twilight; very funny, quite gritty and yet you still feel compassion for the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is it humor, fantasy or horror??","review":"I am captivated by Moore. A friend lent this book to me and I loved it. Moore writes with a style that makes his outlandish characters real... who else could make you laugh at a vampire?? Great read... read it in one day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest book I have read this year-and last year also","review":"I bought this book on a flyer-never heard of the author, but the cover was interesting. I thought it would be a half-hearted attempt at a humorous vampire story. The book was great. It read quickly (too quickly) and I was sorry it was over. I have just bought Practicle Demonkepping which holds the same promise as this book and I have the confidence that it will live up to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great Sci/Fi comedy","review":"It may be strange to say but I know people like these characters. The girl that can't be without a boyfriend... The cute boy that's too nice to attract girls... the punk guys working blue collar jobs... the jerk ex... the manipulitive ass who really wants someone - can have anyone - but doesn't know how to find the right someone.Maybe that's why the book is so much fun. It's relatable to some extent. Even with the vampires.Somebody that reviewed this said the characters felt distant. I agree. I also think that on a whole, it's easier to laugh at a distance. It's when you're too close that it's no longer funny (forget who said that). This isn't supposed to be a Anne Rice novel and thank god. It's violent, dark, honest, sweet and funny. Without shoving it down your throat.Excellent writing and story."},{"rating":"2","title":"she's dead, he's living, their lovers","review":"....light hearted, funny with a twist and turn and lots of fun in San Francisco.

I laughed out loud quite a bit while reading this book. It is well written and just plain funny. I look forward to the next book. I am also going back and reading other books by the author. He has a quick wit and a great way of looking at things. Some people have compared him with Douglas Adams, but I disagree with that. He IS funnier to me than Adams. I quess I never really got \\"Hitchiker\\" the way I got \\"Fiends\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different!","review":"Having read \\"Lamb\\" as my first Chris Moore novel, I was hoping this one would be as \\"LOL\\" funny...and when I started reading and realized it wasn't, I was disappointed. But I kept going and was quickly hooked by the characters and the surprises that each turn of the page brought. Definitely a new favorite!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Man does it again. Fast-paced, funny, couldn't put down!","review":"Only professional jealousy would make me give this book less than the top rating it deserves! Chris Moore has come up with the most ingenious solutions of all to the age-old problem of, what the heck do ya do with a vampire, now that you're in love with it? To tell more would be to detract from this delicious tale. If you enjoy witty writing and seeing regular folk reacting to very, er, Unique circumstances, read everything this guy writes, and no, we're not related. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Vampire and Her Boy","review":"A book you read in a day -- too good to put down and too funny not to share with a friend. The perils and pitfalls -- not to mention the humor and romance -- of dating and cohabitating with someone who isn't as alive (or as undead) as you are. Witty, sometimes kinky, and above all fun! One of the four books I've ever read that works, cover to cover.Books don't get any better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and totally hilarious...","review":"\\"Bloodsucking Fiends\\" is totally unlike anything I have ever read. I have quite a few vampire books, but this one was completely original. It tells the tale of a woman named Jody who is attacked one night and wakes later only to discover that she has been made into a vampire. Deciding that she needs a human servant to help her and take care of her during daylight, she gets together with a young melodramatic wanna-be writer named Tommy. Together the two of them are involved in some wildly hilarious situations.I dont read many male authors, so this was new for me and quite a treat. Christopher Moores writing style is unbelievably clever and funny. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've found another darkly funny author to kindle! Weeeeeee!","review":"Moore's darkly funny humor makes this a must read. Skillfully crafted, colorful characters put in impossible situations; a sweet young man who falls in love with a vampire. Not a very good one either, she was bitten hours before they met, but hey, she's hot. And then there's the 'Animals', a group of fun loving, partying down, pot smoking, beer drinking, gun toting buds who work the night shift at your local grocery store. Do they get the job done? Ah - Kindasorta - well not so much, but it's funny as hell watching them try. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention 'The Emperor', a street person, with two k-9 sidekicks, one of which has the uncanny ability to sniff out vampires. Now this could come in handy with a killer on the loose, bodies turning up blood drained and all.Just one laugh after another - I give Bloodsucking Fiends 4 stars out of 5. I'll be visiting this author again.Susan Stec, author, The Grateful Undead: They're so Vein"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life sucks and then you wake up a vampire","review":"Life can be tough for a gal in her late 20's, trying to deal with relationships, fashion, oh, and waking up a vampire.This little bit of dark humor by Christopher Moore takes a different perspective on the whole vampire thing and is told with a biting wit (no pun intended) that makes for a very quick read.While it is a bit of a love story, it is not a romance story, if that makes sense.This was a very enjoyable read. I can't wait to read more of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a vampire Bridget Jones","review":"San Francisco, my favorite city, is the perfect setting for this weird combination of a vampire story and a kind of Bridget Jones career-girl novel (but much much funnier than either progenitor).Christopher Moore's books usually start off with a chapter or two establishing the premise, then he appears to eat some weird mushrooms or something and get hallucinagenically funny. \\"Bloodsucking Fiends\\" is cheerfully wacko from the get-go when 26-year-old Jodi is attacked by a vampire in the first seconds of a book, turns into a creature of the night, and still manages to find true love with the night manager of a Safeway grocery store.In fact, the love story bit was so winsome that I was a bit disappointed when the story got genuinely macabre in the last few pages. As usual though, Moore's devotion to lunacy and his sharply-written minor characters more than compensate for a few loose ends in the plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A vampire send-up","review":"This is a 'fun' vampire novel. One night on the way home from work Jody gets turned into a vampire. Life gets strange from there-on in. She needs to survive and find out why the 'other' vampire is leaving bodies for the police to find to link to her.On the way she finds love, loot and blood. It's quite funny in parts.

Both are camp and a light hearted read....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half-hearted comedy with no point...","review":"Jody is your everyday \\"Jane\\" with an average life. That is until she's attacked and turned into a vampire. Now on her own Jody realizes that she needs human help. Enter would be author C. Thomas Flood. Now time is running out for the odd couple as they try and find out more about Jody's attacker and why he's setting them up for the series of killings plauging the city. \\"Blood Sucking Fiends...\\" is written in an erratic and skittish style, causing the story to jump rather than flow together. It also lacks substance and cohesiveness as if Moore came up with the initial idea and threw a bunch of \\"What If's?\\" around it. There are a few laughs but not enough to raise this book above its shortcomings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced","review":"Right of the bat, this review isn't about Moore's writing style or his stories themself (both of which I love) but rather the pricing.Unfortunately I'd picked up a paperback version of the sequel to this book first, 'You Suck' and was interested in getting this one for my Kindle. Prior to logging in, the book was priced at $11.99; after logging in the price jumped up to $19.38 due to 'applicable taxes'. 65% price increase for an ebook? Seems a little ridiculous to me.When ebooks start costing more than the paperback editions (this one is priced at $10.19) it's just sad.I'm sorry Moore, I'm a supporter but that is a bit much for as a college student. Maybe when the price drops..."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must read","review":"light, refreshing and fun to read, based on this book i am now ordering his other books and if they are 1/2 as good as this i would have spent my money well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute vampire comedy","review":"A vampire comedy about Jody, a woman who was recently made a vampire against her will. She has no clue what vampires are suppose to do in her situation but she figures she needs someone to do her bidding during the day. So she picks up Tommy, a gullible[]aspiring writer. Things are going as well as can be expected with Jody and Tommy until the vampire that turned her decides to screw with their heads.This book was pretty darn amusing and full of offbeat humor. I loved the oddball characters and quirky situations littered through out the book. I wasn't overly interested in the plot but that didn't really matter much. This is the only Christopher Moore book I've read but I'll most likely be reading more.

Interspersed are personal stories and testimonies which are, in Cho's unique style, disarming, humbling, and heart-warming.More than anything, Cho's heart for God and love for people raditates through the book.The mature believer and the Cho student may want to skip this book and buy \\"Apocalyptic Prohecy\\", \\"Prayer the Brings Revival\\", or \\"The Fourth Dimension\\" for meatier study.

I actually bought this solely for the purpose of cleaning my tongue. The straight firm compacted bristles helps remove all the gunk that other brushes or tongue scrapers leave behind. If you want a nice clean pink tongue, buy the 60 full head medium. It's the best for your teeth AND tongue."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"NARC\\" Quite Enough","review":"NARC, starring Jason Patric and Ray Liotta is a story not of good cop, bad cop, but of bad cop and worse cop.Both are undercover Narcotics officers in the Detroit police department. Both of their careers are in jeopardy and they are given one last chance in the murder investigation of a fellow officer. My thoughts:-Ray Liotta gives an extremely powerful performance. He has a larger than life presence and as a viewer, his rage is palpable.-Jason Patric's performance was OK, nothing special, but he and Liotta make a good duo.-In a bit part, Busta Rhymes of rap fame, gave a good performance as a suspected murderer.The plot and the writing are good and they do a good job of keeping things moving along. But, it just seemed like there was something lacking, so for this reason I only give it four stars. But, it is a gritty look at cops and their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"not your average cop flick","review":"This is not a glamorous movie. There are no fancy soundtracks to heighten your excitement, no ultra-adreneline pumped car chases to boost your blood pressure. However, the violence is realistic and will raise your awareness.The story is great...former narcotics cop is drawn back into the force (to the destruction of his family)to solve a murder of a undercover narcotics officer. He's partnered ( his own choice) wt/ the victim's former partner, Oak, a hot-headed, rule-bending widower. Two cops wt/ diff agendas and back grounds ( both get personal in the end)to resolve the case of a slain officer. Two points of view.Not a typical cop flick though, much more thought has been put into this one. It's raw-not for the average thrill seeker. Good movie, would watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark and mysterious","review":"This is Ray Liotta and Jason Patrics' best movies in years. They act their parts wonderfully with the darkness that fits \\"Narc\\". This is one of those movies that keeps you thinking about the truth for the whole movie. You think you know what's going on, but you always learn otherwise. That is what makes a great movie. However, \\"Narc\\" didn't receive enough recognition, only grossing in the seven-digits dollars. If you're looking for something unique and dark, rent this one. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"An underrated cop film","review":"Too few people saw this when it first came out. Who can blame them? It's dark, the opening is terrifying in its implications, and people like happy movies with happy endings that tie up neatly with a little red bow.If that's your thing, look elsewhere, Smiley. This ain't a Disney flick.Two fine actors, especially that Ray fella who needs to be in more films, take a story that never reveals too much of itself until necessary, and make it work. Corruption, drugs, honor, lies and partnership come together in a tale which ends on a very open note (another reason some people didn't like it). Is it a pleasant tale? No. But it is highly compelling.This is how cop movies should be made. Of course, \\"Miami Vice\\" is at the theatres as I write this, so apparently some people haven't gotten the memo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and boring","review":"I'm all for \\"guy movies\\". As a matter of fact, give me a good western or action-packed drama any day over sappy love stories that are basically rejects from the Lifetime channel (eeeuuuu!)This movie was so incredibly boring from the beginning that it was really hard to get to the chase scenes and the storyline. Ray Liotta (what a hunk!) plays a disturbing role as a cop on a vengence to find the murderer of his partner. Predictable acting. Predictable ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Story - Bad Directing","review":"It really is a shame, this has a really good story line. I think the director took alot away from the story, way over directed, should have left the movie roll on its own. Some of the camera scenes added were just there for effect, took from a very good story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY!!!!!!!!!

It's too close to reality of police brutality."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Small Gem in Well-Traveled Territory.","review":"This is a very good movie. The genre of bad-cops, vice etc. has been constantly taken apart and rebuilt in a hundred other movies over the last 20 years, not to mention in NYPD Blue and a dozen similar shows every day. There is no new ground here, so making this watchable and unique is really noteworthy.The performances were spare and clean. The conversations have a reality and depth that is impressive. The mystery element is unsolved and surprising right to the end.Joe Carnahan is a director with a careful eye for detail and very good dialogue and storytelling technique. I'm sure he'll soon be heading up larger projects.Ray Liotta is perhaps the only wrong note - if only because he's played some big teddy-bear types lately and the hard-edge character doesn't feel as real to me anymore. Perhaps someone else might have played it with more depth.I don't know if this is really necessary as a purchase, but it's a great rental - you will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the best film by Jason Patric","review":"Narc is one of my favorite cop films of all time. Patric plays a undercover narcotics agent that teams up with Ray Liotta to find out who killed his partner/best friend. The film has some wonderful twists that you will never see coming. This film is a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Narc","review":"Narc is a great movie. I think the acting is played out VERY good, and the storyline keeps you interested until the end.Ray Liotta stands out the most acting wise to me. Jason Patric falls right behind doing also a great job in acting. The story kept me interested, you want to know the next move theyre going to make. This movie is based around criminals and the drug underworld. Liotta and Patric team up to find out who was really behind everything that went on around Calvess.I highly recommend this movie, its entertaining and keeps up the action. There are quite a few twists in the movie, more towards the end so pay attention so you can see whats really going on.Overall, I give this movie about a 4.5/5. I thought the ending could have been a little different since I don't think it really led anywhere. But check this movie out you wont be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"ray liotta + shotgun = great movie","review":"ray liotta should get the russell crowe anger award of the year for this one, his best performance ever, hands down, blows his goodfellas performance away, blows washington's in training day away. just leaves your trembling and wanting to see it again.partick is a great counter to his character his best work in awahile, this is just a great movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NARC","review":"all I can say is..\\"unbelievable how this film was passed up for major Awards\\", the acting, story line was well directed and written.

My real issue is with Campbell Hausfeld's customer service. The QD (quick disconnect) was missing from my sprayer. Since I needed one immediately, I drove 20 miles to their nearest dealer and shelled out $13.62 from my own pocket for one. Even though my sprayer was now complete, I decided to test CH's customer service - I called their customer service line and explained that my QD was missing and that I needed one ASAP. That was at least 4 weeks ago and I still have no QD (from them). I have followed up with several emails directly to the customer service rep I spoke to and have gotten no response. Because of the lousy customer service, I can't recommend their products."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good hobby gun","review":"i bought this gun to refinish some bathtubs. after the purchase, i ordered epoxies and various other chemicals from midwest chemicals to get the job done. they sort of slammed the gun, saying that it was a good hobby gun and is okay for a 2 stage sprayer. i was told a 3 stage sprayer will atomize the paint and give a total pro finish, whereas the 2 stage sprayer will tend to throw small globs of paint and leave a slight texture. bummer. i never used the gun.i now own the hv3500. it always seems i get burned when trying to save money on tools. might as well buy the right one the first time.i'll review the 3500 after these tubs get done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Bought this to apply penetrating oil on a redwood fence/deck/trellis. Worked great. Only took a couple hours. Used to take all weekend to roll or brush then wipe off. Longest time was spent prepping with ground cloth etc.By using a light spray, did not need to wipe off, and it was very clean application with almost no overspray.I would HIGHLY recommended a respirator and tight fitting goggles. I used a dust mask and became overcome by the fumes. I guess because the material is so atomized it becomes vaporized very quickly.Kind of loud, but not any worse than any spray apparatus. Also the manual was contradictory about nozzles types (diagram showed one thing, text another)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Paint Sprayer/Time Saver","review":"This paint sprayer worked well for painting trim and doors. It saved a lot of time and the finish is much better than being brushed on.The only issues I had were finding the right viscosity to use in the paint.

The tip also bacame plugged a couple times with the thicker paints but that is probably common to every sprayer.I would recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great product; not packaged properly for shipping","review":"I've had experience with two CH sprayers now, and this one lives up to the expectations for quality and usability. I highly recommend this sprayer, however I strongly urge buyers to obtain from a different vendor. I received the sprayer as a gift and did not open the box until after the 30-day period. Although the box was in fine shape, there was almost no protective packaging inside to prevent damage to the spray can which easily gets dented by the unit. My spray can is completely unusable due to shipping damage. CPO Outlet was responsive but has directly refused to replace the damaged part.

I've never listened to King Crimson but dug Levin's playing enough on Peter Gabriel's 'So' to send for this book. I was counting on the lowdown on his choice of bass equipment, his muse for the basslines that he came up with, the business end as a top sessionman and maybe a fish story or two.Levin did recount being accidentally bashed on the noggin with a mike stand by Peter Gabriel.

Her head rests easily. My little one is small, but it works great for her. So far so good! You do have to make certain that you watch your baby so that she doesn't roll, but this would apply to any bath item anyway. After some washings in the washing machine, it has lost some of its fullness and has gotten a little flat, but now that my baby is bigger, she won't lay flat in it anyway. We still use it in the tub for softness. It doesn't last forever, probably, but it has worked well and I'd still buy it again. It is easy to store and it isn't tedious or bulky in comparison to other bath tubs. We can even use it in the sink because it will fold, of course."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs to be washed after each use","review":"This bath is very comfy for babies and worked well for our newborn during sponge baths.

Baby was so comfortable and I had no worries about slipping. From time to time I tried it without the safer bather, and wanted a third hand to hold him!Now, our big boy is ready for the grown up tub and uses the safer bather there.

We just rinse and squeeze out the excess water and have had no problems with mildew.The only problem I see is that it's starting to get a little flattened as time goes on, but I expected that to happen.Great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT for wiggle worms and tall babies","review":"Got a regular hard plastic tub and baby grew out of it within a few months due to length. Also, he was constantly banging his heels against the hard plastic and hurting himself while bathing. Got the safer bather and LOVED it. It gave him much more room to wiggle around without hurting himself. Also, It definitely will NOT start to smell bad if you hang it up to dry after each bath, let it dry overnight, and throw it in the washing machine every other week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Big For Sink","review":"I purchased this to use while giving my 3 month old son a bath in the sink. I found it to be too awkward to use in the sink. I was unable to keep my son's head elavated without having to hold him up. It might work better in the tub with more room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the rest","review":"I got the safer bather for counter top bathing my newborn. We used it then with good results and are now using in the big tub for her baths at four months old. I tried a molded plastic tub, but baby hardly got wet and certainly couldn't enjoy her bathtime! She spent the whole bath trying to wiggle deeper into the water and always ended up lying with her back right on that bump meant to support her bum. With the safer bather we use a lot more water, but baby gets to lounge comfortably with water over all but that big belly and her head/face.As to complaints about odor, we haven't had that problem at all. I just hang it up after bath time. But, the product instructions do caution you not to use soaps with moisturizer which build up in the bather. I've avoided same and smells, no problem!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the rest","review":"I had a hard plastic bather for my newborn but it was uncomfortable for him. when i got the Safer Bather it was a god sent. It never smells like mildew and it keeps him from sliping around. And if fits in my kitchen sink! It was also great for the first weeks when he couldn't take a tub bath...it was very comfortable for him to lay on while i washed him with a sponge."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Safer Bather is a MUST have!","review":"I received the Safer Bather from my mother in law after I saw the item online here. The reviews were what sold me. Not to mention the price! I just had my fourth child 6 weeks ago, and we love this item. None of my other children enjoyed baths at this age. I use to have one of those yellow and blue fold up hard plastic tubs. Well, I sold that at a garage sale two years ago. When I found we were expecting this child, I knew I wanted something different. This product supports the baby AND keeps her warm IN THE WATER!!! My daughter just floats there, totally supported by the cushion. I like the nifty hanger too, when we are done I just hang it in the tub and it dries up. GREAT product with a great price tag!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice pillow","review":"It worked great once I figured out that it is to be used in a baby bath tub or the sink. When I bought it I thought it would fit into the large bathtub and somehow not float and keep the baby in place...I was wrong. It worked great in the sink! I should've bought it when my baby was first home and not at 4 months old...now she is in the big bathtub (at 7 months)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have for new parents!","review":"I bought this for my daughter when she outgrew the infant bath (around 4 months old) and wanted more room to splash and kick. She loves this! It makes it feel like she's in the big bath, but she's safe in the water. It can also be a great item when its dry just for keeping baby in one spot and able to play with her toes, etc. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great product with one flaw...","review":"I bought this product for my son three months ago, and both my husband and I loved it, along with my son, BUT it did mildew even though the tag said it would not so i went out and got one of those regular baby tubs, but my son slips all around, how scary. So in the end we have decided to buy another safe bather, my baby does not slide everywhere, and stays warm on a nice comfy pillow type tub. I would recommend this item, just hang it outside if you can to insure no mildew."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildew","review":"I may have gotten a lemon on this one but after just one bath I was already getting mildew just from hanging it in the shower. Weird."},{"rating":"1","title":"it was great until...","review":"I searched and searched and thought I found the best thing. That is until it started smelling of Mildew a month later. The concept is great if you want to buy a new one every month.It is also hard to keep your baby warm, you can't get their body in water without it coming up to their ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best!","review":"This product is by far, the best bather for newborns. I have 14 mo. old twins, and when they were newborns, I could use this in the sink or the bathtub (one at a time, of course). It is very padded, it cradles babies perfectly and it's thick enough to bathe babies while they are lying down with no fear of their heads touching the standing water. I used this product every day, sometimes twice, for 2 babies and it never wore out. My husband threw away the drying hanger it comes with, so I bought a cheap mesh inclined bather ($5)to dry it out on and never had a problem with midlew. My twins eventually used it to sit on in the tub and I only got rid of it when they started to bathe together. Buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used once and never again....","review":"I can see that it would be comfortable but it was easier to bathe without this bulky item.... Would not suggest."},{"rating":"1","title":"am I the only one who disliked this product?","review":"Not very sanitary. The first time I used it my baby pooped on it and I had to wash it. It washed up horribly. I don't want to throw this in the washing machine every time I give my baby a bath."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY","review":"This is a horrible product. The photo is very deceiving. It is completely flat, not inclined like the photo portrays. My baby's head did not stay above the water so I tried to put him tummy down on it and at first it was okay and a second later I looked and the poor thing's face was completely submerged in water. He could have drowned. Please dont buy it for your own safety!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"This product is a waste of money. It does not work the way you would expect. It becomes completely waterlogged and heavy. The baby lies flat and is not submersed in any water at all, leaving baby cold and uncomfortable. I am surprised at all the good reviews. The plain old mesh \\"sling\\" bath is better and costs less."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed.....","review":"Bath pad did its job but by the time I got him undressed and on the pad the water it had sucked up had turned cold and it was horrible : ( I would recommend just sticking with a bathtub, in fact I am going to go buy one today! One thing I did like about the pad though was that it only took a few mins to dry after I hung it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so great","review":"I bought this based on so many parents' reviews here. I should have listened to the negative ones instead of the raves. My son is now almost 5 months old and I'm going to have to buy another bath tub. Mildew is growing on this pad, despite having been washed in the washing machine and put outside to dry. This pad absorbs ALOT of water when in the tub, it gets really heavy and will leave a lake on your bathroom floor if you hang it to dry anywhere other than inside the tub/shower. This isn't practical to use inside a regular tub. I ended up using it on the bathroom counter most of the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product STINKS - literally","review":"Follow the instructions to the letter - this product will still smell bad after a few uses. I HATE IT!!! I've gone through 3 bathing things so far - and this is my least favorite. First, it doesn't have much elevation for newborns. Second, it gets heavy once it's wet and flattens.Alternate product recommendation - Sure Comfort Tub by The First Years.... now THAT is a good baby bathtub!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Newborn Must Have","review":"We got this as a shower gift and I wasn't sure if we would use it much or not. After our first week home from the hospital, we couldn't live without it! It is so much easier for bathing a little baby. We put it on the kitchen counter and used it for sponge baths. It was so easy, my husband took over bath time. We only stopped using it when our daughter was hanging off both ends. This is a great product and I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best handed down gift ever","review":"This was the only thing I wanted from my sister as a gift. Actually it was hers! She has two sons and now I am using it! It is the best thing ever. I will always give it as a gift to new parents. It takes out the fear of giving a tiny baby their bath and makes giving a bath so easy and comforting. When you are done you just hang it up and let it dry, no cleaning out a baby tub!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildew collector","review":"This product seemed OK at first, with a newborn in a kitchen sink with very little water. The picture above is deceiving, because it really is a FLAT pillow with very little concave (notice the baby in the picture is propped up; this is not how the pillow will lie in your sink/tub) so the baby's ears are often submerged in very little water. What's worse, is that in a matter of a few months, the pillow material is pilling/shredding, it smells, and it's covered in mildew. No amount of machine washing will get it clean... So, time to try something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"peeeee-yeeeew","review":"I got this awhile ago for my first son. it was a great idea, and he loved it, but man did it STINK! no matter where or how soon I hung it up to dry. outside, inside, febreezed... any of it. plus immediately after the bath it's a huge pillow soaked with water, so it's heavy and not too convenient. we also lived in a super SMALL house in philadelphia with no good spot to store it. we've since switched to theSummer Infant Fold N' Store Tub Time Bath Slingand it's been through 2 kids and I'm about to use it for one more. it's convenient and folds and best of all doesn't STINK like mildew! blech! don't waste the money, you'll end up buying something else anyway!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildew! Yikes!","review":"I never write product reviews, but this was one product I had to comment on. I purchased the Safer Bather because my one month old hated the bath. His plastic tub was hard and he would tilt to the side. This seemed like the perfect solution...and it was, for about a month. Then the smell and the mildew started. No matter that I wrung the cushion out after his bath, and hung it to dry completely between uses, it continued to mildew. When I washed it, it completely lost its shape. My son is now six months old, and I haven't used it in months. Also, after buying this product and liking it (at the time), I then ordered another product from the Leachco Inc. Catalogue (which came in the package). That product (a \\"lightly\\" vibrating sleep positioner) did not work at all! I now believe that Leachco products are a complete waste of money! I hope this review helps :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"What an awesome bathing system!!!!","review":"I received the safer bather as a baby shower gift from my Babies R'Us registry. What a great bathtub! Some people wrote on their reviews that if you don't wring out the sponge then it smells and builds up mildew. I can't see what the problem is. I use this for my 8 week old daughter and after we bathe her, all I do is hang it up over my shower nozzle system in the bathtub & let the water run out of it into the tub. The next time I go to bathe her it is completely dry. I'm guessing that people just aren't using the hanger (that comes with it) to hang it up. That's what it is there for. I absolutely love this bath sponge!!! I'd suggest it to anyone that has a little one! What a great shower gift too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so usable in the tub","review":"We found this wasn't the best thing to use in the bath regularly. It's a bit of work to wring the water out, and you never get it all out. It takes over a day to dry, which means if you use it daily you can expect mold/mildew.We did find it useful around the house outside the tub. If you ever need to lay your baby down somewhere secure and don't have time to prep it, this bath pad makes a handy pad that keeps your child in position."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!!!!","review":"I love this pillow. It is wonderful. I started using the Bather when my baby was 5 months old. For the first few months I bathed him in the kitchen sink with a fold up tub. (which also worked great)However, I have a long, big baby and he got to big for the sink. So I needed something for the tub that would work well with a baby that could not yet sit up. He was comfortable and loved all the water at his feet to splash! Now that he is sitting up I just sit him in the middle of it. It makes him much more stable and easier to keep a hand on. I would recommend this Bather to everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Soft but Smelly","review":"We bought this for our infant son because it looked like the most comfortable baby bath on the market. It absorbs the warm water which our baby liked but when you hang it up to dry it molds before it dries. We squeezed out the excess water (as the directions recommend) and hung it in a dry room to air out. The next day it smelled of mildew. And each time we used it we had to wash it in the washing machine to get the smell out---WAY too much work. Go for a plastic tub."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildews easily","review":"I loved the idea of this, and it did seem cozy for my son, but, it mildewed after one month of use, despite rinsing and squeezing it out. I later washed it the washer, and now it has lost it shape and thickness, and still smells funny. Too bad, because I like the idea of a pillow-like surface to keep him from slipping around in the tub."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Big Babies","review":"The picture is very deceiving! It looks like it holds a baby that is at least a couple of months old, with his head safely elevated, in a fair amount of water. I've also read reviews that indicate people use this with 5 and 6 month old babies. My 15 pound 10 week old barely fits on it! It was so small, not what I expected at all. It is more of a pillow than a tub. It is also very flat and does not keep the baby very elevated in the tub. It does seem like it may be nice for sponge bathing a new born though."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"This Safer Bather was a waste!... Even more so it wore horribly! When I called the company I got no were! I got an email stating that they only guarantee there product for 30 days. Mine tore after 3 months of use and they could care less! They were rude and very unfriendly! I say take your business elsewhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where Was This For My First Baby?!!!!!","review":"This item is one of those that I wished I had with my other two children. With my past two children I had the hard plastic tubs that have the hammock attachments and I had one of the sling/seat type and I hated both of them. The Leachco safer bather is awesome and convenient. I love that it is so soft for my little one and I don't have to worry about him sliding off of it or it being uncomfortable for him. It is soft and \\"cushiony\\"!Our son suffered a traumatic brain injury at birth and was in the NICU for 32 days. When I was able to care for him at home this bather made bath time a lot easier for both of us. He is 14 months old now and I still use it because he is unable to sit independently.I definitely would recommend this bather. If I had known about this with my first child I would have used it for all of my kids.Just be sure to hang it dry after every use so it does not become mildewed."},{"rating":"1","title":"How is this safe?","review":"really not ideal for safety. It's flat and goes on the bottom of the tub. I don't like it- maybe it works for other but not me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this product!","review":"Very useful, very good quality, i totally love it! i did not give it 5 stars because after three months of using it, it changes its form."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comfy but got smelly really fast","review":"I initially loved this, but even though we squeezed all of the water out of it and hung it to dry every time we used it, it never quite dried. As a result, it started stinking and got discolored within the first month we owned it. I'm really disappointed, because otherwise I loved this product and so did my baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"a miracle with my first","review":"My oldest loved to lay on this thing and listen to the water so I could have her with me and take a nice long hot shower as a single mom, it was my single most favorite product. My new baby does not like the sound or feel of shower water and isn't too keen on being naked either so this isn't quite the same but it still functions really well as a safe place to lay her and clean her up and putting her on it at an angle with warm bath water just up over her tummy her seems to get her to push out gas that is bothering her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super easy bathing system","review":"This is by far the easiest bathing system we have tried. Lightweight, easy to dry.... My only concern is am I getting water in my babies ears.... That's why I am giving it a four. But it's soft, gentle to the touch of my baby and easy on mom. My four year old can help me bath too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this contraption","review":"I received the Safer Bather as a shower gift 3 years ago. I picked the item for my registry because of the great reviews I read on this site. Two babies and countless baths later, I still do not understand or like this bather. I even contemplated throwing it out while cleaning out a closet last week.*My babies did not like laying on the Safer Bather. They squirmed and twisted even at an early age.*I did not feel like my babies were safe in the Safer Bather.*The only time I was comfortable using the Safer Bather was when I was in the bathtub with my baby. Not very convenient.*The Safer Bather does not come with any instructions or suggestions for use.*It is very difficult to put water in the tub, put the Safer Bather in the tub, the baby on top of the Safer Bather and then wash the baby.I had much better luck with my Safety First Baby Bathtub and I used it in my kitchen (much easier on my back). I kept one hand on my baby and another on the washcloth! Very simple and easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dont like at all","review":"works for bath with towels early days, but to bathe a baby in a tub is unsanitary, the fabric is lint."},{"rating":"2","title":"new mommy","review":"I purchased this bather when my son was 2 months old. It is nice to have piece of mind while bathing him that he is not going to slip all over the baby tub! This was the best $15 I spent so far! Highly recommend for all baby baths!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"This product is a must for bathing your baby, epecially in the tub! My son was almost 9 pounds at birth and quickly out grew our sink. Before he could sit up on his own I would lay him on his back on this while I bathed with him. (I did have to put my feet under the top to elevate his head.) It was so easy to wash him and kept him safe. Once he sat up on his own it kept him from slipping while he bathes and plays. He is now 14 months and I still use it! I will definitely use it for our baby due in April!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth every penny!","review":"I bought this originally in 2002 for my first child. Now, 3 years later, I'm using it for my second child. Its as good as new and works as great as I remember. What's so incredible is that this was stored for 2 years in a tupperware container and doesn't even show it (or smell like it! LOL!) A must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bathtub All Around!","review":"I registered and received the Safer Bather as a shower gift. It is a wonderful product. I gave birth to my daughter in January and have been using this product since day 1. It was perfect for those 1st sponge baths and when her cord fell off, we started using this in the \\"big\\" tub right away. It's now 5 months later and we are still using the Bather. Our daughter is 14 lbs 3 oz and 26 inches long and she is just as comfortable as day 1 on this bath pillow. We have never had any problems with Mildew and I have washed in the machine on delicate cycle with no problems. The bathtub does get heavy when it is full of water, however, if you let the water drain from the tub 1st and then hang the Safer Bather in the shower (with its included hanger) it drains and dries very nicely.I highly recommend this product, it is so worth it!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for bathing anywhere!","review":"I am a nervous first time mommy, and the idea of squirmy, wet baby up high in the kitchen sink scared me! I used this Safer Bather with a basin of water on the nursery floor for all his sponge baths, and it worked great. No matter how squirmy he was, he was cushioned and safe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this bather","review":"This bather has made bath time so easy. I struggled for 2.5 months with the sponge then the infant tub, sling on and sling off. How frustrating they all were. I couldn't keep my son warm and he slid all around when inside the infant tub. I was terrified. This product has been great. It does not move at all in the tub and my son stay in place on the bather. And it keeps him warm and happy. I've not had any problems with mildew or losing it's shape. I give it a thorough rinse in HOT water then wring it out and hang it over the tub. It dries pretty quickly. Within a few hours I can move it to the closet so it doesn't interfere with my shower space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bath out there!","review":"This was the fourth type of baby bath that I tried. The first four months of my sons life before we used this bath pad were a nightmare. We tried the plastic baths, the mesh sling seats, the foam inserts, and nothing worked. This pad holds the water and keeps it warm. The head is also slightly elevated so my son doesn't get water in his ears. It's not at all slippery because it's fabric, and it's easy to hang dry in the tub. I have given it to every one I know who has had a baby in the past year and they all agree!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this product!!","review":"I have to say that I love the safety bather. My son is 7 weeks old and we've used it since his cord fell off. I have not felt uncomfortable at all giving him a bath. He enjoys his baths and looks like he feels secure. I have to say though I'm getting really lazy about having to rinse it out every time. It's not that big of a deal but when my son gets a little older I might get a different type of tub. But I will save it to use on our next newborn for sure!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby gets cold!","review":"I knew I did not have the room for a hard plastic tub so I got this. The picture shows the baby propped at the back of the tub. Who washes a baby like that? I filled my tub, put this in the middle and added the baby. There are two problems with this bather. 1. No matter what the thick head rest gets filled with water which quickly cools and the baby is laying in cold water. 2. It doesn't allow for water to flow back and forth so the water in the shallow end of the tub also cools quickly. Every time I used this even with heating the bathroom my baby got cold! The pad holds a lot of water!!! So you have to have some were it can drain for a while. (The package actually warns of internal molding). We have switched to a mesh style tub and will probably use this pad as a \\"confy\\" seat in the wading pool this summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than we expected!","review":"I first bought this just to take on a trip since it wouldn't take up as much space as our little girl's plastic tub. We loved using it so much that we haven't used anything else since! It is very comfortable on her little back, and I don't have to worry about her sliding off to the side like in her old tub. It comes with a nice little hanger which makes it easy to hang up and dry.The only reason I give it 4 stars is that she keeps sliding down on it and we have to scoot her back up. The size also does not fit in sinks well, so we end up leaning over the tub which can be a pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"DON'T BUY ANOTHER TUB","review":"I can't believe how inexpensive this PERFECT tub is for my baby. I fumbled around with all of the big plastic tubs with my 1st child but his one is a god send for my 2nd! It's like one big sponge that I lay in the bathroom tub. It absorbs the water and as soon as you pick it up, 95% of the water just falls out! No need to worry about it molding or taking forever to dry. It dries out completely in just a couple of hours (and is also machine washable). You can store this just about anywhere unlike the big plastic space hogs. Also, beware of the plastic tubs with the rubber linings (so called anti slip mats) which can rub the babies back the wrong way. My daughter lost some skin on her back from squirming around in one of those and it was sore for days! Buy this safer bather!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Returning after just one use!!","review":"I purchased this because the store was out of the tub I wanted and this was my second choice. I should have just waited. The first time I used it I followed all the directions about what soap you shouldn't use and washing and drying instructions. The first time I used it I placed it inside my infant tub and when through rung out the water and hung it to dry. The next morning there was a black ring that looked like mildew where the water had dried. So I washed it following all the directions. It is now all lumpy and the fabris is pulled in one spot and could break open. I am very unhappy with this and hopefully will be able to return it. I would not recommend this to anyone. I'll just roll up a towel to keep my newborn's head from wobbling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to use","review":"This bather seemed safe and easy. However, I thought it was kind of dangerous for two reasons. One - It was dangerous for me to carry my newborn daughter in and out of our huge tub to put her in the bather. Two - This thing slides all over the place in the tub. It also didn't fit in my sink! Another hassel was having to strain the water out of it and hanging it to dry. We used it twice before we threw it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big for a baby bathtub...","review":"We bought this from a local Babies R Us store to use in our baby bathtub. We had been putting a towel in the tub to keep our 2 month old from sliding down inside the tub.Once we put this Safer Bather in there, our baby could barely fit! It kept him so far out of the water that he was getting cold. Also, the Safer Bather itself got extemely cold once it was wet and exposed to the air.I may be wrong about how to use this thing - we haven't tried it in the adult bathtub yet, but I really can't imagine how it would work in there.Save your money and just use a towel in the baby's bathtub until your baby is old enough to fit in it properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"First of all, it was too big for my kitchen sink so I didn't use it until my son was about 6 months old and could bathe him in the tub. By that time my son was able to roll over and crawled his cute little butt right out of it. So I never really got to use it, nor did I need to use it. It's just a big piece of junk that I don't really know where to keep. If you like the idea of this item I at least suggest buying one of those inflatable tubs, that way it will be out of the way when not in use. Otherwise, I think that you could do without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful product","review":"I bought this thinking that I was getting a floating bath pad for my new baby. This does NOT float. It just fills up with water and sinks in the tub. Then it weighs about 20 lbs when you take it out. Maybe this is what other customers wanted, but it was not the product I was expecting. I'll keep looking for a floating bath mat like I used with my 3 year old son."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mold, Mold!","review":"I have been using the Safe Bather for 3 months and loved it. Last night, I noticed that there was mold on it. I followed the instructions and hung it up immediately after using it.

Try the fold up tub offered via Babies R US from First Safety."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!!!","review":"My son hated baths until we purchased the safer bather on recommendation from a friend. We put it in the Eurobath & now he loves baths. He stays warm on the cushion and he doesn't move all over the place like in the other \\"un-named\\" baby tub we had purchased. He seems to feel safe and supported on the cushion. With this setup we are able to bathe him on our bathroom counter and not kill our backs. We highly recommend this product. I have even raved about it to other new parents we know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why so many good reviews?","review":"I don't get all the good reviews of this product. I really don't like it. It's too big to fit comfortably in my standard size sink,and doesn't keep babies head inclined and out of the water in the tub. It does seem comfy for baby,but she does easily get cold in it. There is n o way for baby to stay submerged in some water to stay warm. I much prefer the first years safety tub. There is a reason it's design has been around for years! It just works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby hates being wet!","review":"My new granddaughter hates being wet. Not really, she just hates her bath tub. I bought her the Leachco infant bath pad, which resembles the Tubby that I used with her mother (my daughter). She likes it! It certainly makes bath time a whole lot more fun for all. Hooray! They have been using it and rinsing it well afterwards and then hanging it to dry. No moldy smell yet, so let's hope for the best, but just to have a happy baby, if it got a musty odor, I'd just buy another............."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a newborn","review":"We have just given our 3 week old two baths and the Safer Bather is great for this age. I love that it pulls the warm water from the sink up against her little bottom and as long as you pour warm water over the baby occasionally (which you should be doing anyway so they won't freeze), the whole cushion stays comfy for the duration of the bath. I love that this cushion supports her so well and that it's not the least bit slippery. I can prop her up on this and only need one hand to hold her in place. I've got my other hand free to grab bath gear as I need it. I'm giving this as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like my newborn to toddler tub better","review":"I bought this because it looked like a more comfortable version of the tub sponge that my mom recommended. It does elevate the baby more than the yellow sponge, but I had a few things I didn't like about it. First, it is very hard to lift to wring out after the bath. The water it soaks up makes it very heavy. Second, if you don't have all of the water wrung out of it, and don't completely submerge it into the warm water at the next bath, when the baby lays on it some of the cold water comes out and makes the baby cold. For the longest time I couldn't figure out why my son screamed every time I laid him on the Safer Bather, and then one day I felt the cold water coming up out of it as I was bathing him. I switched to the Sure Comfort newborn to toddler tub and he likes it so much better. He prefers to be IN the warm water rather than on top of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"This is a must have for any mom! I LOVE it! My only problem with this bather is that my son outgrew it! I wish they came in toddler sizes as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Safer Bather...great product!","review":"I have to be honest, I LOVE the Safer Bather, but my daughter just hates being bathed. She hates the water. I still would recommend this product over any other bath out there. It makes so much sense. It is warm, comfortable, and dries easily. It was a lot easier to bathe my daughter in this as well, especially her bottom area. I only wish it was a little bit longer. My daughter is almost three months old but is large for her age and we won't be able to use it much longer, her feet already dangle off the end of it. Perfect for newborns though. I gave it four stars only because of the short time you can use it, but I would still recommend it since it isn't expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for comfy baths!","review":"We used this during each bath from when my daughter was born to when she was almost 6 months! It is so comfortable for her, and the times that we were away from home and used a baby bath without it, I couldn't believe how difficult it was for her and us (very slippery baby!) I would recommend this for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I picked this one","review":"After reading the reviews of bathtubs for babies I picked this one and I haven't regretted it! It's soft, easy to store, and my daughter feels secure with it. She has not cried once during bath time. That is more than friends of mine can say about their babies' bathing experiences. I attribute our success to the Safer Bather."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Mildew-Resistant, and Fabric Pills","review":"I've been using this since mid-Sept 2002, and my baby loves it. However, I've recently noticed a mildew odor, and the fabric is pilling. I hang it to dry in a well-ventilated room after each bath, so I'm clueless as to why there is a mildew problem. I've tried washing it by hand, too. That seemed to help a little, but it did not eliminate the odor. I've contacted Leachco to see if they have any suggestions, as these problems are contradictory to the corporate product description. These problems aside, it's a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best!!","review":"This is the best. I use it with a large infant tub and my baby is supported wonderfully. It gives him a cushy padding that makes his bath more pleasurable. He's still getting use to taking a bath and he cried much louder in a normal tub. Now he hangs out and only cries once I start washing his hair. It dries quickly and easily (I just hang it in the shower). You can use it in a tub or sink, but the other infant tub works best for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The good and the bad...","review":"My baby loves it. It did seem to submerge him in the water a little more than the plastic tub we got as a shower gift, but not a lot more. I couldn't use as much water as I liked because it would get in the baby's ears(unlike in the pic, where the kid's head is way up out of the water).Also, I made it a point to ring it out and hang it up after every use, but after a couple weeks of use, it is starting to stink a little bit...I have not tried to wash it yet to see if the smell goes away.Also if your baby kicks a lot, like mine, you have to be very careful because he can almost scoot himself off of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jaimemom24","review":"I really do like the product, however it did mildew (the tag says it won't).

I followed directions on how to clean it and it still stunk. Also it shed little lint balls. I now have a basic baby plastic seat where you slip the baby's legs through. It is a lot cleaner then this cloth bath."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as expected","review":"My 4 month old daughter lifts her legs & butt up so that she slides down on the cushion thus submerging her ears in the water - about 2 inches of water in the tub.

It also smells sour and has since the 3rd use, in spite of being rinsed & dried after every bath."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpowering smell of mildew","review":"We have followed all instructions on the bather to avoid mildew. It has continued to have problems. We have washed the bather in the washing machine twice and problem always returns. We wring it out well and hang it right under a air vent in our bathroom. It smells so bad of mildew we are going to have to buy something else to bathe our son in. Lasted about a month before the mildew smell took over. Stay away from this product !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for little ones","review":"I registered for and received the Eurobath by Primo, but my daughter was just a little too small for the tub. I purchased the safer bather and sat in the bath tub with her... she loved it! She seemed so much more comfortable than in the hard plastic bathtub, and much more stable as well. Now we are making the transition to the Eurobath, which I recommend now that she's a little bigger. But, we still have the safer bather for our baths together!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best thing ever!","review":"I used this safer bather when my dd was an newborn. I would put it on the counter with a towel on it and use it to sponge bath her. When she got bigger, I just put it in the bathtub and laid her on it and she loved it. I have used it every night just about since she has been born and it has held up great. I just now stopped using it because my dd likes to sit up in the tub and play now so I have to wash her that way now. I loved this product and will buy it again for the next baby!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Safer Bather is AWESOME!!","review":"I'm so glad I purchased the Safer Bather. My 2 week-old hated getting sponged bathed, so I was really worried that she would scream when we bathed her for real. She was still HALF-ASLEEP when I put her on the pillow, she was so comfortable! After bath-time was over, the pillow simply hangs up to dry out, very easy and convenient. I have another child and I shudder when I think of how nervous I was and how uncomfortable baby was when I bathed her in her plastic infant tub. GET THIS PRODUCT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally","review":"I had a plastic, self contained baby tub when my daughter was first born, but by her 4th month, she was too big for it. I looked every where for an alternative, and walked past this one several times. I finally broke down and bought it, figuring if it was awful, at least I was only out $15. To my suprise, it is amazing! I wish I had it earlier. My daughter could not sit up yet, so she had to lay in it, but it made life much easier. It dries quickly, does not get moldy. Now that she can sit up, she can put her legs in the middle holes and support herself. My only complaint is that when my 6 month old reaches for a toy or something, the tub does not support her enough to prevent toppling. It will begin to float a bit, making it easy for her to slide around. But that's minor. I have a hand on her at all times anyway. She loves it! I have been known to use it myself as a back pillow when I have the rare opportunity to take a bath! A definate must have for new parents!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than any plastic tub out there","review":"I went on reviews when I bought this and it is so easy to use, better than any plastic tub out there. I have a 3 month old and have basically used the plastic tub a total of 3 times. The big tub is just so much easier and nicer and there isn't any preparation, everything is there, it's easy to fill and drain and always worked well with my first child. This pillow keeps my son safe and comfortable, it dries up really well and he can also lie in it on the bathroom floor while I fill the tub. My husband can even bath him and he looks really comfy in it. He lies snugly on it while I soap him up and don't have to worry about a slippery baby falling out my hands or hitting himself against the tub. Well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for giving baby a bath..","review":"I really love this product. I would recommend buying this instead of a baby tub, bath sponge, or bath lounge. I have the bath sponge shaped like a teddy bear and she is only three months and has almost out grown it, we use it as a cushion on the counter instead of in the bath tub. This bath product is great for her size. I will definitely be purchasing another one or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"No need for a bath tub for baby","review":"This item is just awesome - especially if you're short on space in your house/apartment. No need for a separate bath tub for baby, just use this safer bather in the sink until your baby gets bigger, then use in the bath tub. My baby has loved her baths from the first time we used it. There's no worrying about her slipping, and the spongy material holds in the warmth of the water keeping baby happy. I just hang it to drip-dry and have not had any problems with mold. This is a must-have for all new parents!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST!","review":"We bathed our baby girl in the sink the first two months of her life and this was a MUST. it is soft, easy to store, and if you bathe you baby at night, will be dry in the morning. Plus, it was pretty handy when we started giving her a *big girl bath* in her Eurobath, we used this till we felt she was big enough.It is worth the money! BUY THIS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have!","review":"I wish I had this with my first child! My fisrt child hated to take a bath but not my second! It seems very comfortable and it's great on space. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Baby Bath Ever!!!","review":"After buying 4 different bath systems for my first daughter, I found this product. The safer bather, or as I call it the bath pillow, is fabulous! This is the greatest thing ever, infact I am using my original safer bather with my second daughter. And I recommend it to all my pregnant friends and usually buy it for them as a shower gift.Both of my girls have loved the pillow like quality. It's so soft, they feel secure, and becasue it's absorbant they feel warm and snuggly the whole bath.Mine is 3 years old, I've never had a mildew problem. I've never had any problems, just happy bathtimes."},{"rating":"2","title":"After three other bathtubs this is the one!","review":"I went through many different bathtubs for my baby girl. I had a safety first tub that folded, a wire frame tub with a cloth cover that made it more like a lawnchair, a non-folding tub by safety first and then I finally broke down and tried this tub.I hated how all the others allowed my daughter to slide around and even slip down and turn sideways while bathing. This bath sponge tub is great. She does not slip slide around, I can wash her entire body much easier, and when the tub is filled properly she is nice and warm. She loves to kick and splash with her feet while in the other tubs she would squirm and start to cry.If the sponge tub starts to smell after awhile (mine did after 3 months) try to put it in the washer and then hang it in a well ventillated area. That is why I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 - it did smell alittle mildewy recently but now after being washed it is fine.Lets just say the other three tubs are going in the lawn sale this summer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for newborn sponge baths!","review":"If you are a soon-to-be parent who is as nervous about bathing your newborn as I was, this is for you! This cushioned seat perfectly positions your baby for sponge baths. It is contoured to keep your baby in place and provide cushion and support for her head. It kept my baby comfortable long enough to get her clean. I only give it four stars because unlike some parents, I do not think this product is best for water baths. I found that when I tried to use it in the kitchen sink it soaked up A LOT of water and had to be washed to prevent mildew. Although it is machine washable, it does get those fuzzy little pills of cloth attached to it, which are a pain to pull off. Also, I don't see how a baby much older than a month can fit in it, as it is very small. If you are looking for a great bathtub for your infant check out the EuroBath, which I couldn't recommend more highly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bath Time Made Easy","review":"My son is 3 months old and I have been using the Safer Bather since he was 2 weeks old. I originally registered for another bath tub, but after I read reviews on the Safer Bather, I revised my registry and added this soft and easy to transport bath tub. The Safer Bather is perfect because it fits in the sink or you can use it safely in the bath tub. I like the fact that I can safely bath my son then hang up the Safer Bather on the shower hook for it to dry. It is very convenient, soft, and it makes bath time much more enjoyable. Plus, it is a reasonable price. You have to try it! It sure beats the hard portable bath tubs that have a tendency to get water everywhere and are difficult to store."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best!","review":"I love this tub! I used it until my daughter was 3 months and could sit up with assistance. I would recommend to rinse it in the shower after each use and hang it to dry so it doesn't get stinky. She loved laying in it though and it made bath time fun and easy. I have recommended it to everyone I know and they love it also!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS","review":"After my daughter outgrew the 4 Stages bath tub by First Years (she was too long at 2 and 3/4 mos and was hurting her feet by kicking the hard plastic edge)I purchased the Safer Bather. I love it and she loves it. I use it inside of a small inflatable tub (so I don't have to fill the whole bathtub with water). It is soft and she seems very comfortable in it. Now when she kicks the water she may hit the soft inflatable tub which won't hurt. The Safer Bather would be great for a newborn too as baby can recline back it it! If you just wring it out a little and hang it on the hanger that comes with it, it dries out completely each time. LOVE THIS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Moldy!!!","review":"I originally bought this bather b/c of its soft comfort concept, but after only a few baths and hanging it up to dry, this bather succumbed to mold. I could not get the moldy smell out of the bather, even after washing and drying it in the washer and dryer. I would definitely not recommend this to anyone. Your baby deserves a better surface to bathe in, NOT mold!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not mildew proof","review":"I bought this product for my 5 mo old baby b/c she had outgrown her baby tub but not quite ready to sit up in the tub. I did a lot of research and this product claims to be mildew resistant but not mildew proof. If you live anywhere that it is humid, do not buy this product--it will mildew after just one use even if you rinse it out and wring it out real well. It does provide comfy cushioning for baby in the tub, but unless you want to throw it in the dryer after every wash, you might want to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best for newborns","review":"I used this for my daughter's first bath and 3 months later I'm still using it. Everyone told me how nerve racking it was to bath a slippery wet infant, but with this safer bather and my kitchen sink we've had nothing but smooth sailing. She loves her bath everytime thanks to this bather.It fits snuggly into the kitchen sink and I can sit her up or lay her down to clean and play with her. It also fits into our baby bath tub, and every other thing we use to bath her. As long as you take care to rinse it off with cool water after each use and let it hang dry it will last through every bath. It's comfortable and safe, the perfect way to feel calm and relaxed during those first few baths when you're a little nervous."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Important Baby Item You'll Ever Buy!","review":"This is my standard shower gift for friends. I used one of those awful plastic, hard, cold tubs for a few weeks before being told about this safer bather. It supports babies head, keeps the baby warmer because it absorbs the heat from the water and makes bathing a breeze. My daughter is now 14 months old and we still use it! An absolute must have as far as I'm concerned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, needs improvement","review":"Good idea that needs improving. Cushions baby well & holds head up to avoid watery ears, but a bit scratchy & pills easily. Doesn't drain& dry well, although wrung & hung up immediately. Worse, though washed often, mildews; you don't want your child to touch or breathe that. Contacted co. about mildewing easily, despite claim of resistancy. Response: it is mildew RESISTANT, not mildew PROOF, & to wash in my washer. DUH! Had issues with Leacho products & although they respond & have good product ideas, the quality is lacking. They should heed our comments."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not attempt to clean/keep mildew-free","review":"liked bather at first, but when began to mildew and we FOLLOWED MFR'S INSTRUCTIONS, completely \\"pilled\\" and filling clumped. our baby is allergic, so things need to be clean for him.

And it's easy to wash and dry in the washing machine and dryer if you start seeing any funky mildew or the like."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have for All New Parents!","review":"When I was looking for tubs I stumbled across this pillow on the website and went ahead and bought it. It has saved my life!! I was so apprehensive giving my son a bath when he was little and this pillow made it sooo easy. I didn't have to fumble about trying to keep him place while trying to bathe him at the same time. The pillow is difficult to wring, but once I hang it up and let it drip, it usually dries out. I did wash it twice and it is still in pretty good condition. After using it everyday for 7 months, a few threads are coming out of the material and of course my son is very interested in pulling them. But he is almost at the point where he can sit in the tub by himself anyway so I won't be using the pillow much longer. I highly recommend this for all parents!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the safer bather!","review":"As a first time mom, I was very nervous about bath time. The safer bather is the best. The baby doesn't move around at all, and she is comfortable throughout the bath. It is easy to wash and drys very quickly. It is well worth the money. I would recommend it for all moms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!!","review":"I wish I had this bath pillow earlier. WE started using it with our son at about 5 months.

THis is definitely a bathtime must."},{"rating":"2","title":"functions well","review":"the bath pad is fine - seems comfy for my little guy and keeps him elevated. but beware - do not hang it to dry until you squeeze out some of the water. i did not do this and the cloth that wraps around the hook ripped a bit. but it is fine to hang once some of the water is squeezed out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't buy again.

Still looking for that perfect baby bather."},{"rating":"2","title":"This baby bath solution is genius!","review":"After my 3 month old decided she no longer liked the standard plastic infant bath tub, I was desperate to find another solution so that we could resume tear-free tubby time. The Leachco bath pad fit the bill! I also ordered the Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge to try out both options, but I really like the Leachco better. The bath pad absorbs water really well and seems comfortable for the baby in either a sitting position or a reclining position. There is also a square indentation on it the makes it easy to clean the undercarriage! The Leachco is bigger than the Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge and seems to be made of higher quality materials. (I put it in the washing machine per the instructions and it turned out fine.) It is easy to dry between baths and I have had no issues with a mildew smell. This has turned bath time into a fun and comfortable experience!"},{"rating":"1","title":"give my girls a rash!","review":"I liked using this for my premiee baby girl once she grew out of her NICU bath at home but after a few months use it gave her a rash on her back. I didn't think it was the bath pad giving her the rash until her 3 year old sister started to get the same rash on her bottom because she liked to sit on it after my baby girl got out. I would not reccomend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived Filthy and would not come clean.","review":"I ordered this because I don't have a lot of storage space and thought this bath would be easier to store than a big plastic tub. It arrived sealed in plastic but when I attempted to use it for the first time black dirt seeped out. I have attempted to wash it 3 times through the washing machine and still get black dirt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this!","review":"I was given this as a gift and was very sceptical at first. We have both the safe bather and the plastic tub and my boys prefer the safe bather. It cradles them and keeps them warm.

It remains mystery, however, how those two (now) talking heads remain happily married with kids.Though, in this book, both Carville and Matalin remained rigidly royal in defending their clients (Clinton and Bush) against various accusations, in real life after the 92 election, Clinton ended up acknowledging his womanizing behind the green door of White House library to embarrass his country to the rest of the world in an unprecedented fashion, while Bush Sr. continues his activities which are highly suspected of conflicts of interest, not withstanding what his son is doing in the White House right now.

And then Mary's political reaction to that scene and how it affects President Bush's race who is being perceived at the time as out of touch. Priceless anecdotes. Very fast as campaigns just chew up time and people's lives. Civility too, such as it was, in the political realm of those days.

I don't know if Bush supporters will enjoy this book as much, although they might enjoy the Matalin sections.The only sour note comes from Matalin herself, who refers to the Clinton campaign as \\"Clintonistas\\" and continually harps about the media's (alleged) distortions of Bush and his record, and genuinely, truly seems to despise Bill Clinton.

This is what the print on this DVD does all the time. Whereas Benny Hill was funny, this is not.The picture is weird to say the least; it is billed as Widescreen on the box but even when playing it in Widescreen on a Widescreen TV the picture is too squashed.The sound is not AC3 stereo although I thought it was clear.The film has been cut terribly and runs far short of the time billed on the DVD case.Don't bother with this awful print; let's hope the movie gets restored properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"The volcano blows, and so does this transfer","review":"Okay, so it's not a work of art. But \\"Krakatoa\\" is very much a guilty pleasure. Max Schell and Sal Mineo pretty much phone in their performances. Diane Baker is trying so hard she seems like she's in a different movie. But where else are you going to see Brian Keith trying to rape a Polynesian pearl diver? The effects are clearly the star, with the tsunami tidal wave being fairly impressive, even by today's standards. It's a shame that we cannot get a better transfer of the complete 136 minute film. There are way too many obvious splices in this transfer to be acceptable. Also, this was released originally with a flaw that prevented it from being viewed unsqueezed. The flaw is corrected on the new pressing, but it has the same catalog number as the old pressing! The only way to tell them apart is that the new pressing has a white circle in the center, and the old one is clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jules Verne inspired disaster film","review":"Anchor Bay has re-released this film in all it's 131 minute unedited glory (this is the copy with the hot air balloon on the cover). Some sources say this film originally ran 136 but that's counting the intermission. The DVD is terrific (no skips or jumps), widescreen, great sound and color. The unedited version helps the story along without question so take that in account when reading reviews that talk about muddled plotting in the shorter version. If you are into Jules Verne style films you'll like this one complete with volcanos, tidal waves, hot air balloons, deep sea exploration, late 19-century sailing ships, convicts, etc... Perhaps a little too much brought into the film and dispensed with quickly, but still nifty as far as the genre goes. Maxmillian Schell (the captain in the Jules Verne inspired THE BLACK HOLE) plays the captain, Diana Baker plays his love interest looking for her long lost child, Brian Keith plays an over-the-hill diver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes! What were they thinking?","review":"I immediately purchased this DVD title because it is the very first movie I remember watching at a theater as a very small child! The theater was the Cinerama Dome on Sunset Blvd. in 1969-1972 Hollywood, (they re-released it a few times, I saw it 5 times at that theater). This DVD simply put, is bad! Even on a big screen TV the picture is squashed, the sound is muffled, the theater experience is lost. The editing seems to have been done with scissors and tape. Entire scenes are missing, or cut very short. However, the best parts of the movie that I remember from when I was four years old are ok. The volcano eruption scenes, tidal wave, and really cool lava piercing the ship!

Overall, I believe if the omitted parts are included in the other versions, then it will be a good story to watch.

The trouble is the \`action' is late in coming, leaving us with a few unrelated scenes of killings early on.

The true nature of the bigfoot could be nothing further from what is portrayed in this film. There are no confirmed cases, anywhere in the world, of bigfoot exhibiting violence toward humans, let alone abducting and/or sexually abusing them. Films like this are what keeps kids indoors these days, afraid of nature, enamored instead with virtual television based worlds. A gentle spirit of the forest, the primate love of natural beauty incarnate; this is the bigfoot I understand.

Either they lost something due to budget or it was intended to rip-off people who would think it might be fun (in that good bad way) like the original Boggy Creek.

Name me a tenor who coud sing Vesti la Giuba and di quella Pira like he does and also sing the Pearl Fisher aria as he does. I can't even imagine Corelli or Del Monaco, or even Bergonzi doing that. I think the lyric roles were more natural for him. In the heavier roles he tends to push and darken his voice with not always pleasant sound. His top is stuff of legend. To sing a full program and cap it of with an encore Di Quella Pira is truly amazing.

I rather recommend \\"The Bilingual Family.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading title...","review":"I don't find this book to resemble a practical guide so much as one family's account of their experience. Furthermore, their experience isn't representative enough of typical bilingual families to serve many readers much good. I quickly grew tired of their personal examples and wished for more neutral guidance. As a result, I found myself struggling to bother past the first few chapters and ultimately feel I was mislead by the title and therefore selected the wrong book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource","review":"This is a wonderful resource for anyone who is raising a child with more than one language.

I was expecting a nice heart-warming \\"chick-flick.\\" I was very disappointed. This movie is extremely BORING. It moves so slowly! The whole thing just feels like it's dragging. Boring, boring. I kept hoping it would get better. It never did. Even the ending was lousy. You can tell this was a LOW-BUDGET film. Apparently they couldn't afford to film a wedding scene, or even Bella's funeral! How pathetic. Don't bother watching or buying this. It's a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Budget movie - don't waste your time - not romantic!","review":"I liked My Big Fat Greek Wedding so I thought this might be good after seeing other comments....this is no where near the quality of acting, filming, directing or anything else that I expected. It's low budget, the filming is what my 12 year old could do, with the camera going back and forth. I couldn't finish it.....it got worse and worse. Don't waste your time or your money. Believe me, it's a really bad movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"You must see this movie!","review":"Admittedly, I am a little biased writing this review. My brother and his wife are both in this movie. They do community theater in Pittsburgh and were lucky enough to land small parts in this wonderful film. Anyway, even if I am biased, you still must see this movie!! It is wonderful. I NEVER cry at movies, but I did with this one. The story is beautiful and the scenes around Pittsburgh are great. On top of that, my brother was in it! What more could I ask for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good... not Great","review":"I don't mean this in a bad way, but this is not a Big Fat Italian Wedding. (What are those reviewers thinking?)It is so much more.This is an excellent stay at home date night with the wife flick. Although the main characters are fully developed (who knew Chachi could act?), some supporting roles are almost cartoonish. Also it appears as if some side plot lines wound up on the editing room floor.An admirable first effort from the writer/director, Melissa Martin. I would expect bigger and better things from her in the future.Besides, I loved all the shots of my hometown and had to run to the Strip the next day for Enrico's Biscotti.

I am so, so glad that I rented this movie, and I think that anyone that appreciates a well-done, touching romantic drama would love this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love Pittsburgh","review":"If a friend from Pittsburgh, where I used to live, had not told me about this movie, I would have missed a real winner! It is sweet (without being cloying) AND bittersweet, loving, and tender....just wonderful. Every once in a while a movie like this comes along and gives me hope that more worthwhile movies will be made like this one - without violence, shooting, sex, foul language....just nice healthy films.The acting was \\"spot on\\" and I loved seeing a bit of the city and the Strip District. Scott Baio was wonderful....he sure has developed into a fine actor whom I hope to see in more big-screen movies. He plays a wonderful character in this movie, very multi-faceted.This is a treat for the senses, especially anyone who enjoys food-related movies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best films I've seen","review":"The story was original and romantic.

It was awful! I couldn't even make it past the first few chapters. It's tough to criticize a book dealing with child abuse because a) it may be based on someone's actual experiences and b) who am I to talk? I haven't been a victim. However, this is so poorly written that the abuse (at least the initial occurrence - which is all I made it through) just seems ridiculous. It ended up losing the impact it should've had. The way the 10 year old talks and thinks throughout the ordeal doesn't ring true either.This book had the kinds of flaws that a self-published book often has like awkward wording and odd transitions between scenes or events. This book was sorely in need of some editing. And the only reason that it's 500 pages is because of the large print; there's very little text on each page.

After ten glorious minutes of donuts and high speed passes in the driveway at Nana's, we bashed into a snowbank and came down hard on one front wheel. The linkage busted and tears flowed. I called the folks down at Traxxas and, even though it's not a warranty issue, they agreed to mail out some parts.

I am an owner of the DVD and heard a book was in the works. I was very happy to hear this. I was even more happy when I read it. It is a work of art with an amazing style. It's extremely graphic in many ways. For one, the violence is extreme, and two, there is a lot of nudity and a part in the book with graphic sexual images. But those are not reasons to hate this. I reccommend it if you are not bothered by sex or violence, other wise I would suggest backing away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sequal in only a sense","review":"Ok, This is supposedly the sequel to the stunning hit anime.

The router saw it briefly, on the Client Table, and recognised it as an Ethernet connection, but it still would not work. I had to restore my system back to before I tried installing he card to even be able to use the on board card I was replacing. I believe the issue has to be on the driver.

One of the best things is you can program up to three rooms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth it","review":"Like a lot of reviewers have stated - the unit looks great out of the box, but it never really was able to replace the original remotes. If you look at your cable or audio receiver remote, there are a number of buttons/functions that need to be pushed to fully control the unit. So how can a flat touch screen replace all of those separate buttons on all of the remotes. Well...it can't. At least not well.I like Logitech products - I find them well built and functional. This one just doesn't hit the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't do it","review":"seemed like it should be able to work - wasted untold hours - this is the second of the Harmony devices I have tried to no avail - it is not a panacea and both my wife and I decided it was not worth the effort!

The large display sucks thethe battery to nothing in no time. It wasn't long before the remotesbattery would not recharge. Finding a replacement battery wasimpossible, (including contacting Harmony directly).Through in trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy Logitech","review":"I have had several Logitech remotes including 2 Harmony 1000's, Harmony 1 and Harmony 890. Not one of them work properly! The main problem is that you must connect to the web when setting up and changing the components you want controlled. Sounds like a good idea but in reality the software doesn't work and the update just hangs until restarted. It works 10% of the time. You cannot reset the devices to factory default. Not sure why exactly. The concept of being able to automatically set up your remote with an online database of thousands of devices seems appealing but i've wasted countless hours trying to get it to work. Save yourself a headache and do not buy Logitech."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fully functioning RF Capability, Marketing was misleading","review":"I bought the remote for easy control of TV components in a hidden cabinet along with control of some home automation lighting control. The short story is that I went in circles being mislead by Logitech tech support for about 5 hours of my time (total). It wasn't until I asked for an answer in writing that I got the truth and the truth is that the 1000 is not fully compatible with the RF extender. It will not support home automation unless it is IR (though there are a few home automation IR products almost all of them are RF). I ended up returning this and getting the 890. The 890 with the RF extender was about $200 less expensive and even if the 1000 had the z-wave capability after using both I like the 890 better anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"This thing is amazing","review":"If I could play Angry Birds on it, it would be perfect.

However,despite hours of tinkering, I can never seem to get it to cooperate. While this remote sounds very good in theory it appears to fall rather short in practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a great idea poorly executed.","review":"The 'touch screen' is like touching an LCD monitor, in everyway. You don't really just touch, you push. And by push, I mean as hard as you would a button. Kinda fizzles that feature. Moving on.When you choose an 'activity'(Watch TV, Watch DVD, Play Xbox, etc), it is supposed to turn on/off all components involved in that activity. This process simply recognizes the last setting you made on it and adjusts from there. Great, right? Wrong. If anything is done manually, you have to go through all your HDMI inputs, AV inputs, side audio, etc. to get this paper weight back in 'sync'.I find myself using the remotes that comes with it constantly.Bottom line: Looks cool, ...I got nothin'"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one nice remote","review":"This is one nice remote though not perfect. First the cons, This remote is a nightmare to set up as there is no real owners manuel so you won't know how. You need to call customer support and then its a breeze, but this is something they don't tell you about. I spent hours trying to get everything right and just couldn't until I called support and found out about all the other settings there are. Once I reached support (I was on hold for about 10 minutes) everything went easily. The remote is hard to hold and work with one hand but other than that it is a very good. When its programed corectly it works like a charm. I would recommend this to anyone, but you must call customer support right off the start or you will!!! get angry trying to program it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Off and running in less than 30 minutes","review":"When I got home from work and saw my Amazon package on the table, I thought it was going to be a long night of programming this remote. I got started at around 9:00 PM and by 10 I was showing it off to my wife and telling her how easy it was to watch TV or play a DVD.I have heard, many horror stories about the software, but I found it extremely easy...not sure if they updated the software and made it more user friendly, but the stories of the set up being difficult weren't true for me.I have a Surround receiver, Satellite box, TV, HD DVD player, Xbox 360. If I want to watch a DVD...I just tap the \\"watch a movie\\" icon and it turns on all the necessary components. All of this is set up in about a half hour through the software provided. It really couldn't be more simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interface and setup problems","review":"Spent 6 hours working with 8 people at tech support (both Tier 1 and 2) only to find out that the 1000 has interface problems with a Linksys router in a home system. Could only get to 95% of complete setup. When the 1000 went to upload information the last time to the Harmony servers, the unit would freeze up and not complete the process. The 880 supposedly does not have this problem but after 6 hours and no offer of a discount to purchase an 880 I am returning the 1000 until they get the problem resolved. After reading other reviews, the unit seems to have other problems. I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Fairly easy to setup. However the device works sometimes and sometimes not. For the cost of this control i expect for it to work all the time.

It is a universal remote that truly works as advertised. My house guests can finally do simple tasks like control the TV or switch to a DVD without having to attend a tutorial on individually managing various components. One touch of a button and all components are configured to deliver the function (e.g. Watch TV) that we want. It is great (although my 7 yr. old was perfectly comfortable switching and configuring). The only glitch is that the remote will occassionally get confused (I do not know yet what the user does to get to this state) and I need to reset it. I would buy this product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Easy to Program","review":"Bought this remote after having good luck with a Logitech Harmony 659. I almost didn't buy because local prices were well over $450. But, even though it's the top of the Logitech line in price, the features and programmability are worth the extra $$. Plus price was right on Amazon.I can control my television, stereo, DVD, lights, anything that is IR programmable. The product database was very extensive. When I press \\"Watch a DVD\\" the TV input changes, the surround sound selects cinema sound, the DVD turns on and ejects, and the lights dim....all with the push of one button!Only reason for not having a five star rating would be for the fact that it doesn't have Bluetooth. Can't control my Playstation3. But this is probably more of a Sony issue than a Logitech."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice, but awkward","review":"Having never used a Harmony remote before, I was blown away by how easy it was to program the \\"macro functions\\" like Watch TV, Play DVD, etc. The thing I'm having trouble with, though, is that it's awkward to hold such a large remote. There's no way you can use it one-handed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Logitech Harmony 1000 Awesome!!!!","review":"This is a great product for home theater systems with multiple systems to control.

It controls a Panasonic DLP tv, Onkyo receiver, Direct TV HD receiver, Panasonic DVD Recorder, and my blinds! Before my wife could never figure out how to switch the tv from satellite to DVD and now she's got it. I think the people that put a bad review on this, do not understand new technology. I have tried other name brand remotes before this and none of them compare. The setup was extremely easy and the fact that it has a docking station is such a good idea. My last universal remote ran through batteries once a week because of the video display. I would highly recommend. The only thing to add is the fact that it will not control the Playstation 3 without buying an additional device to convert the bluetooth to IR. I am still trying to figure out if this remote can control my ceiling fan which I do not think it can because of the RF technology it uses but everything else is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tolerable, but it locks up a lot...","review":"I have this remote for controlling my home theater equipment. I have a projector, DVD with Escient Fireball, AV Receiver, Xbox 360, cable box and an Apple TV.

They force you to register an account with them before you can start configuring your remote. The software asked me to download and to \\"upgrade\\" the control software about 5 times befre I could even start the \\"configuration process\\". It was a nighmare experience. I was very exited when I got the control yesterday and after many hours working on the configuration, I will sell it. Logitech is a PC devices company and the harmony 1000 its a failed attempt to extend their a PC device to your home. Perhaps if you have only 3-4 components to install this might be a good option, but with more devices I strongly reccomend that you dont buy this control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced","review":"This item is just to expensive for what it does.

Don't bother buying this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product With Room for Improvement","review":"I have a six component system (including an Apple TV box) and am very pleased with the performance of the Harmony 1000 and the ease of system setup. However, I attempted to use a new Intel iMac running the Leopard OS to set up the remote and was unsuccessful. The remote programming software locked up. Fortunately, I had already installed VMware's Fusion software and was able to boot up Windows XP on the iMac. Once I was operating in a Windows environment, programming the remote was a snap.BOTTOM LINE: The Harmony 1000 is a good value for the money if you can set it up in a Windows OS. Folks that are limited to an Apple OS will experience problems. I'm not the first person to report this. Hopefully, Logitech will get their software updated to resolve this situation soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"1000 is very flukey","review":"Purchased the Harmony 1000 with expectations that it might be complicated to set up, but would work fine once that was done.

It would work for a little while, then it would stop activating the television, even though it was taught to do it again and again.

I worked with this thing- I babied it, learned its likes and dislikes. Whether you're a geek or not- stay away from this remote. It's the floppiest flop that ever flopped into flopdome.

I wanted to upgrade to a Blu-ray player but my wife and kids were concerned with being able to work three remotes, adjusting the TV inputs, etc. I was looking for a slick remote that would be a one-touch operation and found the Harmony 1000 on sale. It compares to some much more expensive remotes from professional installers who then charge set-up fees (and charge again if you change AV equipment). I found the software easy to progam and now the 7 yr old can operate all the functions easily! Not the cheapest remote, but easy to program and use.

I have to hit the help button in which the remote asks me if the tv is on, I click no, and then after 2 tries, it finally turns on the tv. I cant believe a $300 remote cant turn on the TV.Secondly, the software is plain horrid. I'm a software engineer, and I could make better software in my sleep.

This remote is awkward when it comes to changing channels etc since you have to press the \\"123\\" icon to get to the number screen. Harmony one may look less cool, but there is not need for these steps.

One customer returned a 890 remote in a zip lock bag after smashing it with a hammer - needless to say he was upset. Harmony remotes are made for consumers who want to program the remote themselves (if the customer can wire and setup a/v equipment then they should have no problem programming) they only offer basic functionality due to the closed software architecture.

The touch screen failed on the original unit, but it was cheaper to buy another one to work with our system, rather than pay over $1,000 for a new programmed unit. I ordered two units from Deal Stop ([...]) which were supposed to be new and under warranty. One unit appears new, but the package was open and the battery was replaced with one that does not fit the unit. The second package was also open, and clearly, the unit was used, old, scratched and a mess, and the install CD was missing, and accessories were just thrown in the box. Very disapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead 2yrs later","review":"If you have unlimited time to program or are willing to have someone do it for you; If you have the patience to reboot at least once a week; If you pay for an extended warranty; If you understand that support is poor for the first year; Then this is the remote for you.

Set it up, tested, trained them, and then left. Later that day, get a call - can't turn off the TV. Go over and sure enough, doesn't work. RF icon doesn't come on. After some fiddling, finally remove the battery and reboot the 1000. This fixed the problem. Next day, stops working again. Another battery removal and reboot solves the problem. Next day fails again. This time I return it for replacement.Get the replacement, set it up and all is well for two days before the RF transmitter stops working again. Remove battery and reboot - starts working. Next day, stops again. That was enough - returned for refund.There is either a design or mfg problem here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy!","review":"This product is absolutely the worst product amongst quite a few electronics gadgets, that I have in my home. First of all, the shape of the product is useless for most remote control use scenarios, where you're placed horizontally in your couch in less than optimal lighting conditions. You have to look at the remote to operate it and you have to use two hands. Second, it's prone to freezing, or maybe my other gear have simply started ignoring it. Either way, it never seems to get everything working in... harmony. I've been trying, with all my heart, for more than 6 months now, to get it to work. My old remotes are still within an arms length of the couch. Don't buy it.

Not. I should say that I've been installing stereo components for myself since 1978 and have had every major component manufacturer's product at one time or another.After following all the directions and hooking this up to the computer I found that the software is incompatable with Vista and requires serious on-line help. Perhaps, if I was more patient and was willing to spend the 12 - 15 hours to figure this out I could do it myself. I am not. Personally, I believe the electronics industry should be sued for Deceptive Trade Pratices for the efforts it takes to integrate these components, but that's another story. By the way, I have a technical degree from a well known university and am a products liability attorney so I'd like to think I'm not a dummy as to this stuff.

I had high hopes that this remote was a great start. Sadly, it is not. You are limited to the pre-loaded buttons. It's hard to navigate. Not all the \\"activities\\" work right all the time. Instead of you telling the remote what you want it to do, it tells you what it will do and how you should program YOUR actions to get the desired results.

They would make a note in my account.Buying a Loitech Harmoney 1000 was the worst decision I ever made. I wish I would have put the $300 on the Cardinals to go to the Super Bowl.

I am a middle-aged woman and I find the count-down timer the best feature. I use it several times a day. I also use the alarm in the morning. The watch is slim and functional. The reason I replaced the other watches was that the band broke. I have replaced the band in the past but this time (after wearing the watch daily for at least 3 years) I looked into the cost of a new band and decided to replace the watch instead. The buttons were not as easy to push since I had replaced the battery a few times and the buttons did not stick out as far as they were when it was new. I am very happy with this watch and hope in a few years it will still be for sale. (P.S. I swim with it in the ocean every summer and it is fine.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great watch","review":"This is a great watch!

I have changed the battery before, but I find it is just easier to get a new one. Considering the price, getting a new one is no problem. I am loyal to this watch because it is so useful. It is digital and has a stopwatch, with is key for running. It is water resistant - so I would not recommend swimming with it. However, I just leave it on the edge of the pool and that works fine for me. One of the best features is the timer. By just pushing a button a few times, you can time several different time intervals. This is most useful for cooking when you have multiple dishes cooking. Perhaps the best feature is the size. The face is smaller than a quarter. Most watches are huge and a pain to wear - but not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made for a child.","review":"This is a cute watch, but it is so small.

As a side note, the little fish accent at the end of the strap is an adorable touch to the watch!I bought the little guy at Kmart, but recently returned to buy a second one when the straps broke only to find that the store no longer carries this classic little casio.I only have two qualms about recommending it: 1) the straps seem to go brittle in about two years of heavy use [and I've replaced the battery once] and 2)there is no illumination/glow-in-the-dark option for it, which makes it slightly less useful for darker settings like unlit rooms or camping tents."},{"rating":"2","title":"No military time","review":"I bought this watch for my wife who needs it for her work as a nurse.

I'd like to see Sitchin's attempts to link ancient earth mysteries to unsolved modern myserties, such as the earth's energy grid, the Bermuda Triangle, the \\"afterlife\\", psychic ability, and even a more in-depth discussion of the astrology/astronomy rift.

And touches upon the BIBLE CODE's meaning. The author's only lacks more in depthabout the comparison between Yahweh & Nannar/Sin. This is definately a changefrom his previous work DIVINE ENCOUNTERS. Is he or isn't he? The same person? For answers read C.L. Turnage\\"sIS THE BIBLE AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL TRANSMISSION?, & WAR IN HEAVEN. The facts speak for themselves.

There are many amusing moments, but the film isn't a comedy. There is a good deal of martial arts, but I wouldn't call it a martial arts film. There is even some insight into politics and corruption. It's not an easy film to pigeon-hole (and that's what most people need to do). Closest would be an action-adventure film, but even that misses the most important point. That point should be obvious to anyone who has ever been a father. It's about the development of the father-son relationship between the martial arts Master and Remo (who are not biologically related). The growth of this relationship is beautifully portrayed by Joel Grey (the Master) and Fred Ward (Remo). The climax occurs near the very end, when Remo addresses the Master as \\"Little Father.\\" To understand what that means, you have to watch the film from start to finish, which I have done with great enjoyment several times. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remo and Chuin deserve better","review":"As a kid, I LOVED this movie. After I read the series, I didn't like it as much. Fred Ward and Joel Grey certainly had the right look (although Chuin's attire wasn't proper, but his acting was perfect as Chuin). The origin was totally stupid, and McCleary wasn't portrayed right, either. This movie deserves a remake!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the widescreen","review":"I liked the movie back in the day, and seeing it again recently was very nostalgic. If it was widescreen, I probably would have picked it up. If I wanted fullscreen, I'd just tape it the next time it runs on the SciFi channel."},{"rating":"1","title":"big disappointment","review":"classic 80's adventure and one of my favorite movies of all time. i had been waiting years for this to be put on DVD and screamed with glee, like a little girl when i saw that it was. then my joy was killed when i read the fine print. it is only in full screen format. all theatrical releases (with the exception of Kubrick's films) are shot in some form of widescreen. whether it is 1.85:1 or 2.2:1 or whatever, they are always shot in widescreen. so why they didn't use the origial print in order to restore this film is beyond me. they didn't even add any extras. i don't see the point in putting it on DVD then. you are better off with the VHS version or just catch it on cable."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WIDESCREEN","review":"I dind't realize until after I got it home that this was full frame not WIDESCREEN. I am returning it. When will the studios learn that we want films in their orignal display."},{"rating":"2","title":"The adventure begins...","review":"...and ended after this one movie (though it did show up as a short lived TV series with differant actors). Remo Williams is an enjoyable movie, though campy at times. Based on a series of books, that I have yet to read. I did enjoy this movie when I saw it in the 80's do in part to Joel Grey's performance as a Korean martial arts master. Yes, that is Joel Grey. The movie offers action, seriousness and comedy throughout but at times it doesn't seem to get the balance right. But you have to take this movie as is and its not James Bond. All I can say is pick it up, watch it and enjoy. Its a good movie to watch on a slow day to get you laughing and give you some thrills. To bad there weren't more in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"We want a sequel!","review":"Too bad they never made a sequel of this movie. It's on my top ten list of favorite movies, and I've been waiting for years for it to finally appear on DVD. Too bad it's full screen only, but I'll take what I can get. For bargin bin pricing, I'm not going to complain too loudly.Some people don't like the campiness of this movie, or diss it because the martial arts aren't Jackie Chan-like in quality. I think that's the whole point of the movie, Chun isn't trying to be like Chan... As Joel Grey says at the end of the movie \\"No, I am better than that...\\". I generally like Fred Ward, and the Chun character is over the top."},{"rating":"2","title":"greatest movie in history","review":"what can i say? i laughed, i cried. it was everything i ever wanted in 2 hours of pure enjoyment. this is simply the greatest creation in the history of mankind. there should be a \\"remo williams\\" class in school that kids are taught every year to learn his ideals and way of life. it will teach that one day you will be \\"killed\\" by the government and turned into a secret agent where a \\"korean\\" man will teach you how to fight and dodge bullets. it's all true. it happened to my best friend. his name is nemo williams. i wish this movie was a woman so i could marry it. its that great. see it see it SEE IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"4 Stars for the movie, 1 star for the DVD!","review":"I can't tell you how disappointed I was when Remo Williams FINALLY was released to DVD and MGM had the temerity to release it in FULL-FRAME (pan and scan) rather than widescreen in its original theatrical aspect ratio! It's 2003, MGM...people are savvier about film than they used to be, and we want to see our favorite films the way they were originally presented in the theater! I don't even demand \\"extras\\" like commentary or making-of documentaries...just a crisp transfer in anamorphic widescreen with enhanced sound. Is that so much to ask?Four stars for the movie \\"Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins\\" - a wonderfully engaging '80s action-adventure flick that doesn't take itself too seriously, featuring terrific performances by Fred Ward and Joel Grey - and one star for the crummy presentation it received on DVD. Remo deserves so much better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nooooooo! Full Screen Format?! Why?!","review":"It wasn't until after I purchased this DVD that I realized it was full screen format. WHY, WHY, WHY?! Don't studios realize that we want widescreen? At the very least, they could put a large disclaimer on the front. This bites. Remo Williams is a great movie and deserves better than this cut rate DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Widescreen Version? Boo!","review":"This is a classic 80s film that I enjoyed greatly when I was much younger. I only buy DVDs these days because of their superior features and longevity compared to VHS. So I was happy to learn Remo Williams was finally coming out on DVD so I could add it to my collection.Alas, my hopes were shattered when I went to my local video store to pick up a copy. The movie only comes in FULL SCREEN. I am so disappointed. One of the best reasons to own a feature in DVD is to see it in widescreen, without the sides of the movie cut off to fit TVs with a 4:3 aspect ratio. But for some ungodly reason the studio has released Remo Williams in full screen. This is a very entertaining flick I want to see again in all it's silly, nostalgic, widescreen glory. I cannot forgive the people responsible for leaving it visually incomplete. Unless of course 4:3 IS the original format the movie was filmed in, which I seriously doubt.I give 4 stars for the movie, 1 for the format."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Boycotting this DVD...

It's a great 80's cheesy action romp. It's also a decent adaption of the Destroyer novels. I think the time is right to remake this film (that seems to be the bandwagon these days). After all, it really isn't a remake as it is a re-imagining of the novels. With todays awesome special effects it could really be something great. They probably should make it a little more politically correct, though. At any rate, this is a solid movie and definetely a good time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remo williams review","review":"film a lot amusing.Fred Ward and Joel Grey they are fantastic together.Kate Mulgrew a lot amusing.

What a shame that there was never a sequel! Guy Hamilton did a great job to introduce the characters to film! Heck, I'm a fan of anything that Guy Hamilton has ever done!Fred Ward and Joel Grey were absolutely the best in this film...if just for humor. So underplayed! Much appreciated here!Also, a GREAT score by Craig Safan...a much underrated composer (The Last Starfighter, Thief, etc...)!If you are a true fan ...check out Tommy Shaw's \\"What If\\" on YouTube.Jus sayin'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remo Williams The Adventure Begins","review":"Very funny movie.

You won't regret this movie for an evening of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy at last","review":"I am very happy that we were able to purchase the pool and deck furniture. My 3yr.old daughter,Morgan, really enjoys having Dora jump off the diving board and relax by the pool wearing the rubber duckie ring. She enjoys listening to the phrases from the diving board, too. It was a good idea for Fisher Price to include an extra Dora doll with the pool set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dora pool great even without the dollhouse!","review":"I got this pool for my daughter's 2nd bday even though she does not have the dollhouse. Since April, this little pool has been dropped more times than I can count yet there is no damage to it. She has a group of Dora figures that she uses with this. This has been a big hit with all the little kids we have coming in and out of our house. None of the figures can really sit on the deck chair - they are too heavy so they slide off. I hear this is also a problem with the Dora house. Highly recommended item!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why, yes, we do hate your music...","review":"...because D.R.I. did it back in 1987. And they did it better (although with thinner production). To hear a band ranting about other bands ripping off a scene that they love, when they are in fact merely off the same scene is pretty damn sad.\\"What I really hate is music like yours, makes me wanna smash your head through a door...\\" - Who's music? We don't know, but I'm guessing that it's the music of all of the \\"fake\\" hardcore bands out there. Doesn't really matter because it's kind of a [...]lyric, anyway.Sworn Enemy try to combine the ferocity of metal with the passion of hardcore. The problem is that they are missing both the passion and the ferocity.

It also gives the reasons why trusted people would deliberatey deceive the public."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's a hoodwinker, all right...","review":"Potential readers should know that Jack Cashill knows more about hoodwinking than he lets on. In 2002, Cashill wrote a seven-part series for the conservative website WorldNetDaily purporting to prove the innocence of anti-abortion extremist James Kopp in the murder of abortion provider Barnett Slepian. A few months later, however, Kopp pleaded guilty to killing Slepian, discrediting the series. Such determination to push an agenda in spite of the facts should be a warning of what to expect in Cashill's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preaching to the choir","review":"This book uses a mixture of truth, half-truth, and misrepresentation to attack the Godless \\"progressives.\\" It's aim, I assume, is to \\"preach to the choir\\" of religous conservatives, boosting morale - it will have no effect on Godless \\"progressives\\" except to provoke righteous anger. The treatment of evolution is atrocious. The book also suffers from lousy proof-reading - in various places Cashill gives the authors of \\"Inherit the Wind\\" incorrectly, inadvertently uses a man's middle name (rather than last) to refer to him, and gives the title of Kinsey's second book wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoodwinked: a mirrored look at the conservative right","review":"This isn't a novel or research; it's propaganda for the tenacious conservative right that continues to peddle half truths skillfully written to ensure being Hoodwinked. This is cherry picking at it's best and in normal conservative fashion an issue is plucked clean of any useful material with the rest of the 'picture' out of view. This book serves one purpose: to blind those seeking the entire argument of an issue and the promotion of old school thinking of the conservative dogma. No wonder free thinking scares conservatives; once you get the ball rolling, their house of cards will come crumbling down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat Emptor","review":"I first came across this book when I checked out Amazon's Bestsellers List for something to read.

Three days: stellar rise, precipitous drop.The book carried a five star reader rating, but it was on the basis of four readers.The book has not been reviewed in any general-readership publication that I could find.

With this album I only liked 2 songs.Having seen them live twice last year, I also don't think that the current Ozric line up is that good. I remember seeing them 2 nights in a row back in the mid 90s and being blown away by how different they were. The current line up just don't improvise much and everything seems far too rehearsed. I want the 2nd show to sound different and yet the only person who really improvises is the guitarist. That never used to be the case. They also are relying far too much on the old 'hits', yet they don't play those hits anywhere near as good as they used to. Will the magic every return?

Any player who appeared in the major leagues does not appear in this book, even if they had 500 minor league at bats and 1 major league at bat. I would like to see them change this and include anyone with rookie status. The cynic in me thinks they want you to buy both books rather than one or the other.They also have ceased including minor league park effects, which would I know they have, but they choose not to print.All in all it is a very good reference, but I would like to see STATS make more of an effort to improve upon their current offerings."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will be speechless","review":"This is the most heavenly fragrance ever created.

While Part Two is generally not as dramatically coherent as Part One, this particular production is handled as well as the first one. Geoffrey Bayldon is delightful as justice Shallow, while Pistol (\\"the foul-mouth'dst rogue in England\\") is played by Edward de Souza as a bulging-eyed, spluttering madman, who rolls his 'r's like a highland Scot.

Every song continues and develops the mood that the first track begins. Usually there is a dud in the mix somewhere but not in this case. Each track, and you may have several of these tracks from other compilations or other disc (like De Phazz, or Grace Jones), is a gem on its own. Reading the brief liner notes from Milla Jovovich, and looking at the photos of the Hotel Costes while listening sets quite a nice mood for an after work trip away from it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"first-rate","review":"the tracks are harmonious, you're never bored to play it.

I found the information provided therein deficient in several categories. There are actually only a couple pages that are devoted to any kind of description or explanation of the sex act itself, and those are non-illustrated and very shallow. The book is much more geared to describing male and female changes during puberty and of course, as a publication of Planned Parenthood, spends considerable time on contraception, STDs, and other topics which are not perhaps reflected in the book's misleading title. I would have returned the book but the return shipping fee would not have justified that process as it would have been more than one-half the cost of the book itself.

I work in very severe conditions--in the Middle East. You don't want to expose a fine mechanical or even quartz watch to daily dust baths and searing desert heat. The little Casio has held up through the worst of conditions, and still keeps time to within 15 seconds a month of the atomic clock in Colorado. It's highly water resistant, and so light you hardly know it's on your wrist. Amazon sells this watch under $20. How can you complain about a rugged, accurate watch for under $20?

I've been testing the loops with a reasonable amount of force and they do not bend.Given the comments from previous reviewers, I was prepared to receive something that might look rather shoddy, but it is not shoddy. Obviously not the best quality silver, but still good for the price. Well-polished.The inside has a small raised bit of silver (where it was soldered) which scratches my finger a little when I slide the ring on - unless I rotate it first to a better position. It is not sharp and does not leave any marks, and once on, the ring fits very comfortably. So this is a minor problem. Obviously these imperfections will vary from piece to piece - this is the nature of the design.The ring does not catch on my clothing.Wish this ring came in size 5. Other reviewers have reported that the sizes run a little smaller than standard, but I ordered the size 6 and it is still somewhat loose on my pointer finger."},{"rating":"1","title":"lovely to look at, uncomfortable to wear","review":"I purchased this item based on it's rave reviews and different look.

The first man's wife (Annette O'Toole) is unhappy with her husband for endorsing his friend's adultery. They have their own marital troubles, sex being a big factor.I saw the unrated version and I couldn't for the life of me figure out why it was unrated. There is more nudity and sex in a lot of R-rated movies. And like Homer Simpson said when told of a beautiful woman, is she beautiful or is she Gina Gershon-beautiful? Figure that out for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing with scant new information","review":"Woodworth is a proven, able civil war historian, but this is one of his weakest books. Instead of concentrating on Grant's relationship with his subordinates, he focuses on mini biographhies of people in Grant's orbit, such as Wallace, Baldy Smith, Sherman and Sheridan. The biographies themselves are no better than what you would find in an encyclopedia and contain absolutely no new or novel information. There is very little material on the personal dynamics between the commander and his minions.Grant's famous feuds with Rosecrans, Pap Thomas and Smith are poorly presented and glossed over without inciteful comment. A golden opportunity is missed here, because these disagreements highlight the most interesting aspect of Grant's relationships throughout the war.

I enjoyed the first half because it was about his life and I really enjoy good bio. of people I admire and respect. I just got booged down in all the explanation about how and why he became a catholic. A little of that goes a long way! So I recommend the book very much. I give the first half a 5 star.

But please be sure to read Peeps first, it gives some more background to the plot.I won't say any more because I have no interest in giving it away. So if you're the kind of person who likes to read a book without fear, don't read this one. But if you can handle it I say go for it. Had I known how \\"edgy\\" it was going to be I probably wouldn't have read Peeps, but I got caught in the story and couldn't get out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peeps is way better","review":"Without being mean.. i did not prefer this book. I loved Peeps and have loaned it out to friends and family. However this book was... strange.I was hoping for something more like the first book. This isn't. It starts out good. There is suspense and it's exciting.. but then you find out what the \\"thing\\" is and it's a disappointment. Peeps made sense, it was a virus that needed to be controlled. This is defiantly not like that.My advise is to pick it up at the library so you can see how it all \\"ends\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent","review":"I enjoyed the story behind this book. I did not, however, like the writing style. I kept needing to look back at the beginning of each chapter to determine who was the character speaking. They all had the same type of thoughts and therefore it sounded like one narrator when in fact is was supposed to be a different character each time. It had a pretty good story behind it though so overall I'd say that it was a decent book. The writing was a little bit too distracting for me with all the characters sounding the same, at some points it was difficult for me to pay attention to the reading because I was so bothered by the fact that there was no definition to the character's 'voices'. I can still say that I would recommend this book to another person, so long as they are aware that the writing style is dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big let down","review":"I loved Peeps, and Pretties, Uglies, and Specials, but Last Days was a big let down.

But this is one of those occasions when it's appropriate. The battery fits my Panasonic PV-GS29 just fine. But when I first got this battery, it didn't accept a full charge. After using it a few times and recharging, it began to show a full charge on the meter of the camera. However it discharges rapidly and requires much more frequent charging than the original battery that came with the camcorder. I read on a few blog sites that occasionally a new Li-ion battery will give a false reading on the device's meter of being discharged. To correct this you are supposed to totally discharge the battery ONLY ONCE. Then make sure you recharge immediately to 100%. I tried this last night and the battery still does not retain a full charge even overnight. I have a Lenmar battery as well, that works as it should. I think I'll bite the bullet and spend the extra money on a Lenmar instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ivy is a real treat!","review":"Ivy became one of my favorite groups the very first time I heard them. I have since purchased each of their four cds and they are no longer \\"one of\\" my favorites. They have the top spot! While I truly love their songrwiting skills, Guestroom (which consists of only covers) does not disappoint. Especially Ivy's rendition of \\"Kite\\" and \\"I Guess I'm Just A Little Too Sensitive\\". At the top of their game once again. I can't wait for their next cd, next five cds, next ten cds. I will be on a waitlist to get everything they put out."},{"rating":"2","title":"IVY Does It Again!","review":"Ivy is a terrific band. This disc is full of wonderful covers.\\"Let's Go To Bed\\"- a classic Cure song that Ivy further stretches into beauty.\\"Kite\\"- full of lasting and melodic hooks.\\"Streets Of Your Town\\"- some of the best alternative pop I've heard, with great background vocal ins and outs.\\"Only A Fool Would Say That\\"- i like some of Steely Dan's stuff and particularly Donald's solo album, and Ivy does this song full justice. some of that cafe melancholy.\\"I Guess I'm Just A Little Too Sensitive\\"- a perfect song of subtle acoustic longing and contemplation.Great CD. Pick it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neat, but not up to par for IVY","review":"\\"Long Distance\\" is maybe my FAVORITE album of all time by any artist... Ivy set their standard so high with the catchiness and ultra-mod production of \\"Long Distance,\\" that \\"GUEST ROOM\\" completely leaves me unsatisfied. Don't get me wrong, it is still a good album, and a must for Ivy fans, but I think it lacks the vibe and passion of other albums. Stylistically it is differnt too, with a much dryer, often generic sounding, electronic sound. Some great tracks, just not up to par in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best features for the price","review":"This camcorder offers the best features compared to similarly priced other brands (JVC and Panasonic), which include flash memory option, USB cable, and bigger video light. It is not as compact as JVC or Panasonic, but small enough to fit small bags. I have not had problems with the cassette insertion mechanism of the camera. It seems to be the best deal for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor video quality","review":"After extensive comparison of digital camcorders, I bought this camera as a well-priced entry level alternative to higher-priced models that all have limitations.The video produced by this camera was simply unacceptable to me and I returned it. The images were grainy and highly pixelated. I thought this problem might be improved with use of an S-video hookup but it was the same (or worse). I also thought it might have been a \\"low-light\\" problem but the same thing was true (although less dramatic) shooting in well-lit rooms and even outside in the sunshine.The problem was probably exacerbated by the fact that I have a fairly large projection TV but when I hooked it up to a smaller tube set, the image was still very grainy.Too bad. I like the feel of the unit and the feature set was good. COuldn't keep it though because the picture would drive me crazy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't really suck","review":"Get a Sony or Panasonic if you can otherwise go for this. Inserting tape at the base of the camera is a pain. Menu is not intutive. The flip open OSD is difficult to get out and the hinge seems to be very frail. Installing the drivers was also not swift on Windows XP Pro. I had to really search throughly for where the driver was located in the CD provided. The start/off button is also hard to operate. If can't afford Sony or Panasonic than this might be an okay choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAMSUNG SHOULD NOT MAKE CAMERAS","review":"I Had one of these, and after a year or so the LCD display when black, FOREVER.

I was filming my kids and my daughter's bright pink ball came out orange in the film. The images were not clear at all and everything appeared darker than to the eye. I have gotten MUCH better results from my old RCA vhs recorder than this digital one. In outdoors, at 1pm, I got similar disappointing results~ the colors of the trees were not captured and again, the images were darker than in real life. Very disappointing.I'm giving this camcorder 2 stars (rather than none) because it does have very good sound quality and it was easy to use. However, because I want decent recordings of my children, this is going back to the store today."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have had 5 of these cameras break in one year!!!!","review":"I purchased this camera a little over a year ago. A few days after the one month warranty it broke, it recorded and played everything with lines in it.

Then they sent us a refurbished camera that wouldn't focus, then one that wouldn't record and now one that won't turn off.The camera's all arrived to my house broken!!!We have had the camera for a little over a year and it has been at Samsung's repair facility more than it has been in our home. I will never again buy a Samsung product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this camera (or anything else from Samsung)","review":"Like many other people who have already posted reviews, my camcorder stopped working just after the warranty expired. Everything seems to work fine, except one major part -- the lens. When in record mode, nothing but a black screen. Customer service will fix it if I send it to their NJ location for over $100 -- about half of what I paid for the camera. I had some hesitation buying the camera, as I had a similar experience with a Samsung DVD player. Not long after the warranty expired, the dvd became half-functional. That is, it plays, but nothing else. Seems like Samsung likes to make products that almost work. Lesson learned: never, ever buy anything Samsung makes, no matter how much of a deal you think you are getting."},{"rating":"1","title":"PROTECTION!!!","review":"Well, I'm glad I didn't pay for it. We won this camera Christmas 2004 as a door prize at a company holiday party. We probably got a total of 3 hours on the camera itself, and when we recently went to use it, flashing in the middle of the screen is the word PROTECTION!- baffled, we called Samsung customer service, and they explained that it is a common and known defect that can be fixed at a service center (at great cost) We explained that we had used the camera so incredibly little since we got it and asked if they could perhaps have it fixed for us. No dice- they wouldn't stand behind their product- and so I will continue on my policy of NEVER EVER buying Samsung products. Had they done right by me and my family, perhaps I would have changed my thinking toward them, but they've lost a customer for life. It's really a shame they don't think about things like that when they make those kinds of decisions. I suppose they really don't care though."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have had two of these camcorders break!","review":"I liked the options, size and price. I thought Samsung was a good name for electronics, but I was wrong.I bought this as a gift for a friend.On the first week of use the battery clip broke and the battery would not lock on the camera. He was able to exchange the camera for a new one.And for this years holidays the new camera was used to record family and friends. During the recording it broke again and only showed and recorded a bunch of lines.And Samsung does not backup their products with a good warranty so now to repair the camera will cost around $60 US.I would not recommend Samsung camcorders. I have had a Sony for years and have not at any problems with it even after I dropped it a few times; the Sony also has a better picture. I also have an old GE 8mm Camcorder that also has a lot of recording time on it with out every having a problem.Please stay away from the Samsung camcorders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy something else...","review":"My camera also quit working just outside of the warranty period. I am not able to play back ANYTHING other than a blue screen with the date via USB, component cables, nor the lcd screen.I use this thing a couple of times every few months, and then, only for a few minutes. I am disappointed. While the cost of these items have dropped over the years, it makes it cost prohibitive to repair. I would rather spend another $100 and get a new camcorder. It won't be a Samsung, I can tell you that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Samsung will repair or replace this camera!","review":"If you have the problem of not being able to record other than audio, (bad CCD chip) Samsung will repair or replace this camera for free.

The pictures were great! Although, we did see them on 3 different screens and each one the quality of the movies were different. On the large (60\\") screen they did look grainy but on a 32\\" they looked great. And we were glad that we had purchased it.The only reason that I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I have not been able to hook it up to my computer via the USB cable and am online to order the other one.

It has, however, some major drawbacks.Our first main gripe is the substandard battery. We've charged it overnight and then would unplug thinking it was fully charged. After one week we'd grab the camcorder and head out the door to capture a magical moment...only to find the battery completely dead.After our third use, the camcorder now has some type of 'mechanical defect' as the manufacturer's manual calls it. The warranty is recently expired and so we're still debating whether to repair this item or just get another more reliable brand.If you decide purchase this camcorder, be sure to get extra batteries and always keep one on the charger. Hopefully you'll get more use out of yours than we did ours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal!","review":"Just bought this camcorder after A LOT of research...and couldn't be happier. It is very simple to use, and the manual is an easy read. The still pics are a little grainy...but we don't plan to use it for that purpose. The microphone picks up wonderful sound and the movie images are crisp and clean. Be careful, there is no memory stick included for still pictures, so you need to buy it.

If you've spent more than a semester without calculus you might as well forget trying to use this book in a formal course.Perhaps if you're a \\"bright\\" student you could make use of this book, though still it is absolutely no testament to professional teaching methodology. If you intend to learn the subject for any moderate application, look elsewhere. This book has no practical application examples worth any salt.

What an absolute waste of good money!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing talent up close","review":"The CD is fine (though many of his seem to offer the same material) - but the DVD of his \\"early famous\\" interviews and performance add a great deal to appreciating the man and his interest in this type of music, family, art. It's a similar approach to the later Madison Square Garden CD/DVD, and gives the \\"first look\\" to compare to that later refined, developed, and confident performer. If you like Buble, I think this is a pretty good piece - and reasonably priced. How long can that last?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Come Fly With Me","review":"This cd and dvd was recorded in 2004. Just about 2 years after Buble started making great music. He is still kind of raw in this dvd footage but you can tell, as in one of his songs, \\"The Best is Yet to Come.\\" He isn't wearing Boss suits like he is now but he could then and now belt out a good rendition of \\"Nice 'n Easy\\", \\"Fever\\" and \\"Kissing a Fool\\" just to name a few. Great music produced by the \\"Hit Man\\" himself, David Foster. Great cd and dvd to listen to and watch if you want to see the early Buble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great inside look at buble and his band.","review":"The arrangements are fantastic and the band flat out cooks! The songs are a bit of a memory lane journey (which is not a bad thing). These young guys know what the music is about, and play these great standards with fresh new vitality. Buble is obviously enjoying himself and this is quite clear in the DVD, which is the real treat in this package. There is a crafted balance of dialogue and documentary woven around the songs. On some tracks I wish they would just let the song continue without interuption, but understand the \\"promo\\" side of things. The bonus tracks from the AOL Sessions are very cool. The musicians again stand out as a group of amazing artists, all with really fine improvisational skills. The AOL Session truely displays a talented group of young jazz cats. This CD/DVD package is a well produced collection of classic standards. Buble is a fine singer, and a great entertainer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Have Been New","review":"I will never deny Michaels talent, it's always incredible. Now I'd like to see it be new. What is the point of releasing a CD/DVD set that has so little original material? Granted the DVD material hasn't been released before, but of the eight (not enough for an album) songs on the disk, only 5 are items not yet released through his current label. A note to all artists and record companies. Why go out and buy a CD/DVD compilation when there are only 5 songs that you would like to hear? What we needed was a live concert DVD (full length), and a new material CD (at east 13 songs would have been nice). I am just not willing to pay for the same things over and over no matter how talented the artist is. I consider this album/DVD combo a shame. Mike can offer so much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"BuBle","review":"I loved the cd/dvd of Michael buble, he's got such an awesome voice!

The editing is totally disrespectful to the material; and, then, you have to wonder why Buble didn't have the brains to realize that it's dispresectful to him, as well. Why would anyone with a measurable IQ ever consent to a project like this one, in which the goal was obviously to distract the listener's/viewer's attention from the performance? You've got to wonder.Well, the goal was achieved. And that's for starters. It gets worse. Shameful. What a waste. Next time, Michael, hire a producer who's stopped sucking his thumb and who's old enough to drive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget it. Another Sinatra wannabe","review":"This album is another attempt, by another guy (in this case a Canadian who has been 25 for like three years now according to his biography), that got under the wing of David Foster and that's about it. The songs are like impressions, and to be honest I like the likes of Brian Evans and Peter Cincotti MUCH better than this guy. The album sounds like karaoke tracks, and there is no feeling in the album the way Sinatra performed these songs. \\"Fever\\" sounds corny \\"Feva!\\" is what it should be called, and the way Buble sings it, even spelling it with four letters as I have is too long.I'm not into wannabe's, but there's one born every minute, but I suggest you buy ALL the albums of these guys, and then decide. This guy has nothing on either Evans or Cincotti, and time will tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aweful","review":"Another aweful attempt. Peter Cincotti, Brian Evans, and Buble need to get off the Sinatra wannabe bandwagon. This CD is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!!!!","review":"Is this a joke? How in the world are we supposed to take this guy seriously? He has absolutely no talent and I find it hard to believe that anyone, outside his family and friends, finds this stuff enjoyable in any way, shape or form.This, along with his other albums, are virtually unlistenable. I am dead serious. He reminds me of a toned down Mark Harris (Mr. Matha Raye), and trust me folks...that ain't a good thing. Yikes!This CD is little more than coaster material at this point. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You're kidding, right?","review":"This CD is great...if you like the who William Hung, American Idol thing.Only difference between this guy and William Hung is there are more songs on Hung's CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break","review":"I won't even waste my time on writing a lengthy review. The band sounds like karaoke, and the vocalist sounds like he needs to take the cotton out of his mouth. \\"Come Fly With Me\\"?I didn't like the songs, and he looks on the DVD much different than he looks in his promotional material, which still call this 31 year old 25.Get it right, and let's get rid of yet another Sinatra wannabe. If you want the real thing, check out Peter Cincotti, or better yet, Brian Evans. At least you can feel they mean what they are singing. Buble is just fell into a well connected group, and Warner fell for it. That is, of course, until it falls off Warner, which likely won't be long if this music is all they've got."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Wonderful","review":"This is an absolutely marvelous album.

Loses a lot being recorded off the speakers in that venue. Could have been a great C.D. if it had not been recorded live. Michael has a fantastic talent, but it is wasted on this. I would send this back, if I could. Buy the\\"It's Time\\" recording, if you wish to listen to real talent, andan outstanding musical background. I would not wish this one onmy worst enemy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"This DVD is a joke. I was expecting a concert type DVD a la Diana Krall (live in Paris) and was shocked at the poor production of this mess. The MTV type video shots seemed to change with every note and even juxtaposed shots from differenct concerts in the same song! It doesn't take a genius to realize that with this, you have inherent sync problems and they were everywhere through this album. Also, the picture quality was poor (grainy and dark) and the soundtrack of the DVD is not even in Dolby Digial although so indicated on the box.Note to Michael - your audio production on your previous CD is tremendous but your video production on this DVD is embarassing. Buy the Diana Krall DVD and learn what a musical DVD is all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preening Pretty Boy - Barf","review":"Good voice, great songs, but, man, this guy is in love with himself. What a narcisistic exercise. Does someone carry a mirror beside him all day so he can gaze upon his own greatness? Hello, it's the music, Michael. The DVD portion continues an annoying trend in concert productions, where an edit seems to take place every 2 seconds. It would be nice if a shot lasted long enough so that the viewer can take in the scene. All the jumping around detracts from the music and induces a headache. Most everything else is Michael yammering on about how great he is and how all women? adore him. That and a bunch of other disingenuous clap trap nonsense that rates mighty high on the barfometer. Just sing a straight song and throw back a bourbon, kid."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's not the new Sinatra.","review":"Ive only ever heared his songs on T.V ads, but he sounds like he has a snotty voice.

This was definitely not worth $20. If you want a professional quality concert, I would recommend buying Michael Buble's Caught in the Act."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flying too low","review":"The sound engineer for this cd should probably find a day job.Throughout several tracks, I could hardly hear Buble, while the band blasted. It seemed like he moved from one side of the stage to the other, but the volume was not increased so that he could be heard. Faded in and out. Somewhat disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pick something else","review":"I got this album after hearing him sing Sway. Was quite disappointed for two main reasons:1) CD doesn't have many tracks, and I don't think the singing here was that fantastic2) DVD is very distracting because of the constant change of view. After a while it got to the extent of being nauseating for myself, and the overall content isn't be any means spectacular, visually and aurally.I don't have this album any more, but I think the other Michael Buble - Michael Buble album is a better buy, with more tracks and lower price. The DVD in this album isn't worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Money I Ever Spent","review":"Buying this DVD was the best entertainment money I've ever spent --- it's that good.This DVD takes YOU there!

It's a nice transition from the shorter tales (Grimm) and picture books (Wanda Gag, Jan Brett) to the longer format. I bought this because we are big fans of everything to do with Baba Yaga & Vasilissa the Brave, and it's true enough to those sources, and also full of nice imagery and satisfying turns of phrase. I was not previously aware that the author also wrote \\"Wicked\\" but now that I know it's not at all surprising: you can really imagine this being done up beautifully on a stage, and it plays out nicely on the stage of the imagination too. (There's even a pretty little song that ties the whole thing together) Anyway, it really works for us. I recommend it wholeheartedly for curling up with the little ones by the fire, or reading to the kids from the bed-side rocker as the snow comes down."},{"rating":"2","title":"foxes","review":"this was a great early 80s movies about teens partying and durgs and what happens in the end is sad"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating film about teens","review":"If you grew up in LA or the San Fernando valley then this is something you won't want to miss. The film is about teens in their senior year in the San Fernando valley who don't understand adults or themselves really.

Cherie Curry probably didn't have to stretch much to play her character Annie and Jodie Foster as always does a great job with her character too.The film isn't polished. Nor is the acting.

Directed by Adrian Lyne, who would later go on to direct the notorious \\"Fatal Attraction\\", \\"Foxes\\" is a cheap, lame-brained attempt at a gritty look into the dark side of teenage life. The movie suffers from a painful lack of character development and goes in a seemingly incoherent fashion from one scene to another, making it hard to stay focused. The movie isn't a TOTAL waste--a few dramatic scenes do at least catch your attention; and Jodie Foster, still under 18 when this was filmed, has a real charisma about her despite the fact that she isn't given much to work with. Plus, that piano melody of Donna Summer's \\"On The Radio\\" which crops up throughout adds a nice melancholy feel. Overall though, \\"Foxes\\" really is pretty lousy and can't be given much of a recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loves the movie foxes","review":"I purchased this movie after watching the movie the Runaways based on the book Neon Angle by Cherrie Currey.I saw at the end that she starred in the movie and wanted to see what she was like back then.

This book does an excellent job of orienting anyone interested in channeling thru the use of a Ouija board. The author presents the history, presents the good experiences people have had and presents the bad experiences people have had. The author even conducts an interview with an entity channeled thru another person using the Ouija board. The results of that interview are very positive. The author's style of writing is easy to follow and well written. It was difficult to put this book down.

From the grinding \\"Oh My Lover\\" to the outright catchy \\"Sheela Na Gig\\" & \\"Dress\\"; and the earthy \\"Plants and Rags\\", which features my favorite lyric on the album (\\"plants and rags/ease myself into a body bag\\"), this is an album full of raw vigor (\\"Hair\\", \\"Joe\\") and jagged beauty (\\"Fountain\\", \\"O Stella\\"). Subsequent albums would have more focus and theatricality, but Dry's bare bones approach proved PJ Harvey an artist of astonishing diversity and talent well before the mainstream caught on."},{"rating":"2","title":"PJ Harvey - Dry","review":"Overall, this is my favorite PJ Harvey album. It's not her best (that would be either the rather dark \\"To Bring You My Love\\" or the generally innocuous \\"Stories From The City/Stories From The Sea\\"), but I keep listening to it again and again. The songs are in a variety of musical styles, ranging from folk/blues rock to 1992-era hardcore rock. So there's a lot of variety. If you don't like one song, wait for the next. Most of the songs are good -- only a couple leave me flat (\\"Joe\\" and \\"Plants And Rags\\"). I cannot say that one song is the best of the bunch, but \\"Sheila Na Gig\\" represents this period of PJ Harvey's career the best for me. And it rocks!If you have never heard PJ Harvey, \\"Stories...\\" would be a better choice. She will not appeal to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"This book is very good.

Of course we see that today (look at the Sandusky scandal) but it was the 80s when this stuff really took off--throwing money at kids who couldn't or refused to apply themselves in something other than playing, sex, and money. Anyway supposedly Johnny was not one to fall for this (which is a farce) as he was \\"true\\" to his girlfriend (a young Uma Thurman . . . who is not a very attractive young girl by the way). . . . Anyway he is wined and dined and in the end \\"does the right thing\\" (which again is very very unrealistic for the subject matter). The story is a stereotype at this point . . . the poor football player needing the big college \\"ride\\" to support his family etc. Anyway the only good thing about this is to see a young chubby Robert Downey Jr. And to see as always a good looking Anthony Michael Hall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical 1980's teen comedy movie","review":"2 of 5 stars to the 1980's typical teen comedy movie Johnny Be Good. To the movies credit, it has several young actors who turn out to be name-brand people. How about Uma Thurman? Robert Downey Jr? Anthony Michael Hall? So that was good.The plot is about a high school football star who is trying to decide which college to attend. So, we follow AM Hall as his character visits several colleges who each roll-out the red carpet with VIP perks to get him to decide in their favor. The whole thing would be OK if you can possible believe that Hall COULD be a football star. My thinking is that on his first tackle, he'd be broken-up into little parts. He simply was not believeable as a star player.So, the movie was mildly funny with the usual plot twists and gags. Nothing special to recommend this movie.

Calling Solaris: \\"The Russian Space Odyssey,\\" is nothing more but a sad marketing ploy of the distributors.Tarkovsky made films about people-not about pieces of metal floating in space masqueraded as the future. Solaris is a film about people, and as such it has few of the cheap gimmicks usually present in sci-fi films. If you are patient, can appreciate subtlety, and found the actors dressed as apes at the beginning of 2001 laughable, you will find Solaris very rewarding-otherwise, don't waste your time.I might also add that although I find Solaris amongst the best films ever made, I also think that it is one of the least convincing of those directed by Tarkovsky. Rather than watching Solaris, go see Andrei Rublev, or The Mirror, they are all conceptually similar, however, the latter two are much better realized."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent","review":"This is one of my favorites movies.

A good effort and a job well done, and I have to say, I am pleased to see that a couple of Hollywood heads have higher than typical aspirations in attempting to remake a novel which is both challenging and not easy to market.A good stab at it, which I suppose we owe to Soderbergh's writing and direction than Cameron's usual search for quick profit. More straight-forward and focused than Tarkovsky's original this movie should be much easier to digest for for uninitiated.Still, as meditative ,challenging and beautiful films go, Andrei Tarkovsky's original is a hands-down winner. I agree with an earlier reviewer that some sequences in the original(notably the highway scene, but there are others) are inspired and unforgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"To clarify","review":"Contrary to poular belief, this is not a Russian 2001: A Space Odyssey.

It is a great, timeless book written by S. Lem. The two movie adaptations to date are quite bad. Tarkovsky's Solaris is so far removed from the book that it should say that is it loosely based on it, instead of being claimed as an adaptation.It is a russian answer to Kubrick's '2001' as much as the terrible Tupolev-144 was a russian answer to the Concorde. Most educated people have heard of '2001' (heard, not necessary liked it), while Tarkovsky's 'Solaris' enjoys well deserved obscurity, not only in the west, but also in Russia, and in Poland (S. Lem's home country).People who like Tarkovsky's 'Solaris' will continue to like it, I can only hope that people who don't like it won't think that S. Lem's book is as bad as the movie. Because it is so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not sure about the Criterion Collection treatment","review":"The problem with the Criterion edition of the movie is that the subtitles are pasted down below the film frame, this forces you to keep the picture as a small window so that the subtitles can fit inside the TV screen, if you try to make the picture fill your screen you lose the subtitles. I don't see a setting in the movie menu that would place the subtitles within the film frame. The Criterion folks probably did that out of some notion of \\"respect\\" for the image perhaps, fine, but at least give us an alternative option for viewing. For a visually stunning movie like this to be seen in a tiny little window with big chunks of black all around is a pity, it really diminishes the enjoyment of the film.

I have been watching SF, reading SF for over 30 years, and I am just as thrilled to watch a brilliant piece of SF filmmaking - regardless of the public response or the inaccessability of the theme - as I am to view any great work of art.This version of SOLARIS, sadly, leaves more to be desired than it delivers. The writing is intentionally enigmatic, and one gets the sense that the filmmaker doesn't really know what's going on, so he's hiding his cluelessness behind a thin veneer of \\"cleverness\\".It doesn't work.There is nothing in the film I would call brilliant. The acting is so-so (having the lead walking around looking at things to creepy music for an hour is pretty lame), the photography is average, and the script doesn't do justice to the original material.I expect great art to leave me a better person - I can get lost in a masterpiece for hours.

Stanislas Lem's novel was quite different from Sotherberg's movie, but I found it rather pleasant on the whole, despite clear weaknesses and sometimes clumsy writing (especially character handling and dialogues).

When I called Kent to ask what size allen wrenches I should use, they answered my questions with no problems.The purpose of this bike, for me, is to figure out if I'm really interested in becoming more serious in road biking.

After a few rides, the cheap components start to show. I am not a professional rider, or even think I will ever make it to a triathalon, however, this bike won't hold up past a stoll in the park. The shifters could never adjust right, skipped gears, and ever slipped the chain a few times. The tires are quite out of round and very unstable at high speeds.I enjoyed riding around with my kids, but on my own training time, this bike worried me. I have taken it back and will spend a few extra bucks to get a good upgrade."},{"rating":"1","title":"heavy slow more like hybrid then road bike","review":"Tire rims did not spin true right out of box. The brakes are slow to stop and are not positioned for quick easy access. You have to squeeze brakes hard to stop on hill. The tires are not thin this was the most disappointing thus not like good road bikes. All components are on the cheap side none are quick release. With this all said it is fairly priced at $169. To get a good road bike you have to pay much more.I should have tried to find a good used road bike instead for the 169 I spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"The sum is just as crappy as its parts!","review":"I was very excited to receive this bike however I am forced to return it. The front derailer doesn't have enough movement to select all three of the gears so you have to pick either gears 1 and 2 or 2 and 3 (so its only a 14 gear bike). The brakes have very little stopping power so if you have to suddenly stop for oh lets say... traffic, then prepare to meet some cars. The rear gears aren't that great either and after a couple days of riding the rear sprockets started slipping and the chain has trouble holding its place. This bike is a mass produced product with inferior parts, sometimes you luck out and everything will work together (all the 5 star ratings) but most of the time things just keep breaking/ falling apart because this bike is built from a spare parts bin.Don't waste your time risking it, this is a DO NOT BUY. I tried to love it but I just can't!"},{"rating":"1","title":"looks great but broken out of the box","review":"The \\"low\\" price reflects the additional time and money I had to spend to fix the bike, which arrived in need of repair. I could've shipped it back, but then it was going to cost me the same to have it fixed. so, all in all, I do not recommend seller at all, the fact that I have to run around trying to fix a new bike just ruined it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"gmc bike","review":"Cheap bike but ok for the price. The bearings in the crank broke down within 3 weeks of buying the bike. Amazon customer service were v helpful"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Value, heavy bike.","review":"I bought the bike thinking it was a great value. Tried to tune it myself, wow that was a pain to do. More difficult than any other bike I've owned. There is no suspension and the wheels are 28\\". The ride is EXTREMELY stiff, too stiff for me so I sold the bike shortly after I bought it. It has to do with the larger wheels and the steel frame. The aluminum in higher bikes deflects more than steel so aluminum frame bikes ARE a little softer than these steel framed bikes.I'm 5'10\\" and I think the large would have fit me better. If you're ok with a stiff ride then go for it, the bike is a good value. Shipping was really fast too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brings back memories of Windows 95","review":"UPS delivered the contents intact. The assembly is straightforward but then... Brakes needed adjusting- this was the easy part. Both the rear and front derailleurs needed adjusting and this took a while longer. So, even with the impact of disassembly and assembly, it looks like quality control out of the factory gates is krap. It is upgradable, in the same way that with patience, Windows 95 morphed eventually into 2000 or XP which were more stable. However, given the cost of all you\`d want to change by keeping just the frame, one would do better to looks elsewhere. The ride is OK, for what you paid for the bike. Bottom line: If you like tinkering with your bike, this could be an interesting project. It needs persistent massaging, same as Windows 95. If you are not comfortable with doing the adjustments yourself, you may wish to look somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not ment for hard rides","review":"This bike is nice to look at but that is about all. I went on what was going to be a 40 mile drive and ended up only going about 18 since the bike broke. I can get the part for free from Kent (when I get all the hoops jumped through) but there is a special tool needed to replace the part. The bike shop wants more that the bike cost to do the repair... So there it sits in my garage awaiting a miricle from the cycling gods."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"Not a good bicycle, makes a lot of noise.

I rode the bike for a few miles then I realized that I should have went to a bike shop to get a road bike. This one does not pre form the the presicion of a the Trek 1000 that I test road at my local bike shop. The Trek has it beat by at least 5 pounds and the Shimano Sora shifters work far better than the revo shifts (who puts grip shifters on a road bike anyway). They you can't shift gears when you are in a aero position and the only way to brake is by being in the drop outs. Yes it cost $140 but it will only last a year. Spend about $650 and get yourself a good bike that you will be happy with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good buy","review":"The bike arrived with a large scratch along the side from delivery but that was not the biggest problem.

Rubber parts are more plastic than rubber. Cheap tires and rims. Looks great though. Aluminum frame. (Just like a beer can). Other than the 4 dollar levers, it's all big box junk parts with pretty paint. It's basically a 49 dollar heap made to look like a road bike. You get what you pay for. It's that simple. If you can justify this in your mind then you'll get what you deserve. Landfill. A new roadbike can be had for under $500. And if you maintain it, the cost will be much less than the Denali. It will have resale, NOT long gone into a recycleing bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go to a store and get fitted!","review":"This bike is sturdy, but honestly you shouldn't be buying a bike off of a website unless you know what you are doing! I made that mistake and even though this bike was right for my height, everything else didn't fit my body. Trust me, go to a store, it's an investment that needs to be taken seriously!

But I didn't know it would take as long as it did. I finally got my bike, I got it 4 weeks later from a neighbor that I don't even know. It was shipped to the wrong house and left there. Ichecked the address and it was my house, so I don't know what happened with that. Good thing he was honest, it was at his place for a week. Second, I went to the bike shop so they can put it together. I had to pay for 2 intertubes because of a manufacturer deffect on the wheel itself; didn't fit propperly and air kept coming out. I haven't been on the road yet, hopefully it won't fall apart on me. I do like how it looks if that any consolation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth a dime","review":"This bicycle is not worth a dime.

Overall good bike"},{"rating":"2","title":"Runs fine.","review":"I am 115-120 lb and about 5'4\\" so I got the small size. The bike comes in chunks that have to be assembled (stem, rear wheel and frame, front wheel, seat etc.). Both the brakes and gears need to be tuned. I have ridden more than a hundred miles on it already and not one problem. The bike is really lite and more than strong enough to handle my weight. This is a great deal. However, if you can't use a screwdriver and wrench, this is not for you.Edit: Coming back to review 2 years later. This is by far the best money I have EVER SPENT. I have a couple thousand miles on it and only ever replaced the rear tube and tire. I absolutely love riding it. No rust or cracks in any parts yet.

Not sure why they didn't throw in a kit of basic Alan wrenches to finish what would have otherwise been an easy assembley. Also... for some reason my bike came without the front right brake pad (?).

The tubes are poorly constructed, the welds are ugly, the components are bottom of the barrel. Everything will eventually fall apart on this, and if it doesn't, you're stuck with a heavy bike that you can't upgrade."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap price cheap bike","review":"I opted for the cheapest bike and shipping charges and i got what i ask for. The free shipping was great, but I read the shipping eta incorrect the date that was given was the shipping date, about one week from the order date was the actual day the bike was shipped. Got here pretty fast after it was shipped. So expect a two week processing and ship from order date.As i was assembling it I noticed the handle bar wrap was ripped in two different places. I used electric tape to remedy that problem. Put air in the tires rode it around felt okay and sturdy. Next day the rear tire got flat. Not the perfect bike. If you buy this bike be prepared to make some minor adjustments and repairs.Also wanted to note the weird neck and adaptor for the handle bar. Can't figure out why the manufacture would use an oversided neck then an adaptor. Why not just use the correct size. Well I'm over that now. You get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of crap","review":"This bike was an aweful purchace, the pedal threads stripped out on me after only a week of riding, and i wasn't even riding that hard, most of the protective plastic was shattered when it showed up and the bike never did run to strait."},{"rating":"1","title":"P.O.S.","review":"This bicycle is inexpensive, but it rides like it. It also looks cool, but that's it. The gear-shifting system is horrible and outdated. It makes a grinding, metal-on-metal sound while riding in the lower gears. Does it look cool? Yes. Does it need major work after market purchase? Yes. I should have paid the extra $100 to get a different bike, because now I'm stuck with a $159 P.O.S.

To begin with, the bike was received with a pierced tire tube and incorrect seatpost size (the seatpost included was too wide to fit in the hole - this was confirmed by a bike shop). When I contacted Kent Bicycles for support, I received yet another incorrectly-sized seatpost, despite my specific instructions. Eventually, the bike shop had to order the seatpost at a cost of $20. Very quickly, the front gears broke and somehow bent, making the lowest gear unavailable for use. Eventually, once other components started breaking, I contact amazon.com for a replacement, and lo and behold, the incorrect size seatpost was included. Does Kent Bicycles send out this same incorrect seatpost for all Denali bikes?Bottom Line: Stay far far away from this product, and if you absolutely have to have it, buy it in-store, pre-assembled at Walmart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cyclists BEWARE.","review":"I received my gmc denal road bike about a week and a half ago, the first day I received this bike the stock tubes blew out after about 20 minutes into riding, then the following day the kick stand on the bike snapped offwhen it was adjusted back up (not exagerating), and on top of these things the chain constantly slips and the brakes are horrible even when adjusted. And when riding one day the allen nut that hold the handle bars and the fork together loosened completely and almosty made me wreck.I guess the saying is true \\"you get what you pay for\\"...I highly DO NOT recommend this bike to anyone, not even a begginer it is dangerous and a number of things go wrong with these bikes.

I'm sure no one's going to buy this bike for the Olympics. It was pretty easy to put together and with a few simple adjustments I was on the road. Unless you are about 6'2\\" or have a very long inseam of 35\\" plus, I'd recommend the the medium or small size. It looks good too so you won't be embarrassed to be seen on it. This bike will last you for years. Good luck, and have fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good entry level.","review":"I have just begun to start training on a bike, and haven't even touched a pedal for more years than I can count. After looking for a bike that wouldn't break the bank I decided on this one. I am training for a 1/2 marathon and needed to supplement training with something else, and I decided on cycling.I decided on the GMC Denali just on the price point alone. After bike shopping at LBS and looking at entry-levels at 700 dollars, my jaw hit the ground.Out of the box this bike is easy to assemble with any sort of mechanical aptitude. It does take a little bit of tuning up, which is easily YouTubed, but other than that I rode 7 miles my first ride. I have since put 21 miles a week on it for 3 weeks and haven't had the slightest chain chatter. It rides well and I am thoroughly impressed so far. If you are looking for a bike that will not break the bank, this could be the bike for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Bike at the Right Price","review":"First of all I am 6'1\\" ~200lbs and this thing fits me fine. Right out of the box assembly was quick and easy but you will need to make some adjustments as some gears will make a little noise till you get it right (still ride-able). You might also want to adjust the handle bar angle up a bit. Once I made a few adjustments this thing serves it's purpose fine. I am not a \\"biker\\" but I wanted a street bike for commuting in Pittsburgh from where I can park for free to where I work. Components all seem sturdy enough and I feel comfortable and safe on the bike. I would suggest getting a helmet if you are just making the switch from a an old 26 inch mountain bike because this is quite a bit faster, higher off the ground, and has less grip in gravel situations."},{"rating":"1","title":"I sent it back.....","review":"Beautiful bike, bright colors, nice design...best price ever.I got the 26\\" version, it was too tall for me.

I got it for 150.00 and plan on putting a few dollars into new brakes, because they are not very good, but I think buying this bike for 150 and spending 60 on brakes is still quite a bargain when comparing it to $800.00+ bikes out there.

This might be out of my range to fix. I figured out how to tighten the brake cable before I realized this and by then I found the handle bar heavy and hard to steer plus my feet hit the front wheel even at the slight turn it could make and I wear a woman size 7 shoe.

The crank is already showing signs of cracking after about a year of use (I'm not a very large fellow and unfortunately my legs lack super-human strength) and there's a general feeling of cheapness to the bike. It works fine if you just need a riding around campus bike on the cheap but it will end up requiring work/maintenance quicker than average.The format of the handlebars and the positioning of the gear switching mechanism also limits the number of positions where you can attach a headlight.In sum, if you're going to ride it hard it's not going to last much more than a year or two. It was decent while it worked but now it's sitting in the garage until I can at least replace the cracked pedal crank.

The brakes needed adjusting but the shifters worked alright.The bike is equipped with the usual components you findin this price class, maybe even a bit above average.Shimano Tz30 rear derailleur, T31 front derailleur and the Shimano twist shifters.

I use the stretch routine after workouts or anytime I feel I need a thorough stretching out. It is not difficult and you feel good afterwards.

You must think in terms of credibility. No motive was given for the secret service agent to turncoat on the president.This is vital. The audience must know why he's turned traitor. Allow a foreign camera crew on board? No way, Jose. Harrison Ford has a gun on one of the bad guys so he won't reveal his position? I thought these guys would dearly love to die for their cause. And the parachute scene? People dropping in a parachute for the first time wouldn't be grinning from ear to ear. If you like airplane hijack movies then \\"Executive Decision\\" is much better.

When terrorists supporting that general slip aboard and then take over Airforce One, the president and his family are in danger.The action is good, and the bravado of Ford as the US president is exciting. I have to admit, however, that the believability of the entire story is pretty sketchy. There are quite a few holes in the plot, the largest being the lack of an explanation about why a top secret service agent, the one over the President's security detail, would ever help terrorists.Even so, the drama and action are good.Those things together make for a good, but not completely outstanding show.4-stars...that's it...and perhaps a rather weak 4 stars at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two thumbs up--way up in the air, that is","review":"Combining the sure-handed directing of Wolfgang Petersen and the superb acting of always-in-top-form Harrison Ford, \\"Air Force One\\" is an action/thriller masterpiece. All the pieces of this movie fit together like (pardon the cliche) a big jigsaw puzzle. A great supporting cast; an inginuis script by Andrew W. Marlowe; edge-of-your-seat pacing; great cinematography; a patriotic, four-star soundtrack by skilled composer Jerry Goldsmith (\\"Rudy,\\" \\"U.S. Marshals\\")--all contribute to make \\"Air Force One\\" a smashing hit. Nominated for two Oscars (though it lost to the public-swayed votes for \\"Titanic\\"), this is the most enjyable movie I have ever seen in the theaters. Kudos to Harrison Ford, who shines as the American President we all wish for, standing up for what he believes in.

The action scenes, production, special effects, musical soundtrack by the stalwart and excellent Jerry Goldsmith and the photography are first rate.

I love Harrison Ford movies, but this one is a stinker. The special effects look like they are from the 50's. I just watched Top Gun and Star Wars. Both of them had better arial shots. The plot was a die hard rip off. Talk about suspending disbelief. This is about as phoney and contrived as they come. I like far fetched movies like the Matrix, but this is just plane (ha ha) silly. The fundamentals are all wrong. No character development. Why didn't they go ahead and make the president a former wrestler who happens to be a ninja war hero?

The beginning of the movie is somewhat credible, but soon presents us with one-dimensional characters and motivations, a lame and predictable plot and wooden, tepid acting. There are some twists, but they are so ridiculous and unbelievable that I stopped caring about it halfway through, given that the resolution has no surprises at all since the \\"good\\" guys always win. Despite some competent action sequences, this is brain-dead, mind-numbing material, cartoonish at best and completly disposable. There\`s no force to be found here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent script, plenty of action, but somehow lacking","review":"To me the best thing about this film is the fact that the American point of view is not the only one given voice. There was much truth to what Gary Oldman's character says to the President about american involvement abroad. And as such, for one of the first times, an american film is not so pro american. Bravo!Now to detract. If our secret service is as inept as they were portrayed in this film I feel sorry for the President. And I have to say that at times certain scenes came off incredibly staged and unrealistic. And some scenes just seemed very inplausible.All that said I have to say that the film is very entertaining. I just wouldn't rate Air Force One as a purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly thriller","review":"Typical Hollywood thriller ...

Like the president could have really taken down a large group of terrorists. I mean he's not Arnold or a military expert. He's the president for God's sake! Like any president could have done this! The movie's simply about the air force one plane that's hijacked by Russian terrorists and the president decides to stay on board and not go in the ejector seat and kick their buts!

When russian terrorists high-jack the air force one, its up to the world's all-time favorite president to make it out. But he doesn't want to do that. His wife and daughter are on the plane, and he's getting them and his crew safe before he goes. When the Russians get him and are black-mailing D.C., whats gonna happen? Is he going to give up his life for his family? Is he gonna let the US blow the plane? You'll have to whatch it to find out!

They don't even try to attempt something remotely original, and that seems down into their casting decisions. How many times do we need to see Gary Oldman play a creepy villain? Honestly, how many times do we need to see Harrison Ford play a Presidential figure of some sort? Even Glenn Close gets type casted in those \`women who wish they were as powerful as men' roles. That is the big issue with \`Air Force One', there is nothing original here. The story is preposterous and pretty straightforward with no real stimulation. It doesn't make a lot of sense and yet it is forgivable action fluff for the most part really. The action scenes are effective and some of the visuals are nicely constructed, but the tension just doesn't live up upon multiple viewings, and really with a film this redundant in basically everything it isn't worth watching more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"not even good to laugh at","review":"There aren't very many movies I outright loathe. There were so many times during this movie that my jaw just dropped at the stupidity of it that I wonder whether I might have missed the point - is this some Strangelovesque ironic masterpiece, and am I the dumb literal sucker? But of course that's not true (the first part, at least).The typical argument in defense of a film like this is, \\"Of course it's stupid. It's an action movie.\\" Yes: even the good action movies tend to be stupid. This one, though, is stupid but has nothing to recommend it. The patriotism is simplistic, insipid, and insulting. The plot is trash, the characters trash, the action trash. The movie doesn't even make sense within its own reality - suspension of disbelief fails you.What an awful, awful film.

Why couldn't they make a movie for once that's more steeped in reality: Where Air Force One gets hijacked and the U.S. Government has no choice but to shoot it out of the sky so U.S. security is not compromised. Now THAT would be entertaining, but not very popular."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very bad film with some very good actors","review":"This film is a real dissapointment. Harrison Ford gives a credible performance as the President and Gary Oldman pulls off his villain role with panache. But this movie simply doesn't work.

Maybe logic isn't exactly what people are looking for when they watch a \\"no-brainer\\", but this film is really too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Headache-inducing Fare.","review":"This movie is so rancid it will appeal mainly to the brain-dead.

I just watched the last 1/4 of it on TV just now. STUPID movie. Harrison Ford looks like he's drugged or constipated throughout the entire movie. He's gotten in the bad habit of narrowing his range of emotions from his usual A-to-B to an annoying A.SPOILER (although, how can you spoil this piece of rotten fruit any more?)William Macy plays a pilot.

This movie had so many rediculous, stupid scenes in it, it was almost comical. I know playing the president of the United States is a great character to portray, but Harrison Ford should really be more critical of the scripts he accepts. The scene where the presidnent's secretary is floating down in her parachute has got to be one of the most ludicrous shots ever captured on film. This is an action film, however it's just a really stupid action film. Sappy, confusing, melodramatic, and rediculous are just a few words that describe this movie. Oldman, Close, and some good character actors are horribly wasted. Great premise, awful film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great action - a Harrison Ford trait","review":"A great movie for Harrison Ford fans. Ranks with it's cousins Patriot Games and Clear & Present Danger. One minor flaw for this military veteran reviewer - toward the end of the movie the President (Ford) asks an Air Force major (William H. Macy) if he know how to fly, and the answer is \\"No\\". The major is wearing Master Pilot wings on his shirt, but he doesn't know how to fly . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"It's a boring script and the acting is just plain bad - Harrison has one good believable moment, but Glenn Close and Gary Oldman can't manage to pull it off.

He silently kills a member of the terrorist group before establishing contact with F-15's to engage the hijacked plane.

A 40-yr-old president taking on professional commando in his 20s for hand-to-hand combat repeatedly? Guns blasting everywhere in an airplane?

Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman, even though they were strong enemies in the film, kept you on the edge of your seat with their heartpounding dramatics.This is a good film for bringing out even more patriotism and pride in our country and president, adding to the patriotism that was brought out by September 11th. I can compare this presidential film to THIRTEEN DAYS, the Cuban Missile Crisis film that came out last year (except that Air Force One wasn't based on a true story). I think Dubbya would be wise in watching both this film and Thirteen Days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kick butt - USA!","review":"This is definitely one of the good ol' us vs. them - good vs. evil story. Harrison Ford plays a different kind of US President (one that I would like to see in \\"real\\" life), a President that takes matters into his own hands and deals his own \\"justice\\" by kicking some serious ... and shooting the heck out of everything.

Good tale that is heart pounding at moments.As I said before Cool.This team of actors is great. Harrison Ford is definately better in this one than 6 days 7 nights.

Ford stars as U.S. President James Marshall, who boards Air Force One for a flight, when terrorists (one played by Gary Oldman) hijack the plane. Like \\"Executive Decision\\"(I recommend you watch that awesome film) and \\"Passenger 57\\" (a cool movie), the plot revolves around a hijacked plane. This particular movie is an awesome adventure and just as good as \\"Executive Decision\\" (stars Kurt Russell and Halle Berry), and to me is even better than \\"Passenger 57\\" (stars Wesley Snipes). Glenn Close plays the female vice president, and Anne Archer plays the first lady, Marshall's wife. This spectacular piece is directed by Wolfgang Petersen, who also directed \\"In The Line Of Fire\\", an awesome thriller starring Clint Eastwood, John Malkovich, and Rene Russo."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best action films out there!","review":"Harrison Ford plays the President of the United States and does a great job at it. I have watched this movie too many times to count. This is one of those movies that have you cheering for the President. It's about time someone made a movie where the President stands up for himself instead of someone always trying to save him. Gary Oldman does a fantastic job as the terrorist. He really makes you believe that his cause is the right cause. Some scenes did remind me of Die Hard, but if you liked Die Hard you will love this movie. My wife was watching the movie with me and kept digging her hand into my arm! She really gets into the movie more than I. Overall, the DVD sound and picture is excellent. This is definitely a buy not a rental!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly Enjoyable","review":"I found this film to be highly entertaining, although somewhat unrealistic. I can accept this because, as a work of fiction, it is precisely that--unrealistic. It had its moments of implausibility, but overall these were forgiveable since we get to see a President who is honorable, decent, and faithful to his beliefs and family--another huge point of fiction considering the current administration. The plane is a bit different from the real thing (so I have been told), but that's ok. Nothing presented in the plane is \\"beyond belief.\\" Even the \\"bullet resistant\\" cabin is possible.

My cashiers love it and it makes my life so much easier because I know what items are selling, what's not, how much per hour (so I can more efficiently manage scheduling), and so many other wonder features for such a great price.

This book touches on various cultures while relating them to current \\"Western\\" culture. It's a fascinating look at the ceremony and sacredness in birth for many groups-while the lack of ceremony rings loudly for America.

However, it is compact, organized by district and nicely written. It was fun to read. It provides some history, description and human interest anecdotes about authors, artists and others who frequented these various establishments during the establishment's formative periods. It also provides some indication of the current quality -- at least as of around 1999 or so. My only suggestion is that a map would have made it much more useful both for people trying to use it while in Paris as well as for armchair travelers.

There's not one. If you are already familiar with Paris, there's nothing here that's eye-opening. Considering only 30-40 lines in this very tiny book is devoted to each restaurant/bakery/shop, nothing much is said. The large number of spelling mistakes in French could have used a good spell-checker. If you are new to Paris and just need some names, this could be of some use but make sure you do research on the internet to find out more about the restaurant before you go.

The short novella bears little resemblance to the film other than its title and post-apocalyptic setting. That being said, readers who enjoy day dreaming about the world sans-civilization could do worse than this simple little story with its non-threatening prose and stock characters. Always remember, there is no shame in putting down Faulkner and wasting an afternoon with a little harmless trash....G.R.R. Martin can attest."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good for escapist readers, I liked it","review":"I found the story interesting. I did not miss the usual gory boring details of the holocast which preceeded the story line.

If you sought a moral then I would conclude you could find it here in the people's Hope the postman exploited and which finally they used on him."},{"rating":"2","title":"The post-Apocalypse book you'll ever read","review":"I read this book a few years ago and to this day it's one of my favorite's of all time.

I read it all in one day - couldn't put it down"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved the book for different reasons than most of these!","review":"Mr Brin is obviously a very gifted writer. I listen/read lots of modern authors, and it is a pleasure to find an author who just plain writes well!That being said, I saw the book on a different level than any of the other reviews I perused. The whole post-apocalyptic setting in my mind, was simply a background against which to analyze the heart of humankind. The post-apocalyptic world made it easy for Brin to cut through a lot of the fluff that clouds our thinking and get to real issues of life, justice, ethics, and finally idealism. Along the way he explores several social models: benevolent socialism, leader worship, feudalism, and separatism. Brin also weaves an interesting subtheme about what it means to be a man, or to be a hero.This book is way more than \\"a good read\\" or \\"highly entertaining\\" - it will make you think and examine your values. - the sign of a truly good work."},{"rating":"2","title":"book superior to movie","review":"Yes, this is the book that inspired the movie. No, they are not very alike except in the bare bones way. I never liked Costner's acting but I always liked the premise of the movie, so when I found out it was based on the book, I had to read it. The book is much more stark, more inside The Postman (Gordon Krantz)'s head, and is weighty. The torn countryside, pocket communities, survival mindset, and daily hardships are represented so much stronger within the pages than on the screen. It has some uplifting moments as well, which really touched me (ie the first time in 17 yrs that Gordon sees a light bulb on instead of a candle or oil lamp, he cries for all that is lost even though he thought himself a \\"hardened survivor\\"). It can get a bit monotonous with Gordon's waffling on helping himself or helping others, but overall - well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated new classic","review":"This is going to be one I have to read every few years. A classic of life during nuclear winter. Civil society in America has died in a slow battle with post-war chaos, hypermilita groups, and famine. It's a wonderful tale of a professional liar, a traveling actor who becomes mired in his deceptions and in the process starts a legend that might lead the survivors back to civilization. The first step is the simple act of starting a postal service. There is interesting musing about feminism in this story. I found this narrative to be make the book worth it alone. Also, the book is a great travel guide through some scenic spots in post-apocalyptic Oregon."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best that Science Fiction has to offer","review":"All too often, when friends discover I enjoy science fiction, there is the qustion of why. I point to The Postman as an example of what a gifted writer can do with the genre. If you heard that this is a tale of post-apocalyptic America, your first thought would be Road Warrior and you could not be more wrong. Its simple plot gives way to complex themes. Mr. Brin examines the relations that keep society together, the relations between men and women and the need for one man to be a part of something lager. In the end, it is hope, fragile as it is, that binds us together. If you do not like science fiction, if you do but are longing for something with a little depth, please read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the book - forget the movie!","review":"For anyone who has seen the film, \\"The Postman,\\" read the book. It's a great read even if you haven't seen the movie, but to realize how much someone can screw up a book in making a movie out of it, this is a classic example. The Postman (movie) has practically zilch in common with the book - continuity, location, characters, storyline. Wow. Set largely in western Oregon, Brin's novel starts slow but builds to a great crescendo at the very end. Wish Costner had had more faith in following Brin's storyline. It would have made a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Book Far Better than the Movie.","review":"So, that's what the movie was supposed to be like. I wish it had lived up to the book. Post-apocalyptic America in a vision more real, gritty, and troublesome than anything dreamt up by Stephen King. Good Book.If the movie had tried to be half of what the book was, it'd have been a classic. Why is it that Costner stars in these duds made from great material? Are they just hiring the wrong screenwriters?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Brin's Best","review":"I read The Postman long before that horrible movie came out. Women who have not read the book will be pleased to know that there is more than one female character in the book. The choice of Costner, et. al. to make one character that is an amalgamation of the three central female characters is deplorable, at best.After watching the movie, I had to reread the book, just to make sure I wasn't hallucinating A LOT of actions in the book that never made it to the screen.Don't let the \\"film\\" sour you on reading this fantastic work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his better novels","review":"Just another post-apocalypse view of the future, and not a very good one at that. I saw the movie and it was even worse. I couldn't believe they made a movie of one of his poorer works. I wish someone would make a movie of this Startide Rising/Uplift War series."},{"rating":"2","title":"DONT LET THE MOVIE FOOL YOU!","review":"If you saw this movie and think the book would be just as pathetic, dont even think about it. Brin writes an interesting story of life after a revolution, a nuclear war and the destruction of our American Culture and the travels through Oregon of Gordon, the man who would become the postman. It is a very good book to read and I do recommend it even if 'end of the world apocalyptic' novels aren't your style, youll find this a good book to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"for fans of post-apocalyptic America","review":"To Brin's credit: this book moves along quickly, follows a nice formula, and goes roughly where you expect it to go with just enough twists to keep it engaging along the way.That said, this is also an exemplar of a very average novel about a \\"post-apocalyptic America\\". It makes me want to see the film with Costner. Just to compare.Also: Brin's attempt at being sympathetic to a woman's plight in this post-apocalyptic scenario? Fell way short. Trust me bro, these broads would be way tougher than you've painted them here. Even with a bunch of survivalist ex-soldiers with rampant genes and hormones."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointing...","review":"The only time I can honestly say I enjoyed the movie better than the book. I suppose my biggest gripe is style...the author comes off almost pretentious at times. Plus the thought of \\"neo-hippies\\" as some kind of scientist/artist/wood elf kind of makes my stomach turn. All the hippies I ever met smell bad and have no job.Also, I guess it might be kind of picky, but count how many times he uses the word \\"irony\\". It's just about every other page. Sorry. Loved the movie though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad book, better movie","review":"As a post-apocalyptic novel, The Postman is mediocre at best. As a social/political commentary, it's much worse. There are many other books better than this. Give Costner (and the screenwriter!)credit that the movie made a solid adventure story out of a poor novel. Its too bad, the basic premise of The Postman is very interesting. However, the end result is disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was surprised....","review":"When I picked up tis book, I expected it to be another one of David Brin's interesting novels. And, when I started to get into the book, I hated it. I thought, maybe, that the book would be different from the movie, which I also didn't like, but it wasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and cliched sci-fi","review":"As a self-professed post-apocalyptic fiction aficionado, I was very disappointed by this book. It cannot compare to some of the classic apocalyptic novels. Poorly written, very painful to read. The characters are wooden, the plot is simple, the dialogue is artificial, and there is nothing about this book that sets it apart from any other post-apocalyptic novel that you could find in the mass-market stack in the Walmart sci-fi section.Very disappointing. Boring. Do not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Bother","review":"This is one of the worst books that I ever MADE myself read. That's right, I actually forced myself to complete this poorly written book. I kept waiting for the author to redeem himself, but alas I remained dissapointed. The really sad part is that the theme could be quite interesting. Unfortunately, the author creates a probable view of society after a holocast and does nothing with it.What was the deal with the mutunt soldiers? That was realistic (sarcasm). And of course the author couldn't give women too much credit by allowing them to be victorious in battle. Oh yes, the computer, stupid stupid stupid. If the scietists were able to get computers going again, do you really think that they would only repair hand-held children's games?This is a horrible book and a great waste of time. Unfortunately, Amazon has not given me the option of giving less than a one star review. The author owes my life a more than a few hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage...","review":"I am an avid reader and a fan of the \\"post-apocalyptic\\" genre, but I have to say, this book is utter garbage. I only read up to the third chapter or so... I couldn't take it. Terrible writing, disjointed pacing, awful introspective ramblings, and unrealistic, two-dimensional characters make for great kindling, and little else. It's the only book I've ever thrown away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read Postman - It's way better that that Costner flick","review":"The Postman is an intelligent work with deep concepts. Describing the aftermath of war in America is done beautifully and with enough ambiguity to make it seem plausible. I live in the States, and there is that underlying survivalist mentality when you leave the Major cities. This representation is a good spin on the concepts and the possibility of post-apocalype survival."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a much better story without Kevin Costner","review":"You know, without having to look at Kevin Costner, this is a pretty good story. I haven't seen the movie, but I have read many other books by David Brin, and they've all been enjoyable, so I decided to give this one a try. It's a philosophical story more than anything else, but set in a nice post apocalyspe landscape that makes the abstract issues a little more urgent. Is it wrong to deceive people, possibly into giving their lives, if the myth you are pushing might eventually bring great benefits? Is it possible to have a system where the powerful do not abuse their power? Most impressive of all, this book avoided the standard hollywood ending, and left us wondering if there really was any hope, if the myth was really true or not. It's even aged well, unlike a lot of other science fiction books set in \\"futures\\" that are already in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Movie's Better","review":"If you liked the movie...well, watch it again. It's way better than the book. Brin gets credit for the cool main idea, but it's developed better in the (notably different) movie. The execution in the book just isn't very good--and like most sci-fi, the book's poorly-written. By the standards of sci-fi, I guess it's o.k...maybe alright for the beach or whatever. But really just not very good. I love post-apocalyptic fiction, and even I found myself skimming to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Had to keep reading","review":"Be prepared for a slightly different ride to the movie. I purchased this after watching the movie and as usual there are differences, but enough similarities to not disappoint if you have seen the movie.I think, as a book, it captures a lot of the struggle of humanity with it's own self destructive tendencies. I found that I kept making excuses to read a bit more and a bit more. I will be interested to read other of David Brin's work and have high hopes that I have found another great author."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book was non-stop reading....READ IT!","review":"I grew up in Oregon and have been to most of the places that he wrote about.

With Sprint, you will be headed for disappointment and frustration. Customer service, when you can actually get through to them, is incompetent. Prepare to have hours of your time stolen from you when you deal with a billing problem with Sprint. After switching credit cards, I've spent days trying to give them the new number to bill to, with no luck. I've had charges for services I never ordered nor authorized appear on my bill, and then spent literally hours of time e-mailing, trying to access their website and calling, with no resolution. Find a phone and a plan you can like with another carrier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great phone, some problems with Sprint","review":"While I love the phone, there are some issues with this phone that Sprint (or Palm) has not worked out yet. The biggest issue is that you cannot send text messages to people who are on Verizon or on t-Mobile. For some reason text messages are never received by people on those networks.

I absolutely detest this phone and wished I'd listened to the Sprint tech rep in the store who tried to warn me. How about that ... Sprint continues to cell an expensive, high-end phone that its own techs know is bad. The guy seemed to have a negative attitude in general, so I din't listen. I should have. Trust me, stick with the PALM version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok , but not great","review":"The phone has a number of \\"glitches\\". I had it for 2 years with Sprint and needed to reset it (take off the back cover and push the reset button) weekly. It would constantly freeze. Synching became such a problem that I stopped doing it.

We see through little Elfi's eyes the beauty of an era when times were still simple. Her family comes alive throughout the book as we learn their individual characters. Grandmother and Grandfather played a very important role in Elfi's upbringing and their love and warmth is genuinely felt through the writer. And Aunt Gusti quickly became a favorite of mine. Her cheerfullness and dedication to the family was endearing. I was very sorry to read of her misfortune at the arms of the Third Reich. Elfie's mischiefness keeps us smiling throughout the story but through her loving upbringing, her faith and optimism lets her shine through all obstacles. The memories that are brought to life in this revealing autobiography will immortalize Elfi and her family forever.

At the least force, the fan is TRULY \\"whisper quiet\\" (how many fans advertize this way but turn out to be huge disappointments?). Anyway, last year I wanted to buy another, and lo and behold, they don't make them this way anymore.

If money is no object, by all means go ahead. Just know that in 3-4 years, you WILL be replacing it (or putting in the pile to Goodwill). If you're on a budget, I'd say you need to look elsewhere.

On low the 630 was only slightly quieter than the cheap fan, but the motor/fan noise was, to my ear, less annoying and disturbing-of-sleep. The Vornado's advantage is that it does a decent job of circulating the air in a small 12x14' bedroom on low speed, which the cheap fan did not. I also tried it in a family room about twice the size. The 630 helped a bit but didn't noticeably move the air on low speed. Might have to go to the next bigger size to circulate air in the larger room. To achieve proper air circulation on lower speeds with truly quiet operation I'd have to install a ceiling fan with much longer blades and bigger armatures.

Quite powerful and solid build quality. I dont think I can take the highest setting, its too noisy. I usually prefer to leave it in the lowest setting.

For the money, it is not much higher quality or quieter than a $20 fan. If you are looking for quiet, try another fan. This one will disapoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I bought this on the recommendation of a friend and reading reviews. One big disappointment for me is the noise - just ok on low and much too loud on the other two higher speeds. Also, I did not find this to live up to its claims of moving air throughout a room.

The Vornado is a very good product, made well and also styled nicely and quiet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Collectivism and Children","review":"I found this book disturbing! The book reads well, and feels good, but this is a book about collectivism. It is very very subtle, but lets face it, Hillary has long been an advocate of socialism. These are the roots of a movement towards collective society, like Marxism. In order to implement what she advocates, the government will have to have complete control."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valuable concepts","review":"Clinton covers important concepts that all parents should understand. She has a lot of valuable thoughts about how important it is to start our children out on the right path. I wish she would have been able to leave out the politics, I would have enjoyed this even more if it was purely a parenting book. For book with valuable ideas on discipline and behavior I'd recommend Perfect Parenting by Elizabeth Pantley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Seller","review":"I ordered this book, for my college seminar 1 month ago, with the promise that it would be at my house in less than 5 business days. I have contacted the seller but have recieved no response, so not buy from them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only useful idiots will buy this","review":"Clinton should scare all freedom loving Americans with this ghostwritten [garbage]. This is pure communism unmasked. She subtly suggests the state would do a better job raising our children than we could. Sounds a little Marxist to me. Take a close look at Chelsea. She is obviously Web Hubbell's child. Would Ms. Clinton have us believe we should have each other's love children and then raise them collectively? As Stalin liked to say, \\"only useful idiots will buy this\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"I used this book as background for a college essay I was writing, I found myself reading the entire thing and loved what she had to say!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The book in its introduction describes how family life used to be.Its primary focus is the need for \\"investment\\" to end great social ills such as poverty, homelessness, and illegitamacy. While well intentioned this ignores the failure of government intervention to solve these problems. In the almost 40 years since the New Frontier was first proposed we have seen only limited results, from increased \\"investment\\" (taxes). That increased tax dollars have marginally narrowed poverty, abuse, and neglect found within inner cities.Government funded good intentions are often the greatest enemy to the same people Ms. Clinton is trying to protect. Often leading many to be unable to escape griding poverty, illegitamacy, and abuse she is trying to protect.The focus should be on greater self reliance, rather than on creating a whole new generation of children who are unable to escape the stranglehold of increasingly repressive Orwellian system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo!!! Ordinary Village people have common sense","review":"This book is written by someone other than hillary clinton. How would she ever know all that is written in this book. She can't remember important issues in her life besides telling us what is right and wrong. Sorry hillary, my golden retriever could have written a better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"an absurd book","review":"Hillary Clinton's ostensible support for children as posed by this book is utterly grotesque in the light of her support for many causes detrimental to the welfare of children.[...] her inability to tell the truth except when it serves her own ends is stamped over everything she touches. What village was Hillary in when 900,000 men, women and children--particularly the children of Rwanda were butchered while Bill Clinton was president? Don't waste your time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It takes a Village","review":"There is no way to review this product ordered Sept 3rd since I never received the product.

On Sept 28th I was issued a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware and read between the lines","review":"This woman will have our children taken straight from the womb to government subsidized day care facilities. It does not take a village, it takes parents to raise a child.How about giving those who choose to stay home and raise their own children a tax credit instead of legislating more incentives to put children into care facilities?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Leftist Bromides","review":"No Mrs. Clinton, it does not take a village: it takes a mother and a father. This sorry excuse for a book is nothing but a collection of self-indulgent bromides that appeal to those that think they know how to raise everyone else's children. The type of though exhibited herein is typical of the generation that is ruining America."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Amazing!","review":"The book gives lip service at the very begining as to how a child's parents are the obvious primary care givers and providers for a child, but the rest of the book is in direct contradiction with this common sense view. In short, a good deal of Hillary's \\"village\\" is none other than the federal government and its myriad of programs. There isn't a government program she's come across that she doesn't like. Well, I suppose that Mrs. Clinton, as member of a wonderfully successful nuclear family, would be just the right person to be the architect for the ways in which the federal government can rear its big ugly head into the parent-child relationship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written","review":"Not very well written. Hillary wants to eliminate the roles of \\"mother\\" and \\"father\\" and instead turn children over to society at large. Bleh, socialist garbage. Also, numerous errors and incorrect references appeared throughout the text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written by Barbara Feinman Todd, not Hillary Clinton","review":"Hillary was apparently \\"too busy\\" to do much on this book at all. It was written for her by Barbara Feinmann Todd. There was an agreement that Todd would share the credit when the book was published. As you can all see, there is no acknowledgement whatsoever of her work. This fact, ALONE, makes the book not worthy of attention.However, even if Ms. Clinton HAD, as promised, given co-credit to Ms. Todd, the book is a socialist's dream - \\"It Takes a Village\\" means \\"You can't be trusted to make decisions about how to raise your child - the government has to make the decisions for you\\". This is typical of the liberal double-speak; they call things that are terrible by nice, warm-n-fuzzy names. Socialism is a terrible thing. Period. Ms. Clinton embraces it. That truly tells me all I need to know about her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check your facts","review":"Some interesting content in the book, but I'm shocked that the tenth anniversry edition still contains a quote in the introduction that is not only paraphrased, but attributed to the wrong author. Did no one fact check this book? Did no editor notice the error in ten years? The quote should be \\"Ye cannot live for yourselves; a thousand fibers connect you with your fellow-men, and along those fibers, as along sympathetic threads, run your actions as causes, and return to you as effects\\" and the author is English cleric Henry Melvill, NOT American author Herman Mellville."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing -- I expected better","review":"I didn't actually read every page of Hillary Clinton's book, but I read the first half and the majority of the second, and I can tell you--- don't bother. There was one chapter near the end, \\"Every Business is a Family Business\\" that I thought was pretty good, but for the most part I was completely uninspired. Its a hodge podge, anecdotes from her own life, pats on the back for little good things that people are doing, nostalgia for old values, pointing out all the evils and dangers in the world, lots of religious references. There wasn't that much I didn't agree with, but it was all obvious stuff, and if it wasn't someone of Hillary Clinton's stature writing it, it wouldn't have held my interest.All in all, a disappointment. I was hoping at least for some amusement."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enlightened Message for Families","review":"Hillary Clinton is first and foremost a mother, and she makes that clear with her book. She has also always been an advocate of the child in our world. From her early days in Illinois, to her education at Yale, she searched for answers to the question on how best to raise a child. Her work in the political arena reflects her continuing search to find legislation and policy that can have the most impact on raising a child to realize its full potential in the world as it is today. IT TAKES A VILLAGE documents this continued quest. We as a society, can learn much from reading the intelligent arguments from a woman regarded by many as one of the most influential women of her generation."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Takes a Village - Good Reason Why Hillary Must Be Neutralized!","review":"A book that illustrates why Hillary Clinton must be stopped at all costs! Remember the following path to totalitarianism: Dependency (the \\"Village\\" concept) => Central Planning => Socialism => Communism => Fascism. Hillary would destroy freedom for everyone! She is the devil reincarnated and all freedom loving people should seek to destroy her brand of politics and the ideas she is attempting to promulgate with this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read between the lines","review":"Hillary Clinton's political manifesto. It sings the praises of Socialism and multiculturalism."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Didn't Take a Village for Hillary. It Took a Nanny!","review":"Gimme a break. For the millions of us mothers and fathers working the front lines with blood, sweat and tears, we understand all too well what it takes to raise children to excellence: hard work and perseverance! Through both the joys and the struggles of raising kids from birth to adulthood, excellence in parenting requires huge doses of time, energy, planning, and commitment. How would Hillary know that? It certainly didn't take a village for her to raise her daughter. It took a nanny."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"It Takes an Elitest to Raise Chickens\\"","review":"Is there anyone who truly believes that Hillary really cares about children, or that she has the slightest idea of what it takes to raise a family? From her lofty perch, she sees people as chickens who need to be managed, feed, medicated, and controlled in order to maximize production and to make things run smoothly for the benefit of those in charge of the coop. Like so many of the professional \\"do-gooders\\" of our day, she gets her ideas from a warped top-down view of life. The most dispicable element of our society are those who prey upon children and use them for their own gratification. A close second to this are those who hide behind children to further their own careers and political agendas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Poppycock!","review":"Fiddle faddle, I say, to this socialized notion of communal raising of children. The only child a village raises is the village idiot! Reduced to expecting handouts and spare change, the idiot becomes predestined for failure.My father, God rest his soul, taught me with a firm leather bullwhip that success goes to those who work hard for it. With his merciless beatings and occasional encouragement, I became self-reliant, hard working, and quite indifferent to what the village thinks. Not to mention, my fleshy buttocks are now coarser than month-old steel wool. I have never been wont for food or shelter, and have never taken a dime from the elitists.If only all of America had my father!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Socialism is alive and well in Clintonville","review":"What a total advocate for socialism! Hillary will always push for total Government control of all Americans from the cradle to the grave. She makes it very clear in this book that she expects the Government to do what is best for all citizens, and the ultimate product will be all citizens fitting into the same mold of admiration for her as President. I believe she sees her self as a benevolent dictator."},{"rating":"2","title":"It would work only if our society were homogenous.","review":"If our society were totally homogenous politically, religiously, etc. her \\"It takes a Village\\" would probably work. But you see, it is not. For instance, in this hypothetical village, should the official political view be a democratic one or a republican one? Should the religious view be areligious, or inclined to a specific religion such as Buddism, Islam, or a brand of Christianity? What should be done to those who don't conform to the ideals of the village and threaten to upset this ideal system?The weakness of her premise is in the diversity of cultures found in these United States. If our government is to be the mediator of this village environment, just whose culture should the government promote? It sets the stage for a global, one-world government, big brother society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Read. . .great reminder...","review":"This book is an easy read and a good reminder to all of us.

So I'm not sure it is wise to purchase hypno tapes from someone who would participate in disreputable types of tapes. Just my thoughts."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Quality, Excellent Recordings!","review":"Steve G Jones hypnosis recordings are excellent quality. His voice is soothing and there are nice sound effects which help you get into a more relaxed state. The scripts are well-written. I've found the recordings very helpful for me to effect change in my life. The effect is subtle at first, but everyday I can see that I make another step toward my goal.

Seriously every night I lie and bed and think \\"ell, guess this will finally be the night I hear the whole recording\\" and then the next thing I know, my alarm is going off.

The speakers voice is ok, which tends to be a big issue with me with audio books. I am middle aged and have occasional insomnia (as well as battle of the bulge).

I couldn't find the tape after years in storage and moving a couple of times. I decided to try this one. Not impressed, it was difficult to connect with the hypnotist because of a couple of reasons. I've heard other people mention someone's voice being annoying or not soothing. I found a little bit of that mix in this case. I also felt it took way to long to get to the deep relaxation area compared to the original excellent system I had used. In the end after faithfully using this program for 30-45 days, I may have lost 5 lbs, and who's to say that wasn't my own doing anyways. I know Hypnosis can work, this particular program didn't work for me.

I wasn't skeptical about purchasing this cd, because I knew that I had the issues when it came to following through. I love it! From the very next day when I went to work I noticed changes. I walked by the snack machine and didn't have any urges, or cravings. I go to fast food places and order salads, and baked potato instead of hamburgers and french fries.

There was all this hype surrounding him that he was the future of R&B. Well... I was rather unimpressed by this CD and stored it away after one listen. There's nothing new here. Songs about love making, blah, blah, blah. There's even a song about a girl's... behind, cleverly titled \\"Ur Behind.\\" (Me being the innocent person I am, I actually thought that it was going to be about something different, like someone being behind in a relationship. You know, something with substance. Silly me.) His vocals are nothing special and aren't distinctive. The songs are bland. This is the same stereotypical male R&B that the music industry have been feeding us since the early 90s. An R. Kelly clone.

But for a little ingenuity (granted you will loose portability) and a grill grate from a home improvement store, you will have a much better solution for grilling. This item is a cheap manufactured in China thin cast iron product that is painted black to make it look passable. It smelled toxic when I made my first charcoal fire and the right grate cracked during the heat from fire #1. The grilling grates do not line up flat with the charcoal area so even heat will be a problem. Once it breaks in, I am hoping it will be passable for small grilling jobs.

The parts, once all in place, did not fit each other, so that one rack was level, the other tilted....it made it difficult to grill hot dogs without them rolling off.

So this means I'm either stuck trying to use a lop-sided grill or will have to find a machine shop (and pay extra for this) to drill the 4th set of holes so I can put the last leg on.

One of the grill brackets broke when I set the grill into it for the first time after putting it together. It is actually spray painted black to give the appearance of real cast iron but is actually so full of alloys and contaminants it is really the color of aluminum.

I did have to do some to make the grates fit better but other than that everthing went together fine. The cast iron has a very rough appearance but doesn't create any problems. The instructions showed the grate brackets attached to the outside of the grill but they clearly have to be installed to the inside. You can buy other less expensive table top grills but the sheet metal will rust in no time and you can't adjust the height of the cooking grids. You can just use a little charcoal and grill on one side if you just want four burgers or a couple of steaks.

He escapes to England by boat to marshall commando forces to liberate his town and destroy a planned airfield. A Hollywood Norwegian is something to hear and see, women in embroidered bonnets and shawls and men with bleach blonde hair talking about the miracle of spawning salmon. The action scene, the destruction of the airfield, had enough pyrotechnics to be exciting, but the director chose to sit way back and watch it, making the whole enterprise impossibly dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for sleeping, I guess","review":"I just couldn't get into this at all.

Bring back Belly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Murky and diluted","review":"I was curious to see how Tanya Donnelly's 2001 solo effort compared with 'Sunny Border Blue' (one of the best of 2001, in my book). The results: whereas Kristin Hersh continues to improve with age, Tanya Donelly's muse seems to be napping. Sure, it has its moments; but the best of those moments fail to measure up to the weakest stuff on 'Sunny Border Blue'. This is the musician responsible for 'Not to Soon' [The Real Ramona] and 'Slow Dog' [Star]? I guess she is the George Harrison of the Muses after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"More depth the second time around...","review":"I have been a Tanya fan since the Belly days, and was thrilled when she released her first solo album, Lovesongs for Underdogs. Lovesongs was mainly very pop rock songs, and I'm surprised by the negative reviews of her new cd. I feel Beautysleep is more introspective and moody, and consequently has more depth to it than the last solo cd. I love both, they just have a different sound to them. This one seems less-radio-friendly to me than the last one, and seems to have more of an edge. \\"The Storm\\" is my favorite track so far!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Amazing Tanya Donelly","review":"Beginning with the ethereal \\"Life is but a Dream\\" down to the last song Beautysleep is an exceptional album. Tanya explores her dark side once again after the very light (but still excellent) Love Songs for Underdogs. Her more mainstream song \\"Keeping You\\" is what a love song should be; a matter of fact statement, \\"I'm keeping you.\\" If you've never heard Tanya then you should expect deap, longing, lyrics with excellent guitar. It's not for sweet pop fans or someone who wants to escape from the absurdity of life. Instead expect great music in an existential mold."},{"rating":"2","title":"easily one of the year's best compact discs","review":"beautysleep is the 2nd solo album from a vanguard of alt pop rock. when we stop to look at tanya donnelly's impressive resume, there is absolutely no reason to believe that she couldn't be successful in her solo endeavors. what really gets me is that i actually love her solo work as much if not better than her work with bands such as the breeders, belly, or throwing muses. at times, beautysleep reminds me of cocteau twins or perhaps tori amos what with silky, sweet vocals which are as addictive as anything you are apt to hear this year. hopefully, people will catch on to beautysleep and perhaps the radios will give ms. donnelly some play this time around. some great racks here would keeping you, the night you saved my life, and life is but a dream although every song on this cd is simply wonderful. this cd never leaves my player for long and probability suggests i will be playing it for some time to come. don't miss this one !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"Tanya has out done herself. This is some of her best work in years. Her vioce is melodic and soothing yet painfilled. She's clearly been working very hard since her last Cd.

Her vocals are so tender, yet drenched with emotion and each song sounds like motherhood agrees with her. Tanya Donelly and her band are a very much needed breath of fresh air to the music world. It is an entire band effort and with Rich Gilbert having Frank Black connections its like 1 big happy family. If you want an album that speaks to every emotion, that brings the artist to the forefront (rather than an image)and doesn't swim in over-production then this album should definitely be included in your collection. You won't be disappointed. Already my pick for Album of the Year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tanya Donelly - back with a vengeance!","review":"Tanya Donelly's latest effort is a moody triumph. After taking a break following her solo debut - 1997's underrated Lovesongs for Underdogs - Donelly returns after the birth of her first child with an introspective album that combines sharp, insightful lyrics and some of her best singing ever. And fans of Tanya from her Belly and Throwing Muses days needn't worry - she still rocks (just a bit quieter these days, like many of us). Come the end of the year, this will be on numerous top ten lists - but don't wait until then to pick up a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graceful and Melodic","review":"I offer here the perspective of 40-something music fanatic who has almost no prior experience listening to Tanya Donnelly's previous bands. My impressions of this music are not colored by comparisons, then.This is a graceful and melodic record--dignified, but not boring, spiritual, but not spacy. Donnelly has a real gift for creating songs that shift gears in interesting ways, and which often feature hooks that are catchy but never predictable. The production of the recording is first-rate, as are the musical performances from the core band of Dean Fisher, Rich Gilbert, and David Narcizo.Her lyrical gift is also impressive, fashioning such simple, yet evocative, couplets as this one, written for her baby: \\"You landed here from inner space/You landed with that screwed up look on your face.\\" What can I say? Great stuff from an artist who may be, if anything, underrated, despite her acclaim."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm keeping you!","review":"Tanya Donelly keeps going away and then coming back in a new band with a slightly updated sound, this time she's keeping on the solo path but taking a slightly updated take from her first cd \\"lovesongs for underdogs\\". Tanya has mellowed out only in the production of her songs however her lyrics remain fierce and her voice is still a powerful instrument that can haunt you in your sleep. Tanya has always had a knack for writing PERFECT pop songs and she doesn't disappoint with \\"the night you saved my life\\", this song...is simply perfect! \\"I'm Keeping You\\" and \\"The Storm\\" are too beautiful to describe, they are the songs that bring an entire audience of men to tears. Everything about this cd is everything I was hoping for from Tanya's newfound inspiration as a mother. The next best thing to this cd right now is the thought of a new Throwing Muses cd featuring Tanya's beautiful vocals harmonizing with Kristin Hersh, I can't wait!!!\\"Beautysleep\\"--buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"better live","review":"the first time i heard sound tribe was at one of their shows at langerado and i was blown away. these guys put on such an incredible show, i will see them again and again. cant wait to see them this summer at allgood!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Better Live","review":"STS9 has defined a new genre with their latest studio work: Elevator Trance.

I kept thinking the next track would have some life or some beat and it never got going. Before you invest in this maybe pick up a live show somewhere --if they allow taping of course-- and see for yourself if you can stomach STS9.

These are legion--if a typo derby were held, this would win hands down. It's a disgrace. Quick perusal of the publication info reveals the copyright is now held by the publisher. The publisher typeset this edition. The publisher did not proofread its work. At times, you will be brought to a dead halt trying to figure out what the author actually wrote.

Then I bought this older edition for myself to re-read at a later time.The Levanter is well written and suspenseful with Interesting well-defined characters. One of the 5 best as rated by the Wall Street Journal's selections of thrillers and Eric Ambler's works. If you like Vince Flynn and \\"24\\"or Alan Furst, you will probably like the Levanter, by Eric Ambler. Not quite so much action, but the same type of intrigue and plot twists with a recognizable hero. I also have bought other novels by this master story teller. He is amazingly current though this book is nearly 30 yrs old. You have to keep reminding yourself that the story is set and written in the 1980's because it deals with the middle east and bombs.Enjoy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth adding to your collection","review":"Chimaira's debut (?) is quite good. Instant comparisons will be made to Slipknot, but I think of them as much more groove orientated, sort of like the Fear Factory version of Slipknot. Lyrically, what can I tell you, its metal, so you know what to expect. Nothing too deep or mindblowing, but they flow well with the overall sound of the band. Drums and guitars sound good, no solos, just heavy downtuned riffs. There are alot of songs on this album! I was completely satisfied after hearing the first 10 tracks, and then there were like half a dozen or so more songs! Pretty cool. Track 9 rules."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nu Metal that brings nothing new to the table","review":"Chimaria is a horrid band. These guys brings nothing to the table that hasnt been done about 100x before. First off, every song has a couple easy power cords that a 10yr old could play, and the drumming is weak. This band sounds like a replica of Korn, which gives them 2 strikes to begin with (Ok ,Korn had one good album, but thats it) and I dont hear any resemblance to Slipknot (as some reviewers had posted). Even though I really dont listen to Slipknot, they have more talent then this bunch of losers. If you want Good Metal, avoid this. If you are looking for a run of the mill, NU Metal band that sounds like something you have heard a million times before, then this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'LL PASS","review":"I like heavy metal. I don't like this. I saw Black Sabbath during their Master of Reality tour, I saw Judas Priest when they had Les Binks on drums, I've seen Loudness, Iron Maiden and Accept. I'm not here to bash this CD just because I don't like it. I know there's a market for this and this style of metal has its fans. I'm not one of them. Any time you have these growling 'I'm dying' vocals you instantly lose me. I find this style of metal depressing. If this your cup of tea then hey, go for it, enjoy the heck out of it. This just doesn't work for me on any level whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like this.....","review":"Then you fail at life.In all seriousness though, this is some of the worst hard rock I have ever heard.

Chimaira brings an all out assault to your ears. This CD blows away anything they have done before, most likely because it was produced by Roadrunner. A very fast & angry CD after hearing this CD I really want to see this band live. If you like bands such as: Slipknot, Fear Factory, Mudvayne, Nothingface, Hatebreed, or the latter, than purchase this CD. If you can't handle aggressive, angry, fast, furious, and at times hypnotic melodic tunes than I recommend you go elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Be Worse.","review":"(...) Although the occasional thrash and old school metal passages can be heard, it is mostly just fodder for the more groove oriented, hip-hop influenced sound that you will hear throughout the record. I have to give them some respect for the bands' relentless tour schedule, so that is where the two stars came from. On top of the fact that their latest offering, The Impossibility of Reason, sounds like a different band entirely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, but...","review":"The band, Chimaira is very good. I liked this band from the minute i heard the song Dead inside. The band has some very good aspects to it but, like anything good, there have to be bad thingsGood things - Very angry and well expressed lyrics. The singing suits it well tooDrumming is precise, but leaves a lot to be improved onInspiring sound on the whole, leaves me in a good, angry mood. Motivational in a way.BUT, there are times when the singing cannot be heard very well.Notable songs which were my favourites on this album - abeo, jade, dead inside, sp lit, severed.There is one more problem, though in the studio the singer can have a veery harsh,rough voice, live he either can't or doesnt wanna sing that way. Watch the farm club video for dead inside, why is he singing so sweetly? He's suppppsed to be ANGRY!The CD cover symbol is cool, does anyone know what the hell that's supposed to be?"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST ALBUM OF 2001","review":"Yep, Chimaira wins the honors for best album of 2001. Allright, maybe 2001 is over yet but I sincerely doubt that another band will come out with an album better than this this year. It is funny how a band that you totally do not expect to put out an incredible album does just that. Everyone was totally hyped up for the new Sepultura, Slipknot, System of a Down, Slayer, Six Feet Under albums but none of those new albums can compare to this. This, this is just sheer genius. Seriously, this album ranks right up there with classic metal albums such as Slayer's Reign in Blood , Sepultura's Beneath the Remains, and Anthrax's Among the Living. Seriously the songs on this album scream classic and I can guarantee you Chimaira is gonna be a band that will stay around for a while. I would suggest you watch out for Chimaira because they will be around for a while. Best songs: Let Go, Lumps, Sp lit, Rizzo, Jade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"I cannot recommend this album enough. I have had it now for a month, and I am kind of obsessed with it.

Most of them are brilliant. And this record could only come from him. All of it's 9 songs are beautiful, enchanting melodies, with wonderful lyrics yet simple and relaxed. Slowdive usually makes you want to do some mind-altering substances and go into the furthest space, mojave 3 usually brings you down to earth after a long night and relaxes you more than you can imagine, and neil's album... well, just play it and you'll be taken to a desert beach, were it feels like you're alone in the world, and loving it! The songwriting's awesome, the guitars, drums, pianos and stuff are wonderful, but it's his vocals that keep on shining thru it all. It a must-have masterpiece! But anyway, so are all slowdive and mojave 3 records... wonder why..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album i have got this year!","review":"A fantastic album with lyrics and music that are too beautiful to describe. The song 'Driving with Bert' for example has wonderful mix of acoustic guitars + organ and trumpets that sound like a western theme, with great lyrics which makes you hear it again and again. Strongly recommend to buy if you are into this type of quasi-folk music genre, with haunting melodies and a kind of dreamy sound. With so much junk floating around it is hard to find such good music like this these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it but the digital part will last for only 7 years","review":"I love it as I saw it on Amazon.

The buttons are easily be accidentally pushed. I love it though. eventhough i have only seven years to enjoy it. Ohh. Slide rule is so hard to use, even i'm an engineer.

Six months after the extended warranty had expired it could no longer be turned on. That, by the way, is pretty revealing about extended warranties; I will never purchase another one again. The 23HLV85 overall quality was neither better nor worse than other brands (I also have 2 Samsung and 1 LG). The incorporated dvd player was constantly plagued with problems, unreliable, especially with dvds getting stuck and difficult to remove. We quickly gave up using the dvd player since we usually watch movies in the living room and the 23HLV85 was only for a bedroom. According to reviews on the net, the problem with the on/off switch and dvd player are pretty common. We inquired about fixing it but the cost was not worth being left with an old and unreliable set.

I have found myself referring more than once back to this book in explaining relationships and the way we deal with them to young people I work with and to my own daughter. The poems are artfully written and thought provoking. The story of Kwasi Benefo will make you think time and time again.

An important read and study into the psyche of the African-American relationship. I recommend this book highly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dance in the dark","review":"I enjoyed the book very much.

The point is that she put out a subpar product. Period. Who cares if it's been edited and revamped now? There are a lot of us who spent money supporting her in the beginning, but you decide to wait until AFTER folk spend money on your book to come correctly?

While there is essentially nothing wrong with the story, it follows the tried and trusted Gothic formula - the heroine doesnt know who to trust and starts to suspect the man that she is becoming attracted to etc - there is nothing that stands out either.The whole premise ie Claire Sullivan travelling halfway around the world after a mangled message from her flighty sister is far fetched. After a whole lot of nothing, the end when the murder victim is found and the murder unmasked is dealt with too abruptly. If you are looking for a better Howatch short novel I would suggest The Shrouded Walls (four stars) and her best The Devil on Lammas Night (five stars)."},{"rating":"2","title":"User friendly and ridiculously worth every penny!","review":"My pc crashed and took this program with it.

From its haunting, seemingly incongrous beginning (think of it as a \\"visual overture\\", synopsising the film's themes much like an opera's overture does for its musical motifs) to its devastating ending, Rublev is awe inspiring in its depth, scope, and artistry. A sometimes difficult film whose rewards go beyond today's most extravagant expectations out of film. Its imagery and final claim haunt me, informing my thoughts and responses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring Masterpiece","review":"Given the trouble Tarkovsky had releasing this film it is astonishing to be able to view this film in any format let alone this astonishing criterion director's cut.The film itself is gorgeously shot and perhaps one of the most interesting biographical films - in terms of narrative form - it is quite inventive in this respect.I found this to be one of the most detailed, metaphorical studies I have ever seen - impossible to digest in just one viewing. Indeed, one could study this film for years and still know little of its mystery - it is like all great works of art - never fully attainable - it escapes grasp- and yet you know you are seeing something truly special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant color of the original movie is missing","review":"I was very disappointed to discover that this DVD contains black-and white copy of the movie.

Since there is an authentic feelto some of the scenes, the film has value in capturing a way of life that has become extinct. And yes, some of the film is quite artfully done. But the reviews saying that this is one of the best movies ever made left me expecting a whole lot more. I wasdisappointed spending 3 hours watching this movie from the local Blockbuster (VHS)."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANIMAL ABUSE","review":"This movie involves sickening ANIMAL ABUSE.

I am interested in just about any film that is in Russian, with English Subtitles. I loved Burnt By the Sun, and House of Fools. They were mildy stimulating intellectually, and very entertaining. Even if they had been considerably less artistic, I would still be interested in watching them because of my desire to learn Russian. Andrei Rublev on the other hand, is horribly boring, totally mindnumbing, and I cannot even force myself to watch it, as an exercise, and for the sake of learning Russian."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie I have ever seen.","review":"The brilliant masterpiece from any point of view. The best camera work, acting, cinematography and lighting I have ever seen on screen. You feel like you're in a dream watching it because of the camera angles, pace and people's expressions. Filled with so much love for people and God, that it makes you think that this film does not belong here among us. Tarkovsky had made only 5 movies in his life. Each - a tribute to humanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Immersing oneself in Late Medieval Russia","review":"Tarkovsky is a master in organizing imagery, and placing action in what we in the 21st Century can believe is an absolutely authentic setting. We are treated in this black and white film to several intense episodes in one period of the life of the well-known Russian ikon-painter Andrei Rublev, the time he receives his commission to paint ikons for the new cathedral being built in Moscow, through his trip from Vladimir through villages and countryside all the way to Moscow where he can commence his responsibilities. High points include the Tatar invasion and pillage, and the construction of the bell (by a novice)for the new cathedral in Moscow.The sound track is as impressive as are the imagery and the character portrayals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"By all accounts one of the greatest pieces of art ever put to film.

The others all the way through Splendor in the Grass seem to slide a little more into the what- trying to be all things to all peoples? Mundane? Cutsie? Static?I'm not sure what happened, but I suspect that when personel changes are made, the mood and the artistic energy shifts. Plus, Thomas et al started writing their own material. And lastly, maybe I like this one best because the sensuous Latin flavour that was so appealing to me was relegated to the percussion section alone in successive albums.I highly reccommend listening to all the selctions on the follow up albums before buying. I can also reccommend Late Night Betty by Pepe & the Bottled Blonds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Music, Poor Selection.","review":"I bought this CD after hearing a glowing review about it on NPR. I thought I'd get a fun retro jazz selection. About half of the album is what I thought it would be. The other half ruins it... If only they had produced this album without Que Sera, Sera, Bolero and Acuarela de Brazil - it would have been much stronger. Some of these are so cliche that they just hurt to listen to them.Luckily there are a few good tracks, Let's just hope they refine their taste before the next album, or we might have to listen to a jazzed up version of \\"send in the clowns\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring & Inoffensive","review":"Obviously a lot of people like this CD, but I am not one of them. It has a couple of songs that are nice, but for me it is mostly a wide variety of reasonably boring and inoffensive music... not bad (except for \\"Que Sera, Sera\\" which I don't like with the exception of Sly Stone's version), but nothing to very captivating either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Listening After many, many plays...","review":"I've listened to this album and Pink Martini's two other CDs repeatedly and I never tire of the music, the genres or the interpretations. I tell friends that the songs are classics, but the group is modern and there's nothing old fashion about these guys/girls. I doubt i'll ever hear them on the radio because they wouldn't fit with most stations' playlists. If you like this CD as much as I did, you must buy the other two (and why not treat yourself to their DVD to get the full experience and understand who these people are?). I just wish they would release more music, however, I suspect that Mr. Lauderdale is a meticulous and careful composer/arranger and that takes time to do well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifting","review":"I have this cd and \\"Hang On Little Tomato\\" after seeing Pink Martini in concert this summer. They are truly dynamic and I love how they revel in singing songs from various cultures. Songs are touching, lively, passionate and uplifting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"These folks rock","review":"Fun, quirky band that I play in my car from start to finish. Plus, they seem to have a little more staying power than Squirrel Nut Zippers did. If you like a mix of jazz, big band, salsa, and other types of international music then give them a try. My only concern, which is a minor one, is that they seek out *so* many languages to sing in that the act of singing in foreign languages in itself almost becomes a schtick for them. \\"Look, we just sang in [insert language here] -- call us clever!\\" As I said, though, this is a minor concern that does not (through 3 albums so far) detract from the fun factor of listening to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgic sensationalism","review":"I was looking for a BUDGIE CD at Tower Records in SF when I heard this incredible sound blaring thru the store. I approached the sales counter and asked \\"Who the hell is this?\\" To my surprise it was a band I've never heard of. I remained in the store and continued to listen to \\"Amado Mio\\". I was blown away! I forgot about the BUDGIE CD and bought Pink Martini. I immediately ran to the car and played the rest of the CD. \\"At last, a band that respects the sweet nostalgic latin style of the 40's & 50's\\" is what I thought to myself. For those who love that sound, this CD is a must have! And if you think the CD great, see them live, because they're just as incredible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Among my favorites","review":"This CD was a pivotal experience for me, which is saying a lot considering I was grew up playing and listening to all kinds of music. The wide variety of music got me interested in other genres and eventually fueled my appetite for Latin flavoured tunes. (Yolanda is a fabulous tune, it will do the same to you!) Everyone I know who has heard this CD has loved it. I saw this group in person three times in Seattle and Portland, and I cherish each experience. I don't know of another band like them. If you get this CD, you'll never regret it. And play it for people you know; they'll be impressed and think you have great taste in music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bonus, Bolero, A must have","review":"Definately, the one to get. Pink Martini includes a digital download with bonus track \\" Bolero\\" and yes its worth it. Do not fall for the Barnes and Noble website they (B&N;) do not have a hardcopy with bonus track, I ordered the cd twice from them and waited a month for customer service to admit it was not in their system.It is a fantastic Pink Martini album, this was our second PM album after Joy to the World."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"....then tomorrow was another day...\\"","review":"This album is one of the few I have purchased recently that has completely intoxicated me. Song choice and order on the CD is wonderful. \\"Que Sera Sera\\" was the only song I was displeased with however other songs like \\"Brazil\\" and \\"Amado Mio\\" more than make up for this. For how cheap this album is it is well worth it. I hope to hear more from Pink Martini in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Standards reinterpreted for post-everything noiristes","review":"Wow this band takes the sting out of the post-breakup blues (thanks yet again, KC!). Sultry, sexy, postnational, definitely CNS-depressed but never anhedonic. Hangover lullabies for the Pacific Century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tunes for a dinner party or Sunday brunch!","review":"A fantastic collection of tunes. Makes you want to get up and dance! Makes a great gift!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great debut!","review":"This band rocks! I saw Thomas Lauderdale and his band live in Portland last December and LOVED them. The crowd in attendance was more diverse than I've ever seen at any concert (from swing-era elders to grungy gen-xers...even a Ziggy-Stardust-meets-Sid-Vicious look-alike), which reflects the universal appeal of the tunes on this CD. It's hard to classify Sympathique (latin-classical-big band?); in any case, it offers a refreshing take on classical pieces and old standards, and compelling original numbers. This is a fun, eclectic collection that gets better with each listen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but French is terrible","review":"The music is really great, but her French accent is so deplorable I can hardly listen to Sympathique. It sounds very American teenager speaking French in a high school class. The music is wonderful if you can deal with that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A varied and entertaining collection, well recorded","review":"This is an often amusing, very pleasurable listen. The overall theme, I guess, is \\"lounge music\\", but Pink Martini is really much more than that. Think torch song meets latin meets 50's/60's kitsch and you'll be in the right ballpark. A bonus is that the songs are fairly well recorded for a band of this stature.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff!","review":"El Dorado, Rio Lobo, same movie, different supporting cast. Still entertaining. The entire package as group is awewsome. Some of the Duke's best stuff. This pack includes Director's cuts and documentaries for a couple of the movies more great stuff. It was great to see Maureen O'Hara talking about the old days with the Duke and about her doing most of her own stunts. It was great to see Michael Wayne inside the film vault and some of his Dad's personal momentoes from his movies, like his aging old hat and chaps. More and More great stuff, you'll enjoy yourself for days trying to see it all and treasure it for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Wayne Western Collection","review":"What can I say about John Wayne. He was my favorite Cowboy from the time I was little in the 40's. He may have made a few NOT SO GOOD movies in his early years, but I don't think there was anyone that could surpass him in his later years. His movie collections are the best and very intertaining.

The purse itself is heavy. It is difficult to find anything inside as there is only one handle and the opening is small. There is one huge compartment so finding things makes it even more difficult. There are some pockets on one side but they are not deep enough to hold anything without them eventually falling out while looking for something in the main compartment. There is one zippered pocket on the other side.

I charged up the battery for a couple of hours and put in the Compact Flash card. I snapped a total of three photos before this thing died on me, with an \\"E18\\" error message. I tried again after a short while, and it took a couple more photos. And that was it - the end. Now I can't do a thing with it. I researched this E18 message online, and apparently it's a common error with other models of Canon digital cameras (although none mentioned on this model - perhaps too new).

Physical size of the camera is awesome (that can't be beaten by anyone). Movie mode works like a charm...great picture and sound. Battery seems to last forever (and charging time is minimal).Since no product is 100% perfect, I'd have to say the only drawback with the camera is its responsiveness to a quick-photo. Sometimes it takes about a half-second to respond after you push the button. Other than that \\"problem\\", though, it's tough for me to think of a second drawback.I hope you buy this camera. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, but unspectacular","review":"A pretty decent camera for the price. The small size is a huge plus!

A part in the camera made by Sony is susceptible to a loose connection. In shooting mode the image appears as a purplish/black distorted image. Canon stated in their advisory that this would be fixed free of charge regardless of warranty expiration. I returned my camera to Canon repair and just received a repair estimate of $109.62.

Also, the book is very boring, very little in the way of any \\"action\\", mostly a lot of (I presume) the author's philosophy.

Yes, there is some sex but it's not X-rated and last I heard sex is a normal part of life.

The first 10 or so words you learn are different kinds of fruit. You have to memorize all these to be able to go on to the exercises. This may be fine if you intend to get a huge vocabulary, but for most beginners, 10 different fruits are not the most urgent need. The book goes on in the same way with chunks of specialised but not necessarily useful words.The next problem is that hardly any Chinese characters are used, so you get little or no help from your possible previous knowledge of Chinese or Japanese. I bought the book, because it provided CDs with the text, and I still think that's its main advantage. I still haven't learnt Cantonese very well, but I've started using another book (Teach Yourself) in parallel, and that helps a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"recommended for advanced-beginner","review":"I bought this book + CDs after I finished another Cantonese text for beginners.

I was thoroughly disappointed by what we were given. Setzer seems to lack the feel and love for this style that were so evident during his days with the Cats. There are no stand-out tracks, and rather than real Rockabilly, we're given more a honky-tonk sounding selection of songs. Final analysis: Setzer should bury the hatchet with his former Stray Cats sidemen, Slim Jim Phantom and Lee Rocker and give fans an album of Real 50's Rockabilly, the likes of which we haven't seen since the Stray Cats 1989 release, Blast Off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old-School Rockabilly Fun","review":"'Ignition' finds Brian Setzer getting back to the raw, stripped-down, hard-drivin' rockabilly style that first made him famous with The Straycats. I really like the loose, raw attitude of this album. Fans of the smoother, big-band type sound of The Brian Setzer Orchestra may or may not like the new approach he takes on this record. This batch of songs is firmly rooted in the 1950's and aims directly at the retro-greaser crowd. The lyrics are centered mainly around hot-rod car culture and might be a little too 'red neck' for the casual listener. As usual though, the guitar playing is awesome and Setzer nevers gives less than 110% as a performer. Lyrically, some listeners might not gel with the references to hot rods and roosters, etc. But this a fun, hard-rockin' record for those who are into Setzer's retro style."},{"rating":"2","title":"68 Comeback Special Indeed!","review":"Intresting that Brian Setzer would call his new band 68 Comeback Special. Just as Elvis returned to his rockabilly roots during his now famous 68 comeback special after years of movies, Setzer shelves his Ochestra for a return to the genre that made him famous. The stripped down, raw sound of this combo has more in common with the Rev Horton Heat than the Stray Cats. I like every song on this CD and it really showcases Brian's range as one of the best guitarists around today.

The storyline is missing so much and the parents of this little boy should be shot or perhaps the writer should be shot for even making this movie. If they had added some real depth and detail other than the depressed state of this poor family and stuck with the child's life in more detail then the movie might have been worth the $18.00 we paid!!

He is probably one of the cutest child actors I have seen! He is outstanding!! The ending might be hard for some and is quite shocking, but it makes sense. I really think those of you who saw Angela's Ashes and wanted a bit more, would get that from this film.

The memories that Helget writes of are very difficult to believe considering she was so young at the time of the events. Her memories, if they can even be called that, seem to be embelished and fabricated. More a work of imagination than a memoir. Very disheartening and disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harsh and dry--the story and the weather.","review":"This collection of beautifully written short pieces work together to give a view into a difficult Minnesota childhood. It's a stark story, and slim in several ways. Pages aside, it lacks context, and the landscape is almost missing, which is odd for a farm story. The writer's gift with words is considerable, and the final chapter left me gasping (what a tour de force). Did I like it? yes, I did. Still, I have to ask, as a child, was there no laughter? Was her entire childhood taut and poetic, all smashed grasshoppers and bleeding animals? It seems in a family like this, there might have been at least some laughter. I guess that is another area where the book is slim--I didn't sense the fullness of a life when reading it. Perhaps she will write a longer exploration of her life, or a novel. If she does, I'll definitely read it, as she is quite a writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"St Paul Pioneer Press questions accuracy","review":"A front page article in St. Paul Pioneer Press (Dec 15, 2005).Whose story is it?

Not worth it.","review":"This author goes on and on and on about horrible acts of animal cruelty, but the author seems more amused by it than actually trying to make you feel anything. She says it for shock value and to take up space, not for actual things that happened. I'm ashamed to say that a reading class I know is using this book as an example for their class. This book is a work of fiction, passed as a memoir. The story jumps all over the place, the characters are all ugly people you feel nothing but contempt for, and a lot of the book is focused on the authors amusement at animal cruelty, little girls dying in coffins step-by-step and telling tales. The whole book is obvious that she has a vendetta against her family and is trying to force the reader to jump on the bandwagon of \\"They were sooo mean! Let's all hate them!\\" It's to expensive to be used as a fire-starter, so I would just skip it. I would have rated it a 0 if possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the spirit of Paul Bunyan...","review":"Reading this \\"memoir\\" reminds me that the spirit of Paul Bunyan is alive and well in Minnesota. The stories within these bindings smack of tall tales, embellishments manufactured to produce mighty oak trees from a mere acorn of truth. There is cruelty, insanity and other unpleasant arrows directed at family members. Reading these stories, I fear that myself and other readers will never know the truth behind the author's words, what is real and what has been inflated to achieve a certain level of interest for this deplorable book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"When given a memoir, I expect to read about someone's life. In Helget's book, I spent most of my time falling out of the lovely description and doubting the story.

Due to my gut reaction, I went with the latter, which, in my opinion, is fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate reading about dumb, helpless, scared women.","review":"I should have known from the start.

They are just extra episodes all featuring Pack-members, both old and new. It is unclear if these episodes are in fact Thomas & Friends episodes. The narrator is Michael Brandon and the episodes are filmed using 35 mm film, not digital film. (So they will look like season 7, not seasons 8-9). Here are the story stops:1. A Visit From Thomas2.

Well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Weak Entry","review":"We have two little boys who both love Thomas and own most of the older dvds. Sadly, we have found many of the newer titles to be lacking in story quality. As they are no longer basing the stories on existing Thomas written stories, one begins to get the feeling that the point of these new dvds is to sell you on new toy designs.This particular dvd seemed like it would appeal to our truck-loving toddler, but it just doesn't hold his interest. The engines are barely featured at all except to ferry the various trucks back and forth. The stories are not very interesting and there is nothing on this dvd that makes them want to watch it again and again. The voice acting is particularly bad on this one as well.My advice?

While I'm sure there are those who'll enjoy this little foray into the life of the average Japanese teenage girl who happens to be in possesion of monolithic mechs, I'm sure most will recognise it for what it truly is. I'm afraid that, in a market where the name 'Gundam' is the be all and end all of what we class as 'classic' full-on Mech, Bubblegum's numerous spawnings monopolise the shojo Mech market and Votoms and the like are the last word in retro cheese, Z-mind is a little out of it's depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"no product to taste","review":"It is really hard to describe something you have never tasted.

But's this Author's Written Before!","review":"First off, this was one of the most riveting legal thrillers I've encountered over the past year. Once the first chapter (loaded with details of morning prayer at a synagogue) is done with, the book picks up a full head of steam and speeds along, with plot twists, great characterizations and dialogue, and plenty of intrigue. David Hirsch makes for a great lead, and the supporting cast is nicely drawn out, but not overly so.Second, Michael Baron is not Michael Baron. It is a pseudonym, and judging by the clues inside the book, my guess is that Baron is actually Michael Kahn, whose previous legal series featured attorney Rachel Gold. Rachel Gold is a single Jewish lawyer who just happens to work in St. Louis. There is a climactic scene in this book which is ripped from the pages of one of Kahn's Rachel Gold books.Finally, I applaud the author's tribute to author Rochelle Krich.Read this book, and then pass it on to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great New Novel","review":"I read a book or two per week, but this was the first time i was compelled to write a review.

The button on top of clock to set alarm on/off feature moves so slightly it was difficult to tell if alarm was set as \\"on\\" or \\"off\\".

The design is nice and helps you apply an even thin layer, however the wax does cool quickly and I don't wax next to my microwave.

I see a red bird looking at me; red bird, red bird, what do you see....\\" It's the first book that my 3 year old has memorized cover to cover so it looks as though she's actually reading. Thanks to the colorful illustrations, big bold pages and whimsical creations, any child would be drawn to this book. The phrasing lends itself to memorization, the first step on the way to actually reading.

That's more than 20 years ago. They loved it. We loved it. Somehow it got away from us over the years. Just bought the new version for our granddaughter's 2nd birthday. All these critical teachers are missing the point. Great rhythm, rhyme and colors. Who cares if the words aren't placed exactly right. Does it impair the child in some way? I think not.

I would recommend it without question."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"An Attention Grabbing Book for the Busiest of Toddlers\\"","review":"My very busy nineteen-month old son was grabbed by this book. It kept his attention from start to finish. He has had it since Christmas, and already knows most of it by heart. With some of his favorite animals, and rhyming text, it has helped him to begin recognizing his colors. This book is one of my all time favorites. We have even incorporated it into a song for bedtime!!

I bought this copy for a little boy, Michael Paul. Michael is 2 years, 5 months old. His mother works for my doctor and I see her often. She tells me that Michael \\"reads\\" Brown Bear to her at his bed time. The story line is simple, the words are repetitious and the pictures give great clues to what the words say. This gives a child a feeling of reading, a powerful thrill to a non reader. While teaching first grade years ago, my young students were so fond of this book that they took to hiding it at the end of the school day so they could have it the next day.I received a lovely note from Mom and Michael thanking me for the book. I feel that I may have started another youngster on a life of reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"child learns animals and colors","review":"I love this book, it is so fun to read and I love the illustrations.

The kids knew every word in this book, and I ended up turning the pages while they \\"read\\" the book in unison to me. It was so adorable. I knew at that moment that this would be the first book that I bought for my future children. And it was.My son loves this book as much as I do. It's one of the first books he asked for by name. He chimes in with the colors and animals and \\"helps\\" me read.We have lots of other Martin/Carle books, but none of them are as special as Brown Bear."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective merchandise","review":"This particular book has an included CD.

She has a wide variety of books and enjoys almost all. However, this book has just not grabbed her attention even after several attempts - never happened with any other of her books. It's very monotonous and the illustrations are horrible. I kept wondering what the big deal was about this book until I read a teacher's review - apparently the current version is not the original one, which was the real classic where children had to actually guess what the character was seeing based on the picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOVE the book - ANGRY at the Kindle price!","review":"I'm awarding one star ONLY because of the Kindle price.

At age 2 and a half, my daughter had this book memorized, and she would \\"read\\" it to me (sometimes while the book was still tucked away in a diaper bag).The text is simple and pleasant. The rhymes are easy for little ones to remember, and there is a nice flow to the text that hides the lack of a traditional story line.If you own an earlier printing of this book, you may be pleasantly surprised by the re-illustration and a subtle change in the text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?","review":"I love the sing-songy verse of the story, but more importantly, so does my 16-month old daughter!

The sentence structure is the same and repetitve through out the story, so children can easily read along with you. It is a good story to turn into a flannel board or to act out with your children.

I had no idea dealings were quite so \\"questionable\\" between these two powerful families.This is a formidable exercise in \\"connect the dots\\" and \\"follow the money\\" that raises almost as many questions as it answers. For the first time someone has truly crafted a timeline of what happened when, where the money came from, where it went, and why oil is king. It will get you thinking, regardless of your political ideology."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Books Should be This Good","review":"Unger should win a Pulitzer for this, a refreshingly researched and thoughtfully argued expose. I had expected this book would be a polemic and was pleasantly surprised to see that it is not. Unger writes in a sober, detached manner and always backs up his claims. He should give lessons on how to write a current events book and all of the other authors should be required to take that class before writing. This book has not received the press it deserves simply because it is too good and ironclad in its facts. The press only likes outrageous diatribe and poking holes in faulty arguments. They don't find that here. You will, however, find yourself enlightened. Anyone who thought Michael Moore overstated the conenctions between House Bush and House Saud can read this book and be shocked."},{"rating":"2","title":"nessecary reading for all Americans","review":"It is about time that Americans open their eyes to the scary personal and financial relationship the Bush family has with these feudal Islamic fundamentalists.How can you expect Bush to protect us from terrorism when he hangs out with the main financial backers of terrorism?I hope that every American realizes what this buisness-personal relationship with the Saudis actually means."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is a great book documenting why George W. Bush is the worstpossible person that could be our president at this time. Also, check out the movie 911 in Plane Site. www.911inplanesite.com This movie shows suppressed news footage and video evidence from 9/11 that proves the government's \\"official story\\" is ludicrous. For example, the Pentagon was hit by something, but it wasn't a passenger airliner. That's why we haven't seen Pentagon footage. Please, check out this movie and show as many people as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO FACTS","review":"this book is a terrible piece of writing. There are plenty of unfactual claims or the author takes a fact and distorts it into being something it is not. The left will LOVE this book because it is what they want to hear. If you actually try to explore where the author claims to cite information from this book you will find it is not there. Ia m not even a Bush supporter but this book is a blatant attack on Bush - and that sends warning signs that this book was written under the blindfold of hate."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star because I can't give it none.","review":"Evidently the leftists didn't listen to Bob Woodward and others discrediting any \\"secret\\" deal to lower oil prices before the election. Not true. Do your homework, lefties, and read the book before you write a review. Did it ever occur to you that these authors are producing books for the same reason they say the Arabs are influencing oil prices.....to influence the election? Duh! Huh? Get a brain. Just because there were terrorists on the hijacked plane in no way establishes Saudi Arabia as being a terrorist state, any more than John Walker Lindh joining the terrorists means all Americans are terrorists. These books are rubbish, written to ignorant people who are easily influenced by the Bush bashers. I know our public schools are bad, but I didn't know they graduated such ignoramuses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsense","review":"Total fabrication of the truth. Why not read a book on the subject like Morgan Norval's \\"The Fifteen Century War, Islam's Violent Heritage\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Conspiracy?or just incompetence?","review":"When I first picked up this book I thought that there would be implications of some sort of conspiracy between President Bush and the Saudi government that backs terror. There is nothing in the book that proves that. What it does show is a very complicated relationship between our current president, his father, the family that controls Saudi Arabia and those responsible for the 9/11 attacks. What this book is totally consistent with is Richard Clarke's recent charges that Bush failed to heed the warnings that 9/11 was about to occur. It also has new details about the tangled web of relationships between the Bushes, the Saudis and the oil industry. Unfortunately the media gave far more attention to Richard Clarke's recent allegations than to the information contained in this book. The media would do well to also focus in on the Bush-Saud connection."},{"rating":"2","title":"House of Bush, House of Saud","review":"This book was very informative. It explained a lot of things going on in this world that I didn't or couldn't understand before. A must read for everyone!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An eye opener","review":"This book made me want to read all the rest of his work. In fact, I got a Kindle just so I could read them in digital form. There are connections that made me squirm such as the Bohemian Grove and other right wing organizations. The transition from George H. W. Bush to George W. Bush is also enlightening. For example, not marching on Baghdad after the Gulf War was a source of pride for Bush41. For Bush43 it was a humiliating failure.

The relationship is repugnant, especially in view of the fact that fifteen of the nineteen 9/11/2001 hijackers were Saudi nationals; in light of the apparent White House managed flights that helped some 140 bin Laden and Saudi royals to escape the U.S. only days after the murderous attacks on American soil.Quite honestly, I wonder why an otherwise intelligent man like Craig Unger would receive and prominently display an endorsement from an extremist-bigot like Michael Moore on the front cover of his book. Why not include on the cover other luminary Jew-haters and Israel-haters such as Jimmy Carter, Kofi Annan, Cindy Sheehan, John Dingell and Cynthia McKinney? Unger indicates no personal Jew-hatred or anti-Semitic tendencies in his book.

It works great for me.Functional - durable - unique. The hard shell and the fact that they open up nice and flat so you can use the front and back of each sheet without awkwardness is very nice. Million times better than a ring binder or those tightly bound journals that don't give you clean access to the whole sheet. Quality paper too. Like others have said this has replaced my PDA, and I'm a gadget freak so that is saying something.Over-priced? Probably....but what isn't these days? I have pocket sized and large sized Moleskines and did not have to pay what they sell for here. They are still expensive but for me it has been worth it.They make excellent gifts. Everyone I have given them to really like them and put them to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the notebook of the past ...","review":"I have purchased several of these notebooks over the years. They were made in Italy with good quality paper that doesn't \\"bleed\\" (I use a fountain pen). To my dismay, the label on my recent purchase of this notebook said \\"Designed in Italy/Made in China.\\" The quality did not seem to be as nice as the older ones, and the paper does bleed, albeit slightly. I visited Moleskine's website to see if there is any reference to their products being made in China. There was none, with a reasonable reader being led to believe they are still made in Italy. This notebook is not low priced (for something to carry in your pocket for notes) and there are many other brands, such as Rhodia (still made in Europe), for less money and of at least equaly quality. This will be the last Moleskine product I purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell apart many times.","review":"I hate rating anything Moleskine lower than 4 stars, but I have to. As with the previous commenter, the entire cover fell off. I super-glued it back on, and it fell off again. Then I tried a hot glue gun, and it worked... halfway (it is already half \\"off\\" again). The bottom part of the little pocket in the back is splitting as well, and some of my little papers are falling out. This is my \\"work\\" notebook and stays there; I don't throw it around and carry it everywhere or anything. I'll be getting a hardcover next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great product","review":"First, I'd just like to correct the person who said that moleskines have \\"no actual historical legacy\\". The Moleskine company may not have been founded until 1992, but moleskine notebooks have been around since before that. The company is not saying that Hemingway, Picasso and Chatwin used their brand of notebooks, they are saying that those people used moleskines.But the great thing about these notebooks is not that famous people used them, but that they are of great quality. I highly recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing comes close to my Moleskine","review":"This pocket-size notebook is a joy. The paper is high quality and pleasant to write on. Because the ink doesn't bleed or show through, you can write on both sides (a big advantage over spiral notebooks). There's a ribbon placeholder which comes in handy, and a little pocket in back for business cards and random pieces of paper. And, to tie it all together, an elastic band that slips on and off with ease. At the current price, the Moleskine is a fantastic bargain, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work with fountain pens","review":"I love the binding, but the strangely sealed cardstock paper of these journals does not play well with fountain pens.

After seeing a colleagues at work, he used his for drawing/sketching, he highly suggested purchasing a Moleskin for my writting/drafting of my book. I couldn't be more satisfied with the quality, durability, and the convenience of not having ink run through the pages. Whether you would use it for a to-do list, a diary/journal, etc, this moleskin is a perfect choice for writing with any utensil. I will be purchasing another one soon, because my first one is already almost full. Once you start writing, you can't stop. Buy this moleskin."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite Moleskine's ever","review":"The fact that they have used the character of the little prince for Moleskine is great to me, because I believe it embraces the dreams and beliefs of those who use Moleskine to materialize their thoughts.

I usually write at a table, or if I write on my lap, I have a sturdy enough sitting position that I don't need the hard-cover backing. It hasn't been bad having the hard-cover, but I do miss the flexibility of the soft ones. Works great, excellent paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful to have!","review":"I love this moleskine!

Simply The Best.","review":"Review of Moleskine's Ruled Large Notebook.I have been using Moleskine's products exclusively since 2004. In my demanding profession I use quite a few notebooks per year and I prefer the Large Ruled Notebook. The pages absorb ink without the need for blotting. In addition the pages seem to be low in acids (I won't say they are acid free) meaning they will not deteriorate quickly and are close to archival quality. The page weight is consistent with high quality stationary. Some used notebooks I have stored are over >six years in age and the paper is still colored and conditioned just like a new one. My notebooks have been bent, twisted and subjected to the elements. None has ever failed. I have seen many similar notebooks on the market but I have found that Moleskine prices their products to be fair and competitive for personal and business purposes. No one has to settle for less. Five stars without hesitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love These","review":"I love these Moleskine notebooks and have been using them as reading journals for several years. It's soft, easy to carry, has ribbon page marker ans elastic to keep notebook closed when not in us. The best part is that the covers will lie flat when you press down on the spine, and then close perfectly when you are through writing.One thing I have noticed is that the last few I've purchased were Made in China, which was not the case when I first started buying them. The covers do seem a bit flimsier, but it is still a good product. RECOMMENDED"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice!","review":"All of us seem to need some type of little notebook at one time or another. There are many, many brands out there for us to choose from so it can be challenging to find the one that is right for you. However, if you ever try one of the Moleskin books, you're likely to stop looking at other brands. Depending on what you are using it for, you probably want one that will hold up to wear and tear and have good paper to write on. That is what you get with this product and the acid free paper is super nice.You will find some notebooks that are less expensive but not likely to find one with the same quality as Moleskin. I highly recommend all the different sizes and can assure you that they last for years to come. All diaries, journals and lists are safe in these books for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"My NaNoWriMo Choice","review":"I turn to this notebook again and again for journal writing, and this year, I selected Moleskine's ruled notebook (size large) for writing my November Novel for NaNoWriMo. (Because all of my journal notebooks are typically black, I chose red for my novel.) Tomorrow is the final day of November and I have several hundred words left to complete my novel and several pages left in the notebook. I'm remaining confident that I'll not only finish the novel, but that I'll finish it within the confines of this notebook. I love the feel of the notebook, that it will allow me to write from edge to edge, I love the depth of the lines, and I appreciate that it is small enough for me to carry in my shoulder bag so I have it with me at all times. Plus there is a hard cover, a bookmark for saving your place, and a rubberized strap to hold it closed which remains tight throughout the life of the notebook, unlike some of the cheaper competitors.I'm never disappointed in Moleskine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best notebooks you can buy","review":"I have them in all flavors.

I typically jot notes to myself, including shopping lists, phone numbers, and other items. They are stored in my pocket or on a nightstand. In spite of light use, each of these journals has suffered from a split in the binding from the cover to the pages themselves. For the price you pay for these jorunals, they should last longer than a few months of light use. To be fair, I've not had much luck with other similar journals of the same size, although they have been three or four dollars cheaper. I'd love to see one of these with a more flexible and durable cover and binding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for medical professionals!","review":"I'm an intern (first year resident) and love these books because they fit easily in my pocket and help me keep information/notes organized.

I have been a moleskine user for five years and I was excited to buy a new notebook. However, when I received my purchase, the bottom right corner of the notebook was scuffed and scratched, as if someone had dug into it with a knife. The black color looked like it was dug out and you could see the beige inside. The spine was also dented. No where on the product description did it say that this Moleskine used or pre-owned. I was under the impression that I was purchasing a brand new Moleskine notebook, but what I got instead was definitely not new. I am very unpleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't fall for the hype","review":"When I purchased the notebook I was expecting a regular sized notebook, one a bit smaller than a five star 1 subject notebook. Instead it is rather small and not worth the 12$ I paid for it. The bindings were damaged on the notebook (pressed in and wrinkled). The paper is rather good quality and the overall look of it is rather professional.All and all I'd suggest going to staples and buying a nice notebook there. That way you can feel the paper and see the overall quality of the notebook."},{"rating":"2","title":"My book of brilliance","review":"I love my Moleskine notebook not only because of it's size, style, and quality, but because of its rich historical tradition.

This is a book that will stay with me now forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Things Fall Apart","review":"I've come to rely on Moleskine notebooks for work, personal use, for design mock-ups, and to organize the thoughts in my head. The hard cover ones add weight to a bag, so when I found out about the soft cover version, I was thrilled.That thrill didn't last very long.Because the notebook doesn't lie flat, you have to crack the spine if you want to use the notebook on a flat surface. After doing that once, the cover came off. I tried using library binding glue to reattach my cover, but to no avail; the cover just won't go back on.Not only that, but the back pocket in the soft cover version isn't as sturdy as the pocket in the hardcover editions, and it easily detaches from the back cover.All in all, these are only worthwhile if portability/weight is more important than longevity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Best","review":"The pages fall out and the binding fails after a couple of weeks in your pocket.

I work for a university as a fundraiser and I depend on having a notebook on me at all times as I go from meeting to meeting. My notes are very precious. Although they seemed rather pricey, I bought three of them to start me off. I made my first entry in my first Moleskine on October 1st. I finally filled that first notebook up last Friday! Not only did this Moleskine last almost seven months (and I do a lot of note-taking), but I love the feel of the paper and it's color. Easy to write on, very smooth, and easy on the eyes.The Moleskine tucked inside of my Oberon cover makes for a very classy presentation in meetings with donors and faculty.

I have already recommended this book to all of my writing friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality notebook","review":"I recommend this article only if you can take care of your things. And by that I mean that you never loose stuff. This is a pretty expensive notebook that does not serve any other function. The paper quality is average, thin paper that will bleed if you use roller point or marker.BUT if you are looking for a very neat and elegant notebook this is what you need. The higher price is justified by the distinctive Moleskine look. So if you want to impress every time you take a quick note don't look any further."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool for Journal","review":"This is an excelletn gift for anyone that hand writes a journal or jots down ideas for writing or business. Excellent quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced Mediocre Notebook","review":"Yeah, Moleskines have a cult following among those of us who journal or otherwise love a good notebook, but that following is largely undeserved. Moles are overpriced, poor-quality products. Their paper is thin and cheap (except for some of the specialty books, like the sketchbook), they cost about three times what they should, and really the name is all that you're paying for. Piccadilly makes an essentially identical product for a much more reasonable price.

Its size really is quite nice, and it is very portable, even if the samller is more so. This journal is much, much (much) easier to write in. If you anticipate making longer entries--not brief notes in shorthand--or if you regularly carry a bag of some sort, this is the journal for you, hands down. I tend to use the small journal as an on-the-run brain dump and the larger for long-hand text.No other journals are as well made. Plus, moleskines age well. They are an indispensable part of life. I have a small one in my pocket, a larger one on my desk, and two empties waiting for their time to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Legendary notebook with a bad quality paper","review":"I bought Moleskine notebooks back in the good old days before the small French quality manufacturer got acquired by the current company (I think it's an Italian mega consortium who doesn't give a fly about notebooks or paper.) That resulted in the company moving their manufacturing to China and marketing the brand to keep high profit margins.Now, who cares about the brand, when the most important part in a notebook is the paper quality and the bounding. I have to agree with most people who complain about the paper quality in the notebook: it's very low and subpart to even a composition book I can get at Office Depot for 1/10 of the price (See high profit margins above.) For a better quality artist notebook, I now use Canson (made in France) and for taking notes I switched a long time ago to Boorum & Pease (Columner books made in USA.)Sorry Moleskine but your \\"legendary notebooks\\" (TM) are just plain... legendary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Notebook","review":"It is an awesome item, whether you want for a daily journal or for an occasional place to jot notes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy Little Notebook","review":"This notebook is a great way to carry your notes around. The cover is made of a hard plastic, so the book won't get crushed in a bag or pocket like the smaller Moleskines covered in brown paper. The pages are large enough so that your writing doesn't feel cramped, and you can draw things out big enough to easily share with with others (example: I diagrammed a football play for someone sitting across a small table, and they were able to follow without holding the notebook up to their face).The paper quality is fine, but a word of warning: this notebook is probably best used with regular ballpoint pens. Most pens that use a wetter ink will bleed through and feather on the the paper in this notebook, so don't count on using a fountain pen or something of that short in conjunction with this notebook."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Changed It","review":"I love Moleskine. But this latest large ruled journal had darker ruled printed lines on the page. This is the first time I've encountered this. I use my ruled notebook as a sketch book too, and the dark lines are too pronounced to go with any sketches or drawings. I have Moleskine sketchbooks as well. But I draw in all my Moleskine journals. If this is a change, I request you put it back the way it was. If it's a quality control thing, then here's the Quality Control # D00506T from my journal. I will continue to buy Moleskines.

With that being said, I figured this watch was one that deserved something to be said about. I've had this watch for about 6 months now, and I love the look of the watch, I love basically everything cosmetic about it. I've used Fossil watches in the past, and have always had problems with the band clasp, but with this watch I have never seen any types of issues with it. One of my favorite features of the watch is the kinetic power feature, I've noticed after just a few days of wearing the watch in normal conditions, that the watch was fully charged! Awesome! But my biggest con for this watch would be the face of the watch. I have bumped the watch on walls around the house, and I now noticed 3 or 4 scratches on the face of the watch, and that is disappointing.

It is equally suitable for dressy occasions and everyday wear with its elegant style and its durability. With its 100M water resistance you can even wear it swimming.I would have given it a 5 star rating if the Seiko instructions had covered how to remove links from the bracelet and a prod for removing the pins that hold the links together had been included.At $125.00 U.S. versus the suggested retail of $375.00, it is a great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice watch","review":"I bought this for my dad, he has worn Seikos for about 10 yrs - actually he has worn the same Seiko for that long!

It's a bit heavier that I'd prefer, but I guess that's because it has the kinetic mechanism. When I bought it, I was a bit concerned with its faceplate being too large based on its photo.

Ned kelley's Irish family were put-down, locked-up and thrown-around by tyranical law enforcement gangs because, well, because they were Irish.Ned Kelley lashes back at the law with fists, guns and armour. His Irish family is treated by the \\"adjectival\\" authority with disdain bordering on obsessive hatred. Taught by the notorious bushranger Harry Power, Ned learns young to run, think and fire fast and first and ask questions later.The body count is high, morality low and yet the human spirit remains intact as Ned's love for his Mother and girlfriend (later to be wife) provide motivation that rises above loathing and eye for an eye rationale.I do enjoy Peter Carey's books. If you do too, I highly recommend \\"Jack Maggs\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Difficult Read","review":"I purchased this book because my book club suggested it. It is a difficult read, due to the poor sentence structure and grammar. Aside from the fact that it is also depressing (which is sometimes realistic) it moves along slowly and is very predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"is he a hero?","review":"Who is this Ned Kelly? What relevance does he have to the people of Australia today? Peter... whatever his name is writes an interesting modern fable for the people of that little island of criminals. It imitates a found diary text (are we trying to be TOO confidently literary!?!) and tells of his adventures in stuggling to grow up with an inherited criminality, a transvestite father and (gag) the horrible betrayals of the police. This may be a good book for children (peter partly intended this) but it's not the most sophisticated read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant surprise","review":"I picked this up on the \\"take one, leave one\\" shelf at work. At first, I thought the reason it had been \\"left\\" was obvious. There's NOT A COMMA in this entire book! This will be a headache to read!And so it was...for the first forty-odd pages. Then you fall into the strange rhythm, and fall in love with the humor, the danger, and the passion of this story.Halfway in, I Googled in attempt to define an Aussie term, and was stunned to learn quite by accident that The Kelly Gang was REAL, and common knowledge to your average Australian third grader. Well, maybe the average Australian third grader has never heard of Abraham Lincoln (thus I mentally excused my own ignorance).So it's not-quite-fiction, and not quite non-fiction, and definitely worth the extra effort. A satisfying read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"Reading \\"True History\\" is like driving 100 miles an hour for a few hours straight. Catch your breath at the rest stops and rev up again. The only roadbumps to this invigorating read are the raw vernacular and jagged grammar that stab at you like rusty nails for the first 50 pages but become comfortable once you've made the adjustment.Really a tale about class and social justice, Carey's book satisfies because it delivers us to Ned Kelly's 19th century Australia, where corrupt police and earthy settlers fill the stage in this story about a hard, resounding struggle to right a continuum of wrongs. Tough life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Condition rating was misleading","review":"I purchased this used from a third-party reseller on Amazon. I did not return this book as it was very inexpensive. However, the condition rating and condition description were misleading at best as it arrived in terrible condition.Also, though it states that its a novel on the cover, I think \\"True History of the Kelly Gang\\" is a poor and misleading title for a book that is anything but a true story."},{"rating":"1","title":"too many people involved","review":"not my type of reading. not as interesting as the book spoke about.some chapters were not interesting at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...not ENTIRELY terrible, but...","review":"This book is simply a rather boring western. It's not a history book, so you won't learn anything about 19th c. Australia from reading it. It's an interesting use of the vernacular but you will sometimes find yourself reading sentences more than once in order to get the drift. It's basically a lot of whining about being poor, oppressed and Irish - battling against those ... English ...Anyway, I was cruising along, thinking the book was mildly interesting, if a bit slow - then I came to the part about the torture of the horse. Somehow I managed to finish the book after that, although I'm not quite sure how I did it. It wasn't sad or emotionally moving, it was just plain sickening.So, what started out as a \\"different\\" book eventually became just a typical junky western, which always seems to have either a brutal rape or a scene of incredible cruelty toward an animal. Big surprise. Big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"This was simply terrible, a slow drawn out book, literary style was suppose to intrigue you but instead bored the tears out of me. Was not at all like some other Booker Prize winners."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just didn't buy it!","review":"This novel was the romanticized life of another gangster like Billy the Kid or Jesse James, but I never felt any sympathy for the main character at all, and thus, I'm not sure what Peter Carey's objective was. Why write a novel about a character that we're not supposed to have any emotional involvement with? Through the completely excessive amount of pages in this book, I ended up thinking that Ned Kelly was simply stupid. He made bad choices as a result of his idiocy, not because of some larger issue like repressive society, or mental illness, or anything broad reaching and universal (though some would argue that stupidity is universal), so rather than feel sorry for him, or want him to raise himself up, I just wanted him to be shot and have the novel over with.Usually Booker prize winners are a sure thing, but this one was definitely a miss. I gave the book away the second I finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can anyone help?","review":"I have been reading this book for months but still could not finish it. The reason is very simple.

If that is your goal, this is probably not the book for you. Imagine a tale told in first person by someone with an age 12 maturity and practically no writing skills. That's what this book is: fragmented, immature commentary that is VERY hard to follow. For all art, there's the medium that conveys the message. Carey selected a medium that drowns the message. Image the book \\"Treasure Island\\" entirely written in unpunctuated pirate talk (Aye, me hardies!) with no relief of intelligent prose. That's this book. Would give this book a zero rating if it were a choice. The Booker Prize committee must have been drunk."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll let you in on a little secret...","review":"Carey's actually not a very good author, and this actually isn't a very good book. If you really feel that you absolutely *MUST* read something about Ned Kelly, then erase those thoughts immediately, because he isn't worth the two bucks of scrap metal that his stupid helmet was made out of. He's no hero. He's just a sauced Irishman with a bad attitude."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rugged and regal account of historical criminals","review":"This is one of those books which needs a little introduction: in Australia, the Kelly Gang is famous the way that Dillinger or Bonnie and Clyde are in the US. This book shows Peter Carey trying (with much success) to recreate the rugged conditions of Australian life, and it is very well-written in a kind of rough-backcountry slang. It shows how incredibly talented Peter Carey is, and how his talents can be adapted over a wide range of subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"masterful voice","review":"The thing that sold me on this book was reading the first page in a book store. The voice Mr. Carey presents for Ned Kelly is mesmerizing. Once I read the first page and encountered this incredibly vibrant prose I had to buy this book at once. And after I started reading I hardly came up for air, it held me in thrall from beginning to end.I know there's been some differing points of view here on the voice used in this book, all I can say is it's got to be interesting to stir up such diverse opinions. Perhaps I am too sympathetic to the underdog, which Ned Kelly becomes even as his violent ways emerge, but I thought it was a fascinating character portrait of a very mysterious figure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"This was my introduction to the famous \\"Ned Kelly Gang\\", after having visited Melbourne and hearing a tour bus driver mention the famous bushranger, and I must admit that the book was hard to get started on. The writing is meant to appear as Ned Kelly's own, and so it is full of long sentences and missing punctuation. However, about 1/3 of the way through the book, I got used to the writing style, and found that I couldn't put the book down. I found myself truly caring for the \\"hero\\", and hoping that somehow, history would be changed and Ned Kelly would be successful in his quest to free his mother and make known the injustices that he and his fellow Irish had suffered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Like an actor who \\"becomes\\" a character, author Peter Carey \\"becomes \\" Ned Kelley in this brilliant fictional autobiography.Carey makes the risky choice of telling the story of notorious Australian outlaw Ned Kelly as if Kelly were writing it for his young daughter. From childhood to the eve of his death we get an unvarnished view of Kelly and the times and events that shaped him.Kelly was a late 19th century Robin Hood who achieved mythic status. Carey tells his story, not apololgeticaly, but as a part of a view on how a person's best intentions can go awry when faced with repeated injustices.The Australia of the time is laid bare with corrupt, cruel police, desperate rascals and innocents caught up in events.The limitations of Carey's narrative technique are compensated for by the authencity of his voice and the stories he has to tell.Action, adventuire, comedy, tragedy, history, romance all in one book.Inspired!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What to do before you read this book","review":"I had never heard of the Kelly Gang, that I remember, but I read this because I try to read all Booker Prize winners (I have read all but 16 as of now). I found the early part unappealing and I was mightily annoyed by the semi-literate usage (would you believe that the author used \\"were\\" when \\"was\\" was the normal usge and \\"was\\" when \\"were\\" was the normal usage? This impeded my reading for many pages, tho I finally got used to it.) It would have helped a lot if I had known how famous and controversial the Kelly Gang is in Australia. So, I think, you will appreciate the entire book more (if you don't know anything about the Kelly Gang) if you would put \\"Kelly Gang\\" into your browser and this will lead you to a very comprehensive site dealing with the subject. That way you may enjoy the entire book, instead of like me only the latter part of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"True History of the Kelly Gang","review":"I have read more than 50 % of this book and can find no redeeming qualities.

I understand Peter Carey's desire to get into Ned Kelly's mind and I appreciate his effort but not the result which is a disjointed, undescriptive narrative.

A person would need a great deal of background about Kelly and Australian geography and history already to get much from this book.And the style of writing chosen was so incredibly unreadable. Imagine a tale told in first person by someone with an age 12 maturity and limited writing skills. That's what this book is: fragmented, immature commentary that is VERY hard to follow.

It's bad","review":"This book is an inspiration to mediocre writer's everywhere. This book is 90-some pages and took me a MONTH to read. The writing is so amateurish and BAD that is hit me like a brick. I honestly could not believe some of these passages as I read them.Now thats all pretty harmless. Steve Alten's MEG and TRENCH don't exactly exhibit high degrees of complex narrative or exposition, but it was fun and professional. This book just downright [smells.] I could forgive the laughable writing style if only it was fun. The attacks are sterile, unimaginative, predictable , and not exciting. There is no flair or excitement, no visceral thrills. The finale is an assembly line-fiery-explosion affair, and the text consistantly contains errors. Let me put it this way: this book makes the Resident Evil series look like ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDEGet WHITE DEATH instead, and in August, Alten will release PRIMAL WATERS, the 3rd in the MEG trilogy"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Books I Ever Read","review":"The title says it all.

That is exactly what it is.This photo journal though somewhat limited in its scope of her career is interesting to view and lucious in its photography. If you are a fan then its a must have. If you like fine quality coffee table books you should consider it. If you are looking for a photo journal of La Ross' career then you will be disappointed.I made a very grateful and ardent fan of Diana Ross very pleased with a gift of my copy. It was worth the money. I replaced it soon after. It is worth the investment to see the Lady in so many poses and genres that differ from the typical way in which we often see her.Worth the money (If your'e a fan)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put it Back","review":"Indeed, this was to be a photo book chronicling her 40 years as a musical star. What the reader gets is a plethora of photos from the early seventies to the mid nineties. Seems Ross forgot about the successful sixties, as well as the latter part of her stalled career (as well as the 'plumper', older Ross we have seen of late) picking and choosing to create her own revised history. For laughs (I hope!) she throws in such gems as: \\"All the while that I move forward, I make way for reflection\\", \\"My parents gave me the right name\\", and \\"My self said, it is time to cease playing it safe, create new realities, dare adventures, be boss.\\" It's too bad she listened to herslef."},{"rating":"2","title":"DIANA GOES BACK...KIND OF","review":"Let me just say that I have been anticipating this book ever since word leaked out about its existence. For Diana Ross fans, this is the ultimate tour book. Wonderful photos (many never before seen) show the versatility that has placed Diana among the top icons of our time. The book does lose a few points because there are very few photos from before 1976, which totally ignores the Supremes years, an almost unforgiveable sin. There are also no onstage photos (except for Central Park) or shots of Diana with other celebrities. Not to mention very few family photos. A title such as GOING BACK would lead one to expect photos from Diana' entire life and career. However, this is not the case with this book. For the die-hards, it probably won't matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISSAPOINTING BOOK","review":"I was very dissapointed with this book, because I thought it was going to be a \\"picture book\\" of her life and 40plus year career.

JJ has never had a great voice but in the past he has made up for it with his song writing and delivery. Both fall flat on this album. The songs that he wrote are the weakest of the disc. He has chosen some good songs to cover but you'd be better off hearing them performed by the writers themselves. Particularly disturbing is the version of The Cape, by Guy Clark. This is a well written song very poorly performed. JJ is \\"helped out\\" on this one by his son, Django who isn't any better of a singer now than when he appeared on Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer on Christmas Gonzo Style several years ago.

The letters of Paulinus and his correspondents portray an early Christian 'web' of shared concepts, intellectual discussion, and group development. Catherine Conybeare examines how the very process of writing and transmitting letters between members of a community helped to bind that community together and to aid the creation of ideas that would continue to reverberate for centuries. Paulinus was key to that group iconic as a model of behavior, as a conversion success story, and as an intellectual contributor able to bridge the old world and the new.

Actually, it's one of the best albums ever made. It's like nothing else. Tom Verlaine's voice grows from annoying to absolutely gripping. And, of course, Marquee Moon is possibly the best song in the history of music. I don't even know if this is punk, per se. They just have a bad picture of the cover.

Television played with an intricate and sophisticated two-guitar attack, lines intertwining in ingenius ways.

The only problem I have is that I've never heard anyone posit that Tom Verlaine is probably a huge John Cipollina fan, of the first Quicksilver Messenger Service LP. If you listen to Gold and Silver and Fool on QMS's 1st LP...Well, the main theme of The Dream's Dream on Adventure is lifted from a riff in the middle of Fool by QMS, I swear. Just how Television covered 13th Floor Elevators, another obscure psych band, as shown on their \\"Blow Up\\" live album, a lot of the indie-influencing psych guitar excursions come from, and I'm positive of their devotion to the 1st QMS record-buy it and Marquee Moon too!

I picked up \\"Marquee Moon\\" because many of the bands I admire played with Television during the CBGB's days, & this album is often referred to as a watershed recording from that period. Upon first listening I wondered if the wrong CD had been put into the packaging, but no such luck! The music on \\"Marquee Moon\\" has no melody, no rhythm & no hooks. It is as if a bunch of philosophy majors in college read about rock n roll without ever hearing it, bought some instruments & formed a band. The most favorable comparison I can make is a punk Be Bop Deluxe, but that is insulting to Bill Nelson! In short - buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is what all the fuss is about?","review":"Some of the guitar playing is okay, and there's a decent melody here and there, but basically this band gets lots of critics acclaim because they never had mainstream success. Sometimes the mainstream has the wrong idea, and sometimes the right. The bands from this era and \\"scene\\" that made it big were all better than Television. This is an incredibly mediocre record, and that's all there is to it. It's big with the name dropping hipster types because they can say, \\"oh, you know about Blondie, but TELEVISION was really the best band from the CBGB era/scene!!!\\". BULLOCKS!!!

Of course, this album is so often namechecked by modern bands it's become cliche to mention it, but it truly is a great album. I won't go into details...it's too difficult to describe a band like Television with things so trivial as words.

I simply can't quit listening to this disc and in the space of a few months I've bought four of their five releases, including a live one on Ebay that's out of print. All of their CD's are great, but Marquee Moon is the best and qualifies as a must have for anyone who loves rock and roll. I'd give it bonus stars if I could.I'd also recommend \\"The Blow-Up\\" and/or \\"Live At The Old Waldorf\\" (great, but out of print) to hear how Television re-interpreted this material on the fly. Simply incredible."},{"rating":"2","title":"I remember when the darkness doubled","review":"This album has never sounded better. The jazz influenced endlessly snaking guitar work of Tom Verlaine sounds like its shimmering out of the speakers specifically on Venus and the title track. God bless those fine folks at Rhino (And I thought it was exciting when the X and Ramones reissues came out). Buy this in the name of all that is holy and help yourself to remember a time when punk rock meant more than getting a pierced lip, a blink 182 tatoo, and telling your parents that you were running away. And then my child pray to the gods of the digital remaster that the Richard Hell and Stooges catalogs are soon to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last Bonus Track","review":"To offer a stellar review of Marquee Moon would be repetitive and pointless, especially since I'm still fairly new to the genius of this album and am by no means an authority on its merits. It's actually still on repeat in my car stereo, slowly creeping under my skin. There is simply nothing to say that hasn't already been expertly noted within the customer reviews below (and above) this one...But I'll make a notable exception:If for no other reason, listen to the remastered album for the final bonus track, which is listed as \\"Untitled Instrumental\\" but is so brilliant it needs no name. A gritty fusion of manic ska-guitar, dance-punk pace, and crisp, infectious melody, this song would be corrupted if it were somehow unearthed from secrecy. So I'm telling you about it in hopes that you'll restrict amplified listens to your private time on the road. Warning: watch the speedometer...this is one of those tunes that unconsciously compels you to drive faster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw...arty...rock.","review":"In the late '70s, as an 8-10 year old Central Californian boy, I was not exposed to music like Talking Heads, Velvet Underground, Iggy Pop, Modern Lovers, or Television. They certainly weren't played on the radio (my summers were filled with songs from GREASE whether I liked it or not), and there was no MTV, hip college stations (as if I'd have tuned in at that age), or equally hip older brother or sister buying these albums. It wasn't until high school and college that I \\"got exposed,\\" first to Talking Heads, then VU, and a bit later, Television. The quirky, arty, yet extremely catchy songs on this album seem as relevant to me now as they must have when they were first released. As old timers are wont to say, \\"They don't make music like this anymmore.\\" Luckily it can all be found on CD so my kids will be exposed long before I was. Ain't they lucky?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, I Can FEEL it","review":"people are just benginng to understand where Verlaine is coming from. this album is still as fresh as ever. it is full of super edgy guitar playing, and interesting lyrics. a total album listen without a real single kind of song, so radio never knew what to do with Television."},{"rating":"1","title":"stop singing and play!!","review":"I agree with all the reviewers who point out that Verlaine's voice is so abysmal that it's tough to enjoy this record. From an instrumental standpoint it's genuinely superb, but a lot of the songs collapse either because of Verlaine's voice or because they are simply far longer than they ought to be. You don't have to be a Hootie and the Blowfish fan (I'm certainly not!!) to disagree with the critics on this one. A lot of great music came out of the CBGBs scene, but I'll take the Talking Heads or even Blondie any day over this pretentious nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big deal?","review":"Well, I tried this after hearing all of the critics rave. Sorry, but I fail to see what all of the fuss is about. This band desperately needed a better singer. I just can't get past this guy's terrible voice. Great instruments, very lousy singing. A bit too repetitive at times, too, as with the much-too-long \\"See No Evil.\\" Would've been a cool 2:30 minute song -- but it goes on waayyy too long.Another critics' darling bites the dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most like it because they're 'supposed' to like it","review":"This is not a terrible album, but its popularity with music snobs comes from the fact it never gained commercial attention.There are so many bands of this time period and genre that are far superior to Television : Pere Ubu, Talking Heads, Squeeze, etc that are truly good and not riding on the praise of critics"},{"rating":"1","title":"Close but no richard hell","review":"This is an ok album but the 'revolutionary' sound is definetly no where close to richard hell and the voidoids. The 'saturated' punk guitar sound is also no comparison to robert quines mastery on blank generation. Infact no single member of television can compare to his voidoid counterpart, especially tom verlaine, whos writing, although good compared to popular artists of his time, is still no match for richard hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated, boring","review":"Some of the guitar playing is okay, and there's a decent melody here and there, but basically this band gets lots of critics acclaim because they never had mainstream success. Sometimes the mainstream has the wrong idea, and sometimes the right. The bands from this era and \\"scene\\" that made it big were all better than Television. This is an incredibly mediocre record, and that's all there is to it. It's big with the name dropping hipster types because they can say, \\"oh, you know about Blondie, but TELEVISION was really the best band from the CBGB era/scene!!!\\". BULLOCKS!!!

I have often wondered why the Halloween episodes weren't collected in one DVD...and now they are. Any fan of the series should have this excellent collection, and trot it out each year, just like A WONDERFUL LIFE at Christmas. The episodes are of the better, best quality, but they are all loving tributes to what is obviously Roseanne's favorite holiday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"My sister and I have always loved Roseanne, and the Halloween episodes were our favorites.

Now, my dream has come true and now I have the Halloween episodes that I have always looked forward to! It is true, the Halloween episodes of Roseanne are the best Halloween TV episodes you can buy besides the Simpsons Treehouse of Horror. They are always funny and awesome to watch, especially when it is that time of year. I'm just thankful I no longer have to search the TV to find these episodes around the holiday, but just watch the DVD. It may not be that time of year right now, but any time is good to watch this"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its Halloween Roseanne style","review":"There are two shows that treat halloween like a national holiday. The Simpsons (with their Treehouse of Horror) and Roseanne.Roseanne and her family always had fun on Halloween. It was a time for family. In a way that was roseanne and her show was all about.

It's not suspenseful. The \\"mystery\\" is predictable to anyone who has seen more than one television suspense show. The characters are hollow. The interaction is tedious. And despite some hopeful signs of drug use, there are no hallucinations or grand insights.

Trust the reviews!","review":"I agree that these are better than in the picture. I bought these based on the reviews and I was pleasantly surprised when I received them. If you vary between two sizes, go with the bigger size. The straps are a very soft material that feels so good on the foot. It doesn't feel at all like something is binding your foot, but at the same time, it feels secure. I bought the black and will probably get another color...just too comfortable and pretty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected!","review":"Shoe looks great in the picture but is rather strange looking.

A dangerous combination for a sandal. I say \\"probably\\" because I returned it. Cute as it is, it just wasn't worth the risk. If your feet are usually true to size, I suggest purchasing 1/2 size smaller. If they are a little narrow, you should probably pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre book on labs -- not a good training reference.","review":"This book contains general, basic information on laborador retrievers.

It's a beautiful dress watch though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb anime although it lacks a bit in action.","review":"Despite being a hardcore anime fan, I had never heard of Orphen before I purchased this DVD. I had previously explored what I consider to be two of the best anime's of all time, Rurouni Kenshin and Trigun. Orphen is a superb anime, however, it will not be removing these anime's from their throne. The action is quite enjoyable, although action sequences are few. The storyline is deep and enchanting, the humour is insanely funny, and Orphen himself rocks! This is not an anime to pass up! Be sure to check out Trigun, Rurouni Kenshin, Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, Outlaw Star, Spriggan, Princess Mononoke, Ninja Scroll, and Wrath of the Ninja!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Orphen, the saga begins..............AND IT'S GREAT!","review":"WARNING! THERE ARE A FEW MINOR SPOILERS HERE!..............................................................Orphen starts off with the episode called \\"The Sword of Baltanders\\" in this episode we see the characters of Orphen begin to flesh out. We are introduced to Orphen a spell caster, Magic who is orhens apprectice, and Cleo, though she tries not to admit it has the hots for Orphen, and a two \\"TROLLS\\". I am not sure if they actually are trolls they look human enought to me but oh well. Orphen and Magic end up going against 'The Bloody August' a dragon which Orphen seems to have ties to. Eventually the two Trolls end up running off woth the sword of Baltanders and Orphen, Cleo, and magic head after them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"The orginal Orphen was smart, had an edge, and told a great story. it artwork was excellant, it had great music and was in short one of the 5 best series I have seen.This one needs better art work, much better music, A plot and vision!While parts are funny on a whole a great disapointment"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice but far to short.","review":"While Orphen, Spell of the Dragon, tells an interesting story and is well animated my overall impression was kind of disappointing. The DVD contains only 3 episodes, each of about 20 minutes, the rest is opening, end-titling and even the stop/start shots where on TV the commercials are inserted. After the 3 episodes were done they left me with the impression of having seen about 1 episode of a longer anime. So what it inspired in me was a sense of having wasted money, rather than of having seen a nice anime. My advice, don't buy it unless you are an absolute Orphen fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Theology of Singleness?","review":"We do need books that encourage us to consider carefully the pursuit of a marriage partner in community. However, the authors' extremely narrow reading of 1. Corinthians 7 (gift of singleness=low sex drive, singleness is NOT a gift but only a trial) made the book a discouragement for this 30 year old Christian currently in a committed relationship looking towards marriage. Also felt like there was a mixed message of setting an extremely high bar--opposed to opposite sex friendships, talk to her pastor or father before a first date--and then wondering why in the world men aren't going into the breach. It's because you've told us we can't develop deep relationships with a gal and we have to bare ourselves to major authority figures before taking a girl out for a coffee. Duh.There are other books out there. I recently read Walter Trobisch's \\"I married You\\" and found it more helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holding more than you know","review":"If your looking for a book on starting your relationship with the right mind and heart set, this is it.

In fact, after I finished it I gathered up some of my other books on Christian dating and singleness along with their receipts to return them to the book store. This book offers sound advice based on Biblical principles with the much needed Christian love and wisdom."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book ever..and I'm not kidding.","review":"This is a book that I was obligated to purchase for an 18th century lit class. We never got to it on the syllabus, so it collected dust. When I did finally pick it up I couldn't put it down. I laughed out loud frequently. I am amazed at how well it's 18th century humor has stood the test of time. You must commit past the first 50 or so pages to get into the rhythm and style. Then you'll be hooked. Lest you think that this is just a book for English majors with a bent towards the 18th century, I should point out that my other two favorite books are Lonesome Dove and Cryptonomicon."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book changed my life","review":"I always thought everybody struggled like I did until I read this book. For the first time in my 37 years of life, things made sense. His struggles, fears and victories were all things I could relate to. It was as if I was looking in a mirror. I took the 71 question quiz at the end of the book and scored high on all but two questions. I always thought dyslexia was the inablility to read because of transposing letters. Now I know it is far more than that. I have purchased a copy for each of my loved ones in hopes they will be able to understand me and my learning disorder. Best of all, I can use Abraham Schmitt as proof that I don't have to stay within the walls of my fear and limitation. I highly recommend this book to every school teacher, everyone who struggles with surmountable odds or fear of any kind, and people like me, who label themselves \\"a stupid genius\\". Not only is it an eye-opener about dyslexia, but it is an unforgetable story about an unforgetable man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light hearted show for all family members","review":"This is a show that's suitable even for young children. The combination of light science fiction and humor makes for a good series for a relaxing evening. When my young great-nephew, age 10, visited, this one was one series that he could watch without supervision. His grandma started watching it too, and it was well-received by both. The great-nephew went on Eureka marathon, trying to get in all of the series (he did) before he had to leave, even with a busy schedule. He would get out of bed at 6 a.m. so he could begin before the rest of the day's activities. It even won out over computer games. That's saying something for a 10 year old boy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extreme Entertainment!","review":"I am hooked on Eureka... again!I watched avidly the first season, lost interest the second due to the season-long story arc.I love that the show took a break and went to independent episodes with this season.In that respect the writers strike was the best thing to happen to a show.The strike made the second half of this 3rd season the best of all.I am watching continuously now, and I will own them all! :-) Well done, Eureka!"},{"rating":"2","title":"!!!!!!!","review":"This is a great show.

Sometimes it is a bit \\"out there,\\" but you can't ask for a better cast and I've never been disappointed. My husband is an Electronic Engineer and loves it. I recommend it to anyone that enjoys sci-fi and enjoys Colin who plays the sheriff. He does a great job. I also enjoy hearing how they do the special effects and I'm amazed at the great acting done infront of the green screen. I hope Eureka has many more seasons, because we are fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Duplicate of Season 3","review":"I would not have ordered this DVD if I had realized it was a duplicate of the Season 3 I already own on Amazon Instant Video. It would be helpful if customers could see a description of the episodes covered in a DVD before opening the packaging, as I did, thus rendering the DVD non-returnable. Love the series, but I would rather have spent the money purchasing Season 4, which I did not already own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ah ha!","review":"This was a gift for my bff who loves this show.

Yes, the production is better, and their new drummer is better. Sorry, it doesn't help. Schmier now sings all down and dirty, bypassing the maniacal shriek he used to deliver. The band now sounds all new-school, and they just sort of lost me...got to give this one a thumbs down. It just sounds like a modern metal band covering old Destruction songs. The charm and identity of the original songs are gone. I used to marvel at how the guitarist was able to play so tightly alongside the old shambling drummer. Not a problem anymore, they now have a rock-solid kit basher in the band. Oddly, that doesn't influence me in a positive way. I think this lineup of Destruction should record new material, not overhaul their classics. Upon hearing this CD and their new style, I didn't even go to their show. This listener recommends that you seek out the original \\"Sentence of Death\\" and \\"Infernal Overkill\\" albums instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely story","review":"I read this book with my daughter who is almost 8, we have read the whole series and really enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This isn't a DVD, but it's a great VHS! :)","review":"Just thought I'd note that this is currently (8/4/01) listed as a DVD but it isn't; it's the next-to-last VHS volume.

Nothing like observing a child catch their first fish all on their own, it truly is something they will remember for their lifetime! I recently had a 2nd grader show up with this rod, and witnessed only frustration and disappointment. (The safety of this rod while fishing with a group truly came into question too, but that is another issue.) Secondly, why reduce your child's ability to master small and large motor skills by 'copping out' from buying the traditional rod? Take it from my experience, buy your child a traditional rod and closed-faced reel by Zebco or Shakespeare (lots less expensive) and take the time to help them develop the motor skills to master the art of fishing. They will feel so much more accomplished when they've experienced a good cast and caught a fish all by themselves then cheating with this tragic invention."},{"rating":"1","title":"rip off","review":"Ok so I have nothing positive to say about this fishing pole.

It would shoot then the line would tangle. The bobber failed to release the bait. It shot tops 15 feet into the water. In total we actually used it fishing (not trying to get it to work) maybe 3 shots with bait before fustration got the best of us. I recommend not wasting your money.

Seemed like they were too difficult for the kids to \\"pump\\". For the $30 each they cost, I bought two Shakespeare Spincasting combos that came with hooks, lures, etc. My kids caught a dozen or more Sunnies each.

NO. I'm a relatively mechanically inclined individual, and rarely do I give up on a project because I can't fix it, but this was a serious pain in the - neck. I suppose I could replace the reel or spend a few hours messing with it...oh yeah, I don't actually have a few hours to dedicate to that, so...to the garbage it goes.

It will be more enjoyable for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF $$ along with A PIECE OF CRAP!!","review":"I also bought this for my son and it broke within the first 3 hours of using it. It was his first time fishing and he was excited. He launched it and it seemed to be fine but it wouldn't reel back in. Finally after 15 minutes of trying to reeling it back it, we launched it again and it didn't seem to cast out far enough so we tried reeling it back in and it just stopped. Wasting over 1hr on trying to fix the problem, we finally got fed up and just packed up our gear and left. My son was so upset, he cried the whole time wanting to fish. Thanx FOGO for making kids cry and making the parents look idiots. We'll buy a real fishing rod."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money like I did.","review":"I purchased this for my son who loves to fish with his Grandpa after intense lobbying.

One of them broke on the first try of cocking the gun!!! I tried to fix it but realized that the mechanism was made of cheap plactic which had snapped in half. The other gun has continued to work fine after several outings, however, we still have not caught any fish with these. Mainly because the bullet which holds the hook has a hard time opening, and then doesnt allow the hook, bait, and weight to sink low enough to attract any fish.

We bought two of these at 30 bucks a pop. We have twin sons and they were so excited to use these. They shoot fine (about 15 feet...not 30) but the problem is with the capsule (bobber) that holds your bait. It tends to not release the hook that holds the bait. You aren't gonna catch much of anything if your hook is still inside the bobber. I was discussing the rod with a friend and she said her daughters did the same thing. Its a great idea, but it just doesn't work for some reason. I think we will be returning these and getting them a plain old fishing rod. We were out for over 2 hours and no bites. Maybe because they didn't have anything to bite into."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken in no time","review":"I bought this for my grandson.

It's awkward to get the hook back into the \\"rocket\\" once the bait is on. I took my son fishing with them and what we ended up doing is not launching them out of the gun/rod. We left the pod open with the bait on the hook and dropped it into the water and let it drift with the current. I've come to find that buying cheesey little rods and reels are simply a waste of money. If you're going to take a little one out fishing, just use your own and let them reel yours in until their big enough to handle a decent set up.

I have the import game and it's very good, and this soundtrack includes the new songs from that game, and some missing ones from We Love Katamari. The new songs, such as Shabadoobie, Jesus Island, and Family Damacy are VERY good and up to the usual standard of Katamari greatness. The 2nd disc of this soundtrack is a lot of classical pieces, that I suppose are found in We Love Katamari, but I should play through again to find out. If you're wanting some new Katamari songs from an excellent game, I definitely recommend this. If you really want the past soundtracks, then buy them."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of a tribute than a soundtrack","review":"This cd is actually more of a tribute to the game, rather than an accurate soundtrack. If you're looking for the music from the original game, you need to go track down an album called, \\"Katamari Damashii Soundtrack: Katamari fortissimo Damashii\\". That's the cd with all the original music. It's published by Columbia (Catalog # COCX-32760). You'll know you have the right one, by the cover which resembles the original game's cover.

Just to let everyone know that this kit contains a multitool nylon sheath with a small compartment to hold the tool kit, but it is too tight to fit both the tool kit and the Gerber 600 multitlool into the included nylon sheath. The multitool 600 will fit inside the sheath, but it will not close fully on the velcro. Overall the tool kit is very good quality, in black non-reflective finish. On the clamshell package it stated the tool kit is made in China, and the sheath is made in U.S.A., so for the people that is very curious about if Gerber product is made in U.S. or not, now you know before making your purchase. I will purchase this product again, if I ever buy another Gerber multitool to make a set.I will rate this kit a five star, if the sheath that came with the tool kit will close fully for my Gerber 600 multitool.

That means when I'm sweating, or swimming, no go.

Next, they developed an inane relationship between Martha and Lionel under the approving eyes of Clark. Not to mention -- how are Clark and Louis supposed to meet for the first time at the Daily Planet when they've already lived together in Smallville? This was a terrific show for the first four years, but this last year isn't worth buying. I don't see how the present writers, directors, producers can bring it back on course. They need a new team, one that understands the Superman lore -- one that realizes its job is developing the young hero into a superMAN and not keeping a prominent role for Lana.

Fell victim to the same mediocrity that is this shows' downfall.I watched this show for 6 years hoping to watch the brilliant fall of a tortured billionaire. I was promised a strong, steady, and a believable fall to darkness.Lex said in either the first or second season that the path to evil isn't a light switch. I was given none of that. We went from a Lex that was open and honest with Lana, distanced from his friendship with Clark to an overnight madman complete with steepled fingers and an evil cackle.It's like the writers realized Smallville's time is coming to a close so they are hastily wrapping it up.Buy it if your a fanboy.

The Super Saver Shipping method is the bonus of Amazon that draws me time and time again. It truly was faster than a speeding bullet! My gift was a superhero fanatics bliss! Thanks Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Arrived Early...... Loose Disc","review":"Product arrived early, just have one gripe and I can't necessarily blame Amazon for it. The last disc in the season was loose which forced me to review the episodes(to make sure it wasn't scratched), which I didn't really want to do being that I hadn't watched the fifth season yet(spoilers). Still gave it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smallville Season Six DVDs ROCK!","review":"I'm a huge Smallville fan anyway, but having all the shows commercial-free with such excellent quality picture and sound is a delight. There are some deleted scenes and other extras - I wish they'd do a narration of one (or more) of the episodes with Tom Welling, or an interview with him. I have all the seasons DVDs so far, and nothing like that with Tom is on any of them (that I've found so far . . .). Chloe, Martha, Lois, Lionel Luthor and even some guest stars do interviews or commentary on some episodes, but why not TOM?! He's the STAR!!!!!!!! argh. I love the set - I just hope there's an interview or commentary with Tom hidden in the discs I haven't watched yet (but I'm not holding my breath)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just perfect","review":"Excelent producto, I think Smallville is becomeing a more mature series and presenting better scripts."},{"rating":"1","title":"lousy","review":"The item was delivered missing the first disk, i immediately informed amazon to inform about it, and now i am waiting for the replacement to be delivered i hope it comes home complete."},{"rating":"1","title":"DC Comics Characters look terrible in Live Action","review":"This was the most awful apperance of superheroes in live action ever. Never mind the casting. They all acted wooden and made the kind of acting you see on AS THE WORLD TURNS look like fine art. Then there was the outfits, on the comics page it's colored cartoon underwear, on this show, I will not dignify it with comment, but to say that it's laughable would be too kind.I knew that this show was a joke, but now I am more convinced then ever that this show, as well as the CW network, DC Comics, Warner Brothers and everyone who work there are among the most untalented fools in Hollywood."},{"rating":"2","title":"The (young) Man of Steel on Blu-Ray","review":"I'm just going to comment on the Blu-Ray aspects of season 6 of Smallville. The episodes in Blu-Ray look better than when they are broadcast in HD on my local CW station, but not much better. I'd say the Blu-Ray transfer for this product isn't as high grade as on some other Blu-Ray discs I've seen. The sharpness and clarity doesn't extend to the backgrounds much of the time in dark or color packed scenes. But I'm pretty darn sure this season looks MUCH better than my standard DVD versions of seasons 1-5 of Smallville.And, no matter what, I'm sure Smallville season 6 looks better on Blu-Ray (and is just plain BETTER) than the abysmal movie \\"Superman Returns.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Multi region","review":"I won't repeat the many reviews already given. But a true bonus of this set (as well as previous seasons) is that the DVDs are enabled for regions 1,2,3 and 4. Not just 1 as stated on the box. A bonus for Europe - especially with the low dollar rate at the moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST! If you have any affinity for the great movies of the 40's and you're at least close to becoming an old fart!","review":"I have watched all episodes of Smallville and they are almost always worth the watching in a continuing story - not quite what us older folks remember Superman to be but a great, more current interpretation. This episode, however, was a treat beyond words. The cast had the 30's-40's film genre down to the \\"T\\". We got to see all of the regulars we enjoy so much and have them really show their talents by going to a dimension that is so, (pardon the expression Clark), \\"alien\\" to their generation, to what their normal roles are. It just goes to verify the talent of this cast to be able to pull off \\"in my mind at least\\" an incredible re-creation of any of a number of old classics. Bravo to all of them!Bob Reidmuller - Old Fart in California"},{"rating":"2","title":"SMALLVILLE = AWESOMENESS","review":"i love smallville, and this blu ray is a vast improvement over the hd cable version. the only problem is the dumbed down version that wb gives because they don't want to give blu ray the optimal transfer and simply port the lowest common denominator (hd dvd). there is some digital noise. the lack of uncompressed audio is a dissappointment, but its still great. and i love smallville."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Favorite","review":"I rarely watch this episode because the story is focused on Lana and Lex which I am not a fan of. There's very little that is enjoyable here. We see very little of Clark and he's \\"alone\\" and \\"isolated\\" which doesn't make me feel great. I hate seeing an \\"isolated\\" Clark Kent. It breaks my heart. So...not a favorite of mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Season And With Some Added Cameos","review":"I was greatly entertained by this season as with all the other seasons as well as I said for the season one set the cast for the show are still going strong and are still great as their characters. I do have to say though I still can't bring myself to truly care for the shows Lana Lang and how they have made her. Lana is a little less superficial in this season but thats not saying much for the character and while I have no dislike for the actress who plays Lana I do hope they don't have Lana Lang for season eight.Some of the few episodes I truly liked with this season was when Clark fights Zod in the season opener,when Clark has to fight the Krptonian Titan in a underground fighting club,and the first formation of an early JUSTICE LEAGUE. So I say to the fans of the Superman universe now is the time to start your collection of these excellent season sets..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best place to buy smallville","review":"Smallville comes brand new in a sealed bag....Its a great show for a great price.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like any other Smallville season, there were good episodes but also some that didn't seem necessary.","review":"I really like Smallivlle and I like to know exactly what's going on.

But I'm a huge fan, so I liked it anyway. The best episodes were Zod, Sneeze, and Combat. Though I was a little disappointed that the fight between Zod and Clark was so short. I think it should've spanned two episodes at least. I like the episode Combat because it was the first time Clark actually put up a fight against someone as strong as he was; before he got his butt kicked.Brandon Simpson"},{"rating":"2","title":"smallville the way its ment to be seen","review":"I have Been watching smallville sence it started, have enjoyed watching rerunns on hdnet for a couple of years, great to finally have it in hd in my own librery.

It got even better with a few surprises in store (I won't spoil it for you!). Let's just say that the acting is exceptional because everyone makes it believable and although the season finale doesn't make me feel like I have to go out and buy the 7th season right this second (it hasn't been released yet) I will get it within the first few months that it comes out at least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superman Fan?","review":"Then this series is a MUST SEE!

What I have always loved about smallville is that is a show about a young mans struggle to come to grips with what he must become. Season six is like watching something from the sci fi channel! So many strange things going on with lex creating a super army to the Green Arrow (which is such a letdown superhero, expecally on a show about SUPERMAN) I could hardly follow all the funky twist and turns but I will say the last couple episodes peeked my intrest in watching season seven so I am not quite ready to give up yet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect!","review":"This DVD collections is awesome! It has all the amazing episodes of the sixth season and has some bonus features as well! The only thing missing from this collection was that it doesn't have any audio commentary like they have had in the past.

Following the author info there is more 'book-junkie' information to tempt we readers of fiction; award winners, dos and don'ts of writing to an author, information on the different fiction genres. I see this as a perfect gift for fiction readers, especially if you don't know what books the recipient has already read. It's also an invaluable resource for book groups, teachers, and booksellers.

This more rough and ready Sharpe is consistent with a young man at war; he may o always be likeable but he is always compelling. Fascinating as ever. Keep up the marvelous work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only about the narrator","review":"Bernard Cornwell is probably the best historical novelist alive today and his Sharpe series is superb. The reason for one star is the fact Patrick Tull is probably the worst reader I have ever had the misfortune to have to listen to. His style appears to be to mumble through sentences and then literally shout every name or 10-15th word. I suspect many folk listen to audiobooks while in the car and it's pure hell to try to understand what this guy is reading. If you turn the volume up enough to hear the mumbles then your eardrums are assaulted by the shouts. If you leave it low enough to hear the shouts then you miss everything else. Avoid this reader if at all possible but do enjoy all of Cornwell's works."},{"rating":"2","title":"If Your a Fan, Pick it Up!","review":"If you have read any of his prior work, youwill want to pick up his latest offering.This man has a great way with words andcan certainly weave a good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cornwell's Heart Not in this One.","review":"To work, historical novels have to have some element of believability.

I am trying to read all of them, they are historically accurate and very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another rousing good time","review":"I am addicted to the Sharpe novels and this one is as good as most of them. Cornwell is a master of detail and for me that makes these stories come alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"The opening scene is a real grabber. I had just read all the India books and the Trafalgar book. I was trying to space out my reading. I was consuming the Sharpe stories so fast that I was rueing the quickly approaching day when I had read them all and there were no more. So I just opened the novel up to read a page or two so that I would understand what it was about. I would just get on with my life and not continue to compulsively consume Sharpe books.Alas after just a few paragraphs, I was hooked. I sat down and read the whole thing. So I warn you. If you don't have at least a couple hours, don't crack the cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mark Twain is Alive and Well in Galena, Illinois","review":"I first heard this music live in Chicago, where I was lucky enough to witness a miraculous event: Mark Twain singing and telling stories in the persona of Jim Post. What is most amazing about these songs, beyond the beautiful melodies and fine instrumentation, is that Mark Twain wrote many of the words. Somehow, Jim Post carefully reorganized quotes from Twain into song lyrics and then created wonderfully rich melodies to complete the song. Imagine a collaboration with one of America's greatest authors with a rock and roll hall of fame musician and you have Mark Twain and the Laughing River!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good wrestling DVD.","review":"Well, my experience about this wrestling DVD.

She LOVES to watch this video. We danced around the house to the Conga. Clapped our hands to the beat and repeated words in spanish. The video is a plus for helping preschoolers develop rhythm and pronounciation. Cultural diversity (acceptance and awareness) are important concepts for even preschoolers to acquire.

The songs are upbeat and catchy, of course all the Muppets dance themselves silly so your kids will love imitating them, and the celebrity singers, i.e. Celia Cruz, Linda Rondstadt added to the fun. It was not as long as we'd like but for an intro to numbers and short phrases, it does the job well.

I especially liked the quotes he provides - what you can tell your creditors so that they lower your interest rates.

You can't go wrong with this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is credit card specific!","review":"Of all the books I have looked into, this is probably the one the credit card companies hated to see the most. I have looked into many books regarding personal finances, this is the only one I found that is specificaly about, and only about, credit cards.

If you are looking or help in dealing with your credit cards on matters such as, finance charges, interest rates, late fees, annual fees,ect.; this is the place to get it.

She vanquishes robots & monsters. Outside of a couple very brief nude scenes I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment...","review":"Jane Fonda was not only an excellent actress but a beautiful, if opinonated (remember Hanoi Jane?), woman. I watched this as a teenager and despite the \\"striptease\\" this has to be one of her worst. Hormones be damned, watching this was a waste of time. If you like Fonda, try Klute. She was an excellent actress --- but no one could survive this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Testosterone and Brains Don't Mix","review":"We males will watch any appalling piece of crap if it's got beautiful naked women in it, won't we? The \\"sets,\\" the costumes, the acting, the special effects, the music, the editing, the story, the sound and the camerawork here are all way, waaay below sub-standard -- but Fonda looks great, doesn't she?I thought I remembered this flick as a total waste of good female flesh... and yep it totally is.But it has Anita Pallenberg (Keith Richard's girlfriend) as the evil Queen and Marcel Marceau in a speaking role so hey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barbarella","review":"Unless your into the kitchy, sexist period, this may not appeal 2 all. I enjoyed it because it was so over the top. Jane Fonda, obviously still learning her craft, didn't have a lot of range. She mostly just showed off her body in a new outfit, almost, every new scene. The storyline was laughable, but for all you Music fans, this is were Duran Duran got their name from. As long as you don't take it seriously, it is very campy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oi","review":"Set back in the time when objectifying women was normal in the movies, Jane Fonda represents a heroine who can think. I was not able to watch the entire movie because it was so cheesy. I wish I could have watched it through"},{"rating":"2","title":"wow... far out","review":"The new Blu-ray version of Barbarella is the same DVD content from a few years ago but the image quality is like 100 times better, I honestly liked the movie better seeing the pristine print in high def. Would've liked some bonus features but definitely worth the upgrade to Blu-ray for me"},{"rating":"1","title":"too edited from movie I saw at theater","review":"I wish the r rated version I saw at the theater was on dvd.

If you like this type of movie you would be better off buying flesh gordon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two stars for the title sequence","review":"The zero gravity spacesuit striptease in the opening title is the best thing about this film. The rest is pure camp, but it's so bad it's not even bad enough to be funny. The plot, dialogue, acting, sets, special effects, and music are all horribly bad and boring. The most memorable line is, \\"An angel doesn't make love, he is love.\\" But let me tell you, that angel was making plenty of love; unfortunately we never got to see any of it. Watching this movie now, I can see that the only reason it created such a stir in 1968 was because it snuck in soft porn to mainstream theaters. But this film is droll French humor; it has no morals or heart and as such is not a reflection of the \\"free love\\" and liberation of the times. What's worse, even the villains in this film are absurd and boring. If I need a fix of bad science fiction, I'd rather watch The Attack of the Killer Tomatoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flower Power in Space","review":"Do you remember \\"The Summer of Love\\" ? Do you remember \\"The Dawning of the Age of Aquarius (Where Peace will rule the planets and Love will steer the stars ... ) ? Well, this is the standard for the vision portrayed as Barbarella treks to far off galaxies on a quest to apprehend Duran Duran and return him to Justice. In retrospect she seems to be overly starry-eyed, perhaps even ditzy or air-headed, but those are all tolerable traits in a naked lady. Are there parallels to \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" ? Certainly there is Wonder in abundance. In the end Justice is served all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guaranteed to Grow Hair on Your Palms","review":"This is a spectacular picture for stoned college freshmen of all ages.

Buy DVD and enjoy more beautiful upscaled picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"So I'm your one eyed wench now am I??\\"","review":"The opening sequence of Barbarella is probably the greatest in cinematic history, who thought up the idea of a striptease in space? Whoever it was deserves an award for it sets up the theme for the entire film perfectly. Mindless sex in futuristic settings, how fabulous. The plot is distored, disjointed and at the end of the day pointless. But hey, so what...it gives Miss Fonda plenty of chance to change her groovy costumes. Classic lines and moments in the film are a plently, with some of the most classic scenes being Barbarella being attacked by dolls with attitude and Barbarella having a strange kind of \\"virtual sex\\" which leads to \\"hair-raising\\" consequences. This is a classic beyond all comprehension, it has to be seen to be belived. I saulte you all and offer you this message..LOVE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!!

I am quite sure that Jane Fonda feels much the same way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed Emotions","review":"Well Jane is definately easy on the eyes and the opening scene is nice.

I own the E4c model, and since I've misplaced enough flex sleeves now so that I no longer had any working pairs, I decided to order this replacement pack. Sure enough, there were 10 clear flex sleeves in the package--but only 3 of them fit my headphones! The other 7 are too large to stay on my headphone nozzles, so they are useless to me. So basically I paid $13 for ONE pair of sleeves plus one spare (which happens to be somewhat useful as I did have one orphaned sleeve remaining from the original pack). Not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zereba fence charger","review":"This is a horrid product. We returned it! The information said it would cover 10 acres.

Add to it the gratuitous amount of cursing, bad writing and a terrible premise and this movie was completely unwatchable.I can appreciate crude humor from time to time. However, this movie was nothing but crude humor, at its worst. There are really NO redeeming qualities to this film.I rented this from Block Buster, expecting it to be good.

I am a big John Cusack fan but this movie just looked too houckey to work. I was SO WRONG! We watched this on Prime for guys' night and we all laughed our guts out. I couldn't believe how hilarious it was. I would rate this movie 83 stars if I could. I was born early 70's. So the 80's were my formative years. This movie hit all the right notes for 80's references. Perfect. Outstanding. Beyond excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of stupid","review":"After reading the other reviews, I can conclude that I watched the over edited chopped up version of Hot Tub Time Machine. It was an On Demand rental un-rated....so, that is the version I am reviewing. I wanted to love this movie but it fell flat. One basic thing about a period flick is to at least get the custuming right, whomever did the costumes in this film screwed the pooch big time. I am aging myself here but I was a senior in 1986, and I nor anyone I knew dressed even remotely that bizarre. And the hair was all wrong too, especially for the girls. The story was kind of cute none the less, although very hard to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why????","review":"Positive two stars for selecting the Bollywood style colorful clothes and accoutrements and some of the music although they could have chosen more entertaining representations of the '80s (probably didn't want to spend the money).Negative two stars for just copying a well worn \\"going back in time\\" storyline that made no sense (not a requirement), implementing it with another alcohol induced night of juvenile plot and dialogue writing in which, I lost count at around 200 uses of a f word or it's derivatives. At least the script writers did not have to exert themselves on a dictionary/thesaurus for dialogue longer than four letters.Viewers that were hot for \\"Hot Tub\\" will also have their rebellious inner self fulfilled by \\"Youth in Revolt\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"better then expected","review":"If you grew up in the80s you'll enjoy this movie alot more .

I love that he took out that long coat with the cut up gloves that he is known for in the 80s. I love the movie it was silly but I enjoyed my self and I had a few laughs and thought they all did good together I think John Cusack is so accomplish with the serious roles he has been in since the 90s so to come back to do a silly movie was fun and surprising.

Its good from the beginning to the end...andalso bring back great memories of the 80's crowd having fun, being colorfull inthe choice of clothes and atmosphere. Most situations are fun, and as a bonus wehave Chevy Chase making appearances here and there.Had fun watching it...and will watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and not as lewd and crude as others said it was","review":"I enjoyed this movie a lot - I was in the mood for a comedy, and I got one. The other reviews had me worried it was going to be just nonstop sex jokes, something akin to the Scary Movie franchise, but it wasn't. A lot of people also commented on the cussing - sure, there was cussing, but not an inordinate amount. Wouldn't you cuss if you suddenly were transported to the 80s and had a series of crazy things happen to you? I would! It wasn't out of place.There were lots of fun 80s flashbacks and overall lighthearted comedy and I thought it was great. If you like the Hangover, or even the Police Academy franchise since it had that 80s feel, you'll like this movie, I think. I did! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing","review":"This movie was a big disappointment. I ordered for my husband's birthday and we watched it immediately. WE did not laugh out loud once!! We both love the 80's and thought we would appreciate that aspect of the movie but kept waiting for the movie to be funny. Nowhere near as funny as the Hangover and Superbad. CAn't believe the reviews it got on Amazon. Don't waste your money-rent it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot water","review":"I really like these slacker, dumb and dumber style comedies, and hot tub time machine did not let me drown. The plot was pretty basic with a little love story mixed in and a cameo with chevy chase. I think it was pretty good all things considered, but for some reason it is better the second time you watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A butchered DVD - a real shame","review":"This DVD was cut in a thousand places, almost totally deleting the subtle humor that was the mainstay of the movie as originally released. Changes like the elimination of the conversation where the friends decide to go to Kodiak Valley, substitution of a can of energy drink for a iPhone, and a different time travel sequence make this move a chopped up mess. The editors have destroyed both the continuity and integrity of the film. This is a real shame as the original release was actually very funny but the humor has been dumbed down on this DVD. I do not recommend this DVD at all, it is a waste of time. The original in the theater was fun, this DVD is just confusing and banal."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible movie and not funny at all","review":"worst movie i have seen in a long, long time.

I believe I posted on Facebook half way through this movie that I would \\"rather be poking out my eyes with hot pokers than watching this movie.\\" The movie begins on a slightly mediocre note and proceeds to go down hill from there.I will say that the casting was surprisingly spot on, throwing John Cusack back to the era when he was very popular and successful. Rob Corddry is simply disgusting. It's sad that this movie, which had some potential to be witty and fun, like Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion simply fe1l back on 13 year old boy humor and mom-sex jokes.My recommendation: don't just skip it, run screaming from this torture device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal","review":"I found this movie insultingly bad. A promising initial plot idea was ruined by weak plot development, and one of the worst scripts I have had the misfortune to have heard.

This movie is a crude, dumb, corny, not even remotely amusing paycheck for failed comedians (watch for Chevy Chase saying reading from the cue cards occasionally as the Magical Guy who Happens in the Pointless Plot near the Hot Tub!)And what a portrait of humanity. Three losers (Nick being the worst of them--he's not convincing as \\"the wild man\\", and judging from his embarassing acting ability maybe that garage/suicide attempt wasn't such a bad idea) who are getting into their late thirties are pining for their teens (is it a coincidence that these guys grew up in the 1980's?) and go back to a low rent cottage where they originally partied hardy. While seeing a Poison concert!There was maybe one laugh.

Unfortunately it's under science fiction genre; thereby just giving it a bad name. Utter waste of time. Boring loser characters and drivel as a storyline. So much better entertainment out there.

Eight bucks poorer."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Good to Have Friends","review":"This tale of friendship between three guys and a younger nephew that accidentally get sent back in time through a hot tube accident. Hilarious as the premise sounds, its a good tale of friendship or bromance.They are stuck in 1986 and have to re-live some bad memories they had previously experienced. They desperately try to find answers as well as avoid changing the future. In the end, what happens, happens but there are enough twists and comedic antics that keeps viewers enjoying it.This is a guy movie with brief nudity and the ladies may not take to it. I found it enjoyable and the moral is whether your life is miserable and heading towards a dead end or its a success where you are filthy rich, you'll always need the bonds of friendship and love from friends and family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Funny","review":"I expected this movie to be ridiculous & stupid and was pleasantly surprised. It's not intellectual humor, but we laughed out loud quite a few times and we're pretty picky about movies. I do think it's better for someone over 29 and under 55 - most of the humor and fun in this movie comes from the 80's flashback. If you sit back and relax instead of trying to pick it apart for accuracy (I'm usually a geek who will Google whether or not that particular Walkman would have been released in the time period they are claiming), you'll probably enjoy it.It's silly, stupid, fun - kind of like the old National Lampoon movies (the Chevy Chase ones, not the awful contemporary interpretation of NL). It would be fun to watch while sitting around with a few beers with old friends who remember the time period also. A drinking game or two wouldn't hurt either. For once I didn't regret paying for a money before it came out on HBO or Showtime."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's pretty good","review":"It's pretty good has good laughs I just wished when they went back in time they would have had to go back to high school and come back home to there parents but its really good.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought it would be better....","review":"I was really excited to see this movie, looked pretty funny. Well i rented it. Didnt like it at ALL. It really isnt funny, maybe a couple of funny scenes, but most of the movie sucked.

Keep in mind that some of my all-time favorite comedy films are GHOSTBUSTERS, BACK TO THE FUTURE, MEET THE PARENTS, 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN, ANIMAL HOUSE, BLUES BROTHERS, ANNIE HALL, IT'S A MAD MAD...WORLD. Recently, I loved THE HANGOVER, which leads this revitalized genre of group bromance comedies. This HOT TUB TIME MACHINE is utter nonsense, from beginning to end, and I warn you not to waste your time or money on it. Flimsy script, poor direction, poor pacing, forced sex humor (for juveniles)"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Wonder Social Etiquette is in the Toilet!","review":"Screened this movie thinking it would be a fun, nostalgic 80's flavored comedy. Instead, I watched a lame swearing contest between John Cusack and his co-stars. Nothing in this movie seemed fresh or original. In fact, it wasn't even that funny. At least when the comedies of the 80's glorified drugs, sex and drinking they did it with a little less profanity and the scripts were coherent. These days you need to drop the F-Bomb between every other word in order to be \\"edgy\\" I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"A New Low for John Cusack","review":"John Cusack once had talent and a promising career. Now he not only stars in, but apparently also produced, this appallingly stupid, vulgar, and unfunny time-travel comedy.You know you're in for a long ninety minutes when you get one dog poop and one human piss joke in the first five minutes. And that's about the height of the hilarity on display here.Really -- if you like bodily excretions -- or you're almost horizontally drunk -- you might enjoy this horribly acted, written, and directed film.Everyone else with an ounce of intelligence, taste, or sobriety should steer far clear.This is truly one of the worst so-called comedies I've ever seen. I paid a buck to rent this film from Redbox for one night -- and I still feel cheated.Other famous whores on display here include Chevy Chase and Crispin Glover. I feel sorry for the lot of them, but not as sorry as I feel for anyone who finds anything to laugh at here.

I get through about the fourth song, and have to remove the offensive object from my cd player lest I burst into flames.

Any Cure fan worth their salt should seek out all the B-sides for the singles (Adonais, It Used To Be Me, Ocean, A Pink Dream, Home, etc.) and record your own version, replacing all the hopelessly noxious pieces (Round and Round, Numb, etc.) with the B-sides. What Bob was thinking when he left these off I haven't a clue - Ocean and It Used To Be Me are absolute masterpieces, and would have fit in with the theme of the album much better (just where are the mood swings, anyway?). With the B-sides, it's four-star, without two-star. Too bad he couldn't take a mulligan on this one and start over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Their weakest album!","review":"To this day, Wild Mood Swings is my least favorite and least played Cure album. They attempt to do dance music on this one, yet never really pull it off in most cases. Most of the album never grabbed me. Only The 13th was the best song. The '96 songs that were selected for '97's Galore are the ones I skip the most on that CD. Robert Smith's writing and the band's music seemed to have lost ground.

A few great songs, but on the whole unmoving, indulgent, and bland. The good ones are \\"Want\\" (predictable and uninspired lyrics, but an effective opener in the vein of \\"The Kiss\\" or \\"Open\\"), \\"The 13th\\" (a brilliantly successful experiment a la \\"LoveCats\\" or \\"Caterpillar\\"), \\"Club America\\" (a becomingly forceful and spry anthem), \\"Mint Car\\" (too catchy for words), and \\"Jupiter Crash\\" and \\"Treasure\\", which have a nice atmosphere that I can't quite describe. 'Moody' songs like \\"This Is A Lie\\", \\"Numb\\", and \\"Bare\\", however, just lie flat and quivering no matter how many times you try to listen to them and hear something special there. The superbly sequenced _Wish_ was apparently their last hurrah, unfortunately, but I guess they had to go so! ! ft eventually..."},{"rating":"1","title":"HMMMM......just not great.","review":"Robert Smith seems so brilliant just from watching the changes he has gone through in life. But really he is just a normal human too (for the most part, granted). He can be silly and happy.....good, he shows it. However, in Wild Mood Swings it seems to be much less poetic and inspiring than earlier albums like Seventeen Seconds, Faith, Pornography or Disintegration.I personally am not ever going to buy this album. I have heard it all the way through and it doesn't do much for me...I love \\"This is a Lie\\"....it is almost too true for lots of people. \\"Jupiter Crash\\" is alone and dreamy.

It just lacks the 'edge' that other albums from The Cure seem to have.Music-wise, it's a good album. The band is definitely in form on this release. But the songwriting is bland and at times uninspired.This was actually the third Cure album I bought, and I remember when I first listened to it, I didn't HATE it, but it simply didn't have the passion that such albums as Disintegration have.To me, Wild Mood Swings is, to Robert Smith, what 'Zwan' was to Billy Corgan. A collection of well-structured, but uninspired songs that are neither 'great' nor 'terrible'.2.5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Cure album? more like Worst album ever.","review":"There are no redeeming qualities to this album at all. The opener, Want, is not a bad song, but you've forgotten about it after track 4. Total crap. This is The Cure (namely Robert Smith) trying to prove to the world that he doesnt only write depressing stuff. But when he writes this crap, it's more depressing than their darkest material. Total garbage. I am a major fan of this band and this is the first album of theirs I refused to buy. Nothing they have done since is worth listening to.

If it's from the 80's, buy it. You can't go wrong. Both of these bands made wonderfull music in the 80's. If it's from the 70's or the 90's (especially the 90's) just don't waste your money. Yes, it's really that bad, and it pains me to say it because I really am a huge fan.

If you can afford it try getting \\"Three Imaginary Boys\\" and \\"The Cure anomalies.\\" I also recommend the cassette version of \\"Standing on the Beach\\" for side 2. Almost any Cure b-side will do more to fulfill your appetite for quirkiness and variety than this album. If it weren't for the somber \\"Jupiter Crash\\" and \\"Treasure\\" this one would have been traded back. \\"Wild Mood Swings\\" has zero sparkle and very little atmosphere.

There are a couple good songs, but nothing you can actually sit through without breaking to get some headache medicine."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great album","review":"It tires me hearing/reading about how \\"bad\\" WMS is, it really does.

Another thing... no one mentions the track \\"Numb.\\" It's a great song, as is \\"Jupiter Crash\\" \\"Want\\" \\"Bare\\", etc. al. Just b/c WMS doesn't have the line \\"Doesn't matter if we all die...\\" or \\"the wind is blowing like it's the end of the world\\", doesn't make it bad.

The author clearly did not do enough research on the Gods and when she did, she used it in such a way that anyone who has ever read mythology and liked it, would be in shock and disgust. Not only is the research in the mythology poor, but so in many other ways. It seems the girls and their friend are able to drive even when they are only in the first and second year of highschool, this of course, is illegal.

Can't figure out how to upgrade players (It adds XP experience points but doesn't let me spend them). Too many horns in the crowd, and everyone knows that horns at sporting events are obnoxious. Defense is worse then previous years since an attacker can virtually waltz through your defense since the tackling is so horrid and the automatic switching makes you take a player you may not have wanted and even if you take the right player he almost always starts out running the wrong direction you want him to. I wish that smart, quality players of real football/soccer would test these games out and sort out a lot of the goofy little problems there are. Also, incredibly difficult to figure out how to shoot!

Normal work conflicts that happen at every company are blown out of proportion and presented as enormous crises.The proof that Ms. Walton did not set out to tell the story of the Taurus is the way she half-heartedly discusses important design issues and then suddenly drops them to follow personality conflicts at Ford. Where is the discussion of the forward-looking integrated control panel? She tells a long story about how the headlight design causes grave conflicts among employees, and yet never even bothers to tell how the conflict was resolved. This book was a real disappointement for me"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy on the cliches","review":"I just finished this book. While it paints an interesting picture about the process to bring a car to market, the style Walton employs falls short. I understand the strategy to be the naive narrator (learning with reader how things work), but she uses too many cliches and poor analogies to make her point. I don't know how many times she said \\"Ugly as sin\\" or even \\"It was, like,\\" a few times. I'd recommend David Halberstam's The Reckoning or Comeback as well-written alternatives about the same subject, especially Comeback's depiction of the Mustang overhaul, than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mary Walton. Her View. America Does not work","review":"Ms. Walton has written a masterfull distortion of the American Corporation. This work of fiction is a focus on negative distortions of a company that , through Henry Ford, brought America into the 20'th Century and the Automotive Age.One Example. In her book, Ms. Walton focuses on how devastated the design team was that the Outside Mirror was mounted above the sheet metal in the corner of the door. Take a look at your own car. 99% of all cars and trucks are made this way. Ms. Walton. Give America a Chance. Thanks....The Taurus is still one of the best selling cars. I'd like to see one of the Foreign Companies Allow Liberal Writers like Ms. Walton the courtesy and Access that was given to her by Ford.

It is truly fascinating to learn of the scale on which things get done to make a car. It also becomes apparent why Ford, and perhaps other domestic auto companies, seem to fall behind in what the market demands. The DN101 team focused on, and aspired to beat a 1992 Toyota in their 1996 model year car.There are huge lessons in this book for anyone in business.While some have accused Mary Walton of focusing on the controversy, I think she portrayed the reality of such an undertaking, good and bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"If your are looking to work in the car business READ THIS BOOK!","review":"I have been an engineer in the automobile industry for the past twelve years and this book does a great job of describing what its like.

This book is subtitled \\"A Drama of the American Workplace\\" but it completely failed to capture the true \\"drama\\" of what it was like to work on this project. Right off the bat, it's very negative about everything and everyone associated with the project. It certainly failed to capture the strong sense of purpose which we all felt working to try to build this car. Also, while everything is the book is true and accurate, it's written in such a boring tone that it's a chore to read. Insignificant details are added (such as what a person ordered to drink ?), while other major parts of the story are left out. (Like the fact that there was another launch team working their butts off in Chicago !) Overall the book does travel through the story of how the 1996 Ford Taurus came to be. However, you won't enjoy the ride...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Car, by Mary Walton","review":"Very interesting study of the effort to bring a new car design to the showroom.

Because of this I feel my abs get the right amount of time, as some reviews suggest there is not enough time spent on them. I did this DVD for the first time about 2 years ago (was 20 pounds overweight) I can see results in 2 weeks or less. I have not exercised in almost two years now so once again I have 20 to drop and in a week I can notice a difference. I am here today to buy it for my daughter - she had a baby and lost the weight but she doesn't feel her tummy is as flat as she would like. This will kick her butt but she will have the results she wants!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great FIRM workout to add to your routine","review":"I love The Firm and Allie is my favorite instructor. This workout is fun and challenging. I enjoy it when I'm not in the mood to do high impact or heavy weights, but still want a great workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best writing but good history","review":"Although I think this book suffers from both an uneasy writing hand and some grim, soldierly editing, it is nonetheless good history. Once you get used to the (odd) style, you can follow an authoritative account of the U.S. Third Army through its training days and then its arrival in the European theatre, with the spectacular results that ensued. It is, as it should be, a rollicking sort of book, that recounts the events in mannish fashion. It's quick and (relatively) easy to read and adds something to our knowledge of this American hero of the Second World War who, had he had his way, might have started a third immediately! Four stars because it's worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I've been in EMS for over 20 years and when I took the CCEMT-P class I bought this book to read \\"ahead\\" before the class. The book read like any Paramedic textbook and did VERY little to prepare me for the UMBC CCEMT course, it had little to no correlation to the material taught in the course (the book is not recommended by UMBC nor does the book claim to be a part of that course, but the name indicated to me that it would be relevant). It doesn't go into enough detail of the \\"advanced\\" parts of the CC scope and spends a lot of time reviewing things that if you haven't already mastered you probably shouldn't be preparing for certification at this level."},{"rating":"1","title":"An elementry crtical care book","review":"This is a good book to peek into the world of critical care.

This book is an excellent product for those looking to learn about critical care transport. Critical care transport is certainly a different animal from everyday EMS.

Granted, if books and coursework are created by different groups they may not match up conveniently, but I found myself constantly referencing my other texts to supplement what I was reading in this book. Many grammatical errors were found as well. I was frustrated in reading the text as I continued to find reapeating sentences and paragraphs, while it lacked important detail in other areas. There are lots of clear tables and figures, but they often lack great explanation. Overall, I would suggest another route."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"This book was pretty good. Basically I'd like to echo the other favorable reveiws for this title. A lot of good info for those learning game development.Also, something another reviewer commented on. Another reviewer stated that 99% of games for the PC do not use OpenGL on the PC. This could not be more wrong. Just about every game released for the PC gives you an option to view the game using Direct3D or OpenGL. Every major, and most minor, games programmed out there are programmed in both OpenGL and Direct3D. So anything learned about OpenGL is definately relevant."},{"rating":"2","title":"A deeply moving memoir in tune with the rhythms of music itself and its influence on society","review":"The Velvet Lounge: On Late Chicago Jazz is a memoir of author and English professor Gerald Majer's experience growing up in sixties and seventies Chicago, amid troubled inner city neighborhoods and jazz-club oases of lightning-beat sound. Contemplating both jazz itself and issues of identity, culture, art, race, and politics, The Velvet Lounge captures both a wistful look at the big picture and vibrant memories of star music players such as Jimmy Smith, Gene Ammons, Sonny Stitt, Sun Ra, and more.

The best part of it is the cover, which features a photo of great Chicago tenor Fred Anderson. Unfortunately, the book does not live up to its title, \\"On Late Chicago Jazz.\\" The book is \\"on\\" the author and his stream of consciousness musings and memories tipped off by a reference (often circuitous) to a Chicago jazz musician, or a musician that played there frequently. The book is a huge disappointment, because with all that needs to be said about the purported topic, little is. The book has its moments, but for the most part is a precious, narcissistic rambling of tangents and digressions; worse than Ramblin' Jack Elliott or Henry Miller at their most tedious. In pukka, it's a flat out drag, daddio. If you want some knowledge on late Chicago jazz, for now you're much better off buying a Delmark CD (or 2) and reading the liner notes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken Glass","review":"I ordered this item and apparently the claw was too heavy since witin a couple of days of displaying it the claw fellFitz and Floyd Glass Menagerie Craboff.

While Joss Whedan may be skilled at dialogue and conversation in TV shows, I found his efforts at it here to be weak ones... the book does not flow properly. On the plus side, the art here is pretty good... but with bad scripting and even worse story, it's just not worth it.

Later, a formidable villian attacks the X-Men and students within the mansion. While I was unfamiliar with this story, other reviews have noted it is a retelling of the Cerebro plot. The artwork is again excellent in this volume, featuring several intricate double page panels and buoying the sometimes confusing story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Hardcover","review":"When I read Astonishing X-men vol. 1 ''Gifted'', I was amazed.

Also there's a band called Massacre (Bill Laswell on bass) that improvises everything they do and it just kills. Bill Frisell's Trio Live with Joey Baron and Kermit Driscoll is stunning as well, but this Addition by Subtraction album sounds like lame noodling and the bad part is one can tell that all the parts were worked out ahead of time.

Well after that first visit I've been back four times, so I'm seriously addicted to this fascinating country and it's inhabitants. The moment I'm out of the airport and into the bustle I'm totally at home. Unlike lots of other travelogues William Daymple's book gives the same feeling of coming home, of feeling at home in India.

Emmet and his daughter Barbara have an incestuous relationship of long standing which has been kept secret from Constance. Barbara is also having affair with a young Noah, being sponsored at Harvard Law School by their neighbor, retired Judge Hampton, who is sleeping with Noah's mother.

Still, I must admit to some amusement at the intensity with which other reviewers here are attacking this weak effort. It should be noted that this novel was published just after Sanders' death, and it is possible that he intended to work on it more but was prevented from doing so by ill health. Alternately it's conceivable that his declining health may have kept him from tapping some of his usually delicious ideas and left him with a potboiler that rarely bubbles. The Sanders style is here, but muted. A final McNally novel is scheduled for this summer, so let's keep our fingers crossed and hope that this one is closer to Sanders' usual standard.

Shame on the author for throwing many of life's ugly aspects into one book.

It captures the essence of the early Black Metal Movement. Most of the tracks are great and some of them are rare or previously unreleased. The only track that sucks is Emperor-Moon over Kara Sher due to its complete lack of sound quality. The track by Abruptum - De Profundis Mors Vas Cousumet is the most evil track ever in my humble opinion. Hear it for yourself and you'll see what I mean.Raudt og Svart by Arcturus is a different more raw version than what you will find on Aspera Hiems Symfonia.Kingdom Comes by Mysticum is a very powerful hymn that will surely kickstart your evening :-)You'll find 'Dead' as the vocalist on both of the Mayhem songs whose voice I prefer over Attila who appears on de mysteris dom satanas.You just can't lose with this album because it's a true classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"multi use book","review":"a book to use beside your dictionary in understanding contexts of words, as well as a book you can pick up and study through a chapter on one particular theme. an excellent investment for beginners through to intermediate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Modern Spanish Grammar: A Practical Guide","review":"I got both the workbook and the textbook.

When this system first came out there weren't a lot of options for replacement wiper blades. The only replacements I could find were from the GMC dealership, where they charged an arm and a leg! ($60+ for a set to be specific!) Bottom line is these Bosch 443 ICON's fit my 2007 GMC Sierra with NeoForm wiper arms no problem! The only reason I am giving four out of five stars is that on the passenger side of the windshield the right edge of the wiper blade loses contact with the windshield ever so slightly.

The blades came with a single connector already attached that did *not* fit the standard hook style attachments on the SLS. I exchanged them for RainX Lattitides which cost less and fit right away out of the package. I noticed that the Lattitudes came with several replacement connectors, one of which was identical to the one used on the Bosch blades. The Bosch blades I purchased were unopened, so I assume they just come this way from the factory. Inexcusable for a $50 pair of blades.

Nowhere is there a hint that the Indian people were fighting to protect their own homes and their own families. They are merely shown as vicious savages. Balanced stories of this period of history must be read to children.

Edward and his mother were scared because they thought Indians might attack, sneaking through the militia.I was scared reading the ending, but when it was over I wished there was more.This was a good book for 8 year olds or older, because of some violent things.

Published in 1942, in light of history, it is a one sided view of the war between Germany and Russia. The Germans are evil and commit atrocities against the peasants, which was true, but the fact that the Russians were equally as brutal is not in evidence.

The UK version of the album is mostly mixed and consists mainly of the Sasha mix and I think this is what appealed to most of us. A combination of Brian and Sasha back then was God-like (and still is now sometimes). Any prospective buyers of this CD should remember that this was the first effort and debut albums are usually experimental.. personaaly I don't think the following two CD's were anything like as consistent but IMA would be a worthy debut even now.

A must have for your electronica collection. BT designs wonderful soundscape much in the way an architect would esign a skyscraper. He puts down a framework beat and melody and than pulls out the sonic trick bag to build upon it. The result is a beautiful tower of multilayered music. This guy is the real deal kids. A shame radio doesn't have the guts to put him in rotation as some of his tunes could be considered pop oriented (think blue skies, Remember). This CD made my spirit sour! You can tell Brian puts a lot of inner emotion into his music. He does it successfully, that's why I gave it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"ESCM is the BT to have","review":"I agree with the reviewer who said that _ESCM_ was the disk to have. It feels more polished and complete than IMA does, but perhaps more like a pop album at the same time. IMA is dream-house, not pop.

It reminded me of \\"Crimes and Misdemeanors,\\" the film by Woody Allen, wherein each character represents a philosopher (the blind Rabbi is Aquinus 'the eyes of god'), and this book is similar. I tried to figure out which philosopher was represented by each character, and how the interaction propelled the protagonist. The plot is fast paced and flows well.

While not forgetting to add interesting beats, and samples to the mix. This isn't you basic hardcore loops here not at all.

Their quirks are on full view, and they just let go. Bjork is the vocal centerpiece, but if you want to hear her sing all the time, she has her own solo stuff, this is the band's music. Good old Einar's ramblings about Diesel and lobster make this music truly different from traditional pop music. I think the highlights are Tidal Wave, Speed is the Key, and Water.

Much of the music we listened to in the 70's and 80's - even now - grew out of his efforts. This movie is awful and is not a reflection of this man's life. Gram did not even have a beard, for God's sake! I looked forward to a movie of his life - this is not it. Someday, someone will make a decent movie.

What this movie should have been is a telling of Gram's life UP to his death!, and then quickly work in the \\"burning\\", all this bitching and fussing, lying and chasing, come on!,what an insult to a man's mark left on the music world, This mans life burned at a pace few of us can comprehend!

The 1.3oz spray should last long enough for me, considering I truly enjoy it, but it's not the best for wearing every day, all day. I wear it for dinners and ceremonies for work... it works well and doesn't quite have the knockdown power that would make it unattractive. I appreciate the maturity of the scent as well.So at the least, this poorly written review should say it's great, and not too strong... I wear Polo Black for Men by Ralph Lauren for fall, winter days, I lovePolo Blue By Ralph Lauren For Menfor spring and summer mornings because of its fantastic clean smell, and of course, DOLCE GABBANA THE ONE BY Dolce Gabbana For Men for nights out... so I guess if you have smelled these you should appreciate that this might work for you too, but for goodness' sake, go smell these before you buy them... a place like Sephora can be your best friend before investing in cologne."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Everything was there as promised.

This book contains no secrets, but merely erudite opinions about very commonly visited sights and attractions. The book is tiny and lovely at first glance-- it might make a pretty gift, but it is in fact hard to read because the type is light and tiny, the paper translucent.It is not really a guide book, but more of an introduction to the possibilities of Rome.

The album's title exemplifies the music itself: it's simply too good. Each song infuses the elements of what makes The Sugarcubes: fun, corkiness, idiosyncratic behavior, unique rhythms, beats, and harmonies, sometimes abstruse and profound lyrics, and eerie, soft, and melodic singing (and sometimes wailing). At the end it all turns out into some wild rollercoaster ride through the corky and wild world of The Sugarcubes. I have been a Bjork fan lately, but now i am even happier that i can get back to Bjork's creative and musical roots by listening to the Sugarcubes. I recommmend this to anybody whose a fan of Bjork, or anybody that's interested or curious in hearing a new twist to punk/pop music."},{"rating":"2","title":"**BEYOND WORDS AWESOME!!**","review":"...And absolutely STILL the BEST I've ever heard in my life -> A definite **POW** \\"experience\\"!!

Come with an open mind. Challenge the limits of your music taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"gorgeous madness","review":"Life's Too Good is an astoundingly original record. God knows what they were thought of in Iceland when they first started out. It holds so many moments of perfect pop music, be they edgy, mellifluous or surreal. Bjork contorts her voice even more than she has done in her solo career. 'Birthday' is the high point in this regard. While the goonish ramblings of Einar Orn made subsequent Sugarcubes albums unnecessarily patchy, his contributions on this, the debut album, come off as inspired and spectral commentaries on sideburns and stuff like that. Its not to be dismissed lightly. Imagine a bunch of loopy 1980s Beck types isolated in the North Sea making music to make the halibut boogie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good deal","review":"This is a great watch.

The cam action clamps for securing the gun tend to shave plastic but a little time with the file took care of it. The worst thing for me is that with a right handed gun the stand is backwards. With the drawers facing you it holds the gun with the barrel to the left, placing the ejection port and your view of the bore on the back side.

It offers a tasteful and refreshingly different approach to the way most anime series end. Instead of ending with a huge battle with high fatalities this ending foccusses on phylosophical journey of Shinji Ikari and the reason for his existence. This episode is deep and meaningful and a nice change from the stereotypical anime.It is obvious that Shinji Ikari aswell as many of the people asscociated with NERV are an emotional wreck. Now that the angels are defeated Shinji find his own reason to exist his own purpose in life.

That wasn't a story!","review":"Okay, I thought NGE was generally a good series with its high points and low points. I also had heard that the ending was sheer brilliance, which was true in a sense. For those of you who are wondering, the first episode on this DVD is really the final episode of the series, the other two are just an unexplained entrance into Shinji's mind. My god the kid is such a woman. He's obviously never heard the phase \\"Deal with it!\\". Sure he's got deep seeded mental issues, but he is by far not the most psycologicly tormented character on the show. So I guess my main point is why do we care? I would've been much more satisfied with an ending that actually explained the many interesting little secrets of the show. But to each his own I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good series - but only 3 episodes per dvd...","review":"This is an good example of a truly amazing anime being treated quite badly on DVD. Why only put 3 episodes on the last six discs when you can easily fit six episodes onto one disc. As usual it is money, I hope this is not the continuation of the anime trend on VHS when they only had 2 episodes per tape...! Anime fans will buy this whatever - and publishers know this and use it.

If you're looking for an explanation for the ending of this series, or in fact ANY of the imagry in the series, you won't find it.And if you're waiting for an explanation from the 2 movies, don't bother. \\"End of Evangelion\\" is just like the series, brilliant until the ending (brilliant enough to watch, just beware).

Second that the Baker Estate apparently existed in trust without any actual heirs/owners, and that the lawyer with control of the estate didn't just get the papers she wanted and had access to, but constructed an elaborate plot to get a researcher to basically steal them from her--please.

It's easier to control than the wax strips, you are able to put it exactly where you want it without the guessing. I absolutely recommend this product if your a do it yourself waxer! I saw another review that said it doesn't come with many strips, but that is because they are reusable.

Sometimes if something comes too easily it is not as rewarding. I think they might've been featured in Rolling Stone (ouch!) way back in the day (probably right after a long article on Michael J.

I work a lot with a pencil, and the darkened rules now compete visually with pencil lines. But I also find them distracting with blue inks and fine lines. I will, when I have a moment, post a photo showing the difference between the two line colors: it is rather dramatic. For now I am using another brand of black notebook -- I don't think it's fair to mention their name -- which has retained the faintness of line that Moleskine used to possess. Still, I must admit that I have become so accustomed the size and shape of Moleskines that the added width of the new notebook continually throw me off: it doesn't fit in certain coat pockets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Purchase","review":"I know it is a little expensive, but the Moleskine line of products are well worth it.

I keep the Moleskine as a book to write down advanced math that I teach myself for later reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the Moleskine Large Squared Notebook for years: Hate the new darker printing on the squares","review":"I'm sad to say the new books are visually distracting with the move from faint squares in the old printing to dark squares in the new printing. I've sent a note to Moleskine hopefully they can do something for me. I really can't use the new printing style.Overall solid quality book, with great design expect for the printing. I prefer to use a mechanical pencil for notes, now the squares are darker than my writing. This really isn't usable for me any longer.

Then the fun stops!Home Maker is 3 minutes and 52 seconds long.Orientation Day is 3 minutes and 35 seconds long.Banana is 3 minutes and 18 seconds long.That does not include the credits after the cartoons or the commercials before the cartoons start. There are commercials to sell your children more movies that are longer than the minion cartoons. Universal should be embarrassed to sell something like this. It is titled as 3 MINI MOVIES and it should have been called 3 MICRO MOVIES.There are some games on the disk that you can play with your DVD controller and but they are pretty bad.

I happened to find this at the grocery store for $6.99--and yes, I snatched it up without looking at the running time. It does say on the back in about 4 pt. font size that the running time is 12 minutes, but had I seen that, I would have assumed they meant each mini-movie was 12 minutes in length.

Not bad at all just not high quality, of course. Had this set a long time now and although it doesn't get used a whole lot I've put several bits to work and it does well enough. Best thing is, I haven't lost anything. I think the magnetic feature almost draws me into putting them back. I tend to place bits aside somewhere so often I usually go looking around for them when needed again.Only downside might be that it isn't as compact as it would otherwise be if the bits were all packed like sardines in a can. Evenso the case is fairly thin considering all the magnet space and separate bit compartments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimicky case and a lot of bits sounded good, but really poor quality","review":"I received my bits in poor condition. The outer case had two cracks and was smudged so much it wasn't transparent anymore. The drill bits have uneven cutting points and the magnets that hold them in place are a joke.

One, \\"Virtual Reality\\", an excellent song which shows Rusted Root's full potential, is on the LP \\"Remember.\\" Two, the live versions of \\"Send Me On My Way\\" and \\"Cruel Sun\\" sound exactly like the recordings on the LP \\"When I Woke.\\" Three, of all the material they have released, \\"Big White Bird\\" is probably the worst example of the band's talent. This leaves only the song \\"Evil Ways\\", a cover of Santana's hit. They do an excellent job on that track (in fact, I like their rendition better than Santana's). So, this album is only for hardcore Rusted Root fans who wish to collect all their released material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for Rusted Root fanatics","review":"This CD isn't worth buying.It is only 28 minutes long. Two tracks are available on the original CD's. I didn't think that Evil Ways was anything special. Big White Bird isn't one of the better Rusted Root tunes. The only thing of interest is the slightly extended version of Cruel Sun (it is 10 minutes).Note that this CD also comes packaged with the special edition of the Rusted Root live VHS tape. It comes in a special box, big enough to fit both the CD and the tape. If you are a Rusted Root fanatic, that is the one to get. But be careful, not all versions of the video tape come with the CD.If you are looking for an introduction to Rusted Root, get When I woke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Axe!","review":"This is, by far, the best guitar I've ever owned!

While the US was occupying itself with Nirvana and grunge, the UK was turning out masterful works by Blur, The Charlatans, Happy Mondays, Primal Scream, The Stone Roses; not to mention a whole group of talented second tier bands.I can't think of a release that sums up the entire British baggy rave scene as this one does. An incredible mix of groovy beats, chunky bass lines, funky guitars along with utterly unique vocals. Music that sounds as good today as it did back then, able to easily overcome so much of today's blandly overproduced stuff.There are so many outstanding tracks such as \\"Kinky Afro\\", \\"God's Cop\\", \\"Dennis and Lois\\", \\"Bob's Yer Uncle\\", \\"Step On\\"...Wonderfully produced by Paul Oakenfold and Steve Osborne.Emphatically recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unmemorable","review":"I bought this for Step On, and now I find even that song to be annoying.

It worked perfectly! However, the Kindle version leaves out the word \\"Selah\\" from the Psalms while the computer-projected version behind me included it. I didn't feel that was a big deal anyway since some 'experts' teach that Selah was a musical notation that means 'pause.' [...]I found the navigation very easy to use after the initial opening-which was very confusing. Undaunted, I did a 'Go to' to 'Table of Contents' and the navigation changed to normal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"The authors should realize that this is a different book given its complex structure. If you are in the New Testament and need to go back to the table of contents the \\"go to table of contents\\" should take you to the NT table of contents. Same idea about the OT. It takes too long to get to the desired location.Second, the pages should be more like the paper pages. At the top of the page you should see the BOOK and chapter you are currently looking at. The numeric location at the bottom of the screen is useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to navigate/unsearchable","review":"I wish I could type in the scripture reference I am looking for and it would pop up, but this format of the NIV Bible doesn't work that way. You have to go all the way back to the Table of Contents and scroll through the long list of books until you find the one you want. Then you have to scroll through the long list of chapters until you find the one you want. For at church or in a Bible study setting, this version is terrible. It would be faster to flip through an actual printed Bible to find the scripture you're looking for.

Not even a mention of them in this guidebook. Obviously, this small volume can't cover everything but it manages to include a dog park, the Mack Sennet stages (historically interesting, but just a box), a Masonic temple that's also a plain box, and several places that are mostly obscured by foliage.

I tried to stick with the book (I always try to finish a book no matter how horribly it starts out) but I put this one down right after her old husband showed up. This book just seemed like a very unrealistic fairytale. I also got very angry with this author when she had her characters having unprotected oral sex.

I thought it was going to be something different like the great novels, \\"PROMISES BEYOND JORDAN,\\" or \\"LUST OF THE FLESH.\\" This book, 'ANOTHER MAN'S WIFE,' was very disappointing.

The relatioship between Alex and her children was not developed, but all of a sudden they are calling him Daddy. Yani immediately weakens at the touch of Jarrin who had abandoned his family, broke the law, and is still on the run. What bothered me most was the dialogue between supposedly successful, educated, professional adults. At times the dialogue between Yani & Asia was downright crass.

Glenn and K.K. fire off some sizzling guitar work, while Rob Halford(with some help from the studio) lays down some great vocals. However, Ian Hill begins his descent into mediocrity here, but for the most part his bass lines are effective and well-played.

First problem with it is all the wasted pages in the front part and the rear, things like how to buy a bass, stringing it, tuning it, standing, buying an amp. Gee every book you buy repeats this stuff. If you split these pages out you find a core of about 150 useful pages. The second problem is, it lacks how to read notation and get the rtythmn. It needs more examples of counting out the rhythm using words or mnemonics, aka Kodaly, or Winslow Dallin based. Once you get pass the examples of whole, half, quarter notes, these are easy, this info just drops off, i.e. as soon as the notation starts to get tough it quits. I have not counted out the pages but I am guessing only about a 1/3 of this book is meat, those other pages could have been used, filled, with practiced sheet music with mnemonics.

This is not designed to put on a stand and play the itemswithin it! It seemed to be pretty much something to be carefully read studied, and then you go to the bass and play. The print is sosmall and some cases the various pages are not used efficiently. The content is awesome, writing style is easy to understand.If this thing were double it's size, I think it might be the best thing ever. Remember read it study, then go to the bass or find a copierblow each page and then it's ten times more useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very complete","review":"I just got started on this book, looks like it will keep me very busy for a long time. If I don't learn something from this it will be my fault for not reading and taking it in. I have to admit I haven't listed to the CD yet but am really looking forward to learning from it. I like the way it is set up that you don't have to start at the beginning and read it all the way through from there, rather the sections are labled so that you can jump around and geth the help you need in each area."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great alround resourse","review":"I got this book to refresh my skills after putting my Bass down for a while and I was right back at it thundering away at lick in no time thanks to this book.

I love Patrick's straight-forward approach and sense of humor. While I haven't looked at many other bass guitar books, I like how this one uses music, tabulature and the grid to show what to play. The initial/basic exercises are great for a beginner like myself, and make of lot of sense in the learning process. The CD is helpful, but it keeps playing straight through from one example/track to the next. I might need to change the settings on my computer or CD player, but I think it would be better if it stopped after each track so I could manually play the tracks, one-by-one, and look at the book at the same time to see exactly what is being played. Hopefully, when I become a great bass player, after using this book and practicing a lot, I will be quoted on the cover :) right up there with Adam Clayton."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Book to Learn Bass","review":"This book should be coveted by all who want to learn how to play the Bass, as well as by those who want to strengthen there knowledge.I have had this book for over a year, and I have also purchased other book, DVD's & scoured the net for information on playing the bass.

It has greatly increased my understanding about the bass. The cheat sheet with basic chords and scales has proven invaluable.The author has a great sense of humor, which makes any book more fun to read, and consequently, a joy to learn from. Everything is here; from the basics to matters of individual style. There's even a chapter about buying the right bass for you.I highly recommend this book to beginners, and to those who have been playing a while and want to go a little further."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bass book i've read","review":"This is a great book to get if you're just starting to play, or even if you're more advanced. It goes step by step in very concise, simple lessons. Even if you get stuck or don't understand something the people at Dummies are extremely supportive.To give an example, I was stuck in one part of the book or didn't exactly get something, and I e-mailed customer support at Dummies. They must have got in contact with Patrick Pfeiffer (the author of the book) and he actually called me on my cell phone and explained everything to me! It's one of the nicest things anyone has done for me and I was quite blown away by it. So if you think you'll have an interest in playing bass, I would not hesitate to buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"I just reviewed Hal Leonard's 3-in-1 bass book, which I bought at the same time as this one (a few months ago), and my reaction is basically the complete opposite. I like both books, but now I'm talking about this one.The paragraph/semi-narrative style is great for learning when you're away from your instrument. But you'll probably find yourself wishing you had your bass right next to you to try out something new you learned.I'm a beginner to the bass, but not a beginner to music. Still, I sing and singers (especially sopranos like me) are notoriously lacking in knowledge of music theory. So I love finding out about some of the hows and whys behind the whats. It also has great quick references. Personally, I think that anybody could learn from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This really is the greatest book for beginners","review":"You cant ask for anything more for a tool to learn how to play bass.

Within minutes a brown coagulating scum started forming on the surface , which is typical with this product. Did the Leisure Time work ? - I don't know but there was no visible change. Does the Spa Flush work ? For all I know it was just mixing with the spa water I was about to drain but logically some of that was circulating through the pipes and jets so I believe it does do something.I am giving this 2 stars because I only used half the recommended amount so probably not fair to the manufacturer but the bottom line is that I will not be buying this product again and will stick with what I normally use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"My daughter really like putting these words together and what a great way to teach them how to spell and read!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but get better version","review":"I have the one that has 3 pieces the third 4 spelling.

The recordings were processed with one goal: to hide the fact that they were originally released on 78s.

Even using a dynamics processor and a multi-band equalizer I can't undo all the damage that was done.

Or perhaps if you have a hundred rental properties and don't mind if some stay vacant until the perfect tenant arrives. As a landlord with a small number of units and a somewhat tight rental market with low interest rates, I found most of the advice and forms in this book pure fantasy.

I found it less than entertaining. Through out the book the author preaches at you. I was not able to bond with the characters because of this. The author takes various time periods in history and uses them as a reason to preach on the dangers of guns and as the reason for gun control. She also preaches about the Vietnam War and I was very upset that she would make such a blanket statement as the soldiers that died, died for nothing. I agree that it was a war that didn't need to be fought by us I draw the line at any such statement about our service personnel.

The novel does a great job of decribing the area and its attractions. The story, however is trite and the writing style ham-handed.

Much like Steve Hamilton's Alex McNight series, Lewis demonstrates that he knows the northern Michigan area and history in great detail. The other settings of Hawaii and Singapore are also fleshed out in such detail that I assume (having never been either place) they too are spot on as well. Unfortunately, that is about where the positive tally ends for me. Not long into the book it became obvious to me that the plot and writing style was amateurish, lacking any hint of sophistication whatsoever. To make matters worse, just past the middle of the book comes the first of several of the author's political ideological rants.In the end, I was only able to finish the 'novel' by approaching it as a caricature or parody and enjoying a good chuckle over it's many inanities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn all about Great Lakes Shipping~!","review":"Ron Lewis is an expert in boats and shipping.

One: it was too short--I enjoyed the story-telling and most of the characters, and I wanted the book to go on more. Two, I needed more facts, more background. It took me a while to understand the relationship between the gangs, the police, and Tammany Hall. Once the connection was made clear, it made pretty good sense. I am a nitpicker though.

THE FIVE POINTS is a very detached look at the poverty of a New York town in the 1800s.

Indeed, many of the samples seem to come from Broadway movie musicals, such as the outro on the otherwise thrumming \\"Stop Motion Traffic\\" (although \\"The Art of Walking\\" is based around an a cappella riff). \\"Good Block Bad Block\\" gets a little thrashy, while \\"Quiet Storm\\" has a church-like organ and a horn fanfare inviting a funky prayer.

Some DJs just take themselves too seriously - not that this album isn't some serious shi*t - it is. And the music speaks for itself. It's a nice mix, and has got it's roots in deeper places - sometimes eerie and mysterious - always soulful.

I listened to It's It and thought, \\"What is this junk?!!!\\" I know these are remixes, but the songs aren't even recognizable. They could have put any Sugarcubes title to any of these songs, and no one would have known the difference. The only song that you can recognize as a remix is \\"Regina\\" which was remixed by the Sugarcubes themselves. I listened to this album over and over thinking maybe it will grow on me.

However, Neurosis comparisons are valid. Both bands rock the mid-tempo and represent with long, repetitive songs. I love both bands and in my opinion the difference between them is a matter of non-stop brutality vs textured composition. Isis comes at you head on with crazy chuggchuggachugga stylings that make you want to break stuff. Neurosis has that brutality but they'll mix it up with some other tricks now and then.

I paid $10.00 for my copy. For me the main advantage is the books small size , which makes it useful to leave in my pocket and use to revise basic korean expressions from time to time (while waiting for street cars, for example).The subtitle, \\"How to express 1,000 different ideas with just 100 key words and phrases!\\" is just misdirection. The book is organised into 100 sections, each of which contains at least 5 or six PHRASES and additionally vocabulary with some 10 to 20 words to learn. I made that well over 1,000 words and phrases with which to express around 1,000 ideas.There is no organisation in this book that would help anyone to begine learning Korean, but as an \\"additional resource\\" it is useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many spelling and misinterpretations!","review":"There are way too many misspellings in this book for it to be useful. The romanized spelling for pronunciation will have the reader speaking incorrectly but even if you know how to read hangeul then this will still not help because many, many of the words are misspelled in hangeul too! It's like they typed up this book very quickly and didn't bother to edit it (or even read it for that matter). Some Korean sentences given in the book combine formal and informal speech in a way that would sound very rude to a native Korean so be careful! One sentence is translated as \\"I don't understand Korean\\" but actually means \\"I speak a little (or some) Korean.\\" That could be a confusing situation until the Korean you're talking to figures out that you don't really speak Korean! I think everyone would be better off if they just spent a couple of dollars more and bought a secondhand grammar book that has recordings with dialogs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fossil Men's Watch #BQ9245","review":"The watch arrived promptly but it does not work consistently. it was a gift for my son and he reports that it stops running every few days."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly packaged","review":"This watch would have been really nice but it was poorly packaged.

Why? Well, one reason is that it doesn't read like a typical \\"stuffed full of magic dragons and heroes on quests\\" story. This book is a lot deeper than that. Another reason is that this is a fantasy author with a clue. Someone who has a purpose beyond just telling a predictable story. The story is entertaining (even though it moves a little slow here and there) and the narrator is incredibly real. He's evil, sure, but he is definitely not a cliché. He is very complex, and he makes you really understand why he chose his path. You really can get into his head and identify with his choice. You also see a lot of the tension between his original goodness and love of beauty, and his choice of an evil career. He is definitely one of the most memorable characters I've seen in a long time. Go Llewelyn! I'm eagerly awaiting the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Harry Potter - Modesitt on downers!","review":"Publishers Weekly described Enemy Glory as \\"a sort of Harry Potter on downers\\". It comes endorsed by heavyweights such as Samuel R. Delaney and is promoted as \\"a new fantasy saga in the dramatic tradition of George R. R. Martin's A GAME OF THRONES\\". However, given the plotline, I'd describe it as \\"Modesitt on downers\\", rather than making any comparison to George R. R. Martin in any way!ENEMY GLORY has taken me at least a month to read - it's one of those books which, when you take it up, you soon find yourself putting it down again, and picking up the local paper or the TV listings magazine. Either that, or you're forever flicking forward to see if it looks like it'll improve.I'm surprised at myself that I finished it. Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah.","review":"I read this book yaers ago when it came out in hardcover. I thought it had the coolest cover so I took a chance. Never again will I judge a book by it's cover. One of the worst reads ever. Stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I disagree that this is well written or somehow superior fantasy. It is narcissistic; the author has NO idea how to write in the first person, blathering from moment to moment until it made my teeth ache. Llewelyn [now THERE's an unusual fantasy name] is a grating character, and not deep enough to warrant following so closely. I agree with the reviewers who found this a morose and gloomy wallow, and the ending is infuriating! George R R Martin, Elizabeth Haydon, Elizabeth Moon and Lois McMaster Bujold ALL write vastly superior fantasy than this. Avoid this one unless you have a prescription for Prozac and need a sleep aid."},{"rating":"1","title":"self-absorbed","review":"Dense, self-absorbed, tiresome language. If the author happens to be about 20, and this is her first effort, then she may show promise, once she gets some true life experience and isn't quite so full of post-adolescent self-involvement and angst. If she's over 21, or at the most 25, and writing in the vein of evil-is-so-tragically-glamorous and resonant with deep meaning, then she should get a life. Especially in these times.Fantasy/sci-fi writing can, and has been, wonderfully filled with meaning and beauty. It's one of the more under-appreciated art forms. For a brilliant and meaningful counterpoint to this author's writing, see novels such as Ursula LeGuin's, which are filled with humanity, warmth, imagination, tenderness and meaning. I was, in an odd and silly mood, briefly taken by the title -- how offensive, boring, and what a waste of time the content was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly rich piece of work","review":"What an amazingly rich piece of work! Llewellyn's world is so real, the writing so lush and poetic! I'm just blown away by the breadth, depth, and quality. I initially put off reading the book because I felt daunted by the size, but after the first page, I was hooked."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANNOYING First Person Point of View","review":"I struggled to complete this book, eventually lost the will to do it, and read the end, which I have to say ranks up there with the WORST I have ever seen. Why do authors do this? First person [writing everything from the author's point of view] is hard to do well, even by experienced, talented authors. From what I can see, Ms. Michalson is neither. The endless droning of what is happening moment to moment made my head rock.I can only suggest that it is offensive to end a book with \\"here's the end of one of many stories.\\" The series doesn't warrant another book, though I suspect the market will be subjected to at least one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album stinks","review":"Wow. This album is awful. If you are just getting into Phish, and you are thinking to yourself, \\"Hey, I really liked 'Billy Breathes' and that 'Bouncing Around the Room' is pretty cool, too...maybe I should check out this Dude of Life/Phish CD,\\" just stop right where you are, and slowly back away from your computer.

I have every album and many live tapes. I have seen them countless times live. That being said, I must say that this album really stinks. The Dude of Life can not carry a tune at all. His voice is annoying. What were these guys thinking? Please, if you don't have any Phish albums, DO NOT start here. I took a good friend to a show and a week later he bought this thinking it would reflect his experience of being at a show. He threw it in the garbage. I had to convince him that this was not a Phish record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Like Evan below, I bought this CD because I thought it was a Phish CD. It isn't.

Sadly though, his album is not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Phish music!","review":"Anyone who knows Phish music will realize that this is a far cry from their works.

Very monotonous...and if you've heard some REAL Phish, then you'll be glad that the Dude is not part of the actual band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why oh why did they stoop to this?","review":"I could list any number of wrong things with this album- from Phish's lack of musicality to the Dude of Life's lack of singing voice. Let me start by sayng that the Dude of Life is responsible for guiding Phish to some of their loonier places in the first two albums (although none of his lyrics appear on the later ones) and some of that lyric voice can be seen here. Unfortunetly, it is set against a back drop of poor music by Phish, clearly missing the lush arrangments of their other songs, and even ripping off songs like \\"Chalkdust Torture\\" at some moments. Added on to that is the Dude of Life's animal-slaying i-sound-like-a-skinned-cat singing voice which is painful to listen to at best. Leave this one on the shelf, and save yourself some cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like free jazz.....","review":"It seems that some people have missed the point. This is NOT a Phish album, this is a Dude of Life production. Phish may have lost a bet to play on this creation, but it still displays their talents.

STAND CLEAR!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pollack Can Draw, But Singing Ain't His Thing","review":"This album features Phish along with their long-time friend, Steve Pollack (a.k.a. The Dude of Life). Pollack draws all of the illustrations on Phish's merchandise including thier albums. He also is a regular contributor to the lyrics of Phish songs. On this album, Phish tries to utilize his wacky, slightly insane, style in order to create a unique sound. Let me tell you, if your looking for good instrumental music, here it is; as long as you can tune out Pollack's horrible voice. If your looking to buy your first Phish CD, don't buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"not like phish, but great anyway","review":"Ok, this may not be phish, but it's still an awesome album.

In fact, after listening to a song or two I went to my computer to start searching online to explain how this album even exists. My hunch was that it might have been one of those contractual obligation arrangements with a record label when one or more of the members was in a really bad place in life.However, I think it is more likely a favor to their friend the Dude of Life. You can tell it is phish in the background, and the lyrics are tolerable at times if you can look past the Dude's voice...you can hear a number of references and even chord progressions that point to some kind of homage to the Beatles...Lucy in the Subway being one obvious example.If I had paid for this I would be thoroughly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"this doesn't belong in the 'music' section","review":"i could have made a better album by recording myself playing harmonica while farting. if you want to listen to good music that has some humour/a unique sound go get a some zappa albums or maybe some primus, if you want to be a faux 'hippy' then stick to phish and their mindless work with artists like \\"dude of life.\\" this album really has nothing positive to offer, i've tried so hard to like this album for almost 2 years now and couldn't bring myself to take a liking to even one song. it's hard to believe that a band that's recorded such landmark albums as junta could disgrace themselves by recording this cd. a definite DO NOT BUY."},{"rating":"2","title":"finally a book that covers organic textures step by step","review":"With a million and one books on 3D model creation its good to finally see one that covers the other half of the equation -textures!Bill takes you step by step through the process of texturing his Freaky Frank model, unravelling the mystery of organic texture creation with ease.All required files are included (unlike the first print release)although I found it a little strange that the cover photo was created in Deep Paint, while the tutorials use Photoshop and the CD includes a demo copy of BodyPaint.

The Tide & Moon (even Sun angle) features are pretty handy, & great if your doing anything such as a sailing trip, to a hike in the woods.

More problematic is the fact that the watch has dual time and when mode switches to the alternative time display, the other buttons will easily adjust the time with plus/minus 15 minutes. - Now when I think I am looking at the real time I am actually looking at the alternative time without being aware of this. - This has caused me to miss appointments/transportation. - I have found no way to turn of compass and dual time, and for me this makes this watch unusable. - I will trhow it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too thick, hard to read, tide data very coarse","review":"Probably the best thing about this watch is the look.

The production is a natural fit to the tight and rootsy musicianship and compositions. Contemporary country blues (with an emphasis on blues) at it's best. As a guitarist, Cale was a primary influence on Clapton and early Dire Straits. Clapton was so impressed with Cale's writing abilities that he covered three brilliant compositions, Cocaine, After Midnight and the terrific I'll Make Love To You Anytime. Cale did 'em better. J.J.

The author is incapable of holding any semblance of intrigue or suspense past the first paragraph in most of the stories. I typically enjoy a suspenseful story line with interesting characters, quirky plot twists, and a surprise ending. I found none of that in J.P. Taylor's Murder Over Dinner.

Still, a very, very solid collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The sin of success","review":"This album kicks, with wide-ranging compositions, tight performances, steel-driving percussion, blood-pumping syncopation, rollercoaster vocals, and a good dose of fun. Post-punk at its best. We-were-here-first Sugarcubes purists will of course claim it doesn't measure up to Life's Too Good, but you see that same attitude with every edgy band -- as with every album after Murmur, the REM amen-corner prophesied the apocalypse. Don't buy the hype. If you're not interested in being uber-cool, and you just want great music, this record is one of the best. Buy it, listen, and enjoy. If you're not a critic, and not interested in fan-club honors, give it a listen. Those Icelanders, they do satisfy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joyous, yet, but I'll stick around for better","review":"This is a happy, fun CD that'll probably put you in a good mood, but unfortunately it lacks the unique spark of Life's Too Good and falls a little too far into shallow pop at times. While songs like \\"Leash Called Love\\" display Björk's fantastically funky vocals and tunes such as \\"Hetero Scum\\" and \\"I'm Hungry\\" are rather endearing, it seems much talent has not been used. Einar's sexy voice is used almost solely to be the \\"weird guy in the background\\". Wish he could sing a little more like he did in \\"Blue-Eyed Pop\\". This CD is definitely worth buying but not a particularly serious or memorable effort, save for a few songs. Use it sparingly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Piporro, Oscar Pulido","review":"This is a fun romantic comedy that thankfully never takes itself too seriously.

It'd be like reading a headline twice.Where's the hook?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Admirable statements performed with unpolished passion","review":"These songs are both quite good, with Roger's trademark powerful lyrics and vocal performances. If Roger were as inventive in his choice of musical textures and instrumentation as he is lyrically, his work would be undeniable. \\"To Kill the Child\\" is a powerful anti-war statement, as bald as a proclamation of the connection between the shared corporate and state interests in the invasion as could be made. Roger does not resort to poetry here that leaves room for misinterpretation, and I consider that a strength. The risky arrangement of \\"Leaving Beirut\\" is innovative and effective, and the long spoken word story is mesmerizing. However, both songs suffer noticeably from hurried production and an over-reliance on conventional blues/rock sensibilities. If only the music and mix were as risky as the words..."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"Roger Waters does not diisappoint.

Definately not a book for a teen who plans to keep her baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the Facts, Ma'am","review":"Williams-Wheeler's book is a plain English guide to everything a teen needs to know if they become pregnant. It encourages girls to educate themselves, decide on an option, and act without delay in a situation that could easily be paralyzing. It opens with how to determine whether you are pregnant, then moves to who to tell--and who not to.The book is comprehensive, giving all the options for dealing with teen pregnancy, and a step-by-step guide through each. It also covers after-care for each option, then stresses preventing a subsequent pregnancy--from abstinence to all other forms of birth control. Each chapter contains stories from girls who have experienced pregnancy--from age 12 - 22. Some were heart-rending. I appreciate that Williams-Wheeler urges girls to continue their education and to take care of their bodies.An excellent resource for a girl in a bad situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Than Informational","review":"Dorrie Williams-Wheeler has written the best guide to help teens and young adults with the choices and obstacles when faced with an unplanned pregnancy. She shares real-life stories that will help encourage anyone when faced with this situation. Mrs. Williams-Wheeler has also provided excellent resources that will lead our young girls and young women to trusted people who can help them regardless of their situation. Not only the young ladies, but the young men can learn a lot from reading this book.Although there are plenty of choices, she emphasizes the importance of making the right decision for you. Prevention and abstinance may be the best, but when an unplanned pregnancy happens, knowing who to turn to and where to go is most important. I wish this book was written when I was a teen, or when my own children became teens.Definitely a book that is needed for such a time as this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great first read when you're pregnant","review":"This book is a quick read. It's a great place to start after the home pregnancy test results are positive. It presents a very non-judgmental approach to dealing with some of the harder realities that today's young woman may be faced with [ie what to do when a casual relationship led to the pregnancy]. The best part of the book are the stories of various young girls, in their own words. This book also has some really good references for a pregnant girl, regardless of how she wants to handle the pregnancy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to get the height needed and durable","review":"I have a set I have been using for more than 15 years and they still work perfectly. I especially like being able to length the legs which takes only a minute or two and I can have the working height I need - a real back saver.When I first made the legs longer by one adjustment section the legs would no longer collapse neatly inside the top but when I later moved the legs by another section to get a better height the problem went away. Delightful surprise - it is the little things in life one comes to appreciate over time.The ease and speed of setting them up and their compact size for storage or transporting them is what makes them my favorite sawhorses. They also support a normal working load very well.I tried to think about how I would improve upon the design but I could not think of anything to change."},{"rating":"1","title":"very unstable and heavy","review":"The whole idea behind portable sawhorses is that they are supposed to be portable. Sure these legs fold up, but the pair of them with a 2x6 mounted on them is heavier then my compressor! That wouldn't be bad if their weight was offset by stability but it isn't. They have a tendancy to slip and rock when heavy work is put on them or there is any movement of the supported work. This makes them useless as far as I am concerned and they ended up in the jobsite dumpster."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"i loved the cd sooo much! i could listen to it over and over and over again. i just want to say that Christina has an amasing voice and that she looks beautiful on the cover. i also want to say thanks to my mom and dad for buying it for me and for buyingme all her other cds. i love the cd and i love all her other cds, so i think you would love it too!ITS GREAT!If you don't get it your gonna be sad that you missed out!I LOVE IT!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Silly, Impossible Reviews....","review":"\\"Just Be Free\\" was only released today.

Much to my dismay, I soon found out that this album is nothing like her other works; it's AWFUL! A highly annoying dance beat theme throughout the entire CD (don't get me wrong, I have nothing against dance music, but this was just aggravating), mixed with a pre-Reflection Christina who seems to be forcing almost every note. If even the artist of the album advises against buying it...trust me, it's not worth the cash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HAHAHA!!! Don't make me laugh!!!","review":"C'mon, one has to be more pragmatic and dispassionate point of view when writing a review... The album really is terrible, believe me... The only thing that can instigate me to buy this album is the cd cover... Even Christina Aguilera's fans will be disappointed by the lack of tune in the songs...By the way, her name is spelled as C-H-R-I-S-T-I-N-A, not CHRISITNA...Sorry to say this, but you would really have to be damn gullible and credulous to buy album. It's a letdown..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christina Aguilera Says \\"Just Be Free\\"","review":"Although Christina Aguilera did everything in her power to stop this album from being released, she couldn't stop it, and although I love Christina and I don't want anything that would endanger her career to be released to the public, I am glad she couldn't stop this from being released. I love this album. The songs are great. I am thrilled to hear a younger Christina singing fun, innocent girlie songs like this, instead of the more mature and racier \\"Genie In A Bottle\\". This was back when Christina was innocent and it's great to have the opportunity to see this side of her, how she's innocent without necessarily being a 6-year-old-girl, like when she started singing. I love Christina and just because she says so, I will just be free. Hope you enjoy this album as much as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Early 90's","review":"I decided to download the tracks to this CD before actually buying it. Good thing I did. Anyone who wasted their money on this cd, I feel bad for you. It sounds like a cd composed of all early 90's tracks (\\"You Make Me Happy\\" for example). I mean, sure songs like that were great back then, but now... I think you see what I'm saying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Be Free","review":"I hate every song on this album, its awful and she knew it. I feel sorry for her, because other artists don't have to show their earlier work. Of course she's grown as an artist and person, and her views and tastes have changed. Demos aren't supposed to be incredible, its to give labels an idea of your ability. This shows that she has a nice sound, for a 14-15 year old, and a pretty face. It all worked out, and if you supported her before her earlier work came out, you still should. This isn't new material."},{"rating":"1","title":"She is free alright with bad music!","review":"This cd is not going to sell well to the general overall thought of this cd its ashame that they even spent the money to put this cd out on the selfs.

Her next cd should be amazing and everybody has there down time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christina Fought to Keep This Out, So Why Buy It?","review":"This album is just a bunch of demos and recordings that were made to get Christina signed to her label. They were all made when she was around 14 or 15 and her vocals are not as good as they are now. This album was put out against Christina's wishes and does not represent her talent in any way shape or form. So basically, this is just a filler, capitalize album put out by some greedy people who use to be associated with Christina trying to make some money. This is not her work at all and shouldn't be considered to be by anyone of her fans. Every song on this album sounds alike and doesn't show Christina in the way that she should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely DISGUSTING","review":"This is a horrible album, if you can CALL it an album. Don't get me wrong; Christina's voice isn't horrible in it. It definitley isn't as good as on her two following albums, but it's not bad. It's just untrained. What makes this 'album' horrible and repulsive is the style of the music: CHEEZY! It's horribly repetitive in its tackiness...each song is pure torture.But the crown jewel of this sad excuse for an album is the Spanish version of \\"Just Be Free.\\" We all know that Christina has Latin roots. Hey, her last name is AGUILERA for pity sakes! But this song proves that she hadn't had ANY coaching on pronunciation or rythym for Spanish words...it's laughable at best.Please don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR CHRISTINA....

Yes the beat could have been different but the words are so beautiful and Christina's voice is very beautful, she sings in this album with a passion and she even wrote the words so of course I gave her all the stars that I could give her in this rating. I think that \\"Just Be Free\\" the song rather than the album of the same title was written when she was young and that the rest of the songs on the album were written in 2001. Since she's with a new record company after sueing her old record company she must have had a say wheter or not this album was released. She never had a cd released in fall of 2001 like she supposedly said that she would. \\"Believe me\\" is my favorite song on this cd. I'm probably your biggest male fan now.

The object of desire in this peurile flick is Jamie King, who finds herself caught between a pscyhopathic nerd (Schwartzman) and a two-bit con artist (Sawa).

They break off into large pieces and can't be chewed easily. They are very hard! I knew something wasn't quite right when the plastic packaging that houses the biscuits has \\"use only with adult supervision\\" all over it. Well, yes, of course we would only use them with supervision, but I shouldn't have to expect to scoop them out of my son's mouth to prevent him from choking. My husband will eat the rest as a snack and we will never purchase them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choking hazard","review":"I tried this for the first time today with my 8.5 month old grandson and within one minute a piece about the size of a half dollar broke off in his mouth and became lodged in his throat. He started turning off color and couldn't breath. I lifted him out of his high chair hoping that might dislodge the piece but it did not. I then tried the modified heimlich for babies twice and it didn't work. Finally, I put my finger in his mouth and had to go all the way to his throat to reach and grab the piece he was choking on. Thankfully that worked, but I still am freaked out - more than 8 hours later. My grandson means the world to me and I can't imagine anything bad happening to him. Don't buy these biscuits, don't use these biscuits."},{"rating":"1","title":"very brittle, breaks much too easily, choking hazard","review":"I was definately expecting a better product from earth's best.

About a couple minutes after my son sucks on the biscuit, it softens, and he's able to break off very large pieces into his mouth.

She really enjoyed it for about a minute before a piece broke off and she started choking on it. We had to flip her upside down and pat her on her back to dislodge it from her throat.

However, once I bought it and tried it, I no longer worry. These are very hard, so takes a while even for a drooling baby to soften it. I suggest anyone interested to buy one box and try it out. I bought it at Target for less than $2. What a great deal! I am going to stock it up for my baby (and me too.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definite choking hazard for teething babies","review":"My 1 year old has choked on these biscuits - he is old enough to feed himself cereal pieces, baby mum-mums, etc. but choked within 1 minute of eating these biscuits. They are hard enough that when they break off in a baby's mouth, the pieces still stay big and hard rather than dissolving like baby puffs or mum-mum biscuits, and the big pieces immediately get caught in the back of the throat.

She had been chewing for less than five minutes when a big piece broke and got stuck in her palate. We were able to retrieve it but it was scary and VERY dangerous. The first box I got at Whole Foods contained several cookies that had broken into pieces, I should have known better. Do not use this product if you have a young baby as it is extremely dangerous."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real review by someone with a real baby...","review":"These barley teething biscuits are very similar to the wheat ones by the same brand. My baby seems to really like them. They're hard enough that they don't break apart or dissolve too fast. I can say that, to me, the wheat are sweeter than the barley. I personally think barley anything tastes absolutely disgusting, but like I said, my baby likes both flavors. At first, I didn't understand why they were wrapped in packs of two, but then I realized that the first one is undoubtedly going straight to the floor, so a replacement is necessary or tears will ensue. Great product, good price, organic! So no worries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful","review":"I gave one of these to my 1-year old who only has 2 teeth but is teething like crazy. Less than 2 minutes later a piece over an inch long broke off in her mouth. I pulled it out and she was fine, but I didn't expect it to break that easily. She obviously loved the taste and feel because she grabbed the rest and started in again. They are incredibly messy but seem to serve their purpose. Definitely don't give these unsupervised, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choking Hazard!!!!","review":"I gave one of these to my 9 month old (with 9 teeth albeit!) last night, and he choked!! Of course I assumed they'd dissolve like other teething biscuits and didn't try it for myself first. Thankfully I was right there and by the time I had flipped him over and got him in position to try and get it out, he started coughing and crying, but I hate to think what could have happened if I couldn't get it out! If your baby already has teeth and can break pieces off - buyer beware. I tried it for myself afterwards and these do not dissolve very well. It took a while for me to dissolve it. I agree with a previous reviewer, all it's going to take is one death, and these will be pulled off the shelf. Thankfully my baby wasn't that statistic last night, but very well could have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choking hazard for 6 month old","review":"A piece of this biscuit broke off and got stuck to the roof of my 6 month old grandson's mouth.

This product should be taken off the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother With These","review":"These are the worst teething biscuits that I have bought! Huge chunks break off, unlike other, better quality biscuits you can find, like Gerber. Even for kids who are bigger and can chew stuff up better, the pieces are still too large to be trusted at all. Do not trust at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, choking hazard indeed!!!!","review":"This is more useful as a dog biscuit. It is very hard, which ok, if it stays in one piece it's good for teething. But as many other reviews say, when they suck and gnaw on it, it becomes soft enough that VERY large pieces break off and remain in their mouth. And these big pieces, once in their mouth is still hard enough that there's no way they can chew with their gums only. Just eat one yourself. This is just downright dangerous. Why would you anyone create a product like this for kids??? If you bought this, please just eat these yourself and not give it to your kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is a choking hazard!","review":"I chose these as a substitute for zwieback toast, which has apparently been discontinued. Gerber makes a very similar teething biscuit, but after comparing both, I found Earth's Best to be much healthier. My son LOVES these biscuits, but I will be throwing the rest of them away. For the second time today, he broke off a piece larger than a quarter after sucking on the biscuit for only about a minute. My son is eleven months old and does great with chunky food, but there is no way he would be able to chew these hard biscuits with his gums. I am thankful that I do watch him like a hawk when he eats anything, because this product is dangerous! I will not let my son have these again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Break Easy","review":"These biscuits are very healthy, but break very easy.

Leading Up by Lilya Wagner raises a myriad of questions, but supplies no concrete advice or examples on how mid-level fundraisers may implement leadership. Wagner says the same things over and over largely by quoting other sources. The result is a confusing array of leadership definitions, characteristics, and skills, but zero inspiration and ample frustration.The middle of the book, which promises a new model for leadership, instead gives such elementary information as descriptions of tasks fundraisers must accomplish and titles fundraisers may have. Wagner cites no case studies with answers or examples from fundraisers successfully leading those in higher positions or on their boards. The only transformation this book will produce is in your wallet. If you are a college sophomore majoring in fundraising, this book may be required reading. I'll give you my copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Personal Resource Book for Every Fund Raiser","review":"Dr. Wagner's book is a great personal resource for every fund-raising professional--particularly for those new to the field. The author takes one through a self-exploration process and includes the insights and views of other professionals. At the end of each chapter is a series of questions that allows one to reflect on the issues raised in the chapter, in addition to some case histories to consider plus tips on developing your skills.Dr. Wagner's extensive experience in fund raising and her teaching ability is evident by the way she has laid out each chapter that builds on a sound foundation. From one who has been in fund raising, this is a useful tool that would help any fund raising professional take the next steps for developing their leadership potential and skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leadership","review":"I appreciate how comprehensively this book covers the leadership topic in principle and provides the reader the means to understand and practice it.

However I find this CD, well, to put it in a nice way, cheesy. From the 1st track Reach, which is the cliched best friends can do anything type song to the last song, Never Had A Dream Come True, which already has too much airplay on the radio, the album lacks originality. Natural is actually an okay song, as are some others that I can't name off the top of my head. However this will appeal greater to fans of stations such as Radio Disney or TV Channels such as Nickelodeon that listeners to regular mainstream radio and MTV Fans.

Probably one of the only good songs on it is Track 13, \\"Never Had A Dream Come True\\". If you liked S Club 7's other CD and are expecting this CD to be like that... DON'T GET IT!!!

But the with the transition of written to e-books, the Murder She Wrote books -all that I bought, not just this one - leaves much to be desired. Someone should have taken the time to go through the final e-book and changed back what scanning did to the story! When words are \\"scanned,\\" they are sometimes \\"mis-scanned\\": the letters \\"r n\\" are sometimes scanned as \\"m,\\" i.e., \\"corner\\" becomes \\"comer\\". This is only one example of the MANY words that the reader has to supply when reading these books, because the publisher of the e-book didn't take the time to edit the final product. It becomes frustrating and diminishes the pleasure of reading the books. In fact, I bought several and read them but got so frustrated I refuse to buy anymore!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"My husband stubbled upon Manhattans & Murder and gave it to me as a gift as I am a huge fan of the TV series and of Angela Landsbury. Manhattans & Murder is written in \\"Jessica's\\" voice. So I was looking for more books to read and decided to try Martinis and Mayhem based on the customer reviews. I was totally disppointed. Couldn't picture Jessica saying the lines in this book. Plus, it didn't progress the way the other book did - she all of a sudden seemed to solve the case at the end. Not a recommendation from this fan of Murder She Wrote."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Confused","review":"I'm enjoying this book very much, very descriptive and very educational about the fog and the beauty of San Francisco. Have never been, but I know I would love to visit there. However, there is one thing that I found very confusing. When Jessica took a call from the Sheriff of Cabot Cove, Mort, he kept calling her Jessica or Jess, but in every other book I've heard him refer to her as Mrs. F. Plus he never seemed to be such a worry wart about her, but Seth is and he has been known to show some jealousy concerning George. So, was it Mort or Seth who called her? I get kind of bugged when mistakes are made such as this and aren't caught in the editing and proofreading stage.

An accomplished singer, song writer and producer she weaves together songs with a mature theme. She is talking about a woman who has been through life experiences, such as, divorce, single motherhood, and love the second, third, fourth time around. The grooves are laid back, funky and urban. She penned all of the songs, and does an update of her sixties single Girls Can't Do. Her voice is strong, soulful and sweet as molassas, but she can growl and soar with the best of them. This is her first studio cd in a quite a few years and well worth the wait. It is easy to see why this lady has lasted so long. New divas take note and see how old school soul is done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Again the Strings Cascade","review":"Mantovani has become synonymous with \\"elevator music.\\" Aside from the fact that about as many elevators still carry music as they do operators, this is cruel injustice. Arguably more than anyone else, Mantovani perfected a particular kind of \\"light classicism\\" in the 1950s and early 60s. The arrangements he commissioned were at once lush yet restrained. At the podium he was an exacting taskmaster, and his talented musicians rose to the maestro's challenge. The result, in this CD, is a dozen of his best-known covers--and this is Mantovani, not simply the eponymous orchestra that would later travel under his name.Duke Ellington said that there is, finally, only two kinds of music: good and bad. Of its kind, this is very, very good. If this is \\"lounge music,\\" then show me the way. I could lounge here for a very long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Orchestration","review":"Golden Hits is a very special recording. My wife and I heard a broadcast of Mantovani playing More, one of our favorite songs. We both thought it was the best rendition we had ever heard. His scoring replayed the theme using different instruments as lead. The different combination of instruments enhanced the beauty of the song. Unfortunately, we could not find a copy until I stumbled upon this CD on Amazon.This CD, re-mastered in 1996, is quality sound. It is as clear as being in the concert hall with the orchestra. Mantovani scores popular songs to sound like classical orchestration. In my opinion, his use of strings provides a full,robust sound.I highly recommend this CD, it is much better than I expected, and certainly better than the broadcast that led me to this recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Enchanting Music......","review":"Great music does not age, and like fine wine can only get better with time; Mantovani's music is a great example.This album is a collection of fabulous music, and contains the best version of \\"Summer Time in Venice\\" I have ever heard.I'm a very rich woman to have this CD and this kind of music in my collection, but in a world seemingly devoid of taste, I don't think many will agree with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mantovani Golden Hits","review":"This is classical Mantovani! A lovely relaxing instrumental CD of beautiful classic hits of the 50's and 60's. A very soothing experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully dull, cluelessly retro","review":"It's possible that someone out there might still find favor with the over-orchestrated, over-produced music here - the kind that was once commonly used in dentist's offices and elevators to soothe the listener's nerves. These days, while other retro music like Martin Denny can have an agreeably continental flair, Mantovani is just plain dull. This is music of the worst possible type: drained of personality and soul, where even the occasional more modern song (mid sixties) comes off as stilted. This kind of thing has long been replaced by easy-listening jazz; not even the uncoolest of the Star Search generation would be caught dead with this in their closet.This kind of dreck gives you sympathy for the poor listener whose musical background is so impoverished as to make this music an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Shrunk!","review":"Washed the shirt one time and it shrunk to an unwearable size.

The slippage was showing during Season 6, but there were still a lot of moments to watch. The addition of Michael Michele was horrible. She's such a lightweight actress, even being too wretched for ER. The Ballard/Falsone romance was pointless, and went against the grain of the show's earlier tone. As for Bayliss's bisexuality--the Big Man would shudder. And what was up with repainting the squad room blue? Or, as Pembleton would remark in the movie finale: \\"Cerulian.\\" Of course, we completists will buy this set, if only to recall how far this show fell from greatness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tim Sings Like An Angel","review":"I received this album as a gift a few years ago and it quickly became my favorite.

I tried this album because Housemartins member P.D. Heaton was also a leader of this group. Unfortunately, I found this album (Welcome To The Beautiful South) quite dull. Many other Housemartins fans obviously enjoy this album, so you may, too; however, you should definitely listen to this album before buying it. Musically, it is NOT like the Housemartins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Divine and perfect for anything at all.","review":"This CD -- brought to my attention in my early teens by \\"Sassy\\" magazine (remember that, U.S. GenX ladies?) -- has everything going for it.Songs so catchy that I have replaced my copy of this album 3 times because of normally fab friends stealing it from me. Lyrics so smart and funny that I have actually spent the money to replace it each time. And melodies so sweet and weird that I never get tired of hearing it.I think that this is my favorite Beautiful South album as it hangs together the best -- the songs don;t all sound the same, but form a logical aural progression through the course of the album. The dark lyrics are offset by the lush melodies, and the nasty humor is offset by the self-depricating light laughs.Enjoy this relevant, moody, funny album from an underappreciated band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twisted Little Stories","review":"I love this CD. I got it in the Nineties and couldn't put it down for a while. Each song is like a twisted little story that stays with you long after you listen to it. The lyrics are not only clever and catchy, they're also frequently funny. And the lite, upbeat, happy-sounding tunes defy the darkness in the lyrics--it's a winning combination. I thought of it today because I picked up a CD by a guy named Daniel Powter and thought, What does this remind me of? Then it hit me: Welcome to the Beautiful South (but not completely--more like the Beautiful South meets Macy Gray)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Album","review":"I like this CD a lot, but it's not one of those you can really listen to on the way to school and all. It's more of like cleaning up the house music. But anyways, there's a lot catchy and amusing songs. The lyrics are really original too. Every song is like walking in the mind of a loony tune. \\"Woman in the Wall\\" sounds like something from Edgar Allan Poe. There are songs about showbiz, politics, criminals, and of course, it even has those mushy love songs! I cant stop singing \\"I love you but you're boring\\" in the shower. All the songs are unique and entertaining. I must say, I've never heard anything quite like it. Frankly, it's bizzare, but in a friendly way. It's definately worth a listen. But if you're really going to buy it, I suggust you get the Japanese import. It's got some bonus tracks that are must haves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Software does not integrate well","review":"This is a well made product, but the software is a bit clumsy and does not integrate well. The first set of drivers caused it too crash Microsoft Word. The second drivers worked okay. The software was clumsy. When writing on a document, you could only write on what appeared on your computer screen. You had to then save the writing to the document before you could move down the page. It made it too slow to quickly move through a document in a meeting or other situation. The PDF document writing did not work well at all. After you marked on the screen, you had to save the writing as in Word, but when it saved, it ended up in a different place on the document. It was a significant shift.If you just want to take notes and transfer them to the computer, I would recommend it.

The documentation is absolutely horrible and believe me, I should know since I develop training for a living! There are 3 books that you have to surf through to get answers to your questions, which simply aren't there. The product itself seems to be fine, it's just figuring out how to use it...

I understand the title of this book is Beauty and the Beast but when the hero of the book is so overly obsessed with his ugliness it got pretty annoying. He can't possibly believe that the Heroine could actually like him and want to be with him so he doubts her and really studies her the entire time trying to see in her looks and expressions what the truth truly is. He also stresses over the fact that he just knows without a doubt that she will eventually take other men since she can't possibly be happy with him. It was just so annoying.The 200 pages that I read was so repetitive that I just totally lost interest. After the wedding, they make love, travel, get attacked, make love, travel, get attacked, make love, travel, and on and on.

Rather stiff for modern listeners, but interesting for historical purposes. The swinging, uptempo jubilee sound is represented well with The Kings of Harmony and the Mound City Jubilee Quartet. The latter really rock out with \\"You Better Let That Liar Alone,\\" which is somewhat of a predecessor of the uptempo style of the Golden Gate Quartet.

However, I guess I could have done with out the pee, fart, and picking nose antics between songs. I don't really know what I expected his personal life to be like but hell, he came off as a dork on the DVD. I wondered if they caught a sober side of him at all, which is a little disturbing thinking that many of the shots were of him and the others behind the wheel of the bus, driving. Anyway... Its well worth it if you want it for the music and stage performance.

Mr. Sickells is a very good evaluator of talent and does not zealously use a single method, but rather incorporates various techniques (sabremetrics, traditional scouting, etc.) in making his player evaluations. Since this book does a nearly-comprehensive breakdown of minor leaguers at every level in pro ball, I know that I'll have the upper hand in picking prospects when draft day comes. The only thing that keeps this from being a 5-star book for me is that it doesn't include MLE (Major League Equivalency) for each player.

I don't consider it one of their Greatest. Both CD's have great flow starting fast and slowing down for the last couple of tracks on each.

I remember owning a cassette version that dated back to at least the early eighties. This has all da biggest hits from da disco era starting wit da supa funky \\"Jive Talkin\\"- if dis song don't move ya, u must be dead! There is one noteworthy tunes that earns honorable mention here, Children Of The World-what great harmony singers these guys were! Sure, there's a lot of Bee Gees compilations that have been released since which might seem better (this one originally appeared in the late seventies, to capitalize on their popularity then). But Bee Gees Greatest is da one I grew up wit and they're selling here for a penny plus shipping-not a bad four dollar investment if u ask me."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE GREATEST GROUPS EVER","review":"WHEN YOU THINK OF THE BEE GEES, YOU THINK OF SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER(ONE OF THE GREATEST SOUNDTRACKS, EVER).

Glorious pop, each album: 1st, Horizontal, Idea, & Odessa. These are the essential Bee Gees albums. The collection here contains, of course, their later disco/bland pop period, and is, frankly, tiresome, especially when compared to their marvelous, quirky art pop of the late 60s. They were never quite the same after Robin split in 1969, and this 70s-80s stuff proves it in spades."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time Heals","review":"Fortunately time does act to heal most wounds, including those of Disco.

I finally invested in the CD and am really glad I did. I like this album because it has the disco stuff and also the love songs you can sing along to. This music is great to listen to in the morning while you are getting ready to go to work...it really gets ya going. I like to quiz my boyfriend as to who is singing what song..he is so silly he will never know the difference. I try to tell him, \\"trust me, there is a difference between them all..they all have different voices\\"...he just laughs.

Jeers to the packaging.","review":"I really like this set of Bee Gees music. I had the tape of it several years ago. I was dissapointed in two things about this set. First they put it on two CD's instead of one which makes it difficult to program my CD player to play only my top favorites of the set. Second is they cut short \\"My Love (Don't Throw It All Away)\\". My tape version had a bridge part of that song that they took out in the CD version. Go figure. It is not as if it would not have fit on the CD especially as they split it on two discs."},{"rating":"2","title":"for the money, it's great! i listen to it a lot!","review":"if you can;t afford the box set, this is the one you want. it's not as bad as everyone makes it out to be -- the quality of the cd is high, and although there are many tunes on here that i wasn't familiar with, i must say that they included ones that i love, like \\"nights on broadway.\\" as for the other tunes included on the disc, but not originally performed by the bee gees, those songs for the most parts were hits, and were written by the bee gees or barry gibb, so that's probably the logic for including them, considering that the bee gees might have performed them as a demo.once again, it won't win any great awards, but it has the hits that most of us 20-something disco fans think are pretty groovy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Fishing with Small Children","review":"I vividly remember an incident when I was little and dad took me fishing. Like any child getting the hang of casting I wasn't fully aware of where the hook was and managed to hood my dad right in the ear. Sadly he did not really want or look good with a pierced ear, but he was a good sport about the whole thing. When I came across these bobbers that's all I could think of. These bobbers are a great idea for young children who want to learn to fish. You use them along with the Rocket Fishing Rod which makes casting much easier and you can always transition kids to a real rod when they're a little bit older and more coordinated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good music but....","review":"My bad rating isn't for the music , which rocks - it's for the piss poor mastering !

It was a real cultural shock. The Lorca song with its contemporary approach and the exploration Tim Buckley was doing with his voice blew me away. For a young singer in his early twenties, one wouldn't expect such a mature understanding of song writing in avant-garde style as well as in romantic ballads like I Had A Talk With My Woman. Definitely worlds ahead of his time... a timeless musical statement."},{"rating":"2","title":"For more open-minded listeners only...","review":"IT's one of the most adventurous record of Buckley's. IF you look for \\"Tim Buckley\\" or \\"Happy/sad\\"'s romantic tinge you may be disappointed, but don't worry, you will soon find that it's replaced by the innovative, atonal yet impressive, stark yet brillant music. Best Cut: Driftin' and Anonymous Proposition. The lyric include romanticized sex, but unlike \\"greetings from LA\\", it's not as explicit, and are treated with beautiness. Also, Underwood's guitar, excellent. One week moment is the last track \\"nobody walkin\\", it seems to be suggesting his latter soul adventure (which for many is quite disappointing one)... but overall speaking you should try it, unless you are used to those rubbish pop nowadays.

While this one is spoken of as the canonical book since it was one of the first, it is inferior to Kreisman's latest revision entitled \\"Sometimes I Act Crazy\\". I Hate You Don't Leave Me suffers from all the problems already mentioned by other reviewers -- outdated information about the treatment, prognosis, and even mechanisms of the disorder, as well as being somewhat dry. The new book includes all the same information, but also describes the narratives of several very different cases of BPD; the new one does a much better job of helping non-BPD's understand the disorder, and of demonstrating the spectrum of behavior that can result because of BPD."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you aren't BP","review":"This book would be very helpful for those who just want more info about the sickness. It's right on and very informative. However, as I have BP, it made me feel worse than I already did. I hoped to find a way to deal wth this sickness, and it just made me feel crazy and hopeless. I received it on the weekend, and it really messed up my weekend. If you have BP, I wouldn't recommend it, because it's a book about things you already know about yourself, the way you act, etc. It won't make you feel good about yourself or justified."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated and Biased...","review":"Being Borderline and having read many books on the topic, I think I am in a position to say that this book is both outdated and biased. It references the DSM III which still says in it that homosexuality is a mental disorder. I found the book rather offensive. It makes us seem like we are manipulative on purpose. No wonder some therapists are scared to take on a borederline patient. I have been in therapy more than 15 years and am currently in a DBT group. This is the best therapy. Marsha Linehan Ph.D. is a goddess. If you want to find GOOD books on borderline personality disorder, I recommend: Lost in the Mirror, Walking on Eggshells, and anything by Dr. John Gunderson (McLean Hospital in Belmont, MA) and Marsha Linehan.Don't waste your money or time on \\"I Hate You, Don't Leave Me.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Stone Age","review":"On the positive side, this is the first book I'm aware of that delineates the difficulties of having BPD or loving a person who does. However, it is a dinosaur that has outlived its usefulness. There are so many effective therapeutic treatments and useful pharmaceuticals now available to treat BPD. This guide, while it deserves respect as a venerable pioneer in explaining this confusing mood disorder, needs to be put at the bottom of the reading list for anyone interested in obtaining BPD information. It is far too negative and antiquated. It makes it sound as if there is no way out of BPD. But there is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monsters??","review":"Far from being informative on the difficult to understand and treat illness called Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), this book , from the cover design to the back, makes BPD patients out to be violent, unpredictable, thoughtless, incapable of feeling true human emotion, terrible, socially withdrawn monsters, not people who have much hope for recovery. I was so disgusted with how they are portrayed, as I suffer with Borderline and Bipolar, that I am selling it back. This book gives facts (e.g, DSM criteria for BPD, which is slightly outdated), but portrays monsters that do not exist. Whoever wrote this should have their head evaluated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important to understand the underlying causes of BPD","review":"Although it's the first BPD book I am reading, I'm not finding it hopeful, although, but I highly recommend to anyone who wants to understand BPD. We can't counter respond to something which we do not know of the causes. The examples of real cases are a good read, not quick-fixes. Good read meant by me is we can study the underlying causes, by not jumping into the symptoms and the possible treatments. I think it is highly crucial for one who is really interested to understand BPD from scratch, whether if you're reading the first book or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"It seems as though the editor spell-checked this but that was all.

Nine months after our breakup my ex was dx with BPD and his therapist recommended this book to him, although he never read it.

I picked up this book thinking it would be an interesting insight to the disorder but was horribly disappointed. This book points an accusing finger at people suffering from BPD, makes them out to be \\"bad people\\". I do understand that the book was written some time ago, but realistically, the book is very misinformative. Don't take the book for a bible on the disorder by any means. You can't just assume when it comes to a mental disorder like BPD, it's just about as versitile as AIDS. I strongly caution anyone that desides to read any material on BPD. Given the misconseptions of the disorder people can be pit against those with the problem. I definately DO NOT recommend this book if you are looking for understanding in regards BPD."},{"rating":"1","title":"please read this review","review":"If you are truelly a borderline personality who is seeking information before treatment or you are new to treatment do not read this book.It is a very outdated view which is insensitive to the needs of BPDers and their families at a time when hope and faith is needed.I read this post intensive treatment and as a now diagnosed BPD meaning treated and considered successfully treated this book negates it.One star for pointing out fellow famous BPDers.But read this when you can look back...

Did the proofer give up on the book, too? My copy is from many years ago, so maybe the grammar has been fixed in subsequent runs...at least I hope so.

Two weeks ago I suggested to her I may have BPD. She concurred and I asked to borrow it again. This time I found parts of it helpful eg descriptions of certain mental experiences which I had always thought of as personal quirks/difficulties. One thing I strongly objected to was the constant use of the label the borderlinewhen referring to people who experience these difficulties .When you have no sense of self it is only too easy to pin your whole identity on a label,without having others do the same.I am ambiguous in my overall view of this book.Although I found parts of it informative and helpful, I was still left in tears at the end of it because of the gloomy outcome it suggestedI wouldnt recommend reading it to anyone feeling vulnerable.Great title though!......"},{"rating":"1","title":"In need of updating","review":"I have some borderline traits, and this book came highly recomended to me. I wasn't impressed at all. First, it simply needs updating to include newer medications and treatment options. That was a big thing that I noticed. The other major problem that I had with the book is that it seems much more geared towards people who know someone with BPD and not people who have (or think they may have) BPD. I walked away from the book feeling like I hadn't learned anything useful that could help me understand and work towards overcoming my extreme anger issues. Fortunatley, this is my second BPD book to read, so I did not walk away from it thinking there was no hope.

Just what Luke, Leia, and Han needed---another creepy enemy breathing down their necks and messing with the children's Jedi minds! This involves a hive-mind of ants---the Vong were a hive-mind of horrors, and there is little difference between them. They want to take over the New Republic's territory and make everyone do their bidding. Yawn.

It was not so much a mystery as a character study. I agree with the previous reviewer that anyone expecting a good mystery (such as The Rosary Murders or Death Wears a Red Hat) will be disappointed. Having said that, though, i still really enjoyed this book. I found all of the characters interesting (especially the Dellvechio family) and really enjoyed the way the author introduced them to us through flash back stories. I would have liked to see more of the familiar characters that we have been introduced to in the previous books but that's only a minor criticism. I also enjoyed the usual Catholic references; reading one of Kienzle's books is like going to Sunday school though much more enjoyable!

Director Crowley overlays all the silly, sordid goings-on with a palpable affection for his various characters, which makes the black comedy go down easier.

The worst thing that he ever did for his acting was to head to the States. I had just about lost hope in him when I saw Intermission. Now I know that he's a good actor, he just doesn't show it.In this film, Farrel is back to being an Irishman and he's joined by a delightful cast of other up-and-coming actors/actresses from the United Kingdom.

American f word profanity. They even doubled the usage in most lines. It was about losers who ran around beating up people stealing robbing and sleeping with one another. Even the \\"good\\" people were gross . . . . Even when the good people had bad things done to them it was gross. For example one girl was used by a former bf for money. It wasn't that she was just used like a lot of people in teh real world are . . . \\"taken for a ride\\". . . he did that, tied her up, and defecated on her chest leaving here there for days before she was found. You don't see this scene . . . you hear about it. It was just perverse. It is movies like this and Angela's Ashes that really make Ireland a depressingly sad pit of a place in my mind. And the weird thing is that these movies are about Irish written by the Irish.

The talent is wasted in this flick, and that is what disappoints the most. The dialogue and Irish accents for American audiences might be hard to follow, but there are always subtitles for those that get lost. Not much more to say on this one, just not worth the view.

Air's version is quite excellent and goes beyond the ordinary mixtape. They really set the mood for a \\"late night\\" chillout-including a range of artists and genres that blend together smoothly (and surprisingly-see the Cat Power-Minnie Riperton, or Black Sabbath-Nino Rota transitions).

They are drab, drudging, uncomfortable and bleak. Some of the songs sound like they belong in a low budget inde film. They are nothing like the Air that I know and have come to love. They could definitely take a look at groups like Thievery Corporation, and take some remixing notes. There are a couple good songs on \\"Tales.\\" \\"Le Long De la Riveire Tendre\\" is a beautiful soundscape in typical Air fashion, and the first track \\"All Cats are Grey\\" by the Cure is mysteriously dark and interesting.I bought this record without a prior listen.

Nobody, but nobody, rocked harder than the Five in the late '60s, and this album, recorded live on Halloween, 1968, at Detroit's Grande Ballroom, proves it. The group was actually politically active, too, which set it apart from, say, the West Coast psychedelic bands of the same period. \\"Come Together\\" is indescribably chaotic.

It's almost as if they can't hold back their enthusiasm, excitement and energy. The result is beautiful. Even the final experimental track rocks.

However, and this is speaking as a confirmed cynic of both musical politicians and political musicians, it has to be said that this is one of the very (very, very...) few occasions that a political rant actually adds to an album.Overall, the first side hurtles along at blistering pace - garage rock morphing into punk with a dynamic all of its own and the barely stopping between songs.

However, this probably isn't worth owning the whole movie. Part of the problem is that the novel is a little transgressive, while the film transmits none of this quality. E.g., in the scene where the satyr seduces the school marm, the book is visceral, physical, and erotic, whereas the film is timid, clueless, and uncomfortable. This film could stand a re-make today, but they would ruin it with overdone CGI."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic and Mystery","review":"This movie is a good for making you feel better. Tony Randall does a magnificent job of playing multiple roles in a single movie. Throughout the movie his character provides gems of wisdom that are as valid today as they were when the movie was first shown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seven Faces of Dr. Lao","review":"This was a movie I had scene when I was a kidand was so happy to find it at amazon..great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Sometimes you see yourself here . . .\\"","review":"Welcome to Abalone, Arizona, population: strange, and about to get stranger.And who IS the stranger, riding to town on a yellow jackass? We know that he's Chinese, and he arrives just as the townspeople are deciding whether to spend thousand of dollars on a new water pipe, or simply sell out and move on.This, by the way, is the last sane moment which you will experience until the final scene.I won't try to describe this through-a-dusty-looking-glass film, nor the novel from which it came. I first saw it in the theater with my parents, and was blessed enough to share this with my children, when that time came.Production qualities are pretty crude by today's standards, but back in the early 1960s they were state-of-the-art, thanks to George Pal and Ray Harryhousen. Featuring a stable of stars-to-be, this film has depth and an unforgettable lesson.It's great to see this on DVD, rather than fading to . . .oblivion . . !"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a cool movie!","review":"Tony Randall is in rare form on this.Enjoyed this movie a lot kind of reminded me of the movie,Adventures of Bullwhip Griffin with Roddy McDowall.This is one of my favorites also on hand are a whole bunch of character actors in this as well,like Royal Dano for one,some cool special effects too.I would recommend this movie a fun movie to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, entertaining movie!","review":"This is a darn fine little film. If you like it, get the book {entitled The Circus Of Dr. Lao} by Charles Finney. Also the writer of the screenplay, Charles Beaumont, wrote many of the classic Twilight Zone episodes, many of American International's Poe adaptations and was a superb short story writer as well. Tragically he died of Alzeimer's at the tender age of 37 in 1967. You should be able to find his excellent collection A Touch Of The Creature here on Amazon. Great stories well worth your time. Love Tony Randall in this movie. \\"Times may come and times may go, but no more circuses like this show!\\" Indeed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Movie for the Ages","review":"I first saw this movie when I was twelve and immediately built a cricket cage like the one Dr. Lao had in the movie. I even learned the sleight-of-hand trick the little boy did in the film. Thirty-two years later I have discovered the further depths of meaning in George Pal's masterpiece. If you buy only one movie for your child (probably not a bad idea) get this one. He or she will see \\"not the dust, but a universe.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Peice of Nostalgia","review":"This is a great film for the whole family and Tony Randall delivers the performance of his career playing all 7 faces. Whimsical, mysterious and full of fun. Not a whole lot of extras, which would have been nice, but a real gem from George Pal, the man that brought us \\"The Time Machine\\" and \\"The Wondeful World of the Brothers Grimm\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Experience 7 Faces of Dr Lao! ............or die deprived..","review":"Tears well in my eyes and something catches in my throat at every viewing. I helplessly and enthusiastically recommend it to anyone and everyone I care about. I've subjected my summer school classes and my sons to this special treat of the cinema shamelessly wiping away the tears as I watch the magic capture another devotee.A completely uncommon western. Food for the soul. Lessons for life at all ages. Tony Randall capturing your imagination in a role...roles! as he never did before or since. Barbara Eden early in her film career irrestibly charming. And a kid who will touch you as deeply as Jackie Cooper in The Champ or Shirley Temple ever did. All of this and more delivered by the golden age master of cinematic fantasy, George Pal.Well, what more could you want? Don't die, never having seen it. The sooner you see it, the sooner you can look forward to seeing it again and sharing it with your friends. YES! YES! YES!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quaint & Classic","review":"This is a wonderful film with Tony Randall shining as the mysterious Dr. Lao and much of his fantastic crew of seers, wizards, monsters, and Greek gods. This film works for both adults and children and was easily director George Pal's best work. Some people may complain of the somewhat \\"Cheesy\\" qualities in the production, but they really enhance this story of a sleepy Arizona town visited by Dr. Lao, whose circus makes the townfolk reconsider their small-minded ideas of life. Highly recommended!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"This VHS tape was not worth a plug nickle. My VCR is in working order, but as soon as I put this tape in it it got ate. Wasn't worth the money I spent on it. Live and learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do YOU know what wisdom is?","review":"This is a simple movie, yet it explores so many complex themes. Life, perception of beauty, prejudice, wisdom, greed, love, guilt... it steps around them all artfully and tastefully.Sure, this is a movie directed at kids, but I saw it with a child's eyes and love it today as an adult. I still always get tears in my eyes at the end scene.\\"I can do it...\\"Watch this film with the eyes of a child, and you will forever remember it fondly."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the five best ever made","review":"if you're looking for a great movie, this timeless classic has it all. Humour, pathos, emotion, plot, villains, even a chase scene (although the chaser is the Loch Ness Monster!). I have seen it about twenty times, and I have never failed to come away with a tear in my eye. I highly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"BE HERE NOW","review":"A wonderful fable. Timeless even though it is dated in its execution. Much more than meets the eyes here. Meaningful on many levels. Tony Randall is terrific (he didn't like the part -- or so he said).There's been word of a remake with Jim Carrey -- something he's said he wants to do for personal reasons. That would be great. Especially if the screenplay is a closer reflection of the sometimes edgier 1935 fantasy novel by Charles Finney.Is Dr. Lao meant to be Lao Tzu author of the Tao Te Ching? Seems so to me.See this -- if you can find it -- and ponder it's meaning as you attempt to find your best path and live fully, bravely in the now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for young and old alike","review":"The concept of one actor playing multiple roles in a movie is not new and is not always pulled off well, but Tony Randall does an excellent job of it in this movie, there's something in this movie for everyone, and it's a great movie for young and old alike, after watching it, you can't help but come away from it feeling good.............."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],x={key:0},N={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),b(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",x,"See more"))],8,M)):p("",!0)])}const W=d(C,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-ac8c5435"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/4.md","filePath":"people/4.md"}'),j={name:"people/4.md"},P=Object.assign(j,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
