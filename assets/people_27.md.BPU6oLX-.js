All I can say is that I bought this from Amazon.com and haven't regretted it. It is a great series, even the young adult book. It is also considerably cheaper that buying each of the books separately. The only disadvantage to this edition is its size. It isn't nearly as easy to carry around as the single editions."},{"rating":"2","title":"mild movie appropriate for young children","review":"This video told the story of Crockett in a easy way for young children (5-7) to understand. It was not realistic which is appropriate for that age. If it was too realistic it might be too scary and intense. Example: the talk to Davy as he packs to leave for the Alamo and discuss what will happen there but show no scenes. It is a bit hokey and a little on the simplistic side - again, appropriate for the younger children. It does skip through a lot of material with a little less explanation than I would have liked from the video \\"teacher\\". Also, I wasn't real thrilled with the misbehaving older children featured in the video story line but they reformed in the end. My son, who is not used to commercial tv, was surprised by the children's behavior (made him glad he homeschools! :-) but I watched it with him and we talked about this as well as helping bridge the different time periods in which the main character visits Davy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Improbably fashioned or at the very least annoyingly dysfunctional characters who are impossible to care about, with the exception of the wife, who alone seems to react coherently to the situations encountered, and predictable denouement.

This book is excellent. I've been a typographer and letterer for over half my life and I wish I had something like this 20 years ago. It covers many aspects of good logo design as well as using and modifying a font for a design. In my opinion the best part is when Mr. Cabarga goes into some detail about designing and creating your own font. This is an idea that I have been toying with for sometime and now that I have read this book I have a lot of ideas on how to get started. I couldn't recommend this book enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do as he says, not as he does","review":"The graphic design of this book is horrendous, and it has one of the most poorly designed covers I've ever seen. A lot of the examples inside are really goofy too, and really not something you want to imitate professionally.Nevertheless, after giving this book a second shot, I've found it really invaluable. Apparently it's one of the few books (only book?) out there that teaches you, step by step, how to digitally modify and create type . He has some great illustrator tricks and teaches you how to do different lettering effects. It's really broken me out of my comfort zone--before I was stuck using existing typefaces, and now I can pretty effectively knock out hand-done lettering."},{"rating":"2","title":"fonts and lettering in a nutshell","review":"The book is full of great information on type and lettering. Leslie Cabarga's writing style makes the learning process a fun one not a lecturing one. As someone who is obsessing over lettering form and style, I definitely picked up some great tips. My first attempt at creating a custom letter or font was bad, but this book showed me the right direction to take for my next attempt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an expert in his field","review":"I would not recommend any of his type books.

There are many illustrations and examples that prove to be very helpful. I'm a graphic design student and find this book one of the best I have purchased. The book goes into the history of graphic design and how just because something is new doesn't mean it is good. Leslie Cabarga shows how the basics of design are the best for structuring your own successful designs."},{"rating":"1","title":"No matter what you are looking for, this book isn't it","review":"Often the value of a book is based on what the reader is looking for but this book provides value to only a few (the other reviewer.)This book is poorly organized, it seems to go all over the place and there is no logical flow. With the different layout and design of each page it adds another level of difficulty in reading and following. Topics are not comprehensive; often it gives you only select tips. With background in the topic there is no reference for the tips.This book does provide some good tips. Only consider this book if you are a professional typographer, it assumes you have extensive knowledge in typography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Packed full of info way too packed!","review":"I assume this book has lots to give as far as advice and suggestions concerning logo design, unfortunately I could not get past the illegible and cluttered layout and take advantage of what the author had to offer. I think it is unacceptable to offer a book to graphic designers that has been laid out so poorly, the style is nether contemporary, boring nor exotic it is simply messy and chaotic.

I find it absolutely ridiculous that this phone cannot answer an incoming video call, nor can it initiate an outgoing video call, nor can it join an existing call (audio or video) already in session. If the phone did not initiate the call (i.e. if you didn't use the phone to dial or answer), you cannot use the phone on that call. Thus, the phone is absolutely worthless if you want to use it to handle the audio portion of you video calls! I know some people use Live Messenger for other purposes, but for me, the reason I use Live Messenger is to do video calls with my family... If I want to do an audio-only call, I just use a regular phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"story takes a fall and never recovers","review":"For the first 250-300 pages the story is rather entertaining.

Special K (drug reference), Spite & Malice (NOT rap-metal, great chorus), Slave To The Wage (awesome video), and Hemoglobin are all stellar. There's a lot of other keepers, too, which usually forces me to listen to the entire album. Three good CD's in a row, can't ask for anything more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really 4.5","review":"I was initially wary of this album because of the mixed reviews and my firm belief that no Placebo album could be better than Without You I Am Nothing. Well Black Market Music isn't better than Without You I Am Nothing, but it's certainly better than Placebo's much lauded debut (a debut of which I am fond but not sold by). The only questionable song on the album is \\"Haemoglobin,\\" a piece of very listenable musical and lyrical crap. So, if you like Placebo, go for it. I am enjoying the album this very minute."},{"rating":"2","title":"andro/rock","review":"the placebo boys are at it again, with their andro/rock. taste in men sounds like he wants people to be shocked in his bisexual tendencies(bowie, nin, manson, queen, many others). that being a side show, it is a gradual listen, first time i played it, i almost threw it out. you have to play it five times all alone to really make an opinion. it has its moments, but in all, it is pretty damn good. not as good as wyim, but still good. it is pretty hard to top wyin."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's alright, however WYIMN was far superior.","review":"This album is somewhat disappointing after the band's exquisite 1998 sophomore album Without You I M Nothing. It appears to me as if Placebo took a more commercial route here, recycling the same hook, along with their trademark sexual references in several songs, only this time it doesn't sound as emotional & convincing as it was on WYIMN. There are some solid songs here however (\\"Taste In Men\\", \\"Days Before You Came\\", \\"Special K\\", \\"Passive Aggressive\\", \\"Blue American\\", \\"Slave To The Wage\\" & the surprisingly good rap song \\"Spite & Malice\\") that make this album worth buying (& the four starts of course), however putting \\"Black Market Blood\\" as a secrettrack is really unnecessary. Also the bonus songs (The one with David Bowie + the Depeche Mode one) aren't included in the European version, just so you know. Overall an okay album which could've been much better. Maybe nexttime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank U Placebo","review":"I have to say that I love this cd. Placebo have certainly maintained their talent, uniqueness, and creativity. Taste in Men is just a great song to groove to, the whole atmosphere is hynoptic. Brian really sounds wonderful on this cd (he sounds great on the previous albums as well). Passive Aggressive is hands down one of the best Molko ballads ever done, this song really touches a nerve with me because the lyrics are abstract but very true. Spite & Malice is great, Justin Warfield fits in real nice with the Placebo sound and Brian's vocals. I can't analyze and praise all the songs because it would take too long, but Narcoleptic & Peeping Tom are incredible. My favorite track is Haemoglobin, the lyrics, vocals, guitars, and drums are very intense (especially the line \\"now my feet don't touch the ground\\"). Also, the hidden track Black Market Blood is beautiful. Cheers to Placebo, you guys are splendid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just couldn't get into it","review":"I bought this for a small group/bible study with some ladies from church.

Don't ask me which one. After awhile they all start to sound the same to me. Perhaps Ms. Simon is running out of original lyrics to write. However as usual, ad infinitum and ad naueaum Ms. Simon sings about How Great She Thinks She Is In Bed with the track \\"Better Not Tell Her\\". Then of course there is the ironic song \\"Waiting At The Gate\\" which is about a celebrity getting out of Rehab. No doubt Ms. Simon can relate to this well too. I give this album 5 stars because the cover shows what great work the hair, makeup and camera guys can do to a woman over 50."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carly breaks my heart","review":"Though \\"Have You Seen Me Lately\\" is not my favorite Carly Simon recording, it does contain some of my favorite Simon tracks. I won't list them all, but if I had to point to evidence of Simon's brilliance as both singer and songwriter, I would single out \\"Better Not Tell Her.\\" At the beginning, it seems as though the woman is just letting go of a past affair, even being a bit flippant about the whole thing. This changes with the bittersweet ending. If you want to hear what heartbreak sounds like in the human voice, pay attention to the way she sings the last line, \\"That I still...love...you.\\" It gave me chills the first time I heard the pain and hollowness in her voice, and it still gives me chills to this day. Those 5 words, barely sung, almost spoken, are so simple, direct and moving that they sum up everything we feel about lost loves and regrets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relaxing porch music , Breezey. Classic Carly stuff.","review":"I really enjoyed this cd when it was first released way back in Sept 1990. The Fisherman's Song, done with Lucy Simon and Judy Collins is bittersweet but at the same time it creates a peaceful picture of unrequited love. Her songs give \\"strength\\" to one's soul. I always get that feeling from listening to any of her songs. When you are feeling low, listen to this one and it will set you \\"free.\\" There is a We're all going on a Summer Holiday, kind of feel to her songs in this cd. It was a sweet escape without the calories. Thanks, \\"Dr. Carly\\", for writing all these healing songs for ladies everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of the best lyrics I've heard","review":"If you're a Carly Simon fan, this is one of the most unheralded of all her music but one of the best. The lyrics are POWERFUL and the music and vocals are classic Carly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has one of my favorite songs","review":"This album is Carly's follow up to her very successful \\"Coming Around Again\\" album (although technically, \\"My Romance\\" was released before this album). While it didn't quite reach the commercial success of the previous album, in many ways it is a better album. Her writing, vocals and performances are top notch. She lets her sense of humor (\\"Don't Wrap It Up\\") and playfulness (\\"Holding Me Tonight\\") come through in her lyrics. She performs one song with her sister Lucy Simon and Judy Collins. But perhaps my favorite song is the last track (\\"We Just Got Here\\") which is one of the most honest songs about middle age I've ever heard. This album holds up much better musically over time because the arrangements are a lot more acoustic than the previous album and Carly musicianship shines through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Practical Approaches","review":"Overall the book practical approaches for dealing with difficult situations and people.

And, most of the examples given were concerning sports.I even went through the book a second time to see if I could get more out of it, but just found the book lacking.

He writes for sitcoms, he writes newspaper columns, he makes films, and now he's created a riotous book. Winchell Mink is a fast-paced adventure unlike any other middle grade book, sure to keep even a reluctant reader glued to its pages. Well, not literally. The only glue in the book is in the binding, so the pages don't fall out. You don't have to worry about any glue seeping out and causing the book to stick to your hands. But in a metaphoric sense, Winchell Mink is hard to put down, and not because of the glue. Seriously. Only the finest quality glue was used in the construction of this book.Winchell Mink is a terrific story and not just fluff, as some children's novels tend to be. As a parent with two middle grade children of my own, I like to see stories that reinforce the idea that it's okay to be who you are and not worry about being something you aren't.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie ever!!","review":"Catch-22 is a great movie, and does justice to the book.

Seen through several perspectives, though there is a main character. All are struggling with the madness of war and each develops his own sanity formula. It's a movie that you can watch several times before catching all the nuances. The cast is something, too. The name actors all capture a facet of the personality types you meet in military service and carefully exagerate it so that they become charactures that develop a whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good movie, that could easily be adopted to our more recent wars.","review":"As other reviewers have pointed out, this movie is very different in content from the book. That said, the movie is true to the context and ideas of the book, and is done very well. I give it four instead of five stars only because it is a little to conceptual and abstract for my taste, but I was glad that I watched the whole thing through. It is well done, conveys its message effectively, and is a worthwhile watch or read."},{"rating":"1","title":"just rent this movie","review":"I thought this movie was not as good as Heller's novel, but I definitely appreciated the movie with some respect. I could not believe this movie was so badly rated as I really loved the story, but now I understand. I think that this story was just very hard to incorporate into movie format. However, what makes the novel so good is all the different characters in the story, but the movie did not do a good job setting everything up. There is about 10 minutes of silence in the movie that could have been used setting up the story a little bit better. I watched this movie with my wife who had never read the book and I had to keep filling her in to the basic plot so she could understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat Funny, but Doesn't Do the Book Justice","review":"\\"Catch-22,\\" the book, is much more entertaining than \\"Catch-22\\" the movie. The former is non-stop parody, the latter too often degenerates into burlesque and boredom. \\"Catch-22\\" the book succeeds partly because its author obviously had been part of the insanity required to get through military life and wartime. Mike Nichols did not, and it shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book without the juice","review":"O.K. Anyone who has read the incomparable book by Joseph Heller cannot even begin to compare it to this film version with any sincerity. There is no comparison - period. The vast multitude of the nuances of the satire and their subtle quirks are lost in this less than stellar film adaptation.Although the cast is nothing short of a veritable all-star one at that, the less-than-thorough film leaves much to be desired. Alan Arkin is good as Yossarian and there are several other legit performances. That being said, I recommend reading the book a second time over watching this disjointed and convoluted effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic and trenchant ant-war satire still holds up","review":"It uses humour (always logical, often based in hyperbole) which continues to startle with its underlying accuracy: it's always, in the extended logic of all good comedy, funny.

Performances, script, camera-work & directing all outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Enjoyed Catch-22","review":"Catch-22 is a film that I enjoy watching. I do feel that the Movie is more enjoyable if you have read the book first, so that you'll have a better understand as to what is going on in the film. the movie seems to be, chopped up, out of sequence, and missing scenes that describes, Joseph Heller's interpretation of life in the military.of the two anti war films that came out during the early 1970s, Mash and Catch-22. I feel that, Mash, is a film about the fun and friendly comradery that goes on between the officers and enlisted behind the front lines. where as, Catch-22, gives a better portrayal of the military environment, and all the politics that goes on with in it. being that I was in the military, Catch-22 strikes a personal chord with me. I have to say that Catch-22 has to be my favorite of the two films.I find that the movie, Catch-22, is more enjoyable if you have read, Joseph Heller's book, Catch-22."},{"rating":"2","title":"This has been my all-time favorite movie since it came out","review":"...and this DVD is the best version of it that I've ever seen (including at theaters).This movie had been cut up something awful over the years, and for a long time the only version you could find on VHS was one of the later (and worst) TV edits.

Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to.

I just watched it again and I couldn't believe how dated the film comes across. The movie has the feel of the anti-war movement of the 1960's. I have always been an Alan Arkin fan. Richard Benjamin was good in \\"House Calls\\", but the performances seem dated and very unfunny and very unsatirical in Catch 22. The actors seem frenetic in their acting. Time as passed this film by. It has become caught in a timeframe when many films where made from about 1966 to 1973 where they have a feel which dates them. Films like the Godfather was made in '72, but you don't get that 60's feel from it. It still holds up.

Loved it. But they are different. You are not going to get every nuance of the complex, convoluted book into the movie, but it is a good approximation. The movie works on its own, mostly due to the collection of oddball characters and circumstances. The long list of big named actors did a good job. However, the cinematography may be the star, here. As an \\"anti-war\\" comedy, this ranks near the top. It is as satirical as Dr Strangelove.The movie has no musical score, and only has (as I recall) one instance of music at all (\\"Thus Spake Zarathustra\\", a la \\"2001 A Space Odyssey\\".)\\"Let me see if I've got this straight.

The book actually reflects reality far more than one would think, the movie is just boring and headache inducing.

But at this point in his life, Essex's voice has a rather limited range and timbre. He often sounds like Neil Diamond, and even resorts to speaking some lines rather than singing them, most notably in his hammy \\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight?\\" He is also hampered by top-heavy arrangements and a bizarre song selection: \\"St. Elmo's Fire?\\" \\"Together in Electric Dreams?\\" What, no \\"Flashdance?\\" If you were looking for a contemporary Anthony Newley with less pizzaz, David Essex could be your man."},{"rating":"1","title":"looks better than it is","review":"The concept is great and the toy looks cool.

Most of the rest of the world is covered, however, and covered rather well. The book is divided into large sections, one on each of the major world traditions (e.g. \\"The Myths of East Asia\\"). Within each section you will find encyclopedic coverage of that tradition, including very fine artwork. I give the book the highest rating, despite the omissions, because it is truly an excellent mythology resource (and treats the \\"major\\" world traditions in mythology).If you like Bullfinch's, but would like something more pleasing to look at, this book is for you.

Perfectly cast, directed and costumed, this movie lauched the career of the incomparable John Travolta. The music, the dancing and the zeitgeist of the 1970's in two hours.

One of my favorite moments in movie history is the train ride Tony takes at the end of the film where Tony transcends societies rules and standards and finds his own identity, transitioned in music by the Bee Gees song \\"How deep is your love\\".Music was played on vinyl record players when this movie was made, but what a treat it is for future generations today to be able to watch and listen to this movie in Blueray.

A tale of a paint shop guy who blows his money on the weekends to become a local legend on the disco floor, John Travolta nailed the role dead on. Although gritty with language and scenes that some might consider offensive, it is a true life tale of the mid seventies in New York City. Some call it the revival of the movie musical, but it's much more than that. Ultimately a story of one man's growth into adulthood through misled love and the confusion of youth, this freinds and family story rings true to the bone. Fueled with the dance beat of that generation and climaxed with the writing and singing skills of the Bee Gees, this movie is a classic representation of the times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless classic","review":"The movie and soundtrack is still great after all these years.

I thought this was a cute little dancing movie. Who hasn't seen the image of John Travolta in that form-fitting white suit? I was surprised upon first seeing it to find how wrong I was. This serious and dark film if far more realistic about urban teenagers than most \\"modern\\" movies coming out today. Except for the style of music, things haven't changed that much for a lot of teens today in Bay Ridge, and other places like it. Roger Ebert's review of the film (I think in honor of Gene Siskel) is great, with the one exception that no one seems to have told him that the Verrazano Bridge actually leads from Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, into Staten Island, not Manhattan, as he suggests... Overall, a powerful and engaging movie.

But outside of the club, things don't look so rosy. At home, Tony fights constantly with his father and has to compete with his family's starry-eyed view of his older brother, a priest. Nor can he find satisfaction at his dead-end job at a paint store. However, things begin to change when he spies Stephanie in the disco and starts training with her for the club's dance competition. Stephanie dreams of the world beyond Brooklyn, and her plans to move to the big city just over the bridge soon change Tony's life forever. Watching Travolta shimmy across that dancefloor to that funky disco music, makes you realize that this movie is like no other, and the soundtrack features some of the best disco music ever made. It is, quite simply, amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie!","review":"I was born in 1986, 9 years after the movie came out. I LOVE this movie.

Sure, the music is great, but the characters are truly some of the worst people I've ever seen.John Travolta plays a spineless wuss who lives at home then struts about on the disco floor like a girl. But, it's the girls he's after, and he lays them, and leaves them like he's making a deposit in a human sperm-bank.His wish to attach himself to another human being is parallel to the lack of actual physical contact on the dancefloor.His friends are a bunch of jerks, one of whom tries to prove his manhood by falling off a bridge.But, all this garbage is set to a great soundtrack!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING in today's time.....","review":"Good music, good dancing, but in today's standards this movie would be boring.

The only disappointent in that movie was his partner former All my Children vetern actress Karen Lynn Gorney, I though she gave a bland performance and was miscast, but no difference cause the music and the man TRAVOLTA carried the film.

One, it is whimsical and very tongue-in-cheek. The dog's 'life' is a great example of personification and a great lead-in for explaining 'voice' to my students when teaching them the process of writing. It helps them 'see' (due to the unigue style of font use) and 'hear' the dog and its feelings in a very clever way. This book has opened many avenues of creativity for my students and really helps them be better creative writers. I read some of the previous reviews and was a bit surprised at the negative comments. As a teacher, I feel kids should be encouraged to read and read often. The language is not immature and actually introduces some good vocabulary, which gets students looking to find out what they mean and how to use them.

Other, more reliable witnesses, have given commentary on Hitler's demise, yet Junge claims to have heard the 'shot' that killed Hitler, unbelievable.

The details of abuse were so overdone as to be tedious, never mind that the writer didn't really deal with a good number of the physical ramifications of what she described. The book rambles, and has a goppy, riteous tone to it reminiscent of a Harlequin romance. It does, indeed have numerous and glaring editing errors. It wanders into the realm of New Age philosophy without adding anything meaningful to the topic or even making good use of the subject matter. I felt rather like I was reading the equivalent of a Maury Povich cover of the witch trials.

I got 5 organizations to back my candidate, and still broke even with the opponent (who had none), so it appears the organization sponsorship is a temporary benefit. I played this game once, took about 2 hours, and now I'm ready to give it away. Could have been much better.

Typos and misuses of terminology abound (candidates are called \\"president-elect\\"), and a goofily Bill O'Reilly-ish world view pervades, depicting the Democrats as out of touch with independent voters. When you go to campaign in California and are told that both Bush and Kerry are identically \\"pro-environment,\\" you realize how much games have been dumbed down since the glory days of SSI's \\"President Elect\\" -- another game designed by a Republican (Reagan always won), but with way more smarts."},{"rating":"1","title":"zero compatibility!","review":"watch out for this game. it is only compatible with a thin minority of computers (as far as I have experienced).

One of his more interesting attempts was in his first color film, \\"Rope,\\" made in 1948.The story was about two young socialites, John Dall and Farley Granger, who strangled a college friend just for kicks and hid his body in a chest in the room to which his parents were coming to a cocktail party... Among the guests was James Stewart, who sifted out the truth before the evening was over...One could imagine what Hitchcock would do with such a situation - but in fact he did a great deal more... For a start, he played out the drama in the actual time of the story: 80 minutes on a summer evening in that New York skyscraper... He dispensed with the usual cutting techniques and, for the first time in history, shot in ten-minute takes, with not a single interruption for the different camera set-ups..."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a classic, but it's not Hitch's best by any means","review":"Hitch did a lot better and he did a lot worse.Rope is one of those movies where the concept WORKS.

You may be surprised at how re-watchable it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of Hitch's rare disappointments","review":"Nail-biting suspense? Yeah, right. There is no suspense here, no real detective work either - the two killers act so downright nutty that even a child would finger them as the ones behind the missing man's disappearance. Stewart's sudden transformation from supporting murders in general (which was never believable anyway, only unpleasant to listen to) into a horrified \\"good citizen\\" is contrived.

Morally bankrupt idea for a film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rope on DVD: Pros and Cons","review":"Hitchock's Rope is my favorite movie, and I have anticipated acquiring the dvd for some time now. Yesterday, it happened. Here are the pros: the dvd contains the original trailer, which is quite interesting; the dvd contains an informative special feature documentary with Hume Cronyn, Arthur Laurents, and Hitch's daughter. Here are the cons: The dvd is not in widescreen, and the picture quality, although better than any other presentation I've seen on video or on television, is not as crisp and clean as I expected it would be. You can see the blue hues shifting, and this is a bit distracting.If you're a big fan of this movie, I would recommend buying the dvd; otherwise, you can live with the video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Hitchcock;s Best Effort","review":"This film suffers from the same weakness as another weak Hitchcock film with James Stewart. I cannot get interested in a film in which every character is boring and obnoxious.Two spoiled, wealthy jerks murder another spoiled, wealthy jerk for kicks. Who cares?

A waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too gimmicky","review":"A very gimmicky film on a couple of levels. First it's shot all in one long shot, actually several shots spliced together more or less unobtrusively to look like one shot. Second, it all takes place in real time in one location. This, along with the plot, make it seem like an Agatha Christie play. Two young men (supposedly homosexual, but I didn't notice) murder a friend because they are \\"superior\\" creatures. Then they invite the murdered man's fiance and relatives over and serve dinner on a large chest where the murdered man is stashed. Gee, I wonder where David is tonight? He was supposed to be here. Stewart plays their old schoolmaster who taught them the Nietzschean doctrine, but who discovers the murder and is horrified. Hitchcock's first color film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rope (1948)","review":"This is Hitchcock at his best if just experimentally so. Taken from the play by the same title, ROPE is rife with intrigue, tension, murder. In one sense the film is about the difference between the artist and the manipulator. The one who dominates controls the sensitivies of the artiste causing him to \\"give in\\" to passions not normally aroused. The production of the work is as if on a stage--a play in the making--providing nearly continuous action from start to finish. Can Brandon and Philip pull off the perfect murder? See for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting experiment and a reasonably good movie","review":"Hitchcock said \\"Rope\\" was an \\"experiment that didn't work out\\". Nevertheless, it's an interesting experiment and a reasonably good movie.

It's all one shot, to the extend they could do it back then. They had three or four wipes that they needed to put in, which if it was shot today they wouldn't need to do. But the story itself is so well done. It's like Hitchcock practiced with this movie and then made Dial M for Murder where he perfected it. The story starts out chilling, and continues all the way throughout.

This movie was ground-breaking in two ways: the movie was shot in color, where most of the other films during this time were in black & white, and the film was shot by Hitchcock in one set (the apartment interior) and in eight 10-minute shots.

Jimmy Stweart is wonderful and his monologue at the end was a truly honest and wise realization of his personality. It is a great \\"moral\\" that really breaks your heart. The script is an interesting work of black humor wit and intelligent ramblings. Farley Granger does well with his guilt-ridden murderer role.

The man never took home an OSCAR, but always took home many fans. This film is one of the best that Stewart did with the great director and Farly Granger was excellent in it.

Amazing film, enthralling experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different kind of Hitchcock","review":"3.5 stars. A film inspired by the true crime case of Leopold and Loeb, Hitchcock tried to do a few different things with this film and I'm not too sure it worked. The decision to shoot in eight ten minute long sequences might have sounded appealing, but to me it came off a bit too gimmicky. The film is also a little slow in getting started and doesn't really pick up until Jimmie Stewart comes onto the scene. Jimmie, as always, is perfect and it is he who steals the show. Of course, I don't know how either of the boys thought this was the perfect crime, but then again, what do I know. Still the third act turns out to be quite suspenseful and is what made this film enjoyable. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sleeper","review":"This film is truly a sleeper of suspence flicks. An anxiety evoking plot, it surrounds the murder by two prep school buddies of their classmate inspired by a former teacher masterly played by James Stewart. Hints of eugenics and homosexuality add to the character development as the dominating alum manipulates his weaker half. See if you don't sympathize with the victim's father and former girlfriend who are among the invited guests at the dinner party where their loved one just took his last drink. Little do they know he is still among them dressed, pressed, and folded like antique linen."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Bonhoeffer Ideas","review":"This book, while offering little in the way of new research, approaches the thinking and life of Bonhoeffer from several new perspectives, attempting to find theological and ethical currents which apply to the Post-Modern world.

I liked the idea of a fantasy series based on two people who manage to liberate a world dominated by the mistwraith and after being cursed by it, manage to turn the world into chaos. It is so unlike the idea of some other series where some hapless mortals are fighting against a 'big baddie'. I also found the characters very life-like, and many of them very likeable. Despite the books grim contents it is often very funny, especially in the scenes whe Dakar is involved. The one thing that does marr this book is its complex and difficult language. I had to use a dictionary to look up a lot of words, and normally I don't have to do that often. I also had to re-read several sentences to work out their meaning. This is a book that you have to spend a long time reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"On the bad side of 'so-so'","review":"The story was reasonably interesting, but the conflicts were trite and contrived. What she made her characters agonize over made me roll my eyes. By far the greatest weakness is her nebulous writing, not to mention downright grammatical mistakes.

This was awful ... and I actually waded through books seven and eight of Jordan's WoT without giving up!I have never felt so non-caring about a story's characters that I did with the two protagonists. Read the last few lines of the Kirkus Review - they sum it up pretty well.

Reading on, I began to find that the writing was becoming tedious (far too wordy) and the characters had all lost their appeal. I didn't care what happened to them, and the utter lack of any real gripping conflict soon turned the whole experience into an ordeal.I would like to have given this book a chance through to the end, but what's the use when I don't care for the characters, the plot, nor the world and it's history?

I was immensely let down when I got to the end of the book and found that the story did not end there! I eagerly anticipate the sequel! So... Lisa.... If you are reading this.... when's the sequel coming out?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Know What To Say","review":"I have somehow avoided this book for a very long time, and finally decided to see what all the fuss was about. I can report that it is indeed beautifully written. I can also say that it is one of the most disturbing books I have ever read. The book is considered Nabokov's finest work in English. I hate to say this, but I do not plan to read any more of his works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwieldy","review":"I bought the Kindle edition of this book and found it extremely hard to use. There are no links to the endnotes in the text so you have to manually switch to the end of the book to see if there's a note for the specific phrase/passage you just read. With multiple notes for every single page of the novel, this becomes extremely tedious and kills the flow of the novel even more than linked endnotes would, as it's much harder to flip through a kindle book than a physical book. Do not waste your time on the Kindle version until there are links to the endnotes within the text. I'm going to return this and buy a hard copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle edition terrible quality, don't waste your time","review":"Fantastic novel. My issue is with the kindle edition. Publishers shouldn't be able to get away with poor quality ebooks like this. Unlike other fine ebooks, annotations are NOT linked. There are no actual superscripts in the text. You wouldn't know if anything on the page is annotated. What is ridiculous is that every chapter number has a link to the annotations at the end. So for example, if you want to look up one of the many french words in the book, you would have to scroll back up to the beginning of the chapter to get to the link. Funny enough the foreword at the beginning is properly linked and annotated - just look at the sample. If only they cared enough to do that for the rest of the book. You're better off with the print version unfortunately."},{"rating":"2","title":"the ultimate road novel","review":"Full disclosure: I credit \\"Lolita\\" with turning me into the lit geek recovering English major type that I am today. Read it when I was eighteen; got sucked in on the first page by the haunting echoes of Edgar Allen Poe. No mere mortal should be able to perform the tricks with the English language that Nabokov got away with in this book.Get the annotated edition. On a first reading it's more fun to puzzle things out for yourself, but when you go back (and you will) Appel's notes will show you everything you missed the first time around.Much has been made over the supposedly pornographic nature of this book. Far more fascinating to me is its hilarious depiction of all that was middlebrow tacky in postwar American pop culture -- particularly tourist culture.Screw \\"On the Road.\\" \\"Lolita\\" is the ultimate road novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important Note about the Annotated Version","review":"Greg Hullender's review (which is a Spotlight Review as I type) is dead on, especially insofar as he points out that all but the most erudite reader will miss out on most of what is going on beneath the surface of the page without reading the annotations. But...It should be emphasized that, if you read the annotations during your first time through the book, you will completely and totally spoil the story. Put otherwise, the outcome of the whole book is given away in the first few annotations, and repeated many times thereafter. Unless you're the kind of person who reads the last page of a book first, don't read the annotations the first time through.Also, I think it is helpful to know that Nabokov was no fan of symbolism or allegories... so don't waste time and energy looking for them in Lolita, because the author himself said that they're not there."},{"rating":"2","title":"dark and dangerous","review":"Nabakov's \\"Lolita\\" is a dark and dangerous novel which is absolutely beautifully written. I was drawn in immediately and was compelled by the conflicted character as he navigated his desires for young Lolita."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"As a first-time reader of Nabokov, this annotated edition of Lolita proved indispensable for penetrating the depths of this 20th century masterwork. The annotations provide some much welcome insight into references, allusions, and secrets that would have otherwise been lost on me. I could not imagine reading Lolita without these annotations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, Disturbing, Masterful, VERY Helpful Annotations","review":"I had heard of 'Lolita' as being a classic for so long, and finally I got to reading it. I now know why it's considered so highly. It amazes me to no end that both Nabokov and Conrad were 'English as a second-third-fouth-etc language' speakers and writers, yet they display sheer mastery of our language. It's hard to believe that Lolita came out in the 50's. I think it might still be ahead of its time, or timeless in sense. It was disturbing, albiet riveting. Thank goodness for Mr. Appel's annotations, as the work is loaded with French quotes and various literary allusions. It made the read far more enjoyable for this sad monoglot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good read","review":"unlike most other great novels, this one is pretty damn readable, without pandering or compromising any of the material. Nabokov did the unthinkable back then, (wich is all the rage now nearly half a century later) he dared to see both sides of American culture the high brow and the low, and stuck them both into his blender,and the results are what you would call today post-modernism.It can be read either as a trash novel, a romance, a tragedy, a comedy, a fairy tale, and so forth and so forth. This novel is pushes american prose into directions that at are a6t once sublime and invigorating. I would recommend giving this book to those ( particularly teens) who are unimpressed by literature. Nabokov's style is so clean and accesible, as well as infinitely fresh, that I would assume it would ignite a more deeper respect towards the written word by today's youth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much TRANSLATION, not enough ANNOTATION","review":"My beef with this book is that too many of the \\"notes\\" consisted of translations of the little french phrases nabokov's narrater (monsieur Humbert Humbert) uses. Although I have not gone back and counted, I came away with the impression that AT LEAST HALF of the annotations consisted of simple translations of simple french phrases, which you could find in any french-english dictionary.There are, mercifully, a few good points in the annotation that enhanced my understanding of LOLITA somewhat. The butterfly-references, in particular, are nicely correlated. \\"Metterling-Schmetterling\\" grumbles Quilty as he is about to be shot to death--that's really brilliant. I wish there were more of this sort of thing in the notes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Kindle conversion","review":"Obviously, this review is not meant to be a judgement on the quality of either Nabokov's novel or the annotations that accompany it. Whoever supervised the digital conversion for the Kindle of this special annotated edition should be summarily fired. Clearly, no one actually tried out using this product as it was intended. The annotations do not appear within the text as links, and jumping back and forth between the text and the notes at the back of the book is damn near impossible. It's a fascinating work, but the only way to enjoy it is with an actual paper copy, at least until someone who knows what he or she is doing supervises a second try at this one. This could have been so cool; the perfect book to show off all that is possible with the Kindle. Could have been, should have been, and would have been if anyone had cared. Shame all around."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF ANNOTATED VERSION","review":"Does anyone at Kindle understand how to format an annotated novel? The hard copy and paperback versions of this great annotation have notes running along the texts. They correspond to the commentaries at the end of the book. Those commentaries edify the themes of \\"Lolita.\\" (That's the way annotated books work, folks.) Kindle's electronic version and its iPad adaptation do not have references on the pages of the text, so we have to GUESS when to go back to the annotation section to see if there even are any notes. DUH? Kindle really scammed us on this one. It's the only Kindle book I immediately demanded a refund for. If \\"Lolita\\" wasn't one of my favorite books, and if the annotations in the paperback copy had not been so handy and valuable, I wouldn't bother reporting this.Write to Kindle, folks. Demand that they reformat this one, because the effort is worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Adds a new dimension to a novel I admired already","review":"It's hard to imagine a better qualified person to annotate Nabokov's Lolita.Appel has an extensive knowledge of Nabokov's life and work. He met Nabokov, on several occasions, and used those opportunities to find out information that only the author could know.Appel uses this knowledge to add new, profound and, sometimes just simply amusing insights into a novel that I always admired but also felt frustrated by the mystery shrouding it. To be sure, even after reading Appel's Annotated Lolita enough mystery still remains to keep me intrigued and also to renew my appreciation for Nabokov's amazing mind.The Annotated Lolita contains a lengthy introduction by Appel that covers other Nabokov's works, his life and his philosophy. The, sometimes dense, annotations are scattered through the text very unobtrusively so that it is quite possible to read the novel with or without Appel's help."},{"rating":"2","title":"CELTIC IRISH KNOT SS RING","review":"BEAUTIFUL DESIGN ON THIS STERLING SILVER RING.

They are obviously (to me at least)well past their prime here and only surviving as a novelty. Sure there's lots of great instrumentation here but you've heard it all before and heard it much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mellow, but Rich and Exciting","review":"This CD (which was taken from shows during '89 to '90) is different than the other live Grateful Dead CD's. It is mellow and light without being boring like Reckoning. It is also rich and lush, with a light jazz influence. The sound is closest to Wake of the Flood, but the songs are all stretched out. It does have the famous Grateful Dead jamming, but with the harsh psychodelic/acid edge removed. It is sort of like something Sade would record if she were to take LSD. You can really get into this album, but at the same time it is one of the few Dead albums that could be used as background music for a Sunday brunch.Eyes of the World is especially spectacular with the Brandon Marsalis sax solo. If you really like this, you might want to check out Marsalis's sax solo on Widespread Panic's \\"Light Fuse and Get Away\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the buy","review":"To start off i am a huge grateful dead fan and i have prabably about 150 cd's that cover many years of there carrer. This release is very good and worth buying. it has some great music on it and the price of the album is worth the eyes of the world with Branford Marsalis on the sax alone. All and all this was among my first bunch of grateful dead cd's that i got and it got me hooked so do yourself a favor if you are thinking about listening to the grateful dead and you want to hear something from the 1990 era buy this cd. But i would also get something from the 77 era too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too too much Brent Mydland","review":"It's way too much Brent for me. It's like the microphone was only in front of him! Jerry is impossible to hear and the piano dominates the vibe of half the songs. Booby sounds good when you can hear him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute classic Dead, a must for any music lover.","review":"For me live music is the only way to go. The sterility of the studio only serves to take all of the emotion and creativity out of music. These are characteristics that the Dead and especially Jerry sought out night after night. This album is a classic example of why live music is so much better than studio. The album is scorchingly hot Dead, but for any music fan please listen to Eyes of the World on the second CD because Garcia and Marsalis take you on a special ride to a musical world that only existed on that night, but which can be revisted and remember from this recording. Something that could not exist in a studio. I highly recommend this album. Even to those that are not fans of the Dead, after you listen to this recording you wiil at least know why we love them so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great production and performances","review":"This is probably the best sounding of the Dead's live catalogue on CD. Only problem is I can't stand Brent Mydland as a background singer or his version of Dear Mr. Fantasy. Mydland was great on the keys but the microphone should have been taken away or turned off. He ruins what could have been a great version of Cassidy as his volume is the same as Weirs?! Just didn't work. However once I get past that the rest of this 2 cd set is one of the better \\"mixed\\" live recordings. (Dick's picks are usually the entire show)"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Over","review":"My favorite Dead eras are '68-'69, and '72-'74. I understand the fanaticism that surrounds the band, but anyone who sees \\"rebirth\\" in '89-'91 instead of \\"death rattle\\" is over-optimistic. If Brent had an ailment like throat cancer, I apologize in advance for unintended cruelty, but his singing blows chunks. The synths and MIDI are real downers too. This is the Eric Clapton-ization of what was once adventuresome, boundary-pushing music into sanitized, watered-down muzak for the yuppie masses.

I wanted a book with a lot of Celtic/Gaelic names for a baby. There are those, but half the book is taken up with surnames (not what I was interested in) and the names of Celtic deities (interesting, but again, not what I was looking for).And if you write a book with Gaelic names in it, PLEASE include a guide to pronunciation! I admit that my knowledge of Gaelic is pretty limited, but I am pretty sure that some of the pronunciations the author did give were wrong, which didn't exactly inspire a lot of trust in her research.All in all, I'll probably return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Introduction to a milestone algorithm in VLSI: ordered binary decision diagrams","review":"Imagine that you have a many million transistor chip.

This is a system, a workout program and you HAVE to stick with it. Even if I don't see any improvement I keep doing it because it will pay off.

It does a good job of addressing issues that matter to the contemporary vocal artist and recognizes a market that is looking for information that you cant find from more traditional voice pedagogues.2). It covers good voice techniques that will help you to gain new levels with your vocal training and it is full of a lot of added value, such as vocal health, recommended vocal products and select articles/essays from some of the top voice teachers in the world. Its almost a \\"lexicon\\" and has qualities found in a good reference publication. Its Jaime's book, but its not all about Jaime... its very generous in how it shares information from other experts in the field.Jaime is one of the hardest working and passionate voice pedagogues in the business.

I didn't mind the fact that this book is about other things too - technique may get you far, but the other aspects such as diet, exercise and knowing how to approach your live sound will make or break your career and performance.I will always be coming back to this book as I am now - for guidance, exercises, or upgrading my lifestyle as a vocalist, jumpstarting my dedication to another level and I can't wait to see new stuff in Jaime's store or to be privileged enough to be trained by him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!

His preface focuses on where you have to worry about cheating - mainly outside the US, or in small unregulated US casinos (if you play in Las Vegas or other large casinos, cheating is not a problem).The second area he focuses on is the methods casinos use to cheat, and how to detect them. I have played in casinos outside the US, and have personally seen casinos cheating (in Curacao). As a card-counter, I could have been financially wiped out if I played there unaware of what the casino did.This book is a quick read - it is entertaining with the antecdotes, but also includes good documentation on how to identify cheating, including illustrations.

It will not auto update to the same version as the normal Thrones & Patriots, so if you try to join a game you will get an error saying you need something like version 07.25.00.15705, even though the in game versions match.There is a way around this which involves creating an ISO without the patch on the disc and using a No-CD executable, but it's a hassle and not worth it.If you're going to play by yourself, this edition is fine.

Add in sheets with the instructions indicated the stand had a history of collapsing. The additional brace may prevent that but the stand is unstable. This Toshiba TV stand is made up of 25 dollars of substandard materials to hold up an $1800.00 television. The Toshiba corp should be ashamed to have it's logo on such garbage.

Furthermore, the grammatical mistakes in the book were very apparent. A company that can't get most of the grammar taken care of in a book causes great concern to me.

There are frames for not much more $$ that have double that resolution. Plus, the unit is gigantic and, despite the faux-wood frame around the outside, will definitely stand out on your desk or mantle. It must be four inches thick - nevermind the power cord sneaking out the back. In addition, the construction of this thing is cheap plastic. The faux-wood frame rattles loosely around the display, and the buttons feel like they're going to snap each time you press them. In addition, the menu is not intuitive and, given the terrible resolution, can even be difficult to read.

I am sending it back. If you want to use one memory card per photo session, then fine. Otherwise, there should be a capacity for transfering photos from your computer or camera onto the frame without tying up the memory card or having to have it plugged into the camera or computer. BTW, the frame is the size mentioned, but the actual LCD screen is much smaller and the resolution is grainy. The manual that comes with it is severely lacking, regardless of whether or not you have computer knowledge. I will say that it is extremely easy to just plug the memory card into the frame, and let it rip, but again, if you like to reuse your memory card and download photos onto the computer, this is not the purchase for you.

It states that you can use a Memorystick or USB device. I have been unable to use either. The only thing that will work is the SD from my wife's Palm. The instructions are grossly inadequate which should say alot, since this product should not need any instructions. Also, I thought I had a bonus when I found a USB drive contained in the box, but incredibly it would not work on my Dell computer. I have several Memorysticks that I use with my Sony cyber-shot camera, but now I'm stuck going out to buy a SD card, just for this device. Please look elsewhere before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy!","review":"This frame was purchased as a gift by a group of us for our babysitter. The idea was great but the frame wasn't.

Having limited space on my desk to display photos, this frame allows me to display all the photos and mpeg's I like. The pictures are clear and crisp. The sound is a little tinny but the mpegs run great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"This picture frame has a low resolution, resulting in a very grainy picture. Your pictures may look wonderful in your photo album or on your computer monitor, but it won't look good into this frame unless you are squinting! Also, the frame doesn't have internal memory and doesn't accept a CF card. This requires the user to plug this into a computer or purchase a separate memory card just for use with this frame (which adds to the expense). Since the price of these frames are consistently decreasing, I recommend spending an additional $50 for a frame with higher resolution and internal memory or CF card compatibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Gift","review":"The image quality of my scans and digital photos looked very nice and I found it quite simple to load the frame up with 100+ photo memories into the memory (it also takes the various memory cards); comes with a tiny remote that conveniently slips into a slot, although I did not try the remote. I put mp3s on it to play in the background of the slideshow and they played fine.For $99, this is a nice digital frame and as in my case, can make a perfect gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grainy Photos","review":"I have a digital picture frame already and order this one as a present for a family member thinking I would get the same quality of pictures for a much less price that what I paid for my original digital frame.

I returned the one I purchased because I was so disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for MPEG's","review":"I purchased this to display MPEG movies (which it says it can). I was told by tech support that I had to use a DIVX encoder and that they must be AVI (which is also incorrect). The SANYO Xacti video camera I was using was MPEG-4 (The iPod accepts the files without issue), I tried converting them in Quicktime to several different types of MPEG4 and none worked. There are better frames out there and I intend on finding out which one is the best. I have ordered another brand and will see if it works. This was by FIRST product return on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a touch up!","review":"Instant face lift! When used as directed, expect good results.

My forehead certainly looked smoother (I have two deep lines there). I used it under my cheeks and the laugh lines have minimized.I think the trick is to use it sparingly and not slather it on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Primer","review":"I heard about this product several years ago and love it.

Purchased 2 products and have been completely disappointed with both. They promise to give temporary help to those of us that are wrinkle ridden and certainly do not deliver. The only thing I can say to the defense of this product is that it does make your skin feel soft but don't even attempt to use it prior to your foundation. All it will do is make your foundation ball up and roll right off.

Because of the section on hatching your own, I have been able to incubate and sell many guineas, even some to Yorktown Victory Center!

Almost nothing in this book is true. I would start with other resources first. The only thing true and very worthy to know in this book is that guineas like white prosso millet.Only one thing was more disappointing than this book - Stromberg's (the company where I bought my guineas by mail). I waited over two months without communication, stayed home from from vacation because they told me on the phone my order would be coming, and I could never get information that my order would be be delivered in late July instead of the first of May.Two GARDENING WITH GUINEAS facts that I found to be untrue are: 1) Guineas do not dig the ground (Guineas completely denude their pen.); and 2) Guineas do not eat plants, just the bugs off the plants (Guineas have defoliated entire trees, shrubs, as well as potted plants on my property.).Other erroneous information includes information about dogs and guineas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited at best","review":"This is a sweet little book but the information it contains is limited at best.It gives many \\"rules\\" for keeping guineafowl, many of which simply don't apply to most of us. The section on incubation is woefully inadequate, and much of the book consists of chatty posts lifted from a website, which are heavy on opinion but pretty lightweight if you want real help, or substantial information on these interesting birds.There's little in this book which you won't be able to find in an hour or two of surfing. Save the money to buy more birds, and don't bother with the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent resource for beginning with guineas","review":"I thought this was a very helpful book, that especially beginners like myself, can read and understand in the raising of guineas.The downside was that the new copy I purchase arrived with the cover and front pages torn.

I'm disappointed in Amazon for not double-checking and sending me a damaged copy.I will look for materials from other buyers rather than purchasing directly from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly flattering","review":"Most of the information in this book turned out to be largely bogus - in my opinion. Guineas are messy, they do dig in the garden and eat the vegetables and some flowers, they poop runny poop all over your lawn furniture, they are loud, they scare away all native birds and pick on the chickens constantly. Plus, unlike chickens, they fly pretty well which means they can get places (and poop) where chickens cannot... like on your roof, window sills, car, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for new guinea owners","review":"After purchasing 6 guinea fowl chicks (keets) I was told many different things about their care - I was confused.

It's no way comparable to the detail Storey's Guide to chickens is about chickens but it's still packed with info. It's a small thin book with step by step guide from hatching, brooding, and etc. It talks about how to move nests, how to house the birds, and most importantly how to get them to stick around when you finally release them to free-range.

Great book if you are going to raise Guineas and want to have the knowledge ahead of time to save yourself from problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I purchased this book with great expectations based upon the glowing reviews of others. Though a decent source of information about raising guineas, the book often left me frustrated and confused. For example, contrary to Ms. Ferguson's experience, neither I nor anyone I've talked to has had any success moving guinea nests. Also, when discussing raising young keets, the author states, \\"it would be a good idea to provide an optional heat source for the keets in the henhouse on really cold days or nights until they are older.\\" What is \\"really cold\\" and what is \\"older\\"? On numerous occasions I've searched this book for help with specific problems and gotten only vague information that left the question unanswered.My experience has taught me, 1. Guineas can be raised exactly like chickens and 2. Don't try to move a guinea nest. Just invert a cage on top of the setting hen, give her food and water, and let her hatch and raise her brood right there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Information for beginners..","review":"Since I just started raising Guineas, this book was very informative.

I bought this fax based on price thinking one fax is as good as the next. Not so. In my opinion this is not a machine for business use because it can't be trusted to send more than 2 or 3 pages at a time. The automatic document feeder, which I've learned is really what distinguishes a home fax from a business one, is incapable of separating a stack of papers and just sends them through the machine in a jumble. The problem is that unless you've counted the pages, you'll get a report saying the fax went through just fine, when in fact it sent half of what you thought went through. Unless you stand there and watch the pages go through, you won't realize that it didn't sent the critical 30 page fax you wanted it to, but 24 of them.

When our inkjet fax machines in our branch offices give out we'll likely be replacing them with the Brother.Update: After using this for over two years, not much has changed. It is still working well and we are quite happy with it. The only issue we have had is that if you have multi-page faxes we have found that if the pages are pushed too far down into the machine it may grab more than one page at a time.

Mistake. The songs are generic, bland, very dated sounding lite jazz/funk/pop. Hated it, to be honest. \\"Something About you\\" is an absolutely essential track for any 80's aficionado, but if you are thinking of purchasing this you might want to consider that there may be a reason why they only had one hit. For comparison purposes, I got the brilliant, wonderful (and consistently enjoyable) The Very Best of Crowded House at the same time, and the difference is night and day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grim ...","review":"The movie is pretty grim. It is a disjointed collection of three short stories. The transition from one story to another is abrupt and confusing. This is more of a documentary feature than a feature film.Some reviews talk about exotic locations and haunting cinematography. I think the movie scored poorly from an aesthetic perspective as well. A panoramic shot of the Judean desert doesn't exactly qualify as hypnotic. Another movie called \\"The Beast of war\\" was shot in the Judean desert and even though it was a raging war movie, the exquisite cinematography captured the viewer's attention.The only redeeming factor about this movie is that it isn't biased. Everybody (the Bedouins and the more upscale urban Israelis) have been measured on an equal scale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it.","review":"I had such a hard time getting from a darker brown to a copper tone. I tried everything including going to the salon and all they did was fry my hair.. the color they used was dull and didn't stick. In a fit of desperation, I tried this one last ditch effort because my long hair wasn't going to take much more abuse. This is the only product that resulted in a solid copper color and stuck to even the more damaged parts of my hair. Now that it's the right color, I can focus on getting it healthy again. I would recommend it for sure. I would have done this first and spared my hair the damage not to mention the money I could have saved had I known better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Color Ever!","review":"My wife uses this haircolor and just loves it!! Everywhere we go, she gets compliments from people. Strangers approach her and tell her how much they love the color and what beautiful hair she has.

This colour is GORGEOUS!!! and I've tried many that were not... I find it way too bright red on top of the blonde parts, so the next day I put an Ash Blonde non-permanent colour on top which just tones down the red a little so it looks more natural, and then it's perfect.

I do use a sulfate-free shampoo, so I'm not exactly sure how other people are able to keep this color fade-free, but mine's not only fading, but rubbing all over the place.It also turned out really uneven. I haven't dyed my hair in years, so that is probably my fault.Unfortunately, the red I used to use has been discontinued; although I love the results that this color had right away, the quick fade and pink dye that is now rubbed all over my house is NOT worth it!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"hair color","review":"Loreal always makes a quality product. the color was true to the color on the packaging.

When I decided to cover it I went w/ this color/brand because L'oreal is known to have generally good products and the color on the box was similar to my natural color. Unfortunately within days of dying my hair the color drastically faded. :/ I colored it again and it looked nice for a couple days then started to fade. I use salon shampoo and conditioner for color treated hair AND my hair has never faded like this. Also this color is said to be a neutral. It is not.

I love the Camel Kiss #72, and can't believe they carry it at amazon! It never occurred to me to look here. I had been using a lighter color, and was never really happy with it. I just dyed it last night, and am very happy to see ME back! It may fade over the next few weeks, but I never really noticed it. I think the $10 price is a lot better then paying $100-200 and then having to pay again and again for what I think are almost the same results.

I'm going to start the auto-shipment with my next order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feria is hit or miss, but they hit hard!","review":"I've tried a few of L'Oreal's dyes and I generally like the parent company better than others in general. Feria is better than anything, though. I naturally have a darker brown hair that gets to medium brown in the summer months. Feria can be hit or miss, in that some times the colour won't last or doesn't seem to \\"soak\\" into my hair enough. I generally only use black tones and red tones, however.The exception I've found is their Power Reds line within Feria. Long lasting, deep colour that always gets tons of compliments. I have never tried any other \\"collection\\" line within Feria, but I'd reckon those are stronger/better than the rest.P.S. I've also never had an allergic reaction and I have a fairly sensitive scalp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugliest brown I've ever seen","review":"I used this kit over Bright red hair and it turned my hair into literally the ugliest brown I could possibly imagine.

If you're shy, retiring or prefer to blend in, this is NOT the color for you! This is a relatively new shade; actually I have a hard time finding it but Amazon usually has it and somebody is usually selling it much cheaper than Ulta or any upscale beauty supply place. The color is very dramatic. I'm a natural very dark brunette but have been a redhead for over 30 years. Here's my tip to maintain your shade regardless of which red you are. Red is the most difficult to maintain because of it's rapid fire fading. When you shampoo, only shampoo your scalp. Your hair is very seldom oily or dirty; it's your scalp that needs attention. Rise well and follow with as much cold water as you can bare. This will keep your color intact longer and leave you with added shine. If you condition try to rinse with cold water. Its tough in the winter but what price great looking hair?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I think the product I recieved was old","review":"I recieved this and put it in my hair, the color turned out really odd, and the conditioner that came with this was gritty and didn't really condition.

Won't buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Current Dye of Choice","review":"I ordered the Ruby Rush to dye my dirty blonde hair a dramatic red. It worked, but the first time the results weren't that great. I waited two months and used the dye again. I discovered that leaving the dye in about 10 minutes longer than recommended seems to create the deep and vibrant color I wanted. And, it doesn't leave my hair in awful shape.For the first week after dying, my hair color is amazing. After that, it fades to a so-so red. However, the multi-faceted effect wins me over. My hair looks like it has highlights in it, nearly comparable to my old stylist who charged $200 per session. Until I find something better, I will continue ordering Ruby Rush.Five stars, rather than four, because even though it fades quickly, so does every other red hair dye. I recommend Ruby Rush to any blonde looking for a fiery change."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Only Red I Will Use","review":"All other red hair dyes look fake and harsh- this is the only red hair dye that I have used which looks natural and truly beautiful.

I selected this mix because it explicitly said- \\"Cooler\\"- that it was supposed to minimized red, orange and gold tones. What a lie! My hair turned out bright yellow-orange. Completely unnatural and completely unsightly. I had to go to the salon the next day to get it corrected, and the stylist said that Feria products are particularly difficult to correct because there are metals in the products (which are also horrible for your health).

(Which makes no sense at all. I haven't dyed or highlighted my hair in about 2 years.) So the back half of the top of my head is reddish, and the rest of my hair remains a slightly lighter shade of brown than it usually is. It's not at all flattering, looks very fake due to the unnaturally reddish section on top, and didn't make my hair shiny or soft.

Checking the last box it was evident that it had been opened and re-packaged with parts missing-also useless. So, in effect, I got 1/3 of my order. I have since learned that the product is no longer produced. My complaint is: if you don't have the complete product don't sell it!

Rather, this great master of attack goes through a number of pawnless endgames, pawn endgames, and those where each side has no more than one piece. There are many basic positions as well as examples from practical play. For endgames with more pieces, go to Fine's \\"Basic Chess Endgames\\" or for more advanced material try Shereshevsky's \\"Endgame Strategy\\". But for an introductory endgame book, this is pretty good.The book by the same name by Chernev is not so practical, comprising endgame studies, which doesn't mean it's not pretty good anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful As A Reference For The Endgame Fanatic","review":"Even now, as a 2089 rated player, I still do not care for this encyclopedia of endgames.

Why are human beings drawn to folktales, fairy tales, mythic figures? Barthes discovers that this draw surrounds us everyday, used both commerically and unconsciously from the personas of professional wrestlers (who resemble those seen on American television today) to our discussions of public figures. Mythology, Barthes argues, is a vital and living part of our society but it is also one used without real understanding because it is so deeply ingrained in the human mind and heart. The essays are light so that the non-specialist can enjoy but deep enough that the scholar can see and understand the theory underneath."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mutilating thought: Unreadable translation","review":"No one who can read French should read Barthes in English but if you must read him in translation avoid this one. Trying to follow his thought in this version is nearly impossible. Although I managed to finish this short book and glean from it the general intention, it was not worth the time it took to untangle the mangled sentences. Simple words were changed into incomprehensible ones. Admittedly, the author's wish to imitate his satirized material may account for the difficulties of translation but that would account for only a small element. This book should be replaced with a new translation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comments on 'our' society.","review":"What Italo Calvino gives us in 'Cosmicomics' and Umberto Eco provided in 'Misreadings', Barthes gives us more reflections on ourselves and modern society.Analysis of modern games to advertisements, he depicts portions of personal interaction and methods for dealing with the intelectual side of current systems of thought"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Commentary","review":"Barthes elaborates on his thinking of semiology and utilizes the myth as an instantiation of the internal structure of sign. Although a number of the concrete popular examples such wine, wrestling, and toys ring a little flat-yet there is still a wealth of interesting material in this compact text. There is insightful work on the absence of proletarian myth, while myth is always interwoven on the right. Barthes argues that myth is what naturalizes contingent history, thus creating the illusion of necessity, particularly as it regards class relations. The myth is what fixates order in the service of bourgeois interests, a fixing of signs thus rendering them motionless and apparently immutable."},{"rating":"1","title":"baby wagon gift basket","review":"This product is way overpriced for the size it is,,,,beware the picture is very deceiving,,,the whole thing actually fits into a box that is 10\\"x15\\"x15\\" much smaller than expected,,,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Corporate Business, Foreigner Distorts Talent Potential","review":"It seems as though this group has just begun their Deep Purple like segment of Greatest Hit/Live CD's.

And much like that bacon-fryin' mega fart, the album just got worse. I would have slit my own wrist right there but the plastic knives kept breaking. Instead I was left with a broken soul AND sore, scratchy arms. Fail.

It's pretty cool that it was written in 1915, but of course that means that some of the language is a bit old-fashioned. It's very readable. The only downside that we see is that a few of the stories go on a bit longer than they would need to.Overall an excellent book for anyone who loves mythology. By the way, my favorite story is the story of Proserpine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking illustrations","review":"The strength of this exquisite book is in the pages of beautiful reproductions of artifacts and artworks from throughout the history of the Empire.

It was the tub drain size for $2.50. Also in that department they had the rubber in 6x6 squares that you can use to make your own gasket with a pair of scissors if you just want to trace your old one. I think that was $4 for a pack of 2 but you can trace two of these gaskets on each sheet so you end up with 4 gaskets for 4 dollars (or 2 thick ones if you double up).

Those of you who own this mug, any tips appreciated. I drink milk in my coffee so the potential for mold, rotten milk, etc building up is pretty bad.

I'm guessing its the oil that gets left behind after you wash it off. If that's the kind of product your looking for, you should buy it.2) You have to get used to the potent smell. The fact that you have to sleep with this in your hair, I wasn't too happy with the smell in my dreams.3) Sacrifice a hair towel.

The texture of my hair has changed back to it original form, like when I was a baby. It is light and silky, shiny, full of body and movement, and it makes my twists looks fresh and new all the time. Everywher I go people ask me if I have just gotten my ahir done and the fact of the matter is that my hairs is overdue to be redone.

A good deal of these songs are masterfully crafted and sophisticated in their approach. \\"That's All\\" and \\"Misunderstanding\\" are fantastic singles that are far and away superior to anything Phil Collins has released as a solo artist (outside of Face Value and \\"I Don't Care Anymore\\"). \\"In Too Deep\\" is a first-rate ballad that most other artists would have been proud to have written. In fact, \\"Mama\\" and \\"Tonight, Tonight, Tonight\\" sound as if they were written by none other than John Lennon. This compilation is not perfect. It tries too hard to be diplomatic (why else would \\"Congo\\" be included over \\"No Reply At All\\", \\"Paperlate\\" or \\"Man On The Corner?\\").

If I want to listen to this kind of crap, I'll buy a Phil Collins album. This has got to be the worst collection of Genesis music I have ever seen. Firstly, There is only one original Genesis on here (I Know What I like [In Your Wardrobe] ) from back in the day. The only other song from real Genesis is the remake of \\"Carpet Crawlers.\\" Secondly, all of this stuff on this album is pop. Genesis was Progressive Rock. There are only two songs from the Peter Gabriel era on there. The rest are all Phil Collins trash; poppy, irritating, and bland. Each song from the Collins time is predictable and distasteful. It's for stupid people who do not have the time to analyze songs. I suppose if you want to listen to Genesis' mainstream attempt at fame, this is the album for you. However, if you want THE REAL GENESIS, consider buying \\"Foxtrot,\\" \\"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway,\\" \\"Selling England by the Pound,\\" and others BEFORE THE PHIL COLLINS ERA!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rockin' service!","review":"I love Genesis!

For the die-hard fan, buy this for \\"The Carpet Crawlers\\" only. Excellent vocals by Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins. However, the rest of the album will make you cry at the sorry state of this band. \\"The Hits\\" only includes awful edited versions - \\"ABACAB\\" and \\"Tonight X 3\\" are cut in half, and gone are the incredible instrumentals that made this band fantastic live. For great NEW music, try Steve Hackett's \\"Darktown\\" - an excellent release with 100 times more integrity than \\"The Hits\\" total sellout, last minute ditch to try and regain the band's popularity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even bother","review":"When I first bought this I thought it was going to be great!

As a life-long Genesis fan (who is most fond of the 1970's version(s) of the band), I purchased this disc mainly for the new version of \\"The Carpet Crawlers\\", which I might add is excellent (although slightly over-produced). But who would have ever thought that \\"Carpet\\" and \\"I Know What I Like..\\" would ever end up on the same disc as \\"I Can't Dance\\" and \\"Jesus He Knows Me\\"??? Anyway, the collection is still a MUST for the Genesis fan due to the inclusion of the new version of \\"Crawlers\\" (Which, by the way, I feel would have been better suited to be included on the boxed set), as well as the single versions of \\"Mama\\" and \\"Abacab\\", which have been previously unavailable on CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: The songs are edited!","review":"I love Genesis, but I cannot endorse this collection. Naturally, it is impossible to include all the songs that fans might want in a single-volume; that doesn't bother me so much. However, I think it was a huge mistake to shorten many of the songs here -- especially \\"Mama\\", in which an entire verse is removed at its emotional arc.My opinion: die-hard Genesis fans will get excited at the start of each song...and be annoyed by the end of many. For this reason, I can only give the collection 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm all for budgetary cutbacks, but not musical ones","review":"I was anticipating this new release featuring many of my fave tunes from the Collins-era Genesis. Sadly, I was disappointed by the content: many of the tracks are radio edits. \\"Tonight, Tonight, Tonight\\", \\"Abacab\\", and \\"Mama\\" are three of the cut-back songs that make this Greatest Hits release something of a downer.Although the \\"Carpet Crawlers\\" re-make- featuring Peter Gabriel & Phil Collin's momentary reunion- isn't too bad, it's not quite enough to offset the clipped \`tunage.

It's fine if you want to go off and write silly love songs that sell jillions of records to people that never even knew that Peter Gabriel was the lead singer for many years, but I wish they would have changed the name of the group. Most of this stuff could easily find a home on a Collins or Mike and the Mechanics solo record.

I guess Watcher Of The Skies or In The Cage could not be consider as \\"hits\\".The last song (Carpet Crawlers 1999) is available on CD single and is an excellent remake.In summary, don't waste your hard earned money on any greatest hits CD let alone this one.[DW]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Genesis sucks!","review":"Everybody knows the only good thing that ever came out of Genesis was Phil Collins' solo career!

Oh, and here are the songs that I thought they missed: Paperlate (the best Genesis pop song of all time, IMO); The Lamb (the Gabriel era song all my friends know, not Crawlers or I Know What I Like); Your Own Special Way (another great pop tune, so it would fit right in with the rest of the songs); Home by the Sea (this is ALWAYS on the radio, a great song); and Man on the Corner (if I'm not mistaken, this charted here in the states)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not if you're a fan","review":"If you are a fan of Genesis, pass on this greatest hits comp.Abacab and Tonight are the \\"radio friendly versions\\".

They're tossed aside in place of very questionable entries, such as No Son of Mine and Jesus He Knows Me, which I wouldn't call hits, just throw-aways the studio released to let the public know Genesis was still around. This band lost credibility with \\"Invisible Touch\\" (some feel it was earlier), going for Top 40 stardom and sacrificing their musical creativity.This CD could easily be expanded into a double-disc set, including more work with Peter Gabriel, complete versions of the songs (instead of radio edits), and definitely more instrumentals (especially The Brazilian - the only high point of \\"Invisible Touch\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"Genesis- The Hits","review":"I am not really impressed with this CD, the contentnor the sound quality, but perhaps die-hard fansof the band will like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Hits\\" Falls a Bit Short","review":"Calling this album \\"The Hits\\" rather than \\"The Best of Genesis\\" was a wise move.

Having said that, \\"The Hits\\" is still far from complete. Missing are great Genesis singles like \\"No Reply at All,\\" \\"Illegal Alien,\\" \\"Man on the Corner\\" and \\"Paperlate.\\" The album also contains a couple of tracks from their recent album without Phil Collins, which would just as well be forgotten.

It's been said almost to the point of cliche that this is a 'strange' book--and it is. It's also a delight, moving the good Doctor fully into the possibilities of the narrative imagination. This is not your generic Doctor Who--no running through corridors, no whiffy time mechanics, no playing it safe. This is a Doctor Who adventure that grabs you by the lapels and gives you a big Groucho Marx kiss. Then, when you least expect it, it can break your heart.You've been warned.

Did Scripture form the ultimate while the other three formed the support base? Were all four of equal importance?

The book lacked a more sophisticated analysis that this subject deserves. Instead it was a breezy read, superficially attributing hurt feelings and communication hurdles to gender differences.

The characters continue from the original novel and new characters are introduced that are both complex and human. Reliquary is as much fun as the original and contains numerous twists as it moves through the New York underground. I highly recommend this book for an entertaining read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pucker marks on the seat from this wild ride.","review":"I just loved this book. I couldn't put it down. I wanted it to go on and on. I'm trying to find another book to satisfy my hunger the way Reliquary did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts off promising but slowly fades away","review":"I quite enjoyed Relic, so it was with great anticipation that I began to read Reliquary. The story starts off promising. There is an air of mystery and suspense that continues to build. Perhaps this is the problem. The authors do such a good job of building atmosphere and preparing you for the climax that when it finally comes, it can't possibly live up to your expectations. Instead, when it does come, you're left feeling cheated, as though the authors did not know where else to turn, so they took the trite and easy way out. A far more interesting read would be a non-fiction work about the real \\"Mole People\\", the forgotten homeless of New York's underground."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does not outshine the first, but worth the read","review":"This one was quite exciting, but a bit more predictable than their first book. The ending twist was not really a surprise, though it was still exciting to read it all being played out. I had a lot of fun reading it, and I am very curious to see where this series goes - I can't imagine that this plant could cause any more trouble!"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY disappointed!","review":"For those of you who read Relic and have not yet read Reliquary. It is a sequel of poor quality. I am a huge fan of Lincoln Child and Douglas Preston. Reading Relic was a terrifying experience that kept me on the edge of my seat and scared at every turn. Reliquary fell very short of my expectations. I kept waiting for it to get scary! It never came close to the anticipation I had built up knowing a sequel had been written. If you want scary, read Relic. Don't bother reading Reliquary, though well written, it paled by comparison..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"Reliquary by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child is the sequel to Relic. Reliquary is an exciting book. It is realistic science fiction. You won't be able to put it down. I sure wasn't! Reliquary is staged in New York City, above and below-ground. The book is mature in its themes. There are many scientific terms and ideas. There are many characters ranging from the underground community leader Mephisto to FBI Special Agent Pendergast. A drug from a lost village transforms people into a legendary creature that craves a chemical in the human brain.This causes a killing streak in New York City. The drug called \\"glaze\\" by its users is a plant is grown by a former scientist in a reservoir. If the plant hits the saltwater, it will activate and potentially ruin the world's ecosystem! Find out for yourself! You do not need to read Relic first, the first book of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A better sequel than any other.","review":"Child and Preston have done it again. A spectacular sequel to The Relic. Intense,Fast-paced and well written. Crichton and Barker fans beware, these guys could scare even you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"Great sequel book to \\"The Relic\\"! Good action and suspense! Should read The Relic first to get the full impact!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent follow-up to \\"Relic\\"","review":"I have enjoyed all the novels that Preston and Child have written and I think that Special Agent Pendergast will be one of my favorite characters. I also like that many characters from Relic are here but the villain in new, which is something I appreciate.Once again, the novel begins in New York and the museum is at the center of the story. I don't want to give away the plot, others have done that but if you like Relic then you should like the follow-up novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Take the Subway","review":"As with anything, the sequel has a hard time living up to the original. This is true for RELIQUARY. However, I was quite reminiscent of Margo and D'Agosta from the new story. They still held their own against an old, but new, threat and I did find myself gripping the armrest a few times. I became a bit jaded with the mole people underground, but was not dissapointed with the climax of the story. I think it would be wrong to say this sequel did no justice to the RELIC. You should feel at home back in New York City with Preston and Child's monsters to welcome you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Realistic, but a real snore fest.","review":"When I read the first relic book, and the summary for the second book, I really wanted to get it. When I checked out Reliquary, and read it. I was horribley dissappointed. I thought it was going to be another scary Preston and Child book, with another Mbwun monster loose in New York city. It would have been a great book. But instead of a terrifying monster, they had a bunch of wrinkled up drug addicts in the underground. And the ending really disappointed me, it was really surprising though. Wait until paperback. Dont waste your'e money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts off well and then degenerates into absurdity","review":"I am a big fan of The Relic, both the book and the movie. Therefore, I read with great anticipation the sequel Reliquary. The first half is really interesting as the mysteries begin to unfold. But it ultimately disappoints by leading to a ridiculously over the top and absurd ending, including the obligatory wipe out of an elite military unit (in this case, Navy SEALS) and the Wrinklers sacred ceremonial hut of skulls. Preston and Child acknowledge Jennifer Toth's book The Mole People as the inspiration for their depiction of the tunnels beneath Manhattan, but in the Author's Note they seem to take everything in Toth's book at face value judging by their recommendation of it. I have read several reviews by people knowledgeable about subway tunnels and so forth and they dismiss Toth's references to the miles upon miles of abandoned tunnels and the decaying waiting room complete with piano and mirror lined walls as sheer fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"basically it's the Relic minus the originaltiy and suspense","review":"I don't know why all these people are raging about this book, it was all I could do to read it through to the end. The interesting things about the Relic (the museum setting, some interesting characters, some suspense as to origination of the moster) were ALL missing. What is left is the same old characters that don't seem nearly as interesting as 1st time (the neophyte NYC scuba diver was the only person I cared about and he is only in it at the beginning and end). The mutants are not as scary, and one would think the setting of lost undergrount tunnels of NY would be eery but really not that much of the book takes place there and it is still only a fraction as interesting as the Museum setting of the 1st book. All I can say is don't believe all the raves. If you want a good no-brainer suspense yarn, try the Cobra Event."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just when you thought Relic couldn't get any cornier.","review":"Even though Relic wasn't all that, it did have its moments. Just as this book did. Unfortunatly that moment was when I closed the book after reading the last page. Sure the whole \\"Stop the plant before it destroys our eco-system\\" dilemma was intriguing. But when the final confrontation between them and the *gasp* wrinkly people was over, I couldn't stop laughing. If your in the mood for a book that fails to follow plot lines, and makes absolutly no sense at all then by all means read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous read!!!","review":"I've gotten hooked on the Preston/Child colaborations since reading \\"The Ice Limit\\".I saw the movie \\"The Relic\\" and wasn't too thrilled about reading the book. I knew I needed to read it before I could read \\"The Reliquary\\". Hollywood can really trash a good book while translating it to film. In this case-very rare-the sequel blew me away. I've ordered another book to learn more about the underground dwellers in N.Y. city-fascinating! I plan on reading all of their books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliquary Completes the Relic Story, in Fine Style","review":"I'm not much into \\"There's a monster - let's separate so he can kill us one at a time\\" books. RELIC was interesting but sort of predictable [akin to the mummy seeking Tanna leaves!]. RELIQUARY on the other hand, provides a more logical, rational story. Preston and Child have obviously done their homework on NYC's underground people [Mole People] and the tale reads as plausible. Their description of the Crystal Pavilion is most memorable. More important, at the end of the story, I relished the seemingly complete intermeshing of all main themes of the book. My only hope is that the FILM VERSION will not screw up a good tale! Thanks, guys! Now, out of the sewers and onto another topic. Please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It ain't The Relic","review":"With the heart-racing, action-packed, rollercoaster-ride that The Relic was, it's a shame that what could have been a great sequel fell flat. What's with the sewer people? How can you go from an underground hybrid monster to a bunch of deformed sewer people? How scary is that? New York City has thousands of them! I like Preston and Child's writing, but Reliquary lacks the suspense, horror, and non-stop action of The Relic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sequel with new ideas!!!!!!!","review":"I was leery of this book a little, because I was afraid this was just going to be \\"Relic\\" in a slightly different setting.Boy was I wrong. The stakes are higher, the critters more numerous, and the thrills are undiminished.Give credit to the authors for coming up with different critters, not just more of the same ones from \\"Relic.\\" The monsters have evolved as much as the storyline, so that while it feels a continuation of the original, it really is a substantial change from that original.I was a little disappointed with the big surprise, not so much because it ruins the plot (it didn't at all for me)but because I saw it coming from the moment the first hint was dropped, and was kind of waiting for the reveal which confirmed my expectations.If you liked \\"Relic\\" READ THIS BOOK. It really is the next stage of a story worth savoring."},{"rating":"2","title":"suspense at it's best","review":"Preston & Childs have secured their place as top suspense writers with their latest \\"Reliquary\\".Following in the tremendous footsteps of \\"Relic\\", the sequal \\"Reliquary\\" surpasses the high standard of it's predesesor. This book starts you back in the old museum and also takes you on a wickedly wild trip through the underground New York. With returning characters like Margo Green and Agent Pendergast this book pics you right up and holds you until the dramatically twisted end. This was truely an excellent suspense thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"AL()ENS MEETS THE LOST WORLD","review":"Ok, I loved Relic, and all of the \\"jurassic\\" sagas, So I was quite excited about this book, and This book was amazing! It reminded me of the film AL()ENS, but with amazing elements of Jurassic park, with action in every chapter, it was like someone nuked me with emotion!

It KICKS ass! and I mean it"},{"rating":"2","title":"-> Reliqary Review","review":"Reliquary is none other of that of The Relic if you are expecting alot of inside about The Relic creature you may be mistaken. Reliquary goes more indepth into the secrets that lie in underground Manhatten where \\"Moles\\" aka Homeless people live, eat and learn. I do not want to go that far into the book as the hole point in reading a book is to find out. But I will state that I enjoyed the book and both The Relic & Reliquary were interesting and fasinating. I cannot wait for the motion picture sequal Reliquary. If you were interested in The Relic and want to find out what acctuly created \\"The Relic\\" you should pick up the sequal to Douglas Preston & Lincoln Child \\"Reliquary\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"I love this book and was thrilled to read another time.

I recently decided to start at the beginning! I liked this one even more than Relic!! My favourite authors ever!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Going and Not as Intriguing","review":"I really tried getting into this book. I pushed myself to get even halfway through it. But, it never reeled me in like other Preston/Child books have. They usually snag me from the very beginning but not this one. I liked how all the characters from The Relic have stayed the same, but the mystery, the intrigue, and the adventure was missing... or at least sparse. As a sequel to The Relic it would have been nice to have semblance of similarity, but there was nothing similar whatsoever. Moving on."},{"rating":"1","title":"very dessapointing","review":"Even when the plot and the suspence of the story are just fine, it seems that the characters stroll until the middle of the book to find out just what everybody already knew at the end of the movie.

Just too dumb. I enormously enjoyed the first book, but this one just pulled the plug for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Experience!!","review":"The book was in great shape (brand new, no discolored pages) and I received it quicker than anticipated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just bad, worst of the series","review":"After reading all the books in the series, I'm used to the ridiculous endings and contrived plot twists, but his one had all that plus some tedious action sequence that couldve been left out. The only things that redeemed this novel just a little were the descriptions of the underground tunnels and the Pendergast character.Who they used for the \\"bad guy\\" in this one was absurd. It just wouldn't be possible for him to have kept what he was doing a secret, especially from those who'd worked with him in the past. This book was a real let-down. There are a few books in the series that are better but, unfortunately, for context it helps to have read this one first."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good sequel.","review":"Although not as good as THE RELIC, RELIQUARY holds well on its own. Still plenty of suspense to leave my fingers numb. Overall a well written novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing read!","review":"If you enjoyed the Relic, and read it in one day because you wouldn't put it down, READ THIS BOOK!! It moved well, as you began to wonder what Pendergast was doing while D'Agosta was going crazy 'topside', you turned the page and found out. The Relic, i thought would be impossible to top, but somehow they have only made this story better, but by filling in the holes they left us questioning earlier...we learned more."},{"rating":"2","title":"reliquary doesn't surpass relic, but is a worthy sequel","review":"Relic and its sequel remind me of alien and aliens. In the first, you have a thriller about a single creature that seems to be unstopable, while in the sequel, they are dropped left and right, with a larger emphasis on action. That's not to say one style is better than the other. Reliquary has all the techno-jargon you've come to expect from preston and child, but unlike Michael Crichton, they are horror writers at heart. and horror you get, with equal amounts of suspence and gore. Occasionaly, the characters fall a little close to stereotype, with a cool professional FBI man and a street smart NY cop, but do not compromise the story. If you want a satisfying thriller, you can always count on Preston and Child, I'm waiting eagerly for the next one, guys!one last note, If you have only seen the movie of relic, read relic before you read this. Otherwise the story will be paradoxal to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Letdown","review":"Nothing like Relic.

A must read from me now on to the next book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"overdone","review":"So much was repeated from RELIC. I felt that reading the first book was wasted.

Don't bother reading this one. Rehashes things from the first book -- gives you \\"revelations\\" that were discovered in \\"Relic\\". The characters weren't fleshed out -- very two dimensional. And the ending.... RIDICULOUS!!!! The only thing I liked about his book was the fact that Pendergast plays a more central role, and I did like him. I had to force myself to finish this book -- maybe I shouldn't have, I would probably have liked it better if I didn't!!!! Read their \\"Mount Dragon\\" if you liked Relic.

I had to read the next chapter but neglected my tasks to do so. The authors gave substantiating data on the underground of Manhattan. However the ending was not in the characters' former behavior. Although it was a true page turner it lacked a believable ending. This book was not as good as The Relic nor the Book of the Dead the I have read by the authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read!","review":"I didn't think this book was as good as Relic, but then again, how could it be.

The author includes a lot of great items in the kit such as eye charts, a book, audio CD's, and cards with all the different eye exercises.HOWEVER, after adding up ALL the time it would take me EACH day to complete all the exercises, it would have been about 3-4 HOURS OF EXERCISES EVEDRYDAY!!I understand that natural vision improvement is something that involves a lot of dedication every day, but I'm sorry I just simply do NOT have this much time EVERY DAY to dedicate to performing the different eye exercises. Additionally, I felt that some of the exercises were poorly explained and were difficult or confusing to perform, therefore I do NOT recommend this kit. I am purchasing a different eye exercise book that got excellent reviews therefore I hope to have more success with that one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Epic Failure","review":"What a scam!I was looking for eye exercises, not something with back, neck exercises and massage therapy.Very dissappointing.Meir Schneider you failure.Google Yoga excercises and do the body stretching, there is no need to buy this product.( for those that believe body yoga improves eye sight)Those who genuinely are loking for eye excercises to improve the muscles in the eyes..... this product fails miserably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not something anyone really needs to see. Not funny at all.","review":"Well this movie was looked like it was filmed by handheld commercial Video cameras from the early 80's, Or maybe low grade security cameras. After that..... IT GETS WORSE. Very low budget haunted house - possessed teenagers movie, dead comming back to life with terrible makeup, and poor acting and dialog. But hey, all the money they saved on filming and script was apparently put into a fund to get 2 lesbian girls to get half naked and kiss on the floor behind the bed, and get the blonde (who's not nearly as busty as she appears on the cover) to do a minute long Topless chest scrub down while the group nerd stares at here thru the giant bathroom door peephole, then later as a topless zombie. This Movie so not worth the effort to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book!!!","review":"ok well this is one of my fave books ever and eventually revell iz one of my fave characters even though he's evil. well this is the 2nd book in the midnight secrets series and this time kendra thought she destroyed revell with her powers but that isnt the case. eventually she thought he was really evil even though she was really attracted 2 him bcuz of his good looks. well even though months later she 4gets about him she misses him alot and then discovers that revell returns and is still alive. then a new girl arrives after kendra's sister lauren leaves for switzerland 2 attend school. soon kendra grows suspicius of ariane and thinks she is stealing her stuff and the problem is she is gettin more attracted to revell everey time she meets him at night. until later she discovers the real truth and is shocked to learn about her stepfather graham and revell. but you have 2 buy thiz book 2 find out what happens!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Hits","review":"I remember when this album came out first time round in the 1980s, before CD, on vinyl. It was a great pleasure to listen then, as it is now.Not that it isn't worth the money ($17) as this is a CD that any music lover would want to play again and again, but there are now newer hit's collections by Rogers that cost the same and contain more songs, so it might be worth checking them out."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved these...classic","review":"I am 35 years old and I played with these when I was little and I loved them!

She was excited beyond question. But one thing kept her from liking this school. Mobs of angry Whites were gathered outside the school and were cursing and threatening the nine black students. One mob chased after her threatening to hang her. See what she does to survive a whole school year with all the harassment.This book sparked my intrest on intergration. It tells the true story on how Melba Beals could survive such brutal conditions. It also intrested me with the descriptions about the main events. The only downfall to this book is that Melba rambles on and on about many things. She repeats certain things in every chapter making it redundent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best and saddest book","review":"Warriors is one of the best book i've read in a long time. My reading teacher had us read this book. This is the first book my whole class has atually finished. One of the most memorable parts of the book for me was her courage and the fact that she went back there just to be abused everyday. I admire Melba and the others courage to make it throughout the whole year. This book I would recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good History Read","review":"This book is a great read if you every have wondered how someone made it through intergration in the 50's in Little Rock, Arkansas."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was very enlightened by this book. It was AMAZING!","review":"It was very hard to learn what these students had to go through to get a decent education they desired so very much. they had to give up many things to attend Little Rock's Central High School. They also had to take so much physical and verbal abuse from the white students there. The author gives you an idea of what it was like to go through that every day. It was a truly wonderful book. I really couldn't put it down. I sincerely believe that Melba was a true warrior. Definanatly deserves five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's an amazing book!","review":"When I read this book I really realized happened in Little Rock in the year 1957.

I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys history and drama in the same book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out - this edition is abridged","review":"The information on this edition says \\"School and Library Binding\\" ... what it doesn't warn you of is that this is *not* the original text.

The author does an amazing job of telling a story that must be heard by all-teenagers, adults, everyone. I had a very hard time putting it down, although I think most readers would have to be over the age of 12 to fully comprehend everything this REMARKABLE book has to offer. Five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated to hate it.","review":"Yes, I did not like this book. I feel like I should have, it's a great memoir of Melba's trials and tribulations while integrating with the rest of the black students into the school, but I couldn't bring myself to like it. I just could not stand the way it was written. It seems to fall into such a repetitive cycle of self-pity and \\"things will get better, oh wait, they aren't\\" that I started to not care at all. The first half of the book held my attention and my emotions, but as it dragged on in it's repetition I just felt less and less. I know she wanted to write about everything that happened to her to show how bad it was, but I feel like if she had cut back on things and just focused more heavily on certain events that she did include that it would have better held on to my emotions than being continually bombarded with incident upon incident until I was numbed into a state of not caring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This story was quite boring and and the author lacked the ability to make the reader want to keep reading. I definitely do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling voice...","review":"This is an amazing book, compellingly narrated through Beals' diaries from her youth. Her first-person experience of one of the highly-charged, ugly parts of American history opened my eyes to the reality of and struggle against racism that exists even to today. I was horrified and humbled that events such as those experienced by Beals happened within relatively recent history. I fell in love with Beals' grandma - a woman of true wisdom, integrity, and encouragement. My hat off to Melba Patillo Beals for an amazing, compelling narration of our history. Thank you for helping me see through the eyes of a strong and struggling child walking into the face/voice/fist of hatred."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!!","review":"This movie starts out alright, with some good chase scenes and a few shoot-outs, but then it just becomes incredibly boring. Detroit 9000 becomes so slow paced, that it will put you to sleep.SNOR-FEST.....ZZZZZzzzzzzzzz"},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't live up to the hype","review":"After seeing a preview in a theatre of this re-release, I was intrigued, mainly because it didn't have any of the usual '70s black action stars (Fred Williamson, Richard Roundtree, et al) in it. I though maybe this was The Great Lost Blaxploitation Film. I was wrong. It's just not that great. It's got a good plot and good intentions, but a mediocre script, some remarkably gratuitous scenes of violence and nudity (even for this genre) and atrocious acting by everybody except the two leads (who struggle valiantly but in vain) keep this on the level of a cheap made-for-TV movie. Sorry, folks, it just doesn't live up to the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try to stay AWAKE !","review":"I only gave this movie a chance because i'm a big Tarantino fan and he claims this is worth a watch. Wrong! This movie is so boring and the acting is terrible. It starts out with a group of people pulling off a heist and it's the worst heist ever put on film. Then the rest of the movie is trying to figure out who has seen or heard anything about this caper on the streets. A chase / shootout scene at the end and wondering if the white cop on the case was crooked or not. Only thing interesting about this movie is seeing the Detroit skyline missing the renaissance building since ive spent alot of time there since 2006. To wrap this review up if you are thinking about viewing this movie DON'T ! you can find something better to do with your time i'm sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amusing - good for a laugh","review":"I happened across this one in the university theatre a month or two ago. It's definitely worth a laugh, and would make for an amusing evening at home. But greatest on foot chase of all time?

The main plot revolves around the existence of a secret clan devoted to allegedly other offspring of Jesus. Uhhhh, yeah, sure, ok. All of the major events of the twentieth century were manufactured by the cult to ensure that it's ancient prophecies come true.Worst of all, the author has set up the finish for a sequel to this atrocity. Don't let it happen - avoid this tree waster."},{"rating":"2","title":"A couple of flaws, but good momentum","review":"Enjoyed this book, look hopefully forward to some kind of sequel. Main character Jack Dunphy was interesting and humanized (though I don't see the comparison to Bond at all). Good tying together of the messianic mythology. Dunphy makes a couple of dumb mistakes though, that I found hard to believe he would make, even during (or especially during) the heat of the chase. Still, started and finished it in one night, so must have been pretty good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read when considering/implementing EJBs","review":"This is a must read for everyone who either considers or is implementing EJB-based software.

In a team setting I would make this a mandatory reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved me much time","review":"If you are already experienced EJB developer then you will appreciate the good wisdom and advice in this book. I found it is not a problem solving kind of book but a problem avoiding one. Read before you start your next project and like me you will save many hours of frustration.I give 4 stars because some chapters are not as useful and overall the book could have better organization. But these are small points. Definitely you should read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"god must hate us all","review":"Please don't get this cd. It's a waste of money and very boring.

It was him and Billy Strayhorn, who wrote it:chillingly beautiful. Strays piano is sparse and shimmering,The Brute plays his lush vibratto as always, just more so-if that is possible. That's how it goes on occasion, literally hitting all the right notes. I used to have the album, and ordered the CD for that one song. Yes, there are some other nice tunes, but it's more a grab bag than not.

Now, is the presentation of such elements as the suicide of one of the asylum-seekers or the character of the Russian mobster challenging enough to turnIllegalinto a great fiction movie ? In my opinion, no. The movie is instructive yes and also fascinating sometimes but let's just call it a documentary with a heart. Already forgotten.

It was probably recorded in HD, but it was burned onto this DVD as 16:9 inside 4:3. Additionally, I would say the transfer wasn't done very well.

Published on 2.13.61, Henry Rollins' publishing company, it suffers from the same general malaise that Mr. Rollins' work most suffers from, and that is a lack of the graceful act of self-editing. That said, perhaps it deserves respect simply for the very fact that in-your-face, self-published punks had the all-out nerve to just go ahead and do it. After all, Ms. Cervenka is certainly one of the originals of the lets-get-this-perfectly-not-too-straight movement. Read it for the anger and angst, if you must. And for the strange little drawings.

All of Calloway's major soloists from that time come to the fore, most notably, as the subtitle suggests, Chu Berry on tenor, but also Chauncy Haughton on clarinet and Mario Bauza on trumpet. Dizzy Gillespie played on some of these 78's but I wouldn't swear that he takes any solos.In addition to the excellent soloing, listeners will experience the tight, powerful swing of this band in what to my ears is its heyday (though Calloway himself said that his band of the early & mid Forties was even better), as well as a bit of the leader's famous hamming, on pieces such as \\"Geechie Joe\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"French Classic!","review":"Alma Lach was a contemporary of sorts of Julia Child, having published her books during the 60's and 70's, however she was greatly overshadowed by Julia's landmark classic (Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Vol 1) and numerous subsesquent books and tv series, and Alma has been nearly forgotten.I find both authors very helpful on making classic French dishes, and will consult both authors, and others prior to cooking a particular recipe, to see the subtle or different variations to consider.

It has a funny plot, great cinamatography by Busby Burkley, dance numbers by Ginger and Fred, and early-Hollywood cheese like women dancing on airplane wings during flight. Remember, Ginger did everything Fred did, but she did it backwards in 3 inch heels. Haha. But this movie is a classic. The Burkley stuff is a true feast for the eyes. A must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music is first, dancing is second","review":"The situation and plot is extremely tenuous. A love affair wrapped up in musical clothes. The interest of the film is the music itself, the crazy idea of making dancers dance on flying planes, and the perfect art of Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire in their music, singing, a little, and dancing. They are known for that and they probably produced here one of the first musical and dancing films of some great value. The plot is music and dance. The story is music and dance. The story line is music and dance. And it is very entertaining by its creativity.

It would have helped to rank the projects as easy, medium or difficult but there is no indication. The second project, building a stereoscopic 3-D viewer was even worse. It was completely wrong and didn't have the desired 3-D effect at all. It was as if both of these \\"experiments\\" were written without them ever being attempted by a child of any age!!

I have over six hundred records from all categories, classic, jazz, punk, modern - you name it. But among the top ten of them is this.

Some people may think of them as a one hit wonder, but if you liked \\"Rebirth Of Slick (cool like dat)\\", you'll love the whole album. Even a decade later, this is still one of the most unique albums I own, rap or not. The only current group I know similar to them might be \\"Jurassic 5\\".

The case appears to be a lock, and the client guilty, but slowly Drummond proceeds to unwind it. It takes some surprising turns and Haig's witty remarks in the consciousness of Drummond are reminiscent of DeMille's John Cory. The interplay between the characters is well written and as a whole, Haig doesn't go to far overboard to support gays in the military. He's basically fairly even handed and doesn't try to beat the reader down with his personal view. Drummond, as a character, gave me my John Cory fix without Haig being Nelson DeMille. I've been missing that and I'll probably work my way through the rest of Haig's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I have recently become a BIG fan of Brian Haig.

Perhaps it would have been better to have Martin Caidin write the novel first and then base the movie on his story. I have seen the movie numerous times. It is a fascinating premise with huge potential which, unfortunately was not fulfilled. The movie has perhaps the worst directing I have ever seen. Some of the acting is incredibly forced and there are unexplained holes in the movie which the book fills in. But I would recommend the book to anyone whether you have seen the movie or not. It is a good, although short read (230 pages).

A provocative and influential film director. \\"Kenneth who!?\\" This collection covers the latter part (1964-2002) of the underground raconteur's astounding, nearly 60-year long career in avant-garde filmmaking.

This does not detract from the enjoyment of this disc, however. Several of the pieces (e.g. Scythia, Hope of Ages and Rain Suite) stand out but all of the tracks are good.

The acting was very good, particularly Dakota Fanning, the story was interesting, the effects were exciting, and the characters were likeable (most of them, anyway). My only caveat is the very end of the movie, which just fizzles. The last fight scene is very cool, but after that the characters seem a bit lost as to what to do.

Too heavy of a reliance on an Asian city backdrop and overbearing distracting music to provide ambience.(2.) Excessive wire use (people and things flying around) to the point of ridiculousness to provide action.(3.) Choppy editing of head shot jumping to head shot as actors couldn't get beyond exchanging single memorized bland lines.(4.) Dakota needs to take artistic control of her movies - she's too good for this. She also needs to develop real life experiences outside of Hollywood to expand and be a convincing young adult. All she could offer were forced, contrived acted facial expressions to represent her maturation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time and money","review":"Wow where to begin. Whoever edited this movie really was a fan of art house editing. Not the good kind of editing but the really choppy, lets play around with different cuts and fading techniques and see how it turns out. Technical issues aside, the movies drags along save for the 2 or 3 cool action sequences. The last 30 minutes felt like an eternity, and to add to that, none of the plot elements EVER get resolved.

The direction, the dialogue and the overall content were all so very wretched for me to tolerate.Watching Dakota and Chris interact with each other was such a bore. I said to myself, had this been the first movie that these two ever done it would probably be their last. This movie had such a low budget quality to it that it made these experienced actors look....callow. I generally like watching movies that these two have been in. Needless to say I was disappointed and I believe this movie was a bad career move for these actors.The one scene where those Asian guys could yell to the point of making your ears bleed was enough for me.

If you are interested in exquisite art and Charleston history, by all means, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute lightwieght tote","review":"I ordered this bag to stash my gym clothes and sneakers. The pattern is very pretty, asian inspired. It's made of a lightweight plasticy weave that reminds me of outdoor tarp material. It was a bit thinner than I expected, but despite that the bag held up fine with clothes, sneakers etc over a year and a half of use. The smaller makeup bag came in handy for keeping track of hair and makeup items. I think the bags worked out very well, and I can easily wipe them clean, or recycle them if they ever do come apart. But so far they are still in great shape. As a bonus, the manufacturer added an asian design silk purse about 5\\" wide by 8 \\" long for free. It is really pretty as well, and I have brought it to several weddings. A nice touch by the Anne Millie company."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a very helpful start, if you want to learn statistics","review":"I am sorry if this review may happen to hurt the feelings of people concerned. But this book really is not helpful for someone looking to be introduced to statitics. Throughout the book, important concepts are introduced randomly, in disorganized way.

One workable approach is the building block approach: DON'T PANIC; just break a complex task, such as studying statistics, into achievable chunks or steps. Krieger's book is an excellent first step, except for two minor mistakes in the book; they are not serious problems for the alert reader-student. The first minor mistake is a reversal of computation numbers, and the second minor mistake is a reference to the wrong table or chart. With many other publications, I might ask: doesn't the author-editor care enough to proofread and edit? In fact, finding the mistakes is an excellent exercise in acute observation for the future statistician-scientist. As an objective reader-student, I agree: Melanie's book is a logical, well organized, clearly written book. Five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"Alexander Kent is all one needs to know a true writer of the sea and adventure. Sometimes it was like reading Tolkiens books.

Right now, a 2 pack of filters for the HAP412 are going for about $31. Considering that's almost the cost of the purifier (with 1 filter included), I'd suggest trying a purifier with a reusable/washable filter.It's quiet enough on the lowest setting and seems to do an OK job purifying but ultimately the filters are way too expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Bought this a year and a half ago to air out a small guest room in our house (we sometimes have a problem with neighbors'secondhand smoke).

Yuk!I replaced the filters immediately, but then I noticed a strong chemical smell coming from it that gave me headaches and a bad metallic taste in the mouth.Unfortunately it's too late to return this.

I don't know what's wrong with Universal; they've never really cared about this movie, it seems. -By that I mean they've never bothered to letterbox it. This movie never looked all that good on any of its video releases; I seem to remember it always looking pretty lousy, even on laserdisc. It's such a funny and exciting little thriller with a great (and sleepless) Goldblum, a tough and sexy Pfeiffer, an even sexier Harrold, a nasty Bowie, and lots of famous faces in cameos. -Enough reasons for a DVD, I should think !."},{"rating":"1","title":"Into a Very Long, Boring Night","review":"This is one boring film, with a pseudo-fey style that think tries to fool its audience into thinking it's cool. I love Ffieffer and Goldbum in their past and future work but they seem to be sleepwalking through a script that has flat dialogue that has him asking her over and over again to just let him go home--as everyone, but David Bowie, should have done before this film wrapped up. The eighties were great and riveting and \\"Into the Night\\" is not indicative of any of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feast Your Eyes On Jeff...Because Your Brain Will Switch Off","review":"My god, Jeff Goldblum is a fine specimen of manhood with his beautiful face, fine physique, controlled mania and wry way of speaking. But this very dull movie, filmed in an ugly fashion so popular during the 80s (very anti-art), with an absurd and tedious plot about some jewelry and a mysterious shady lady with whom our hero becomes entangled, leaves so much to be desired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome and lots of fun...","review":"This is one of the best comedy/adventure/chase flicks ever made. Lots of fun with some interesting twists. Don't miss it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty... car chase, shoot 'em up, and little plot and character development","review":"I watched this late last night on cable while ironically suffering from my own insomnia. I probably saw it long ago in the '80's or early 90's but it is entirely forgettable. It seemed like Jeff Goldblum was desperately trying to instill some depth and substance, a second layer to this thin and linear story. Michelle Pfeiffer is young and sparklingly pretty in this but put in a fairly lame character role that gives her little room to actually act. Or perhaps she was simply inexperienced and figured she was jsut there to look good. The Bowie cameo was interesting. The string of murders, and bloody trail left thru this movie and in that callous, slightly comedic '80's way is really off-putting to me. You know...the bumbling Iranians blowing away or drowning anything that moves. ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"80's nostalgia but no value","review":"Goldblum & Pfeiffer were so young here. It's nice to see major names early in their career. Goldblum's character has insomnia which goes along with him sleeping through his performance. Funny moments weren't really funny. Why did this even try to be a comedy, drama, Moonlighting episode? Bowie is amazing as an actor but he really serves no purpose with his barely 8 minutes of screen time. The 80's soundtrack is cringe worthy. This movie has value for a Bowie fan & for some brief nudity of Pfeiffer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another awesome John Landis movie","review":"This a another great John Landis movie. You have cameos by people like David Bowie, Dan Aykroyd, Carl Perkins (Writer of Elvis song \\"Blue Suede shoes), Bruce Mc Gill, and John Landis Himself. There is even a music video with BB King and featuring Jeff Goldblumm and Michelle Pfeiffer. John Landis also interviews BB King on here as well. The only thing I don't like about this movie is that the sound is mono and not Dolby or DTS surround. So if you are a fan of John Landis movies, or Jeff G. or Michelle P. or even BB King then this is a good video to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Into The Night with a young Michele Pfeiffer/Jeff Goldblum","review":"This is a must own DVD in your home DVD collection! Movie is well made, and very funny (with some mystery and suspense) and features the acting of a young Michele Pfeiffer and Jeff Goldblum (and other up and coming current stars). For whatever reason this movie didn't garner too much press when the movie was first released, but is definitely worth the purchase. First rate!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this movie","review":"Back when this movie came out on VHS I use to watch it over and over again. Both the stars are wonderful. It is about a guy who can not sleep and so he goes out and ends up finding himself in a little mini adventure with a very attractive women. She has a older boyfriend that was sick, there was a secret passage way, and a elvis impersonater in there somewhere. Then an appearance from Jake who use to sell exercise equipment on late night TV. Then there were some bad guys in there chasing them. It was a fun movie and I really enjoyed it. Both Michelle and Jeff went on to make other good movies after this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Film","review":"A classic film of the 80's, INTO THE NIGHT combines humor with mayhem as well as excitement and suspense. Goldblum is perfect as an insomniac who desperately needs some thrill in his life and Pfeiffer's character is just what he needs. Together they help each other out while surviving a jewel caper.

A dozen or more famous actors come and go in roles that are each hilarious while our hero and heroine live through one crisis after another. Goldblum is great as the engineer who \\"can't get any sleep\\" while Pfeiffer surpasses her own beauty to deliver a performance of a woman who goes through more \\"except this\\" and \\"except that\\" and \\"if only\\" situations than you can shake a stick at.

Furthermore, and most importantly, it contains the absolutely \\"must know\\" high-yield facts in every subject in Step 1's coverage and fun mnemonics to go along with them. This book also has a review of review books which helps you decide which books are best for you. It also includes a form you can submit mnemonics and suggestions with to improve next year's edition.

If you can cover everything in this book you'll only know the basics, but at least you'll know ALL OF the basics ! That should be enough to get you through Step 1 with a good score.Another great thing about First Aid is its fully comprehensive guide to review resources, both books and on the web.

You'll only hear most of these great songs on a Paul solo tour and it's captured here in excellent quality. This DVD is a must for every KISS and Paul fan alike. If you missed this tour don't worry, this DVD comes through. \\"Goodbye\\" is the final and best track here. A must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show. Shoddy DVD production","review":"Great show, lousy job on getting it to DVD. Regardless of what Mr. Louis Antonelli says, there is NO excuse for not having a default soundtrack selected if one just chooses to play the DVD. The aspect ratio is also a mess. No excuse to not show in 16:9 format when you wind up cutting the tops off heads on half the close ups and cutting the bottoms off guitars when zooming in on guitar solos. Just plain sloppy. Also, doesn't look like the aspect ratio is even correct on some shots as things look slightly shorter/fatter than they should be. Video seems to be overcompressed as well with very visible compression blocks/artifacts throughout as well as horizontal banding on some shots. A consumer product like Canopus Pro would have done a better job than what was used for this DVD.That said, it's a fantastic performance by Paul Stanley that should not be missed. Just a shame that he didn't find someone with a little more experience producing DVD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of One Live Kiss","review":"I'm in the process of sending this DVD back to the seller.

I don't know how much of it was \\"doctored\\" at the studio, but he sound here is simply nearing perfection. All instruments are crystal clear.The House Band performs admirably, seasoned pros like they are. The first songs begins with the usual modern trend of headache-inducing editing but, fortunalety, editing slows down soon after.Of course, Paul can be very annoying sometimes, moments when you can sense his ego taking the world... But these are minor claims compard to the amazing music you'll get in this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Concert EVER!!","review":"First off...I got to see Paul Stanley live on his Live To Win Tour in 2006 in Baltimore & I honestly have to say that show was THE BEST concert I have ever been lucky enough to attend.Now on to the DVD, One Live Kiss. I got to see the first full screening of Paul's DVD at the Dayton,OH Kiss Expo on Saturday, Oct. 11th. This DVD is SO worth the wait. Watching this transported me right back to Baltimore, Oct. 26, 2006. This DVD allows the watcher to experience the phenomenon that is Paul Stanley in the ultimate surroundings. Lou Antonelli captured perfectly that up-close & personal, intimate feeling that Paul's shows all had. This movie puts you right there front & center. It makes you forget, at times, that this is a movie & not live. You catch yourself wanting to clap & jump up & down just like at the real show.Lou Antonelli & Paul Stanley have outdone themselves. They have put together an amazing show. This DVD is definitely the next best thing to actually being there live."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO AUDIO","review":"Just a heads up - I just recieved my SECOND copy of this dvd -Amazon is AWESOME with returns, by the way.

Unfortunately, the end results of this research is a very dry and somewhat boring academic study of Chinatown gangs.

A truly scary premise especially now that the machines have taken over (sorry, that's a Cyberdyne joke).This made-for-TV remake was broadcast live in 2000 and I was most impressed. I am a technical flaw-spotting fiend and I only spotted one glitch - I'll let you find it.The plot is already explained so I'll address the cast - well chosen, and the production values - top-notch. Live TV is most unforgiving and this was pulled-off in good fashion.Sadly this scenario has been supplanted by terrorism but nevertheless, for those who recall the truly excellent 1964 version, this modern take still manages to grip you with suspense. Once I finish this review I am ordering a copy. You should do the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Thing Clooney's Ever Done","review":"Good remake. I think what's remarkable about this version is that it was done LIVE twice on the same day (once each for the West Coast & East Coast). What really would have been COOL, Attention WARNER BROS HOME VIDEO, is if BOTH perforamnces would have been put on the DVD. In fact, I would have gladly paid more for a 2 DVD set containing BOTH performances. Warners, please reissue this DVD, and include BOTH performances of Failsafe. Thank you. P.S. Failsafe made it to T.V. in 2000, months before 9/11. Had the airing been scheduled after 9/11, it never would have made it to T.V. The dialog regarding New York would have been deemed way to harsh, and I would have agreed with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"MY GRADE: C plus to B minus.","review":"This picture is an homage to the original 1964 \\"Fail Safe\\" but is quite the disappointment in that it doesn't offer much of anything new.

What an awesome cast. Now go see the original.This was made for television and was purposefully presented in black and white.CINEMATOGRAPHY: B minus; STORY/PLOTTING: C to C plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus; NUCLEAR DESTRUCTION THEMES: B minus; OVERALL GRADE: C plus to B minus; WHEN WATCHED: mid July 2012."},{"rating":"2","title":"FailSafe Remake","review":"This is the re-make of FailSafe starring George Clooney and Richard Dreyfuss. I am always going to go back to the original FailSafe starring Henry Fonda but the re-make is more than good and Clooney and Dreyfus shine, the story is again in black and white and pretty much holds to the original film.

I just re-read it for nostalgia's sake, and to see what I thought after reading many (too many) other books on Zen.This book was still a fresh, enjoyable read, and I gobbled it down in less than a week. I would say it's a compelling intro for people to latch onto and enjoy. Perhaps it's a bit sugary sweet; a light confection that draws you in with exotic tales of the great Asian masters, and intriguing, accessible koans.Shunryu Suzuki Roshi apparently said this when his American students built him a beautiful Japanese-style house: \\"...but why did you make it look Japanese???\\"Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Original, and Still the Best","review":"\\"Zen Flesh, Zen Bones\\" was the first book to bring Zen Buddhist koans to America. It is also the best. The translators have left these wonderful stories and teachings speak for themselves. If you have never read koans, they are bewildering stories that defy logic and shock the reader into a higher state of consciousness. They are especially wonderful to read after meditation or church. They are ancient stories, often describing the strange interactions between monks who challenge each other's claims to enlightenment. They seem as playful sparring of the mind, heart, and soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heals the mind","review":"The concepts in the writings helps you understand and deal with real life.

The light projects great and since he is only 5 weeks old i have it resting sideways so the projection is on the wall closer to him than the ceiling. Both ways the lighting is just enough.

Also, there are only 3 options on the select-a-show insert, each having three different shapes that only fade in and out in red, yellow, and green.

We called babyage and they were nice enough to refund the price of the toy (minus shipping of course) and then just told us to keep it (at that time we didn't know that it didn't work). Shortly thereafter we got an email from them asking to talk to them first before submitting our review on Amazon, so I sent them the same letter that I'm writing here and that was over 2 weeks ago and we have yet to hear from them.

I know just a smattering of spanish, but I have to say his charisma transcends the language barrier, and of course Luney Tunes' excellent work backs the charisma up.I've had the record for a while, had a bunch of MP3s before that, I listen to this record a few times a week at work, and it's not old yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"De Seguro el mejor cd del año por ahora","review":"Bueno primero que nada quiero introducirme, soy Yan Carlos Colon aka \\"Yanki\\" del Staff de ReggaetonLyrics.com.

Este cd es el mejor cd de lo q va del año y eso esta ya asegurado. El cd contiene 21 tracks, 18 siendo canciones, 2 el intro y outro y un interlude. La calidad de las pistas fueron excelentes. Dj Nelson, Urba, Fido, Monserrate, Luny Tunes y Nelly botaron la bola. El Feat. con Andy Montañez quedo tremendo! Un Duo para la historia tanto como para la Salsa como para el Reggaeton. Yankee como siempre experimentando con diferentes tipos de flows(estilos), siempre cantando con tonadas diferentes.

The script and direction lack the necessary punch for a psychological Western - further hindered by a low budget. Mitchum's solid presence cannot save this routine outing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mitchum can't save tedious, cliched B western","review":"Slow, cliche ridden, poorly paced excuse for a B-Western can't be saved even by Mitchum's strong presence. Overblown musical score, undeveloped secondary characters, uninspired photography. There have been many great movies made with the theme of a town tamer brought in to clean up a tough town, only to be despised for doing his job -- amongst the legion of great films along these lines I'd recommend \\"Warlock\\", with Henry Fonda, Richard Widmark and Anthony Quinn. This movie is not in that class. Definitely avoid it unless you are in need of a Robert Mitchum fix."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT WESTERN","review":"Robert Mitchum and Jan Sterling are wonderful in this kind of off beat western where the town hires Robert Mitchum to get rid of the bullies who run the town and don't mind shooting the citizens.

The video aspect is fine, but the experience ends up being like going to see one of your friend's friend's bands...you just want to leave at times but you can't, and your curiosity gets the best of you in the end. I won't be watching this doc over and over so I gave it one-less star than I would have if it was more informative and less about the drunk or high kids who attend the festival. I think it would be an excellent recap if instead of lumping the years together, why not release each year as its own DVD. That would provide time to look at the fans as much as the artists, and it would give time to some of the better acts that were at the festivals instead of a local trio playing outside their room. (No hate towards those bands, but there are a lot of established popular artists who never got represented by this doc at all.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"Avoid this company like the plaque.

It starts alarming and making a horrible sound (I thought it might explode), my husband again called the manufacturer and they sent out a part (sensor I think) it still doesn't work. Now we have to run the sink faucet on hot and the shower at the same time in order for it to work properly.So after two years of dealing with it my husband wanted to go with a regular water heater; but after seeing all the bad reviews we decided to just try another brand.

I had a minor outlet leak easily fixed with a new O-ring (and loads of walk-thru advice from tech service). Nine years on, I've had two elements go out within a few months of one another. That's better life than I got with tank-type units, and the failure was soft- I still had hot water, just not quite as hot. As before, diagnosed the problem with the supplied manual, called Seisco, and had parts in the mail same day. Cheerful, friendly, helpful...and they call back quickly!

Within 23 months both needed repairs. One leaked water, and the other stopped heating water. Since then within 11 months, we've had to replace the temperature probe two more times. The technician tries to blame problems on hard water. He said we should have replaced all 5 of the temperature probes the first time we had problems. So why didn't he send five replacements? It's hard to find plumbers who will work on them, so we are usually without hot water for a week by the time the part is sent. SEISCO says their tankless water heater can last up to 20 years, we would like to see it last longer than 23 months.

They replaced both of them with brand new units and they both managed to last 13 months this time (just outside of 1 year warranty of course).

It took the company almost a week to ship it to us- after many phone calls with them asking the same questions over and over. When we told them that the motherboard was actually smoking, we were told that there is NO WAY that could happen because of a treatment that they put on the board. We offered to send them a picture, but they declined. So here we are, about 5 months after replacing the motherboard and we are waiting for another one to be shipped. The motherboard they sent just fried and was smoking in the same area as the last one.

I thought for sure Stink Free would take care of the lingering smell. As suggested, I poured on Stink Free and let it sit. Oh. My. God. The perfume scent was SO overwhelming I got a headache and ended up bunking on the couch to get away from the bedroom! That's not even the worst part. After the product dried I sniffed the accident spots and now they smelled like urine AND baby powder. GAG!

One day, while he was out, we used the blacklight to find the marks and stink free to clean them. Under the blacklight, the urine shows up neon yellow. With one wipe, it erased the yellow, until the walls were all back to normal. When he came back in, he looked really confused as he sniffed around trying to find where he marked.

The second set had the same problem with two of the three. This problem may develop because none of the triangles snap together firmly in the storage position. That is an issue because two of the three go in the storage box upside-down. It is very difficult to put them in the box without the legs flopping down. I suspect the faulty triangles were returned before and stored improperly for a long time, which left the legs deformed.

You would be better off just researching curricula and paying for those. I partly blame myself for wasting my time on this book. I should have looked at the copyright date, which is 2000.

To remedy both you can go to Internet Archive for some of the sites and for the books you can ask the US Department of Education for their website.

The plot is intriguing (as always), but it's watching these two move through LA, playing off their odd partnership, watching each other's backs, solving the crime, and bringing as much order and justice as possible to an otherwise corrupt world that keeps me coming back.

The audiobook surprised me a little bit as I don't hear Elvis and Joe Pike speaking with a lisp when I hear it in my head, but that's what you get on this audiobook. A little disconcerting at first, but I got used to it. Also, the reader is not an Angelian as he can't pronounce Sepulveda or La Cienega correctly, just picky little things that bugged me. Didn't detract from the great story, however.

El Tamino 'a lo heroico' de RENE KOLLO canta Mozart como si se tratase de Wagner: incapaz de transmitir sensibilidad, y francamente fuera de sitio en este papel. La Reina de la Noche de EDITA GRUBEROVA rinde a gran nivel, aunque algun agudo no sale todo lo limpio que debiera. Notable el Papageno de HERMANN PREY, y un escalon por debajo el Sarastro de PETER MEVEN. Un lujo contar con JOSE VAN DAM para el papel de Orador. Completan el reparto de nombres conocidos la insuficiente Papagena de RERI GRIST y la segunda Dama de TRUDILESSE SCHDMIDT. Conviene citar tambien al casi inaudible Monostatos de GERHARD UNGER.

Which is surprising as Madea goes to jail the play is one of my favorites of Tyler's plays.This movie however strayed too far away from that premise. The sub-plot and plot were not cohesive. It was almost like watching two different movies.I would have enjoyed it more if Keisha's character had some interaction with Madea prior to going to jail. Especially since they did not go to jail until 3/4 into the movie. Prior to that, there was no connection between those people and what was going on with Madea.

It's like the author just took all of the Seventh Doctor's TV adventures, put them in a cocktail shaker and mixed them up, and then poured the mixture onto the page.The only thing in this book that I haven't seen before in another Doctor Who novel or episode is the character of Joseph Liebermann, who I hope we see again.

There is no CD and there is no website from where the pictures can be downloaded. This is unforgiveable in a book that presents itself as a learning text. Curiously, Mr. Beckham's website references a resource center for the book and refers the reader to a URL on page 4 of the book.

Most of the stories are based on real figures from Spanish history, but they are laced with just enough facts to allow the willing reader to research further, not with a tiresome assortment of schoolbook dates and names. Especially memorable are the story of invalid King Enrique of Castille, who tries to muster the strength to get out of bed and confront the greedy nobles who take advantage of his illness to plunder the kingdom; and of the \\"converso\\" Jew who, as a good Christian working for the Inquisition, faces the dilemma of initiating charges of heresy against his own daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn to play Irish concertina","review":"I couldn't start to play my concertina without this DVD.

The combination offer great insight into, not only what happened in 1991, but also of the events since. The combination goes a long way toward explaining the antagonism between the the political parties as well as how it is that they are able to justify their tactics.

Wright is probably the most sensible theologian I have ever read or listened to. In the field of NT surveys, his is a true masterpiece. Wright has such confidence in how he deals with the material available to him. His methods constantly prove extremely effective, even if they aren't always predictable. When he sets out to paint a picture of the first century world of Christians and Jews, one wonders if he has enough material to present a convincing argument; but by the time he's done, it almost feels as though he has transported the reader right into the events, not only into the midst of them but \\"inside\\" of them. I have not only learned many new things about the NT world from this book but have gained (or reenforced) knowledge in many other fields (e.g. epistemology and historiography) as well.

There are 639 plants covered, not just perennials, but annuals, bulbs, vines, and shrubs as well. So considering that there are thousands of varieties of flowers, the chances of finding a particular flower are slim. This book is better used without a specific plant in mind, but to browse through to get ideas of plants of a particular color.Also, there seems to be a warm climate bias. Many of the plants (not just annuals) are for zones 8 and up. I think northern gardeners would find this a frustrating book to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect format","review":"Wow...what a lot of fun. The three strips of mix-and-match flip pages are the perfect interactive format for letting your own eye experiment with different color combinations. The consistent quality of the photographs and color printing make it easy to compare how even subtle shifts in color have a powerful design impact. The author's own remarkable plant combinations on each strip are fascinating in themselves. Not just pretty pictures either- the back of each strip identifies the plant, descibes its culture and growing habits and also offers some very good suggestions for plant combinations. One of my all-time favorite garden design books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A note about the e-version","review":"This is simply a note about the e-version. The text was not thoroughly edited after being scanned from the book. For example, \\"came\\" is always spelled \\"carne,\\" and there are many other errors that make it occasionally hard to understand or guess what the correct word should be. It was distracting, and I feel like a full-priced e-book should have been carefully proofread-- or at least spell-checked!The book itself was excellent, though. It made a great read and great discussion for our book club."},{"rating":"2","title":"creative history","review":"It was this style of story telling that tuned me into history books rather than away from them.

But like some other writers of popular western history (especially Ian Frazier), he frequently shifts back and forth between historical narrative and anecdotes about his own travels through the region. The families' stories were severe and dramatic enough to be told on their own (especially those of the heartbreakingly inept Worsells). Raban's own misadventures in eastern Montana seem trivial and irrelevant by comparasion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to usual Raban standards","review":"Let me say first that I love Jonathan Raban's writing. I devoured Hunting Mister Heartbreak. Passage to Juneau was a great companion to my (rather pedestrian) cruise to Alaska. And I am currently in a vicarious voyage down the Great Mississippi via Old Glory. But Bad Land was a disappointment like the promises made by the railroads to those eastern European settlers. It was dry like the farming techniques meant to coax crops out of the half-sections. I just did not enjoy this to the extent that I have with other Raban books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Raban is no Wallace Stegner","review":"I was disappointed in the author's failure to capture the spirit of the settlers who sacrificed so much in their attempt to settle eastern Montana. He told their stories from a distance, and was quick to place blame. I kept speculating as to how Wallace Stegner might have told these poingnant stories. Stegner's roots and his love of the American west would have made him a much better voice for these 20th century pioneers."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was as dry as the Montana plains...","review":"This book is ideal for the rugged history major who loved reading required college history books. Raban has put a lot of hard work and research into this tale of the Northwest plains, but his interpretation of that research leaves much to be desired.I had to keep telling myself that this is a history book, not a novel. But even then, with the poor introductions and follow-throughs, the shifts in thought, and writing that reads as if no editor touched it, this is a book you'll want to read when there is nothing else around to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stream of Consciousness!","review":"My earlier acquaintance with Jonathon Raban's work lead me into this book with the hope that it would offer a well written and compelling discussion of his chosen subject. I'm dissappointed. It is a rambling stream of consciousness, discursive, lacking structure and focus. The reviews inside the front cover, from the Financial Times, Daily Telegraph, Sunday Times Spectator, and Scotland on Sunday - all suffer from the same quality of dubious veracity, that tainted the efforts of the railroad companies and the US Federal Government, to attract settlers to the featureless and infertile plains of Montana.I rate this book a waste of reading time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Montana history comes alive","review":"Living in Montana & having a mother born in the northeastern part of the state who told us many a story of'baking sun,' blizzards and wolves, I am quite familiar with all the towns & locals mentionedin this book.

The only inaccuracy is his mention of theAgricultural College in Missoula. This is wrong. The University of Montana is in Missoula and is NOTthe land grant, agriculture college. That is located at MSU in Bozeman, Mt. Makes one wonder abouthis other factual accuracy. All in all, a must read for Montana history lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Homesteaders Were Tough!","review":"Raban tells a great story of how homesteaders were lured from eastern cities to the Great Plains by the railroad interests. They promised arable land and a scientific method of farming that would produce plenty from marginal ground. My favorite anecdote is how the \\"section farmers\\" would use the wire of their boundary fences as crude telephone conductor so they could ring each other and make dinner invitations. This is a great book that reads like a novel. Everytime I drive through the plains and see abandoned farms I think of this book and the people who once lived there."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY MISTAKE WAS . . . . . .","review":"My mistake was trying to read this in the summer!!!

Ranchers were expecting their homesteads in eastern Montana to support twice as many cattle as we now know to be possible. They were expecting rain to provide sufficient growth to the rangeland grasses for a successful life. The modern day drive through this country is beautifully described.

My marriage had deteriorated because I didn't give enough time to my family. Despite the excessive amount of time I spent working, my company suffered financial setbacks that provoked a hostile takeover - with no job security for me. Wile I was in a deep depression, I received this book. Even though I had not been open to \\"self-help\\" before, I thought I had better read it anyway.

She sings with her usual impeccable technique, distinctive timbre and interpretive authority throughout. However, the omission of most music for the other characters (Valerie Masterson's somewhat white-voiced \\"V'adoro, pupille\\" notwithstanding) results in a certain monotony of effect--there are better ways to introduce Dame Janet's art to a newcomer than to hear her sing seventy minutes worth of one Handel role. Cutting the opera in this way also makes one appreciate Handel's sense of musical and dramatic variety within the confines of the opera seria form; Caesar's arias are all of a piece and quite different from the music for the other main characters, Cleopatra and Ptolemy. Their effect is measurably reduced by their being deprived of their setting in the whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits Great","review":"Lost my original 135L lens hood after a photo shoot and looked everywhere for a replacement.

This handy tool is helpful in figuring out chords to a song. That's mainly why I bought it.

It greatly simplifies a lot of music theory and puts the information directly into your hands for composition and other considerations like transposition and so much more. It distills the important stuff down to something graspable even for amateurs like me.I gave copies of the book to my two nephews who are studying music now and I'm told their instructors agreed with me when I said, I wish I'd had this book 30 years ago.

It has 12 pages of information that tells how to use the wheel on the front of the book. This information alone may not be enough to get the most use out of this tool, but it does help. I would recommend this in conjunction with a good music theory book. Edly's Music Theory for Practical People would be a good choice to pair this tool with.

Can't imagine how bad it would be otherwise.The leg length was enough for the weight of the legs to keep it down if needed. Straps pulled tight enough. And it rolled up well into a small package that rolled into my blue closed cell foam pad.Would have preferred a design that made the back taller, even if the pad doesn't fold and double back all the way down.

Their ACTUAL lengths are 17.5\\", 15.5\\" and 13.5\\" long - each basket is off by 1.5 INCHES! (the length and width are accurate). Even if the dimensions were accurate though, these baskets are cheaply made, and feel like they are abut to crumble.

And I hate returning the things, so first I wanted to use them for a storage, but after just 2 days of sitting in my storage they made the whole room smell. It's a really horrible product and there is no way I keep it in my home and I definitely don't recommend it to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a match","review":"The baskets themselves are not the best quality,by far.

A couple chapters are devoted to stories and stuff about survivors, but the majority of the book is about who is prone to suicide, how to prevent it, myths (i.e. don't ignore suicide threats)...I finished the book feeling that I was at fault for my sister's suicide.

The book is broken down into two parts, a year apart. It is a sort of love poem to Tristessa, the morphine addicted prostitute that he is in love with.In true Kerouac fashion we once again live vicariously through his vivid writing of his experience on the road.

Influenced by be-bop, his story of a junkie whore poor mexican girl not only expands the saga of Beat life, it finally brings his music to the page.

There is no talent present in front of or behind the camera. The only joy is a little schadenfreude watching Adam West sink to a career low as the police captain. At least I hope he hasn't sunk any lower than this. The story, if it matters, a young man is run over and killed by a group of rowdy teenagers. The mother does what any of us would and takes the body to the local voodoo priestess (every small town has one). The boy is reanimated as a zombie and is directed by the priestess to take revenge on his killers one by one. Add in a soundtrack of 80s hair metal songs and you have yourself a movie. Such as it is.

The main characters, played by Midler and James Caan, are both unappealing and unconvincing. Anguished yelling to convey deep feeling doesn't work in real life or in a movie. We somehow, also, were able to predict outcomes of most scenes. Fast-forwarding over a few scenes took nothing away from the adolescent story line. Good instead of a sleeping pill.

One time we got bored so my mom deciced we should watch a movie and we watched this one. The movie is about this women named Dixie Leonard and she is a singer. During WWII she goes to Europe to sing for the troops over there, with Eddie Sparks who is very famous.

I got this set on sale for $45 5 months ago for home usage. In June I replaced my gates and I used the 24 to jockey the new one in place while I bolted the hinges on. With all the steel and wood weight I was impressed it didn't bend at all. The only gripe I have is that they are not striking bars like my cats paws or snap on bar sets at work. If these are struck the handle can shatter and cut you so be careful. If a striking set is desired, look up mayhew cats paw or dominator bars. I have a 42 and 48 inch dominator bar at work and they take lots of punishment and still deliver when needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Video Distribution Amplifier","review":"Because of it's low purchase price I decided to take a chance and use it in my home theater hookups.I provided a 12 volt DC voltage converter from my household current in order to be able to use this in the house. The audio portions of my composite cable are simply bypassed as those can be split off without any need for a voltage boost. So using only the video leg through this amplifier, I split my composite video signal as needed.The product works flawlessly, draws very little power and runs very cool. It does all I needed and avoided the cost of the priceier composite distribution amplifiers offered as home units."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product not complete","review":"I puchased this for my home video system. After receiving this amplifier, I found it does not come with a built-in 12v DC power supply. If you are purchasing this for home use, you will need to also purchase a power supply to convert from 110-120 AC to 12v DC. This increases the cost significantly."},{"rating":"1","title":"ED's people slipped on this one","review":"I have used the Friends of Ed books in the past and found them to be excellent tutorials. The Foundation Flash book and the Flash MX ActionScript aare well-rounded, and cover the ground they set out to do, albeit wwith errors here and there.I bought the Friends of Ed Macromedia Flash MX Studio, expecting similar coverage reflecting advanced concepts for design. Much to my regret, I found this to be a book on ActionScript. The examples are essentially trivial tricks done with ActionScript, with descriptions that suit some aspects of game design.To contrast, the Flash MX ActionScript book published by FOE focuses on many of the concepts used to build Flash applications... and is a book that would be useful to designers who wish to use Actionscript when developing a Flash Project.Macromedia Flash MX Studio was a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Best-Off","review":"If you don't already have everything from him, you should really consider buying this one.

THE GREEN BELT MOVEMENT is currently the only volume that provides as much insight on this topic.This book aptly illustrates the practical effect a visionary can have towards the cause of unifying and balancing the degraded social, cultural and biological environment that we inhabit, by it's ample portrayal of the life, philosophy and focus of Prof. Maathai.I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great fragrance for people who can't stand fragrance!","review":"I am overly sensitive to most so-called \\"fragrances\\". These infusions of essential oils and aromatic amines that rape the senses as one strolls down the detergent aisle of the neighborhood grocery store have become ubiquitous. Nothing we buy nowadays seems to be free of perfume.Enter \\"Pure & Basic Body Wash\\". Available in several refreshingly natural scents, this shampoo for the skin is at once soothing and nourishing to the epithelium and gentle on the nose. It leaves one feeling clean, soft and glowing with the gentle fragrance of wild bananas and natural vanilla bean. It's truly a refreshing change from ordinary bath soap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book can fall apart","review":"This is a sweet book. It is the only book I have found that talks about weaning.

We bought it back when she was weaning. The light paperback is a bit flimsy even for an older toddler; but then, it has more of a specific time period that the child would be reading it a lot, so it easily lasts that time and is still on the shelf for occasional re-reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very very helpful","review":"This book has been invaluable in weaning my 2-yr-old. We read it over and over as we got ready to wean, and this week, as I weaned him, we keep referring to it. I really think it helped him understand the process, and also be proud of what he can do now as a \\"big boy\\" that he couldn't do as a baby. Most of the time we adapt the text to talk about his favorite foods, drinks, toys etc now -- but it's great to have the pictures to refer to.

Its the perfect mix of their own blend of house, which incorporates house with jazz, distorted guitars, Latin rhythms. The sound can be described as both innovative and original, as well as refreshing. All 10 tracks are distinct and none sound alike. The party really gets started with the opening \\"La Guitaristic House Organisation\\" which is 7 minutes + of pure heaven for house lovers, opening with a heavy beat then kicking in with the synth and electric guitars. It's classic. This was undoubtably one of the best house albums of 2000, with its original voice and interesting mix of intruments into melodies. The album is relaxing to listen to at times, other times you'll want to get up and dance. I highly reccomend this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and fancy-free","review":"This falls into that rare category of house/dance albums that work whether you're sitting on your couch jamming along or going all out on the dance floor. Installation Sonore is a fun, moody, playful, and inventive album that takes the oft-brainless sounds of French house and imbues them with intelligence. Rinocerose knows that making house aficionados happy requires discipline and patience. Too many DJs go for the build; Rinocerose welcomes listeners to come along for the ride. Especially noteworthy tracks: numbers one and five, which - in my opinion - best illustrate why I'm eagerly awaiting their next release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh and Innovative","review":"This CD is one of the best house releases of the year 2000.

This machine produces audible noise (a grating sort of sound coming from the poorly designed fan) even when I am wearing earplugs. These earplugs eliminate 30 Db noise, so you can imagine how noisy this terrible machine is. Furthermore, even at the lowest setting in a small room, it barely turns itself off, ever, suggesting that it is highly inefficient. This humidifier is a joke, and the people who designed it ought to be embarrassed, whereas the people who let it be produced and distributed ought to be punished."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Cumbersome\\"","review":"My biggest complaint with this unit is that it constantly needs replacement filters that are both hard to find and expensive.The internal filter starts to grow mildew and deteriorate after as little as one days use. Without the filter, the unit does not work.If you're looking for a humidifier that needs to come out of storage fast and rescue a kid with a cold, forget about this one. It wants tons of attention and upkeep that is both annoying and expensive.Also, the unit is noisey and the construction is cheap.For me, this has been a huge waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly loud","review":"I bought this on clearance from Target, wish I had seen the reviews here.

I have aHoneywell 17000 HEPA QuietCare Air Cleanerwhich some people complain about being noisy, and it is dead silent compared to this thing.Aside from the noise it also seemed very likely that the filters would get moldy quickly, and the unit doesn't seem to have any way to detect whether or not there is water in it, so even when it's dry it will keep running. It also doesn't have a visible humidity readout, so there's no way to measure how well it's working.This product has turned me off to the Holmes brand name altogether.

This is a readable guide if you want it to be - it has the same issues as many texts (they use different terms for things than other researchers do, etc.) but that's normal. I would recommend this one if you really want to understand the science behind your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"The classic textbook in the field of judgment and decision making","review":"Intended as an introductory textbook for both undergraduate and graduate students, Rational Choice In An Uncertain World lays out the foundations of decision science. In a non-technical style, Hastie and Dawes compare basic principles of rationality with actual behavior in decision-making. This book is not about what to choose, rather about how we choose.I have used this as a graduate course textbook (and I was taught from it). While the book is partially directed at advanced undergrads, my experience is that the content is almost entirely new to most grad students in psychology, marketing, organizational behavior, strategy, finance, economics, etc. This is a book I re-read every two years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book","review":"This book is terrible to read.

To me, one of the main reasons to get a wireless frame was for content delivery. Stock prices, weather, news with my pictures. Well, FrameChannel died so kiss that goodbye.The other thing is that, on mine anyhow, the firmware would get corrupted at least three times a year. Normally, you just update the firmware again and that would fix it but last time, I had to install an earlier firmware and then upgrade it to the current version. Now, I am having the same issue but I cannot find an earlier version and Support simply ignores my request.At this point, it is a $250 doorstop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor customer service","review":"Our frame died because of a firmware glitch after the warranty was up. Digital Spectrum tech support has been consistently slow to respond unless prodded with extra e-mails.

Oh well...this is just how things are made these days. However, the wireless feature did not work which is a deal-breaker. Whenever I attempted to search for a wireless network, I received a message stating an \\"unexpected error had occurred.\\" The only way to get it to go away was to power the frame off and on again. I thought a firmware update would correct the issue. Updating the firmware was a pain and did not fix the issue anyway. So, the frame is going back.What a waste of time and a terrible Christmas gift. Pictures loaded from an SD card or USB device looked fine but I still would not recommend product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pirates of the Caribbean 2 - 8 Pkg Figures","review":"My son really likes these figures.

If there are people who, even at this late date, might get into serious trouble calling press conferences and telling their true story... then this fictionalized account delivery method would be the logical consequence. Strieber makes you believe, and makes it an almost impossible task not to read well into the night. No need to be an ardent \\"alien believer,\\" because this story does not require you to initially \\"believe\\" anything. Even the characters find it hard to believe what is happening around them.

However some things continually annoy me about him and they are very present in this novel. Firstly, I find it intellectually revolting how he still clings to such old-fashioned, reactionary ideas such as Jungianism (or that kook Joseph Campbell), and uses \\"archtypal\\" patterns as a way to formulate a story. Also his characters have an annoying habit of believing themselves to have \\"figured everything out\\" when really they just have a bunch of stuffy ideas that they will not let go of. In other novels by Davies these things annoy me but they are easy to ignore, but this novel is fully made up of such things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed with my order.

Sadly I stopped listening when the sacryn hits left me empty and disappointed.

After about the first 6 albums, I lost track of them, and only recently \\"returned\\" to the fold, back-filling what I missed in-between. The first disc in the Here and Now collection, IMHO, is merely OK and, for some of the songs, there is a better version in some of the live discs. As for the second (live) disc....ouch! I now have four of their live discs (this one, the King Biscuit disc, Wildwood Springs, and Grand Cayman)....this one is not in the same class as the others (song collection is fine, recording and performance are not). Given what I thought of first disc, I was hoping the disc set would be salvaged by the live disc...just didn't happen for me. Sorry guys....I'm glad most folks had a better opinion, we're just going to have to agree to disagree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only For The Hardcore Fans","review":"It is wonderful and long overdue to see contemporary artists like Ryan Adams, James Iha and Jim James acknowledging that America deserves to be far more than a guilty pleasure. However, their involvement did little to dissuade me that America has much to offer these days. Chasing The Rainbow is the lone exception. The other songs have moments, but the sheen of the overall production seems to erase the humanness that their better songs always possessed. The live bonus CD is a great way to encourage trial, but outside of 'Sandman' there isn't anything here worth a 99 download. No doubt, most Amazon reviews are by written by fans hungry for any output from their beloved artists; still, i have to strongly disagree with my fellow Amazon Americans. On the bright side, the Complete Greatest Hits is a 5-star collection that everyone should have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a big america fan, but \\"WOW\\" ...This is good stuff...","review":"I wasn't expecting too much from America's most recent recording, but I think these guys, along with colloborative efforts from members of My morning Jacket, Nada Surf, Fountains of Wayne, and Ryan Adams.. really nailed it. Not a rock and roll jamfest, but America never sounded better, with tight harmonies and exellent musicianship. Not a bad song on the entire cd and the live concert of their greatest hits sounds terrific. Favorites include \\"Always Love\\" where Beckley shows incredible range (never heard it quite like that in the 70's!), \\"Chasing the Rainbow\\", and \\"Walk in the Woods\\"...So far one of my favorite releases for 2007...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here & Now Is The Place To Be","review":"America has always produced great music although never heavy or full of messages. Critics began by ripping them apart as being a C S & N rip-off as you can see in early Rolling Stone magazine web site reviews from 1972. But America has always been one of my favorite bands. Here & Now is probably on par with their best 70's work although we all wish that Dan Peek could be involved again (maybe one day). I was impressed and happy for the guys that this CD debuted at #52 on Billboard, their best showing since 1982. I can already tell that this is going to be a great summer CD to listen to. Songs like Chasing the Rainbow, Indian Summer and Ride On have become new favorites. I have always loved Dewey's vocals, very honest and warm. I thought that the 2nd disc of the entire HISTORY album was going to be a throw away but it is great, and I never have cared for live stuff by anyone.

It was a rare opportunity to get up close and personal with two music hero's from my youth. The first concert I ever attended was an America show at the Arie Crown Theater in Chicago in 1973 when I was 15 years old. It was a thrill 34 years later to finally meet Dewey and Gerry and talk with them a bit. They previewed several songs from this new CD at the Wildwood show and I was very impressed with the new material. After spending some time with the CD, I think it stacks up well with their stronger material. As a bonus, you get a live CD from an XM show they did (all for the price of a single CD!). Whether you are a longtime America fan or new to their music, buy this CD.......you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece!","review":"This album is extraordinary from every point of view. America has rise their standars in the 90's including the impressive solo work from Gerry Beckley. Holiday Harmony from America and Horizontal Fall from Gerry are outstanding albums. Here & Now is in the same level and probably higher. One thing that makes this album so special is the combination of America with younger musicians and producers which was key for the outcome of this project. You will find many music styles in this album from classic America West Coast, retro ala The Doors (Ride On), Country to Prog Rock, music from the 70s,80s,90s,00s..you choose! Chasin the Rainbow and Indian Summer are my favorites but every song is so well played and arranged that I can only give 5 stars to this album.

At least your voices suggest you've seen better days."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great CD","review":"Just picked up the new America CD. It is terrific. They have stayed true to the sound that made them famous and their harmonies are still great. This is a great \\"sit back and relax\\" CD. I especially like Walk in the Woods. Just a great feel good song about life. The 2nd CD of their XM concert is also a keeper. It shows that they also haven't lost their edge in concert.

The author quit college in 1968 and enlisted in the US Army, completed Special Forces training and by age twenty he was voluntarily assigned to MACVSOG-Command & Control South. This was a different kind of \\"dropping out and tuning in\\". Mr. Acre's book is a no bars hold account of what it was like to run recon across the fence into Cambodia, complete with the Special Forces style debauchery that occurred when he and his fellow SFer's were relaxing between missions. I really enjoyed this book because of its honesty, humor, and realism; the events are told in the way that they happened with no petty political-correctness cover-ups. Being able to read about MACVSOG is very interesting because it gives the reader a glimpse of how US clandestine operations are performed at ground level.

Project Omeaga's recon activiites made an extremely valuable contribution to U.S. military operations and the accuracy of the intelligence gathered resulted in thousands of lives saved.

Through a collection of short stories, which may initially seem disconnected but which quickly paint a coherent picture, the author delivers an image of the war that is frightfull, awe-inspiring, humorous, tragic, surreal, and, at times, beautiful. Where did Mr. Acre learn to write like this?While the author took tremendous risks during his time, he clearly subsequently lead a much richer life because of it.

Not happy with the performance or standards of this company that is suppose to be highly ranked on consumer reports for pressure mounted baby gates. Somebody within their company seriously fell asleep at the wheel on this one. Planning on having a word with the company in the morning and will post later how good their customer service really is..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I really thought this would be more of a documentry on the history of carnivals but it's really not.

I thought there would be multiple techniques (using gel medium, burning tools, etc) and thought it would be great to have a bunch of techniques in one book.

As I was reading them I was just confirming my own findings. In a nutshell , yes, instructions are clear and illustrations are beautiful, except the photos are staged and do not reflect real results, and the instructions are misleading and have errors. I would like to hear Lazertran's opinion since their name is in every project. Save your money, find more reliable instructions, and consider other brands (many are twice less expensive and have been tested by other than Debba Haupert.P.S. I was't even done typing when I got a response from Lazertran, who I sent my questions to earlier. They were prompt. Here is what I copied and pasted from their answer:\\"She is quite wrong.

All in all, very well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"The earliest Lost World tale of dinosaurs in modern times.","review":"This book is one of a number of Professor Challenger adventures of Sir A. C. Doyle. A noted zoologist (Challenger) has come across evidence that there is a plateau in South America that can be reached from deep in the Amazon rain forest in which prehistoric animals still exist. An expedition of four (Challenger, a sceptical zoologist named Summerlee, a noted hunter (Lord John Roxton), and Edward Malone, a journalist) sets out to verify this report. The arguing and interactions between the academics is interesting in that little seems to have changed in the last 87 years! It should be noted that Doyle isolates the plateau so that there is minimal interaction with the rest of the rain forest (thus, the dinosaurs can't escape). But, why couldn't the ptereodactyls spread out? This story was one of the earliest \\"Lost World\\" tales and has been made into a film a number of times. Other stories in this sub-genre owe much to Doyle and Challenger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whew.","review":"This is the only Doyle book I ever read. His idea is nothing short of remarkable...but at times he tends to ramble on which makes it slightly boring at times. I found his descriptions of the plataeu rather confusing. Does anyone agree?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Doyle puts you in the action.","review":"Doyle puts you in the action. He makes you want to be on the Challenger expidition. His writting is so discriptive you can see the see all the action take place. The book starts slow but really picks up as the adventure begins. The old English language is a bit distracting at first, but once you get past that the book is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Adventure Story","review":"I first read this book when I was 11 years old. It enthralled me and probably started my life long fascination with well written science fiction and fantasy stories.

That is where the similarity ends. The movie was a joke, the book was fanatasic. I much prefer Doyle's rendition of dinosaurs in mondern day to the fuzzy plots of frog-dna-reborn Veloci-Raptors running amuk, but that's me. I would, however, recommend that before you allow yourself to be polluted by the movie, you do honor to the reference by getting and reading this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read three pages","review":"Read three pages then just decided to netflix the old silent version which was quite good.I do like the Sherlock Hopmes stories by the author though."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Jurassic Park.....But Better","review":"This is not the Jurassic Park Lost World that you see in the movie, and I knew this coming into the book; but I did not expect it to be this good. This was a very entertaining book to me. It was a prime adventurous novel of a lost world that was really there all along. This book grabbed ahold of me after the first chapter or so and I was hooked since then. This is the first novel I have read by Doyle and it certainly wont be my last. If you like adventurous books, with new animals and civilizations, I would suggest this book in an instant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read","review":"This is a classic tale of dinosaurs and other extinct creatures living in modern times that predated Jurassic Park by eight decades. If you liked the original Sherlock Holmes stories, but missed this thrilling yarn by the same author then this Conan Doyle novel should be on your \\"must read\\" list. Follow Professor Challenger and journalist Edward Malone into a Lost World located somewhere in the depths of the Amazon basin and a plateau raised into isolation from the rest of the world eons ago. There are Ape Men to be defeated and the constant threat or becoming a meal for prehistoric carnivores. Do they survive and return to civilization with prof of the professor's discoveries? You'll just have to read this page-turner for the answer to that one. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is a really good and we'll written book. It keeps you entertained.

This book was a big let down. This is the only bok I can say that I liked the movie better. The whole Idea and storie line is boring and so predictable. A group of people coming to document a bunch of lost, and dead animals are not to exciting. The only thing this book had going for its self was it was the sequal to a best seller. Readers beware this book isn't worth your time. Stay away. The only thing That I can say that is good for this book is, \\"The Dinosaures win again.\\" No surprise their. In closing, If your bored and don't have anyother book to read, mabey then read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke","review":"As I expected, the garnets of this inexpensive necklace are full of inclusions.

The second time I took the necklace from the bag, stones and pearls started falling all over the floor. One of the stands had broken. Sigh.

Buy, Listen and Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vain - 'No Respect' (Gottdiscs)","review":"Sure glad that I have the available room to store old CD's and lp's.Also glad that I rarely discard anything of such.I remember seeing Vain play a late gig in a club on the same night that Motley Crue was in town during their 'Dr.Feelgood' tour.That's how long it's been.I didn't realize that years later,Vain had released two other CD's,2000's 'Move On It' and 2001's 'Fade'.I'll have to check those out sometime.Anyway,I always thought Vain would stick around longer than they originally did after the release of 'No Respect'.Overall,just good glam rock&roll with a kick to it.Happening cuts were \\"Beat The Bullet\\",\\"Who's Watching You\\",\\"Laws Against Love\\" and their love song(well sort of)\\"Icy\\".Line-up:Davy Vain-vocals,Danny West&James Scott-guitars,Ashley Mitchell-bass and Tom Rickard-drums.Should appeal to fans of Diamond Rexx,L.A.Guns,Roxx Gang,Dangerous Toys and Hanoi Rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"soul /personality relationship","review":"For those who feel some \\"presence\\" in their own conciousness I would recommend the observations presented in this book. At this stage in civilization when we have the luxury to pursue knowledge and closeness to the meaning of our being with access to ever-increasing information Meader's explanation of a relationship between one's soul and the contemporary personality is reasonable and gratifying. Just what are we trying to achieve?

He is genuine and a very gifted speaker. The information he is bringing through is enlightening and far reaching. Shine Forth is spot on. He is in touch with the truth of things.

Stunningly accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"This book, full of silly cartoons and conversational language, was not worth much to me.If you have just been diagnosed, are part of the target audience (I'm in my early 30s, younger than most with this disease), and don't know much about autoimmune diseases, this might be an OK place to start. It won't give you much that you can't find online, though, and the author's tone is chatty in a way that I found annoying, not engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"just another story...slow","review":"This book sounded like it would be really interested, but as I was reading it, I could only think how boring and uninteresting it was.

I recommend \\"Taking Charge of Your Fertility.\\" It's well written and teaches women how to really know their cycles and stop relying on junk like this and doctor's who still use a 28 day cycle chart to determine conception dates and due dates.It's 2010 people.

Women's cycles are NOT all the same and these beads assume they are. Never mind the fact that stress can delay ovulation for any woman and once again render these beads useless! I personally ovulate on day 21, so if I was using these beads for birth control, I'd easily become pregnant. If I were using them to find my fertile times to achieve pregnancy, I'd fail. It is incredibly rare that any woman has a perfect, textbook, 28 day cycle with exactly the same fertile times as any other woman.

It didn't remove my make up, particularly eye makeup, (I don't even wear waterproof...A good cry removes more eye makeup than this cleanser did) and it didn't rinse clean.

A very precise account of the drugs, the demons and those who called themselves \\"friends\\" to the King of Rock and Roll. The book goes into the cover-up, the amount of drugs in his system, and the people who supplied the drugs to Elvis.

The box it came in was another story but i won't get into that, but it looked fakely made as well. The silver paint from the plastic is flaking off extremely bad. The label that says Gucci on the bottle is flaking off too. The worse part of this is the scent, it smells really good, but, it lasts for like 5 minutes just like the knock-offs that you can buy from cheap stores and stuff. Read the other reviews from the people that bought it (and didn't realize it was a fake), even they said the smell doesn't last very long too. I am soooo pissed off.

I just wasn't buying it at all. Jaime Pressly as Violet in Poison Ivy 3: The New Seduction, did so much of a better job then these broads. All this movie strikes to me is as if the characters within the movie saw the 'Poison Ivy' series with Drew & Jaime and attempted to be like how they were and make a \\"secret\\" society based upon it, basically trying to be wannabes....and epicly failed.Btw, the only thing \\"secret\\" about the Poison Ivy society was the fact that they didnt say crap about it in public, other than that everyone & their mama appeared to know about it.

I put out some food ( cord, seeds, cat food, fruits, etc.) and waited to see what I got. I got many pictures of deer but nothing else, I could tell that other animals were eating the food but i could not get any pictures so i decided to put up my night vision security camera to see what I was missing. In 3 nights I got videos of deer, skunks, cats, rabbits, and a fox. The camera got pictures of all the deer but nothing else even though I got video of larger skunks running around right where the Game Spy was aimed and still nothing. On another note the camera eats up batteries, The store brand 6v's I have been using last about 5 days so I'm switching to rechargeable.

Neverwhere is somewhat \\"Sandman-ish\\", but there's something new and different about this dark, offbeat story that you won't find in the Sandman. Gaiman's narrative is positively some of the best I've read, and it genuinely frustrated me to have to put the book down. Great stuff.Granted, the book doesn't measure up to the quality, wit, or poignancy of \\"Good Omens,\\" but Neverwhere is a whole different animal altogether. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to any other book-lover. It's imaginative, artistic, visual, and very intelligent. Yes, there were predictable moments, but never annoyingly so. All in all, it was a great book that I do look forward to reading again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic","review":"\\"Neverwhere\\" is a wonderful story full of magic in all the places you would never think to look.

I wasn't really sure what to expect when I opened it. I had heard such great things about him but for some reason I still wasn't convinced he was going to fall short of my expectations.Boy was I ever surprised. I loved this book. The story was fantastic and the characters were lovable (even as I hated some). Door was adorable and I even loved bad Mr. Vandenmar. I was literally laughing out loud at almost everything Mr. Vandemar said...\\"What,\\" asked Mr. Croup, \\"do you want?\\"\\"What,\\" asked the marquis de Carabas, a little more rhetorically, \\"does anyone want?\\"\\"Dead things,\\" suggested Mr. Vandemar. \\"Extra teeth.\\"-page 205Gaiman created a world that was exciting, captivating, and even frightening but he also gave me something to think about.

I was sucked into the the dark world of \\"London Below\\" and by the end of the book, found myself wishing for more. Neverwhere is a brilliant fantasy novel speckled with shades of humor. My only beef with it was that I found myself begging for a sequeal (well it's not much of a beef to be honest). By the end of the book. there is no paucity of unanswered questions and I really really hope Neil Gaiman releases a sequel soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"More fun than a weekend with a White House intern","review":"I've never read a fantasy novel before but since I was about to attend a convention with Neil, I read this. It's terrific. I spent most of my time waiting for Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar to return but was always interested in what the other characters were up to. I'm a fan of satires and comic thrillers but I truly liked this book. Trust me, I know what I'm talking about. I taught Neil everything he knows and I can prove it --- he said as much when he autographed a copy of Stardust to me.Bill Fitzhugh"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best works of fantasy literature I've read.","review":"Neal Gaiman's graphic novel series The Sandman is possibly this quarter century's best answer to The Lord of the Rings. Neverwhere is its best answer to The Hobbit. Darker, more intense and more sophisticated in some ways than Tolkein's work, it is every bit as literate and allusive. I hope to God he keeps it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want more De Carabas!","review":"This is one of the most unusually written books I've read. While the only other Gaiman-touched thing I've read was Good Omens (that book IS God), I know he does a lot of comic books. This was apparently the first real book he wrote.It strikes me as being written much like a comic book, with a great deal of space between the words. What I mean is, in a comic book the \\"script\\" is written around the pictures. The words in the comic tell only part of the story. Neverwhere is written the same way. But that's okay, because though the pictures aren't drawn for you, he still left enough room for you to see them in your head.The only other thing I have to say about this book is, READ IT JUST TO MEET DE CARABAS! This character is terrific! I only wish Gaiman had written more about him. Oh, Mr. Gaiman, if ever you read this, PLEE-HEE-HEEZE write another story about him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"dark and elegant","review":"I discovered Neil Gaiman as the text author of the 4 part graphic novel \\"Stardust\\"(now available as a novel.) The illustrator, Charles Vess, is a master of his craft, and Gaiman is equally so. \\"Neverwhere\\" is a dark, creepy, wholly satisfying book, full of familiar, but not old characters. I scarfed this book in one evening, licking my chops all the while. The villians are horrifying, the heroes are amusing and sympathetic, and the storyline crackles. I do recommend this book to fantasy/horror lovers, and check out the illustrated \\"Stardust\\" too...if you can find it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pure magic","review":"After 'discovering' Jonathan Carroll, I did not expect to ever stumble upon another author whose stories evoke similar moods and feelings.

Neil Gaiman has truly won me over with this book. Not only is it beautifully written, but it will keep your eyes glued to each page. It combines suspense, mystery, and a bit of fantasy to create a beautiful novel. I recommend this book to anyone who loves a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind Blowing Imaginative","review":"This book is a feast for the imagination. Truly a step into another world. It is the story of Richard Mayhew, an average Londoner transported into a secret underground London world, that is dark and strange, where anything can happen.First of all, I must say that I love Richard! He is so sweet, caring, and funny, and I love watching his evolution through out the book. Really, I think this is a story of finding your own strength.All of the citizens of London Underground are colorful and original, Hunter, Door, Old Bailey. And the Marquis who is my personal favorite, who has \\"created himself as a grand joke.\\" Read this book if you want to experience something not like anything you've experienced before, if you think there might be more out there than just the daily routine.Colorful villains, and some scary situations, but also lots of great subtle humor. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The dark world of London Below","review":"Neil writes excellent fantasy and in this book he takes us to a city below a city. I love this idea and find it fascinating that such a world \\"exists\\" underneath. Characters Richard Mayhew, Hunter, the Marquis, and Door set off on a quest for information. Richard wants to restore his world to normalcy...but what really is normalcy? Can normalcy be so fulfilling? Richard will never be the same...and neither will you. I like this story where the homeless and underdwellers can be heroes...where rats are respected and are viewed as friends.Refreshing and stimulating."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tragic disappointment.","review":"I loved Gaiman's work on Sandman, among other titles, and thus eagerly awaited this novel. Never before have I been so frustratingly disappointed. Neverwhere is predictable, clumsy, garbage -- unworthy of such a normally original and creative writer. I recommend any Gaiman fan stay away from this book, as it may irrepairably damage their opinion of him."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but not my cup of tea","review":"This book was recommended by a friend. Enthusiasts of fantasy novels may enjoy it, as it is readable. The author's inversion of London had some appeal, and he knows his city well. Ultimately, this novel failed for me.

Neil Gaiman is my favorite author this month after reading American Gods and Anansi Boys, but this...this story does not do anything for me. It came to the point where I had to return it because the story infact goes NOWHERE as mentioned in a previous review. Maybe it was because this was an early story of Gaiman, but I'm definitely glad that he has stories much much better than this in present day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorely disappointing to this Sandman fan","review":"Gaiman's \\"Neverwhere\\" spends most of it's 385 (in paperback) pages trudging the reader through a drab and dreary world of rats and sewage, which would be fine if there was a captivating storyline or alluring characters. There isn't. Richard and his main travelling companion Door are likeable enough, however this tale is almost completely devoid of the mystery, majesty, and sublime wonder which suffuses Gaiman's 75-issue Sandman epic. If I didn't know otherwise I would probably think this was written by an unpublished hack. In truth, the two stars is kind; if I could have given 1 1/2, I would have done so."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tired plot badly written.","review":"Take Douglas Adams and Clive Barker, put them in a blender on low speed and sieve the remaining sludge through a filter which extracts talent and originality - and you have \\"Neverwhere.\\" Reading this book reminded me how glad I was that I had long past burned the fiction I had produced in high school. I gave this book 2 stars rather than the signle one I was tempted due to the one sentence gems of literary promise which emerged from the muck every three pages or so. There is scattered evidence that Gaiman can write, however he has a lot of work ahead of him if he wishes to produce a novel worthy of the paper it's printed on. The amount of people giving this book five stars is frightening, and I suspect these readers need the same type of exposure to well honed literature (the kind without pictures) as Gaiman himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abridged? How about massacred!","review":"I immediately fell in love with this book when I picked it up two years ago. That is why I was so disenchanted with this auditape version. I thought it suspicious that it was only two hours but though what the hay. My suspicions proved right, this \\"shortened\\" version is a masacre and leaves the characters flat. Skip the audio version of this one and go straight for the print - you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful listening","review":"Mr. Gaiman can read to me anytime. His voice is soothing, rich and full of expression. It is wonderful to have an author read his work, because he knows just where all the inflections should be. As for the story of Neverwhere, it is delightful and imaginative. Very hard to stop listening, because you never want to leave the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neverwhere? Nevermind?","review":"You know, I wanted to like this book. Everyone seems to believe that Neil Gaiman is the next Clive Barker. But I have to disagree. I have been trying to read this book for over 3 years, and I just keep getting bored. Why?I don't know. The premise is good; the characters are well-developed and the story definitely has \\"that\\" atmosphere I always love in \\"Wonderland-type tales.\\" But for some reason, when I finally finished it, I thought, \\"Hmmm, what's all the fuss about?\\"It's well-crafted and very dark (which I like), but it doesn't have that something extra that makes one want everyone they know to read the book.AFTER READING \\"NEVERWHERE\\" A SECOND TIME, I LIKED IT BETTER AND RAISED MY OVERALL RATING FROM 3 TO 4 STARS. STILL, SOMETHING FEELS LIKE IT'S MISSING SOMEWHERE."},{"rating":"2","title":"First time I remember...","review":"This is the first time I remember finishing a book and immediately start re-reading it.

It was a total mindbender about a universe we \\"normal\\" people share, but never care to see. We've all had the experience of seeing a darkened subway car, but never once have I ever thought about looking inside to confirm it has the same interior as all the rest..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hero with Yet a Another Face","review":"Of course, Neil Gaiman's first novel has been compared to \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and his own Sandman comic series, but what this story most embodies is a Campbellian Hero's Mythic journey. This includes almost every element of Campbell's journey: a call to adventure, threshold crossing, the tests (complete with helpers), transfiguration, and return to the world. Gaiman's also touches on these themes in his later work \\"American Gods\\"(and probably better there than \\"Neverwhere\\") and I think, no one is writing mythological stories as good as Gaiman right now. Gaiman manages to write about these themes with a wry sense of humour that never detracts from the importance of the stories he tells. This novel gets 4 stars instead of 5 only because I read \\"American Gods\\" first and I'm rating them relative to each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down!","review":"This book was fantastic! It twisted reality and fantasy around and around each other, until, like the main character of the book - the reader begins to think \\"ah, that could happen.\\" I would recommend this book to anyone who misses books that could raise goosebumps, without including so much sex or gore as to make one sick. This was a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd read more from Gaiman!","review":"Quick moving adventure and clearly drawn characters pull you into a journey through a side of London you'll never see. Gaiman writes wonderful non-heroes(the marquis) and creates some truly terrifying villains. Croup and Vandemeer are all the scarier for the civilized veneer and the unashamed relish they take in their work!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy audio version","review":"The primary aim of an audio recording is to be clear and understandable and Neil Gaiman's recording of Neverwhere is neither. The author has the annoying habit of dropping his voice on the last few words of each sentence, making them unintelligible. The only option is to turn up the volume, thus risking hearing damage as the first part of each sentence is now very loud. On certain sections, he adds special effects (echos, static) which make those sections completely unintelligible. This may be a great book, but I will never know as I gave up in frustration after about 1 hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's The Beef?","review":"This book started so promosing, but in the end was one big dissapointment. It was extremely anti-climactic and really did not go anywhere. Speaking rats - what more can I say. This novel is meant for a young teenage audience who are not mature enough to understand thoughtful writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Putdownable.","review":"I really wanted to finish this book - it came so highly recommended on Amazon. But with less than a hundred pages to go, I threw in the towel. By page 280, the author had done nothing but tell us what each of the three main characters were seeking. No information was teased out along the way, and I found that I didn't care whether any of them lived or died. I just wanted it to end. It seemed more like a dull adventure video game than a book, and I don't read video games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring. Tedious. Predictable. Dull.","review":"Gaiman is published, I'm not etc etc.I was reading this in good sessions, 60 pages or so at a time, and I got to around 300 in and just couldn't be bothered to finish it. I lost count of the number of times I rolled my eyes. The characters names e.g. Lord Rat-Speaker. Come on! That's the sort of thing you come up with when you're 12 and a write a story.After all the hype I was incredibly disappointed. Maybe I'm not a big enough believer in pixie dust and unicorns..."},{"rating":"1","title":"You might enjoy this if you are under 17 years old","review":"Even then, you might not like it. Gaiman is a competent writer, capable of holding a story together and presenting a whole array of coherent characters. Unfortunately, this book reminds me of some of the fantasies I read when I was 15. At the time, I accepted them as semi-interesting stories, lacking depth (in characterization, in message, in storyline), but nonetheless worth the read. Perhaps I value my time more now than then, but parts of this book were boring and the characters were flatter than Eric. The humor and characters seemed to be aimed at a younger crowd, but occasional scenes and thoughts were very grown up. A strange mix that doesn't, at least for me, work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"This book was a waste of time. It is the only Gaiman book I've read, but it doesn't belong anywhere near the best fantasy writing available today (like Rothfuss and Martin). The \\"world\\" isn't that great, and Gaiman leaves waaaaay too much unexplained. It also lacks any discernable theme. It kinda reads like a book that was written in one sitting and then never edited.Gaiman has a decent knack for dialogue, but he woefully lacks the talent to create a story with depth and breadth."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent read!!","review":"excellent read! could not wait to turn the pages. keeps you interested as to what happens next. will definitely look for more books by author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly delightful once you get past the whole dead kittens thing.","review":"I'm not sure I can add anything that hasn't already been said. My only real criticism of the book was that I found the very ending (we're talking literally the last chapter, not the climax which I loved) to be a touch predictable. Really there was only one of two ways it could go, so I suppose that was unavoidable. BUT, that being said, the journey to that point was unbelievably delightful (again, dead kittens aside). The writing was stellar, as you would expect from Gaiman, and the story was quite original. It's like he mashed up The Wizard of Oz and Alice in Wonderland, put it underneath modern day London, and threw it all in the middle of a particularly gory slasher movie. I absolutely loved it and it made me just want to buy all of his other books and read them too. So well done, sir. Well done indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Far as the Imagination can Take You","review":"This book is so out there, it really shows what a good imagination can create. A dark underword filled with all sorts of mixxed up cultures that leave the reader thinking about what is really out there and how we became meshed in the world that we do live in. There are great plot twists and character revelations that it is more than just fun. It makes us examine our lives and status and askes us to search for something that is different than what society considers acceptable. Pure bliss in its forming of scenery and off the wall characters. I recommend for anyone who enjoys reading the fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Through the invisible door","review":"Richard Mayhew finds his life changed after he stops to help a mysterious young woman. Through contact with her, he learns about a hidden London, the world of London Below, and he can't seem to make it back to his former life. Richard's adventures helping the young woman called Door bring him back to life, away from his steady, plodding life. I am a huge fan of Gaiman's work, and this showcases his talents, but it does have a few flaws. We aren't given enough character development, and the amount of amazing people and views and things in this story is overwhelming, and we never really have time to digest or enjoy them to the fullest. Despite this, this book is still remarkable, and it's based on a great miniseries, too. And this book features two of most stellar assassins ever seen in fiction: Croup and Vandemar. You'll never forget them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"There and back again","review":"All London office worker Richard Mayhew tried to do that evening was help a damsel in distress, but he got more - way more - than he bargained for. Neil Gaiman has spun another magical mystery tour from the elements of the mythological quest paradigm. Underworlds, eternity, horrific beasts to be slain, labyrinths, immortality, heroes and antiheroes - it's all here in modern form, but nothing crucial really changes, does it? Reading this book is like watching a movie in your head. And through it all, the hapless Richard discovers a well of personal courage that he never thought existed. A timeless tale of humanity's existential search told anew, skillfully written and highly recommended. It's a trip!"},{"rating":"2","title":"London Below: A Great Place to Visit","review":"Neverwhere, by the ultra-talented Neil Gaiman, was my first experience with the author's work. I could not be more impressed. This is a fantastic tale full of memorable characters; some of which could have stepped right out of a Charles Dicken's novel. When everyman or anyman Richard Mayhew decides to help a hurt young homeless [looking] girl, he embarks on a magical journey into the area known as London Below. There he meets Door and a variety of interesting chracters including Rat Speakers and a couple of dedicated sadistic assassins. The book is part heroic quest, part fantasy, part satire, part mystery, but all fun. I highly recommend this novel. I anxiously look forward to discovering more of the author's work. 5 Stars!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A little dark, but a good book","review":"This book is darker than Stardust but still as imaginative. The involvement of the tube stations in London really makes it interesting, especially if you've been there and seen those stations and lines.Honestly, I think if this same book had been written by a woman you'd see more romance between the two main characters and less of the very vile villians. And I really can't see a woman author putting in a lesbian warrior - she's right out of a male fantasy video game. But despite the male flavor of the story, I liked it.He uses the 'f' word several times, mostly as a verb, not as a pejorative. There are a few mentions of sex but none detailed or graphic.I don't think this is one I will read over and over again but I did enjoy it and would recommend it to others (mostly guys) I know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"This was my first Neil Gaiman novel. I'll read him again and again...The ending is what you expect, but better. The characters are good (I especially like when Richard Mayhew writes notes in his mental diary) and you root for them, etc. But the best part (even though it's been done before) is London Below, that other London with all its scarey characters and grimey places. It was just so neat how he described it and created it for the reader. It was definitely the best part for me. It is also a quick read, I read it in a day or less...so, that's good if you want something quick. Anyhow, I recommend it whole-heartedly..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is Gaiman the best writer ever?","review":"Not really.But he may be one of the most interesting. He manages to keep the reader so hooked by such an implausible world that if you are ever in London you may be compelled to look for some of the subway stations that don't exist. Also, the way he uses the history of name to give life to his characters shows true genius of imagination.Don't expect high literature; do expect a wonderful fleshed out alternate world with plenty of twists and compulsive readability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank Goodness Someone took the mantle!","review":"Feeling woeful having exhausted the Douglas Adams books and Tom Robbins, I spent time reading lesser books by lesser writers. Having read Sandman occasionally, then spreading to other \\"graphic\\" novels by Gaiman, I found Neverwhere! Humorous, intelligent and captivating!! This writer creates a story that does not leave you! You will not want to put this down, but if you must for some reason, the depth, texture and details remain so vivid that you will not miss a step when you revisit the story. Some othe readers will speak of gaps or this being a \\"rough draft\\", I challenge them! This book offers mysteries, answers, fables, intrigue and a wonderful ride! I am addicted and so pleased that he is young! More to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If it's fun, why not just enjoy it?","review":"A lot of people are criticizing this novel, saying that there's nothing added to your life after reading it. So what? How about the joy of reading it? Neverwhere starts in a weird way, probably because it's weird to read Gaiman without pictures. But it goes on well, and gets better at each page, with all kinds of mythologies mixed in a kind of organized chaos (I said it was weird). The best thing is that this book is 100% Gaiman. Some say the book has nothing behind the story, that the characters are shallow, adn I ask again, so what? Neverwhere is just what it is, 377 pages of the best kind of entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Me again","review":"What I meant by that Neil's style is somewhat simple is that he lacks a sense of structure (in this book, anyway); take Alan Moore or Emily Bronte, they certain have a good sense of organization. Neil's style is too matter-of-fact, too Hemingway for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful, dark and twisted sense of humor","review":"If you buy this book for anything, buy it for Croup and Vandemar! These two are the most deliciously demented characters I have run across in a long time. I've never found villains quite so entertaining (although, I must admit, in a dark and kind of horrific way) while being so very evilly competent. I loved all their wry comments. Their only downfall was some of the things they ate...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Novel take on Mythic Underworld of London.","review":"This is the first Gaiman work I've read to date, and I was not disappointed. A very free-flowing story that unravels with interesting, although not fully-developed characters. The characters are not as important as the tapestry of London Below, which comes alive with Gaiman's well-contrived imagination. We have just as much fun as Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar, two characters best to be avoided in a dark alley, as we do with Richard Mayhew, newcomer to a world so different from his own. Gaiman has ample opportunity to return to Neverwhere in future works, and this is a great first book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome...loved it!","review":"Captivating and realistic...almost had me believing that there really is a London Below..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried to like it","review":"Neverwhere, like most of Gaiman's fiction, to my mind, seems very scattered. I always enjoy the worlds he creates, but the actual denoument leaves much to be desired. No matter how much his work matures, he always reads like a young Stephen King to me -- great ideas, but the endings are so godawful as to ruin the entire book.Neverwhere has a crappy BBC made-for-tv movie version. It's only slightly worse than the book, and it will save you a slog through the original text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I read the Graveyard Book and loved it for its originality but found this one disappointing and full of cliches."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Gods by Neil Gaiman","review":"Recommended for: everyone from teen and upHighly Recommended!Not only is this a Neil Gaiman novel, but it involved mythological beings therefore I was eager to read it, but afraid to be disappointed. However, Neil Gaiman surpassed my expectations by not succumbing to his normal style of writing, and immersing into a narrative about the main character without betraying his private personality. He also doesn't waste time explaining who any of the supernatural characters are and it is not to be missed; you either know them or you don't. Neil Gaiman takes us on a road trip through midwest America and humanizes these gods, unraveling a story within stories which captures your interest as you delve more into the book. I don't want to spoil the fun of discovering the characters and the plots, so all I will say is, read it! It is worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"it was good","review":"I read this a few years ago. I don't remember the details but I liked that it was different how he was a regular guy, an unlikely hero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimately Forgettable","review":"There really wasn't a whole lot to this book, and after seeing so many positive reviews of it, I had to give my opinion.As the title of this review suggests, this book is overall forgettable and not worth the money to read. I liked the premise, but I didn't at all care for the characters, everything seemed rush and the 'villain' of the story and his reasons for being said villain come out of nowhere AT THE END OF THE BOOK.The problem is that in the end, there's nothing that makes it stand out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressive story with unlikable characters","review":"The hero is a boring, mundane, dumb as a post British businessman, the sort of character that you often see in British fiction, and always seem to see in British fantasy.The story revolves around a magic world beneth London where the homeless and lost really live. I found that just offensive to turn the real tragity of homelessness into a trite fantasy fairy tale.I didn't care about the characters, and although the setting was decent (once I stopped being annoyed by the idea) the conflict wasn't too impressive.In the end, the boring british guy discovers his own potential for greatness (good for him! I didn't see any potential for greatness in him at all) and chooses the magic London fairy land over his boring life.Yawn.AIM"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of Gaiman since SANDMAN","review":"If you enjoyed Lord Morpheus' saga, NEVERWHERE is just for you. Dark, dangerous and utterly fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasy Lovers- Check This Out!!","review":"Wow. While I can honestly say that this book was not my most wonderful read, or my favorite book, it is up there. A wonderful fantasy story that does not get *too* weird, but is odd enough to still consider a fantasy. The characters are believable, from the be-fuddled main character to the smelly rat folk, and the plot moves along at a pace that is sedate enough not to lose non-fantasy readers (me) without boring the hair off of the hardcore fantasy readers. A good book to pick up and read in the evenings, and then re-read in about 6 months when you think about some little scene and can't get it out of your mind. Enjoy this one, people!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just beauty.","review":"When I picked up my first Gaiman masterpiece at a local bookstore, a worker there asked me if I was a fan. All I could say was, \\"I'm not sure.\\" After this book, undoubtedly. 'Neverwhere' is a work of beauty, pure magic. If you're not a fan of 'The Sandman' series, here's a good place to start. No matter what great things you've heard, or in spite of foul, you will need to experience this book for yourself. Gaiman has woven a world unmatched by any other in the fantasy genre, cold, hard, wonderous, and not for the faint of heart. There are no real heros, no real villians. London Underground just doesn't work that way. Read it, you'll know what I mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"This was just a disappointing book. Wonderful, intriguing concept and I wanted to like it. The stage was set - mood, characters, etc. but concept was never fully developed. I had to force myself to finish reading it. One that I would never recommend or reread."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tale of two cities","review":"Daydream a world where everything is as it seems and nothing bears safety. You've just imagined 'Neverwhere', the haunting, volatile Gaea that exists in the belly of London.In Gaiman's first novel, London is separated into two cities, the popular, familiar London Above and the dark, forboding London Below.Richard Mayhew is the man stuck in the middle, twisted reality and fantasy slipping between his fingers. Before he can assume his life above, he must assume it below.The novel introduces us to multitudes of space and characters that are still fresh in mind after the last page is finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent escapism!","review":"I fell absolutely in love with this tale! Neil Gaiman has an imagination that just pulls you in. I am waiting for a sequel - where is the Lady Door's sister? There is enough material here for a series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminds me of Dr. Who","review":"From rooftops to the sewers, this \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" adventure takes you along for a ride thru dark London dreamscapes.If you enjoy Clockwork Orange, Dr. Who, and such... You won't regret this read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorite books","review":"This book is outstanding. The writing is amazing, the story is amazing, and the fantasy is amazing. I have read this book about three times now and have never gotten bored with it. This is by far one of my top 5 favorite books. Neil Gaiman is an amazing writer and the things he imagines bewilders me! I hope he will one day write something like this!There needs to be more books like this in the world!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing!!!","review":"Reading this book is like \\"reading\\" The Matrix except it's a thousand times better. I highly reccomend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning other-world experience.","review":"I've read a lot of sci-fi/fantasy and admit to being jaded. However, Gaiman's work in this book is beautifully written, suspenseful, and original. As with his style, there is humor and clever twists to the story of a man lost in an alternate London... seeking his fate among mystical vagabonds, mysterious magics... and a myriad of bizarre characters. (ok, I've used up my M's.)I read this in 2 nights flat, and sighed when it was done. Recommend heartily. Only 4 stars because I thought the ending was a bit pat, or perhaps I was just annoyed that it ended at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"MAGICAL and WONDERFUL","review":"This is the most MAGICAL book i've ever read. I literally couldn't put it down, and had my roommate rip it out of my hands when he wanted my attention. I imagine the main female character, Door, incredible beautiful in my head... and she leads the main male character on a wonderful journey. I think differently every time i ride the NYC subway now. This is a book you'll want to read and re-read every time your life seems ordinary. Incredibly visual language makes this better than every film i've ever seen... and this is one of my favorite books. ENJOY it at LEAST once. =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"One hell of a page turner!!!","review":"I have never read a book that had me saying, \\"Five more pages and I'll put it down\\" and then end up reading four more chapters. The characters are just perfect. Its an excellent book and its better when you read it more than once. I personally read it 3 times!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Neverwhere- Interesting and Fun","review":"Neverwhere by Neil Gaimen. Great \\"fantasyish\\" book about a London resident who gets caught up between two worlds. Upper London is the world we live in, ATMs, science, sunlight, etc. London Below is a world of magic, darkness, squalor, and heroics. He helps a young girl in need and gets caught up with events (in a world unknown to the rest of Upper London) that causes his identity in the \\"real\\" world to be erased, he has no choice but to join the world of London Below and help with a quest involving two methodical (and unstoppable) killers, a fallen angel, and a girl named \\"Door\\" that has power over her namesakes. Very interesting and worth a borrow from the library (or paperback purchase). Sort of fun. Great concepts and refreshingly understated (doesn't bash one world to define the other).Loved the main character's decisiveness at the begining and ending critical junctures."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Version Vs. British Version","review":"Having read both of them now (and having noticed some of the comments here, some people reviewing one of the books, some people reviewing the other) I just wanted to say that the Avon (US) version of NEVERWHERE and the BBC (British) version are more or less two completely different books.The American one is darker, better written, and moves differently. It really accentuates the city of London as a main character, while delving deeper into the minds and histories of the characters. The English one feels more like Douglas Adams, the American one feels more like Clive Barker.So I'd give the US version a 10, and the British one an 8"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"A perfect construction of place and character. Gaiman has, for a while now, been on my \\"automatic purchase\\" list and so I didn't have to decide whether or not to purchase Neverwhere. Neither do you"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read!","review":"This book is a real fun read. I read the British version and really enjoyed it. It is the story of 2 Londons, the London that we know and the London underneath which is invisible to us and what happens when someone for above falls throught to the underworld.I hope that we get to see the tv program that was made of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible work by Neil Gaiman","review":"\\"Neverwhere\\" is a truly grand novel. Fast-moving, wild, witty and action-packed, it thrills from the first page to the last one. Gaiman is at his best and shows us glimpses of a greater world where everything is better, flashier and more adventorous. A must-have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For booklovers everywhere, Neverwhere is a real treat","review":"This book is just wonderful, truly wonderful. Reading just doesn't get any more fun than this. Thank you, Neil Gaiman, for helping me believe in magic again."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a new fan!","review":"A friend recommended Neil Gaiman's work to me, and I guess I've had my head in the sand, because I'd hadn't come across his name or works before. Neverwhere was the first of his books I read, and now I'm a real fan. It's a dark tale; a journey that opens your mind to the stuff of myths and nightmares. This is not a fast-paced thriller. It's more like a map that unfolds. You follow the highway before you, not knowing where it's going, but not minding the journey because it's so intriging. If you haven't read his books before, don't let the discouraging reviews stop you. Gaiman has a unique voice, and this is is truly a peculiar tale. The characters live in a parallel world that is a bit of Dickens, and a dash of Gollem. Neverwhere is a place all it's own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just beyond the surface","review":"I enjoyed this book. I have read a couple of books by Gaiman this one was by far his most enjoyable. He seems to write about things that are just beyond our perceptions. I wish that he would have gone into more detail about these people who have slipped between the cracks...Anyways I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master at work","review":"Neil Gaiman got me hooked with his Sandman series. I'd say that he is one of today's most gifted writers. The way in which he creates a tale is amazing. Characters come to life like few other authors can do, and the atmospheres he creates are astounding.Neverwhere is no different. Gaiman weaves a tale that mixes reality with fantasy, putting a fantasy world directly within the world of London and its underground. The story is written so well, that you start to wonder if maybe it's more true than we'd think. I had only one complaint about this book, it got over too soon. Gaiman's writing makes the time spent reading fly by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching and Exciting--A Wonderful Read","review":"Neil Gaiman is a very artful storyteller, with just enough wit to make you smile, but never so much that it takes away from his plot or characters. In that sense, I do believe he finally outshines Douglas Adams who was always most concerned about dazzling with cleverness.This novel is hard to put down. When you're done, you will have fallen in love with the characters and wish that there was a sequel for you to follow their continuing adventures. The style is clean and direct, the tone something like a Tim Burton production--colorful and interesting and slightly sinister.For fans of fun stories, endearing characters and wry humor, this is for you. Also highly recommended are the aforementioned Douglas Adams and Robert Asprin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's the Cheshire cat?","review":"This is \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" for adults. Gaiman has captured the magic of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and placed it in his book. The protangonist Richard Mayhew has stumbled into an underground version of London and it is chock full of colorfull characters, both good and bad. Gaiman's character is caught in a world that doesn't look quite like his own, but is connected. Magic rules here and there is a quest that Richard and his companions are on to defeat evil. The two man evil characters, Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar are delightfully evil, just like Fagan from \\"Oliver Twist\\" and they work for a bad guy that is posed as a good guy. they are trying to kill 'Door' with Richard caught in the middle with no idea how he ended up there. This is a delightfull read and is very fast. Nice job by Gaiman and is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dark Contemporary Alice and Wonderland! Thrilling!","review":"Imaginative and highly visual this book is so inspiring!I am 11 years old and this is my favorite book! I look after Door, Richard, Marquis de Carabass and Hunter! Door is a young woman who is on a quest to find who killed her family, Richard Mayhew is a kind good-hearted man who saved Doors life, the Marquis is a trickster who saves Richards life and dies...but comes back to life, and Hunter is the famous woman who is Doors body guard who works for the angel Islington (but noone knows) who is supposed to be good but is the boss of Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar who are VERY bad men (killed Doors family)! Together these characters work together and when time comes for Richard to go back to London Above and he does he decides that hes now not that type of person and goes back to London Below with the Marquis and then joins Door and the Marquis!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly imaginative \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" novel!!!!","review":"I love this book!! Thought the characters were excellent (especially the two bad guys) and I thought Gaiman was extremely original in using the London underground as a backdrop for this amazing story. It seems like the perfect setup for a sequel-Hunter?? Door's sister?? Croup and Vandemar?? I would love to learn more about Lord Portico as well as what happens on our crew's next adventure...I anxiously await more fantastic tales from Neil Gaiman!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gaiman's creative energies births another fantastic story","review":"Gaiman constantly impresses me with his wit and humor. Neverwhere was a fantastic book with clever twists and turns. I strongly recommend it to anyone who has ever enjoyed one of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done but not as imaginative as some of his other work","review":"Neverwhere was a lot of fun, but not quite the masterpiece a lot of people seem to find it. Its premise of a fairy kingdom under the London streets is fairly standard fare for modern comic books, although apparently it caught some mainstream fiction readers by surprise. The characters are also all comic archetypes, but the whole thing is written very well. Gaiman really knows how to move a plot forward. Altogether, I'd say Stardust is a better book than Neverwhere, but this one does have the advantage of mass appeal. The Sandman books are still Gaiman's finest work, and I recommend them to anyone who enjoys Neverwhere. Don't be put off by the fact that they are \\"comic books\\", as the writing is as good if not better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST book I've read in a long time","review":"Finally - something worth reading. Thank you to Neil Gaiman for giving me a reason to pick up a book again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good solid read","review":"The otherworldliness of this book reminds me of goethe's faust. The dip from our reality to another reality is smooth and therefore real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swashbuckling story with fanciful and alluring language","review":"Gaiman has an amazing talent for weaving a beautiful story with the most amazing and alluring descriptions. His words leave vivid impressions in your mind in the most unusual and melodic way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Cup of Tea","review":"Bought this book because is sounded like a book from another author. This book is well written and I am sure the other books this author has written are good as well. This is just not my cup of tea. If you like books with horror mixed into an everyday story then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't buy into it at all.","review":"I watched the superb Hellboy Golden Army film while I was reading this so so novel, and it really hammered in my dissatisfaction with this book. This occured because of the wonderful underground world that was created in Hellboy if not by Del Toro, then the person who wrote the original graphic novel. The whole London Underground thing which ties the names of tubestops to characters is absurd and ridiculous. Imagine if Neil Gaiman were not a household name (sort of) but a first time novelist trying to pitch this story to Tor publishing. He would be thrown out within seconds. Luckily Gaiman has a wonderful imagination and is a gifted writer so all is not lost. But lame is really the best word I can come up with to describe the whole plot. I loved American Gods and Stardust, but Gaiman is definitely hit and miss in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"I made it half way through. But come on, aside from the character mentally noting several times that his life was gone, the author made no attempt to make him appear at all concerned that he had lost everything and was now in a completely alien environment. Even worse: Could anyone possibly protect door from the killers? No...only Hunter could stand a chance. And GEE, guess who shows up as the bodyguard a few pages later. Oh Hunter! There you are! Glad they worked you in so well. And the lame image of the \\"knockout amazon\\" was too much. Anytime a strong female character appears in these shallow books, she has to be stacked. Please. Also, the characters of Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandawhatever were shamelessly stolen from the Bond movie \\"Diamonds are Forever.\\" So I guess what I'm saying is skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neverwhere... goes NOwhere","review":"Based on what I've heard about this author and the interesting premise for this tale, I was greatly disappointed. Although I was drawn in at the beginning, I soon realized that this was just an endless series of underground characters engaging in violent acts against each other while the plot meanders along passageways with little explanation for events and an ultimately disappointing conclusion. I may give Mr. Gaiman another try, but based on this first taste it will be a while before I bother. This was even suggested to me as a possible young adult novel, but I would suggest parents steer clear unless your student is a high schooler or older. I won't be surprised if others rank this review as \\"not helpful\\" because they disagree, but please respect an alternative opinion. I am an open-minded, avid reader of a wide variety of genres, so I thought it only fair to include an honest review from a different perspective. Hope it helps wavering customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"starts good, but then...","review":"I've always enjoyed the Sandman comics, and that prevented me from reading this novel when it was first released; just because Gaiman can write a superb comic, does that mean he can write a good novel? After reading it, my answer is no. It's very unfortunate, however, because his protagonist, Richard Mayhew, is very well characterized, and quite funny at times. I had a hard time understanding just what the point of this novel was. My guess: it's a version of those D&D quest-novels I overdosed on back in the early 80s. If you suffer from fantasy role-playing burnout such as I do (since junior high), avoid this book. Also, I figured Gaiman could be a bit more creative and avoid the \\"lost subterranean world\\" fall-back setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"too slow for me","review":"I saw all the positive reviews for this book and decided to grab it. I can't for the life of me figure out why people love it so much. It was one of the few books I didn't want to finish. Granted, it was excellent storytelling...but the story, in my opinion, is boring. With little to no action, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone looking for a little adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your mind bent and twisted to understand the world below...","review":"I loved this book because it explored the unseen people of the world and they became important. These unnoticed people had lives, and they had missions,,,the fate of the world hung on their success. The people of above(us) knew nothing of the life and death struggle going on ..or if it failed the world above would be adversly effected. The best thing about this book was that the writing...it carried you along for the ride...and made you forget that you had to get some sleep...you just had to know that things were going to be okay for the characters..who you might catch a glimpse of on your next trip to the city....sitting in a doorway"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is perhaps my favorite book ever. Neil Gaiman expertly creates a world on the edge of our own, where fantasy and reality meet.I'm at a loss for words, this book is so good. Go read it. Now. You'll thank yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book EVER!","review":"My friends were addicted to Neil long before I was. Being the avid reader I am, hearing them talk about his books all the time, and being a huge Tori Amos fan I just had to check him out. This was the first book of his I picked up and it quickly became one of my favorites of all time. It is amazing! The writing style is a little confusing at first but only for the first few pages. For someone who doesn't read all that often or hasn't read him before I might recommend \\"Stardust\\" first. But nevertheless this book is beyond amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neverwhere","review":"Neverwhere was the first book i'd read by neil gaiman, long before i'd read any of the Sandman work he's done. And i loved the book more then i had anything i'd veiwed before. And still do. The ability to transform the world and places in that world into something obviously appropriate for those who wished to see it as that.Neverwhere takes you deep underground and into worlds that you would possibbly never even consider exsisting with charecters that capture your intrest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute drivel","review":"I grabbed a copy of Neverwhere at an airport bookstore after only a few minutes of shopping and I wish that I had taken more time in my book selection. This was among the worst books I have read in many years. I started off disliking the main character after 20 pages and it didn't get any better as the novel progressed. There is no explanation for the background or functioning of \\"London Below.\\" There is a mishmash of bizarre characters, but none of them are well developed. The entire story ends on a whimper. Save your self and avoid this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"On the paperback edition of this book, one reviewer is quoted, comparing Neverwhere to \\"a dark, contemporary Alice in Wonderland...\\" I must agree, Neil Gaiman's writing is just as confusing as that of Lewis Carroll's, except less \\"classic\\". Some ideas were appealing to me, such as the young girl Door's ability to \\"open\\" things, but most were not. (For example, the London Below is a whole seperate world made of sewers, rats, people who speak to rats, and people who speak to rats who are taken away by the \\"darkness\\" never to be seen again.) Many concepts are left unexplained, and the ending is unfulfilling."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disappointing","review":"Being a loyal Terry Pratchett-fan I thought I'd read a book written by the co-author of Good Omens. I have to admit that Gaiman's style is rather original and the plot is quite good as well... yet his writing style was not as imaginitative as I had imagined. I finished the book and was left with an unsatisfied feeling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This book just flies off the pages. The charaters are so easy to like (or hate, or fear) and the world is so real I found myself up until 2 A.M. just to get to the finish and when I finally got there I was just sad that their wasn't more. I hope Neil Gaiman writes a sequel. Excellant book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Enjoyable","review":"If you are familiar with London then this book will certainly get your attention. I am not a sci fi or fantasy book reader but this book was really good. You feel the struggles of the main character and even when the struggle is something unfamiliar you can still somehow empathize."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imaginative and entertaining","review":"Well written and full of surprises.

While there were a lot of creative & unique aspects to this story, I found it disappointing.I can't classify the genre it would fall into, either. It's a little bit fantasy, but nothing like classic fantasy books I could compare it to."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fun read!","review":"I know a book is good if I find myself squeezing in a few pages whenever I can - before bed, on the train, on my lunch break, etc. This was one of those books.What really makes a book for me is vivid characters. I want to be immersed in their world. This book did it. Croup and Vandemar are truly creepy..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully odd...a dark, twisted take on Alice in Wonderland","review":"This was a really odd book, but wonderfully so. It's a story about two people really, Richard Mayhew and Lady Door. Richard has a fairly normal life in London. That is until he stops to help a girl named Door, who he finds bleeding on the street. This small act of kindness on Richard's part launches him into the world of London Below where all the people that fall through the cracks of London Above reside. Richard must now figure out how to survive in this place of darkness and monsters. He seeks out the one person he knows from London Below, Lady Door, to help him. But, she's on her own quest to determine who murdered her family and sent assassins after her."},{"rating":"2","title":"London Below.....and then some","review":"Incredible ride indeed. Neil Gaiman did it again. Just heard that they want to make a movie about Neverwhere. I saw the BBC adaptation and it was somehow dissapointing. Then again, this review is about the book and make no mistake it will take you London Below in a blink of an eye. At some point you could almost feel claustrophobic while your mind follows Richard, Door and the Marquis thru the endless passages. Great book indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fifth of Wings","review":"Wings was the funniest sit-com on TV in the '90s and if you were a fan like me, you'll want this complete collection of all the episodes from season five. All the elements are here from Brian's awful neckties to Tony Shalhoub's hilarious Italian cabbie. The highlights are the two episode shows where Joe chucks the airline for a tropical island, the episode where an ex-highschool classmate stalks Joe but no one believes him, and the show where the obnoxious but hilarious character Carlton Blanchard hires Antonio to chauffer him about the island. I still laugh at Lowell's non-sequitors, Helen's Virginia accent, and Fay's disarming delivery. This show was a classic. On the down side there are absolutely no DVD extras here: Zero, Zip, Nada AND the DVD quality is decidedly low definition. Thanks for nothing Paramount/CBS."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Gem","review":"A wonderful, engrossing, stylishly written, suspenseful, compact gem of a book. But after reading it, I was shocked to find the average customer rating to be 3 stars. This was based on just 2 reviews, one giving it 5 stars and the other 1 star. I suggest that an average rating not be given when the number of reviews is so small, where the effect of just one negative review (which I find in this case to be completely unjustified) can be devastating and misleading to potential readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie was bad, book is worse.","review":"The story starts out very good, but the farther one reads the slower and more boring it becomes, I was only able to scan thru the second half, as other reviewers remarked the sex scene is really really laughable, avocados indeed.

Roman historian Theocritus Lucius Westborough is there as being a stock holder of the mine. The pace was a little slow for me as I had to grasp several new terms about the mining.

Yes, there is factual data amongst the 288 pages, and it does manage to paint a picture of what occurred in Europe at the time, although it is seemingly repetitive. One does not really get a sense of the disastrous effects of the Black Death upon society until the final chapter, and even then the true harm is left to the reader to imagine.If the point of this book was just to look at the historical event from a statistical/scientific point of view, then this book might have been abridged to an extended magazine article.Interesting, but a bit too pedantic."},{"rating":"2","title":"the american covenant: the untold story","review":"Beautifully written.

I am certain that the author is not being the least bit homophobic, and I can't imagine any reason for him to be unreasonably alarmist about the dangers of gay sex or sex in general. But as a previous reviewer noted, the book's context does seem to run to the negative, and I wouldn't be too surprised if a lot of readers are completely turned off to gay sex by this book. Perhaps a book shouldn't be judged for not couching its topics gently, but I think a better effort could have made to make this book less frightening. Apparently here is the blunt, in-your-face, truth, and it's not pretty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing follow-up","review":"I bought this CD and gave an entire listen and I hate to say that it will likely be the last time I listen to it.

He, of all of the artists, impressed me the most. So much so that I bought both of his cds, and bought both for my sister. I also have turned 6 others onto him (and counting). I LOVE THIS MAN'S SOUND AND MUSIC. He is smooth, reminiscent of the older R&B artists. The rasp in his vocals and his poetry has him on repeat in my cd changer. It's like meth to a meth-addict. Get both cds. You won't be disappointed in the slightest.

Not one character had any redeeming qualities. Flat dialog ran throughout. This is such a dark story, it makes you feel that the author holds absolutely no faith in humankind. It went from chapter to chapter, as each character spiraled down and out of control.If you love to watch \\"B\\" movies and soap operas, you could probably tolerate this book.It seemed to be a good book, a page turner, which it was, but the ending was as flat as the dialog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Ride....","review":"I enjoyed this story.

The tale is interesting and the characters were very accessible to me throughout the story. Most of the characters aren't very likeable, with the exception of one or two, but you can understand their positions and why they choose as they do. The tale is also a bit soap opera-ish, but I say, if you are having doubts about buying it or not, buy it. It is worth it. It certainly is.

And I'm quite disappointed that I spent $18.00 on this paperback. Sure, the book had a fun premise about a man living a dual life, but the ending was the most depressing, suicidal conclusion I've unfortunately had the experience to read.

What I got is a \\"romance\\" novel disguised as suspense. Nearly every page describes some passionate encounter between characters, and stilted dialogue fills in the rest (the frequent product placements make me think the author is getting royalties). We actually chose a different book for book club, but if you're looking for a topical romance novel about cheating husbands, it might be a quick, fun summer read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good -- moral is a 'wake up call'","review":"I heard a lot about this book going around in reading groups before I bought it. It took me one sitting to read the WHOLE THING! At some scenes, I was so involved that I literally tossed the book across the room when the characters ticked me off. At any rate, the structure of the story is one I greatly appreciate.At one point, Reginald's family in Miami, Florida meets for a counseling session. The author supplied me with enough description to understand the actions of the family members - NOT CONDONE, but understand.In the end, I recommend this book to both men and women. It's a busy story but straight forward, and I believe that for men, it shows the unfortunate penances of infidelity and the effect on those who love you and you also love. For women, it shows the horror of the way in which we as women tend to accept immoral, disrespectful, and emotionally abusive behavior from our men.Reviewed by: P.

I found the story line to be believeable, and being a hopeless romantic, it touched me deeply. The author leaves no stone unturned, giving you mistery, suspense,drama and love all bound in a neat little package all the while leaving room for an on going story.

Lear's book is a copy of the Tanner Lectures that he gave to an audience at Cambridge University, so it is, unlike some of Lear's other works, quite academic.If this doesn't bother you, then you're in for a real treat. Lear uses the tools of psychoanalysis (in a reasonable fashion, thankfully) to pick apart Freud's postulation of the death instinct, and Aristotle's decree that happiness is the highest good.I was particularly impressed with his analysis of how guilt may have been a factor in both Freud and Aristotle's shaky attempts to base their theories on a single, all encompassing principle that gives life a teleological meaning."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hoped it would be better","review":"Jonathan Lear promises to treat one of the greatest subjects around; the relationship between psychoanalysis and philosophy. As a psychoanalyst who has also studied a lot of philosophy, this book seemed to have been written for me. If only! Lear has the maddening habit of never saying what he means, and instead couching all his thoughts in the most obscure prose. Reading this book is like wading through fog, or trying to follow a conversation on a crackling long-distance line. If only the apparent complexity was in line with the contents. But having just read the book twice from cover to cover, I can honestly say that Lear's conclusions are strikingly banal - and that he just expends vast amount of footnotes and bluster to reach them. Someone needs to write the book that this might have been. My choice is probably Adam Phillips, a wonderful British psychoanalyst, who I'd recommend everyone check out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good writing helps","review":"Jonathan Lear is clearly a very clever man, but this is one of those terribly annoying books where intelligence has just gone astray. Lear is writing - as with so many professors - with more than one eye on his colleagues. Hence his prose is extremely leaden, slow, burdened by trivial references - academic in the worst sense. And this is no minor quibble because Lear is dealing with the most important questions of life, and yet doing so in the language of a first year PhD student. Let's hope that in his next book Lear will find the courage to tell us what he really thinks, rather than restort once more to ultimately banal readings of Plato and Freud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Happiness, Death and the Remainder of Life","review":"Lear's book had three chapters. The first chapter, Happiness, was depressing. In the second, Death, about all that happens is Lear attempts to replaces Aristotle's \\"the good,\\" with Freud's \\"death.\\" It is the first time I have read about death without words like remorse, regret, sorrow, victory, or resignation being used once. Yes, I found the word guilt. The NY Times Book Review (Freud KO's Plato, by Richard Rory, Oct. 22, 2000) waxed on about the brilliant last chapter, so I read on. The last chapter, Remainder of Life, will have no consequences, impact or add new ways of thinking to my future, or anyone elses. Lear seems to know this stuff, but quoting others and referencing multiple sources does not make a good book, it is how you use the source material. The three chapters of the book can be summed up in three words, nothing new here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible...","review":"This was the first book in a new book club some friends and I formed. The book was chosen in August, 2001, but it wasn't until after 9-11 that I actually picked up the book to read. It was very odd and disconcerting to read at that time due to the title and subject matter, but I think in a way it helped me deal with emotions I was going through in the aftermath. As someone who has a degree in Anthropology, I'd previously ended up reading little bits and pieces of depictions of Islamic life - and fundamentalist Islamic life - enough that it was pretty obvious Marley did her homework prior to writing this. But it brought ethnography to life in a metaphorical context.

Unfortunately, and sadly, this was the first and last LP by this magical band. It is a cherished museumpiece in the hearts of all true Flying Nun oficionados. It's all here: from sweet, to sorrowful, magical, vicious, hilarious, and all-out-rockers. An incredible mix in one LP. The cd has some wonderful and rare extra tracks(including a sexy and fun rocker recorded live at a small venue). If you like the more ecclectic 60s rock (Love, Beatles, Byrds, etc.) then you'll LOVE the harmonies and distorted Rickenbacker guitars from this legendaryFlying Nun band. A MUST have for anyone who loves NZ bands and more ecclectic type rock music.

All of the illustrations are in black and white, and, if the photos were actually shot on a 950, (which I doubt), they are so poorly reproduced here as to do the camera a disservice. The things you really want to know about a 950 are available for free on a variety of web sites. Are you a beginner? Buy a good photo basics book or two on lighting, the effect of shutter settings, etc. Buy one containing color illos and glossy paper while you are at it. Are you an experienced photographer needing to know about digital cameras, which resolution settings to use, how big a memory module to buy, which batteries to use, and minutiae about the 950 in particular? Search the web for some sites set up by 950 owners, and even Nikon's own. I almost never return books. This one went back."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Short Course in Nikon Coolpix 950 Photography","review":"The book is spiral bound which is about the only high point about it.

Don't even bother ordering this book, it is a total waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Photo Class Manuscript","review":"Mr. Curtin's book looks like it was used at a community college photography class and then zeroxed poorly. The photos are pretty grainy for a book on digital photography. If you are using this book as a resource guide, subjects are hard to find. Granted, Nikon camera guides are often poorly translated and difficult to understand, but this book doesn't clarify a lot of things. For example, I use an off-camera Nikon Speedlight in a lot of my photos, and it took me 6 weeks to figure out how to turn off the built-in camera flash but still fire the external flash. I finally found the answer on the internet. If this book were selling for ..., it might be worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written generic book","review":"I bought this book because Thom Hogan's on the same subject failed to come out when promised last Fall. Curtin's book is nothing more than an adaptation of his book for the 990 which, although shares a lot of features with the 995, it is not the same camera. Pictures on the book are bad. He uses gray scale pictures to demontstrate the camera's color features. It is clear that Curtin used a word processor's find/replace feature to \\"convert\\" his book to the 995. Even that was done poorly. You are better off trying and failing while learning to use your camera's features. Reading this book will not get you much closer to knowing much about the 995 than just playing with the camera yourself. After all, you need not pay anyone to develop your pictures!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book Keeps the theorits honest","review":"One of the most balanced and factual account of the current state of the art of Physics I have read.

The only time i found his objectivity muddled was when he introduced personal examples and asides to illustrate his points.

If you read science books for non-scientists this is one of the best I have ever read (especially if you have read the Brian Greene books, like \\"The Elegant Universe,\\" because they help contextualize the author's (Lee Smolin) perception of String Theorists enthusiasm).

Unorthodox, honest, provocative, challenging the stereotypes. Nevertheless I have an impression that the author is driven by the same \\"dream of the final theory\\" as those string theorists he is polemicizing with. Are the four problems he states at the beginning of the book really \\"physical\\"? Hasn't the author fallen into the same trap of pursuing metaphysical issues as Einstein and the other model-builders, including string theorists? The book forces a reader to think about what is physics, which in my opinion is its main achievement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review pending. 2 stars after reading 24%.","review":"I've only got through 24% after three weeks.

Very masculine and although looking like a quality timepiece, doesn't look overly glitzy and bright as a cheap watch will quite often come off as. I like the automatic light for night time viewing, or when in a theater or darker area. With the sun charging the battery, there's no need to try to save energy or worry about the battery running down. I liked the red in the dial but the blue might be nice too.

Wellington, desperate to defend his hold on Portugal, sends Sharpe on a special errand into Spain to collect hidden gold. Along the way Sharpe Sharpe falls in love with one of the partisans and manages to make an enemy of her intended husband. This, like most of Cornwell's Sharpe novels, is a novel that can take the reader back in time and place him at the heart of the action. The battle scenes, as usual, are first rate and Cornwell's ability to create characters is unmatched. If you love adventure or war novels this one will not dissappoint!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Way to Learn about Napoleonic Wars","review":"I've really enjoyed reading the Richard Sharpe series of historical novels by Bernard Cornwell. They are easy reads and teach you something about the history of the Napoleonic wars. The author includes historical notes at the end of each book which delineate historical fact from his fiction. You find out, for example, if any of the battlements are still standing. After reading \\"Sharpe's Company\\" about the siege of Badajoz, Spain, I went there on Google Earth and took a virtual tour of the fortress.

I highly recommend all of Cornwell's work to those who enjoy this type of adventure writing, and most emphatically for those in high school, or those seeking similar reading experiences at a later age.But let's get to the title of this review. Amazon asks us all to review products almost as soon as the purchase is made, often before the purchase is received.

What a disappointment! The book presents very little new information for even beginning students. The highly-touted 'classic forms' are poorly presented and nearly impossible to follow. The worst flaw (to me) was that Montague's demonstrations of martial applications employ a teenage girl and a child as models! While these may be family members, to see the author triumphantly employing the 'superior moves' of Bagwa against a little girl is downright embarassing!

However the paper stock in quite nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"*sigh*","review":"First and foremost, if you are interested in a good book on a comprehensive study of Bagua, Park Bok Nam is the way to go. This book however, all I can say is, if you are more interested in just (random) applications and learning something that goes in the complete opposite direction of real Bagua, fine, then get this book. But just remember authentic Bagua is alot smoother which can make it more effective for defense along with creating greater health benefits and coordination.I have been told Erle has excellent Taichi stuff, I guess its true.

It was easy to set up and place in the pool. It is very easy to dis engage the alarm and take out of the pool for swimming. My pool cleaner (Kreepy Krawler) has not set it off. The house alarm goes off and on with the outside alarm. The alarm is not too loud but loud enough to hear it in an emergency. We have a freeform shaped pool and I was concerned that the wave motion would not activate the alarm in some circumstances. That has not been the case. We tested the pool with several gallon jugs tied together (about twenty lbs worth) and the alarm always went off. It is the waves that sets off the alarm. If you have wind action that gets your pool into a wave motion, this alarm will drive you crazy. We have terrible wind here, but our pool never gets wave action going during wind storms so it has not been a problem, so far.

It's clearly the choices that were made -- most notably the aforementioned decision to transpose all the songs to C. Anyone who wants to learn to play harmonica, even as simply as Dylan does, will probably be willing to buy more than one harmonica -- and changing the keys renders the ability to play along with the records useless.Changing keys (to make it easy for piano I guess) is a common problem with simple music and tab books.

They started off as a sort of French Duran Duran poppy band, that later evolved into a French Depeche Mode with darker sounding themes and sounds. Unfortunately, you don;t have to listen too closely to notice that all their tunes begin to sound alike. Even as my French is a joke, I can almost make out the way their songs go at first listen, as the grooves are well worn in their capacity to compose new music. As far as the lyrics or vocals go, same thing, and equally as disposable. I will be disposing of most of my Indochine CDs in the near future, but I will still keep my Duran Duran and DM albums.

The details from his story made me feel as if I was there, although no one could have gone through as much pain as Mr. Faber. It was an honor to hear of his experience after what he went through. It takes a strong willed person to go through what he went through and to continue to live with the pain and to tell others of his past.

There are way too many nooks for food to fall into that are really difficult or impossible to clean. Anything that goes in their lap goes down the holes for the straps. If it had been designed with the straps coming out of the sides like others we've seen since it would be much better. It's impossible to get out all the food that gets into it.

Since the second daughter is on the small side, this really big booster is still too large for her at 8 months, so although she is almost walking, she still slumps in the chair. In addition, the playthings on the sides are too difficult to use for a baby small enough to need a tray. On top of that, there is an unremovable bar between the legs that my toddler will not stand for, so I have found this one all but useless.It sounded like a good idea, but I think this one would have been better used only occasionally at Grandma's in stead of being our daughter's only booster at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Highchair","review":"Like many others, I thought this highchair would be great because we do not have a lot of room in our apartment.

I bought these for my twin boys thinking...two highchairs - not enough room. I now have two highchairs. The seats were not rated overly poorly when I bought them, and most of complaints centered around the toys being useless, which they are, but it didn't matter to me because my boys were going to be eating in them, not playing with them.... The problem is that they recline on their own. I have them at my mom's house for them to eat in because they were SO tough to clean - as one reviewer said, the food gets into the strap holes and you can't get it out. Now everytime I put the boys in there they recline. The sight of them trying to eat tipped back is cute and all, but EXTREMELY annoying when I've fixed the dumb things 14 times in 5 minutes. You have to take the baby out to put it back upright only to watch as it slides back into recline position.

My first intuition when I opened the box and put it together was to return it, because the peices didn't look like they were going to firmly stay together, but I didn't, and now I wish I did.

The worst thing about this chair is that food gets stuck in it, and there is NO WAY TO GET IT OUT!! It is really gross.

The toys on the tray are also fascinating for my son. He will outgrow them someday, but for now they keep him entertained while we finish getting his meals together. We also love the fact that it will be a booster seat at some point, so we won't have to buy a new seat when that time comes.

The recline feature allows small infants to sit in the chair. My daughter has used it since she was 4-months old. We placed toys on the tray and she would giggle at them. At age 3 she is still using this booster. The height adjustment feature is great because as she gets taller the chair can be made shorter. I like the stability of the chair. Even when fully reclined it was not prone to tipping. The chair goes camping, out to restaraunts, to family gatherings, etc. It serves as a place to keep my child busy coloring as well as for eating.I now purchase this chair for every baby shower I attend! The moms love it and everyone I know who has one has no complaints.If one thing could be changed about the chair it would be to add a padded seat of some kind because the hard, slick plastic can be a problem at times. But I simply place a dish towel or small blanket under my daughter and she is fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good....","review":"We love this chair because it doesn't take the space of a full high chair (and cheaper).

He could sit in the other one, but was constantly putting food in the holes in the seat. You can't take it apart to clean the area so you have to shake the seat and hope all the food falls out. It isn't very easy to clean at all.And when you take the seat off the chair you keep it on, there is food that has spilled out stuck to your chair. The Healthy Care seat doesn't work that way. You can wipe it all off and put it in the dishwasher. There are no holes for the little ones to hid their food for later:) It also folds down to take with you when you go somewhere. It costs around $25 in the store.

It seemed pretty convenient also because it reclines. Although you need to get a hang of that reclining option (can be pretty tricky) it was very useful when my daughter was just a few months old. Then I realized that since the seat itself doesn't have a padding (the back does have one) the holes for the safety straps are wide open and any food that falls off the tray goes automatically in these holes (it's like a law of physics!!!). It makes it extremely hard to retrieve even impossible at times (we end up with a nice colony of ants!).

Luckily my son has not cut himself when getting in and out, but it is a trying ordeal and he always screams. The food tray is a piece of junk along with the entire booster seat.

It was very difficult to adjust. Food would get stuck in the holes where the straps come out and it was impossible to retrieve it. It got stuck in the reclined position so we finally got to throw it out and get a new booster seat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just got rid of it!!!!!","review":"We couldn't seem to get the food out of the holes in the bottom. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM..it was a waste of money! Just because it looks nice doesn't mean it works nice!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing good about it!!!","review":"My daughter is 7 months old and cries everytime I put her in this seat. With my son we had a fully lined (this one is hard and uncomfortable) soft highchair, easy to recline (this is not). I would just suggest getting a high chair, the space factor was an isshue this time, but honestly when you place this chair on a regular seat you have just as much space taken up. The tray still sticks out pretty far, it is hard for us to slide the chair up to the table because of how low it is. I am very unhappy with this product, and I would not recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AZMOM","review":"I registered for this booster to save space and so that we could take it with us when needed. This is the most difficult chair to adjust and you have to take it off the chair and adjust it on the floor with assistance and force. Food gets stuck and is not easy to remove from the slots where the straps come out of. Daily I have to take the booster outside and shake the excess food out of the holes, which means once again detaching it from the chair. There is no chair covering for this booster and we have tried using a towel to catch the excess food, but it is not helping. Save your money or somebody elses, this booster is one big headache and inconvenience. We should all be able to get our money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy something else","review":"I wish I would have read these reviews sooner. I registered for this to save room, I should have gotten a regular high chair to save the headaches. There are two big holes where the safety straps come out of and one big hole where the bar goes down between my sons legs. Once the food goes in there is almost no getting it out. At least once a week we have to take the chair into the shower to blast the food out of the holes. I have tried filling the holes with paper towels, my son pulls the paper towels out and eats them. I have tried putting tape over the holes, this only causes a distraction, my son in more interested with peeling the tape off then eating. The chair is also very difficult to recline, and forget about trying to adjust the seat with your kid in it. Don't wast your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great, But One Flaw","review":"The seat is great itself. My nine month old is on the small side, and the big high chair was eating him up and the tray didn't get close enough to his body. This tray however does. He loves it. The only downside I see to this chair is the big holes where the belts are looped thru. Food get stuck in them and you have to tip the whole chair ( baby seat and all ) to get the food out. I think they could have designed that better, but overall love the seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"This seat stinks!","review":"My mother bought this seat to use at her house because she didn't have space for a high chair in her kitchen. At first, we liked it okay, pricewise it was cheap at the time and it reclined, which was a feature we liked. But it is difficult to adjust the recline on it. Plus, now that she's 2-1/2 she tends to get more crumbs and stuff in the seat and there are these little holes in the bottom for the straps where crumbs, broccoli, etc., tend to go hide out. It's super hard to clean because of those holes. I bought for myself the Fisher Price Healthy Care seat and would definitely recommend it instead! The only plus for this seat in comparison is the recline feature, which doesn't work so great anyway. Don't waste your time on this one, get the Healthy Care instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATE IT!!!","review":"My son recieved this chair as a birthday gift. We already owned a similar chair but this one seemed so much nicer. We were thrilled to recieve it until we actually used it. It is very difficult to clean. Food gets trapped in the little holed and even when we shake it out some food remains trapped. My husband takes it outside and runs the hose through the little holes near the straps and that usually does the trick. After he hoses it out we leave it in the garage overnight to dry. Keep in mind that if you purchase this chair this is a every night routine that you can look forward to. Prior to recieving this chair we were using a Fisher Price chair that was not nearly as attractive. We bought it for 10.00 at Kmart. The 10.00 Kmart chair actually comes apart and can be put in the dishwasher which makes cleaning up as easy as can be. As for this chair do not waste your money. More expensive is not always better and this chair is proof of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liked it at first but learned to hate it...","review":"I got this chair as a shower present and loved it but when my daughter started eating table food I quickly changed my mind. The chair is wonderful for younger babies who just need a place to sit while being fed baby food or even cheerios but once we atarted on table food it was impossible to keep it clean. Food goes down the holes for the straps and is nearly impossible to get out (I even tried using my shop vac). Once my daughter figured out the food could fit down there she thought it was funny to put it in there. I ended up buying a new Fisher Price Healthy Choice Booster and like it much better. I would not recommend anyone spenmd there money on this product because it is unsanitary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to Clean!","review":"This seat has holes in the bottom of the seat for the lap belt. Food falls into the holes and because the seat doesn't come apart, the holes can't be cleaned out. Disgusting! What a waste of money! I bought the Eddie Bauer seat for ten dollars more and have been happy so far with the removable/washable cloth seat cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreme waste of money","review":"I'm a mom of 11 month old twin girls. My mother bought these for us to save space in our kitchen. I wish I would have read the reviews before she bought it. The reviews are 100% true. It is the most disgusting food trap I have ever owned. You cannot get the food out and they are too heavy to shake out all the time. The toys on the side are a waste too. They are not in a location that the girls even notice them and are too hard to push to get them to work. I have tossed them out. What a WASTE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK!!","review":"Other than the convience of having a small booster seat, I would not recommend this product. Food gets caught in the holes where the straps come out and it is impossible to get to it. Even if you shake is out after every meal (which no parent has time to do) the liquid or softer foods get stuck. The base does not come off and that is where most of the nasty stuff gets to. I am throwing mine away and going to buy a better seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for small apartments","review":"This chair is great if you have no space for a full size high chair. My 5 month old daughter enjoys sitting in this chair. I have it tilted slightly because she cannot sit fully upright yet. It is easy to clean; there are no little crevices where the seat meets the sides (unlike another brand). The chair is very sturdy on my kitchen chair, which has a little padding. I also like that it is wide - more stability. It is hard but not impossible for me to tilt so I am not worried that it will move while my daughter is sitting in it. We don't use the tray yet because my daughter is rather small, and I don't care for the toys."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's great except for 2 little things!!","review":"Like everyone else mentioned, the \\"toys\\" are worthless - unless you are a full-grown adult with leverage, they don't work at all... I just took them off entirely.The other thing is the rough edges around the \\"leg bar\\"... I've banged her thighs more than once getting her out of the chair, and I'm always terrified of scraping her poor little legs on the rough plastic under the edge of that bar.But the space saving part of it alone is worth it!! It takes up no room in the kitchen, and allows her to sit at the table with us!I'm so glad we got this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good quality","review":"This chair is horrible. We bought it for our 4 month old and, like many other reviewers, we have to fight to adjust it. We were attracted by the reclining feature, but after the first use, we found that the edges are rough and the back keeps snapping out of place. The other thing is that right smack in the middle of the seat is a hard piece of sharp plastic sticking up. We folded up a receiving blanket for her to sit on. Whoever designed this did a horrible job. We threw the box away, but it's definately going back to Babies R Us."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AS GREAT AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE!!!!","review":"I purchased the All in One Reclining booster for our 2nd son who is 7 months old for 2 reasons I have an older son and his bulky high chair was always in the way and he out grew it so fast, so I purchased this thinking it would take up less space,and he would be able to use it longer Well I was right about that but that's it.. This is the worst design I have ever seen, the back rest doesn't stay in place and it pinches his arms. The tray is the worst part of all it won't stay on very well and sometimes if my son moves to much the tray will fall off!! I would not have bought this if I had known how poorly made it was. I was not pleased at all. THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU BUY THIS PRODUCT!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to clean!","review":"The concept is great, it is perfect for small homes and easy to cart to grandparents houses - however it is virtually impossible to clean. Food - I am talking about HUNDREDS of Cherrios - gets caught in several holes and gaps; you cannot take it apart to access the area under the seat where the Cherrios, etc. are hidden. My son is ten months and we haven't even begun the heavy duty self-feeding. A friend has the First Years brand and can put the whole chair in their dishwasher - straps and all. So unfortunately there may be another highchair purchase in our future!"},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!!!!!!SHOULD BE 0 RATING!","review":"My mom and I hate this seat! My little sister who is now 2, thinks it is fun to shove down food into the great big hole in the front. Once my mom and I were so desperate, we shoved a paper towel down the hole. It worked until now when my sister can pull it out. The toys are useless, my little sister is so mad that she cant push the toys hard enough, I can't and I'm older. if you even think about getting this item, your crazy!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a must NOT buy","review":"We bought this instead of a high chair. It tilts, it adjusts in height. It has cute toys in the tray. I could not get the toys to work, pushing with all my strength. No fun there. It was a lot of work to get the chair to adjust in height. Even with the 6? different angles that this could tilt at, I could only get it to stay in two positions, upright or laying back, nothing in the middle. The best part is the food falls into the cracks where the straps come out and it is impossible to ever get it clean again. We would take it outside and shake it upseide down and most of the crumbs would come out. If you bought this, take it back!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I can't stand this chair. When I hooked it to my kitchen chair it constanly came loose and slid around. It is IMPOSSIBLE to clean. The little holes that the belts come out of are like the abyss for food. Plus reclining the seat was virtually impossible. It is not convienient for taking it to restuarants either. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Found a way to clean it","review":"I agree with everyone's comments that this seat gets disgusting -- whoever designed it clearly doesn't have kids. I did find a way to get the food out of those holes though: Stick a vacuum cleaner hose into them. It's pretty gross to hear all of the food that comes out of there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"crumb picking 101","review":"We selected this item feeling that it was ideal due to its reclining positions and neutral colorway. The neutral color was the best aspect!Problem 1) The seat tilt slips back from the position that you select.2)The seat has two deep openings that the safety straps come out from... an ideal place to catch crumbs if you like that sort of thing! (and it is awkward to clean them out daily)3) The tray does not position itself or stay on wellOther than that, its great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this chair!","review":"Don't buy this chair unless you feel like cleaning out trapped food after every meal. I purchased this chair for my second child after using a similar one with my first. The old one you could remove the bottom easily so clean up was simple. This chair is awful. After every meal you find food in every nook and crany and it is almost impossible to clean. I have a hard time adjusting the chair and often have to wait for my husband to fix it. It is simply my least favorite baby item purchase. It is very obvious the designers of this chair do not have a one year child. Most days I feel like throwing the chair threw the window of the manufacturer. Do yourself a favor and do not purchase this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"I loved it until . . .","review":". . . my daughter began to feed herself! Booster seats are the way to go, but only if they can be cleaned easily and this one can not. Tons of food gets \\"lost\\" in the two holes in the seat where the straps come out. I too have tried stuffing papertowels into the holes, but my daughter just picks them out. I usually have to get the vacuum out to clean the chair after meals. My daughter is 18 months now and the chair has served me well, but we are going to buy a different one, now that we know what to avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This thing is awful.

I can't wait to get rid of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this seat, it's not worth it!","review":"For starters, if it helps, I'm mother of three and have used other boosters before. I bought this one a few months back, about March, 2004. Biggest mistake I ever made.From day one my little one figured out how to push the bar that holds the tray away so it made the whole seat fall apart. He thought that was a blast.The whole thing is poorly designed and made, in my opinion. If you have any questions about how well you might like it, go to MCDonalds, get some cheesy toys, (personally I didn't see why you'd want the distraction of the toys at mealtime to begin with), then take them home, and glue them, along with a picture of a bear to a stack of phone books. It would be cheaper in the long run and work better too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept, poor design","review":"I purchased this booster seat for my 14 month old son. He is learning to eat on his own and is very messy! Inevitably food falls onto the seat and gets trapped in the large gaps where the belts come through. Cleaning the booster is next to impossible because it does not disassemble, you can't even remove the belts. To clean it, I have to remove the fabric seat back and then spray the entire chair down in the sink! Even then, I am unsure if I have cleaned all the trapped food out because I can not see the area I am attempting to reach. I have resorted to covering up the gaps in the seat with masking tape to prevent frequent \\"deep\\" cleanings.The concept of the booster is great for people looking for an alternative to a highchair and who have younger children, NOT SELF-FEEDERS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Good--until you actually have to use it","review":"I recently purchased this seat and was very disappointed when I opened the box and got it home. While it looked big and sturdy in the store and on the package(which I liked), it's very heavy and bulky, and VERY difficult to use. Unfortunately, the size and bulkiness of this seat makes it difficult to find a chair that this booster will fit on. The size and bulkiness also makes it very inconvenient to travel with. I found this booster seat to be extremely difficult to adjust the height or recline it. It actually took me and two grown men to get the seat reclined! It's definitely not easy to adjust unless there is WD40 involved! Also, the toys seem like a neat idea but are too difficult for an adult to operate let alone a child. I would recommend trying out the seat with your baby in the store if you can. Unfortunately, I made the mistake of not trying this seat out when I had the chance, if I had, maybe I would have saved myself the aggravation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this!!","review":"I bought this chair thinking it would be a great booster, but it is not!!

I ended up just holding him in the bathroom sink until he got bigger and I could hold in sitting position until I started using the tub I bought where he could soak in the water a little bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea in theory ONLY","review":"We too have a small house with no storage so we thought this product would be great. It seems they have fixed the foot rest problem, so that was a plus. Yet it would not fit in any of our sinks, so we were bent over the bathtub. Plus it sits so high that we had to put a great deal of water in the tub just to reach his bottom. There are no straps so when he learned to move that was that. While he was still little we ended up bathing him on a hand towel in the tub with just about an inch of water then we switched to a bathtub seat. I think this product seems like a great idea, but it still needs work."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent bath seat","review":"I've started using it with my newborn and found it very easy to \\"shower\\" him by simply pouring water over him. Because it doesn't fit in my sink, I use it in the bath tub. This seat eliminates the whole \\"sitting in unclean water\\" thing. Plus the fact that it folds compactly is great. It can be used at home or when you are away. It fits neatly in any suitcase and dries quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like","review":"I did not like this for a newborn. It might be better for an older baby. My little girl slid all over the place and turned sideways. We got the Sure Comfort Deluxe Newborn-to-Toddler tub and like it much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"I bought this item when my son was 1 month old. It's great! It's so much easier than using an awkward baby bath tub. You just sit it in the tub and it does a wonderful job supporting your baby. It reclines in two positions. The mesh covering allows for quick drying and it's washable. The only draw back is that there's no way to hang it up anywhere to dry. Other than that, it's a great product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately a bummer buy","review":"I am so disappointed that I have to return this. The others are correct, the bottom doe NOT stay down and there's no way your baby's weight will make it stay (it will make it flip even quicker). I LOVE the idea of a sling as opposed to a tub since it seems much more comfortable and gentle so I'm going to look for another before just exchanging it for a tub. I thought, \\"Maybe they just had bad luck. They can't ALL be like that. It won't fold on me.\\" Wrong. (Bummer!) Put your efforts into picking a tub instead, or find a different sling. It's too bad they can't fix this since so many people seem to like the idea. I really am bummed out about this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so safe product....","review":"I'm going on vacation next week and purchased this thinking it would be the perfect thing. It looks like a really great bather...compact, comfortable for baby, easy to use....I thought my 5 mo. old would love it. Well, she's starting to roll over now and it turned out to be not such a great thing afterall. The bottom flap kept popping up and I had to hold my daughter down so that she didn't roll over and out. I'm returning it today....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but not great","review":"I bought this product because it is compact and easy to store! I however have the same problem as do alot of other parents. The bottom keeps flipping up while I am bathing my son. I have to hold down the foot rest part while I am bathing him making it rather difficult. It is a great idea but they should have tested the product more before putting it on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Great Tub","review":"I bought this tub seat hoping to not have to hold on to my son while I tried to bathe him. The foot support comes up to high making it awkward for him to sit in the seat causing him to fall over. This is not good for small infants."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used this once and gave it away","review":"I registered for this product because I have a small house and didn't have a good place to store a full-sized baby tub. This does fold up nice and small, but it is useless. The bottom of the chair sits an inch or two above the sink or tub- so in order to have the baby in any water, you need to fill up the sink quite a bit. With so much of the baby out of the water, my baby got cold very quickly. The mesh seat wicks the water all over, so she was sitting in a very wet chair. It was a disaster (think screaming, cold, baby). I ended up using a regular old baby tub, which if I twisted just the right way, fits under my bathroom sink.I was using this with a newborn, perhaps it would be better with an older baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Gift - Use it ALL the time","review":"I got this as a gift for my 4th child and only wish I had it for the other 3. My first son had a big tub that I used once because the suction hose never worked. After that all of them were bathed in the sink where you master the art of bathing with one hand - not much fun. This allows you to have your hands free. The two positions make it convenient as the baby gets older. The mesh allows it to air out with no smell of mildew. It folds up so we just keep it in our bathroom - just throw it in the tub if company's coming.I bought it as a gift for my cousin because I recommend it that much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this bather!!","review":"I tried 2 other types of tubs but this one was the only one that seems to hold my 3 month old in. This allows me to have better control of her when bathing. Wish I had started with this one!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy","review":"Like the others, I am so disappointed in this product. I live in an apartment and was really anxious to have something so compact (since my home has been taken over by baby items) but I can't use it. As soon as I put my baby in the sling, the foot snap comes undone and folds up on my baby. This can't be safe!! And how are you supposed to hold this down and wash an infant at the same time?? We had to go buy a regular tub because I just couldn't use this product for my little one. Don't waste your money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So much for feeling safe!","review":"Like another reviewer, the foot area of this tub kept popping up and it made me feel very uncomfortable about the safety! Aside from the safety issue, my son (6 weeks at the time we used it) wasn't comfortable because his feet were not in a comfortable position. I returned this item just for the safety/flimsiness issue. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I wish I would have taken into greater consideration the bad review this product had recieved. It does not fit in my sink and when used in the bath tub, requires way too much water for a newborn. I intially bought the product because I liked the storage aspect, well now it gets to be permanetly stored under my bathroom sink. I purchased the old fashion tub today with a teddy bear sponge for comfort. My little girl and I are much happier with our new purchase. Don't waste your money on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept but needs improvements","review":"Like the rest, the bottom of my bath seat folds up and it is really hard to bathe the baby while constantly fighting the seat. It is still better than those cold, hard plastic baby bath tubs, though. After reading the review that said they have improved the product, I am going to call the manufacturer and see what happens. Also, I don't think anyone else mentioned this, but you would have to have a very big sink to use it in one. A regular double kitchen sink is way too small."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is perfect for the tub!","review":"Some of the past reviews say that the foot part flips up. I'm guessing that has been resolved because I have never had this issue, the foot part snaps into place so there's no way it can flip up. This tub is too big for my kitchen sink but my sink isn't very big. I put it right in the tub and it works great for us. It dries quickly and folds up compactly. This tub is great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Designed Product","review":"This seat is not at all sturdy. The bottom portion will not stay down, and I'm not about to put my baby into it. I bought it yesterday, and I'm returning it tomorrow. It does not seem safe at all. It is so light that it seems like the baby could easily tip over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Concept idea than reality allows for","review":"Bought it for the same reasons of:1. space saver (folds up)2. use in sink and tub3. holds baby with good supportLike it because:1. folds up2. dries quicklyHATE IT because1. BABY SLIPS down/off the older she gets (worse in the tub)2. Didn't fit in our standard size sink (the base did, but her neck still hit the edge of the sinkFor our next baby, I've already registered for the pillow-type support that hangs to dry. Picture of real mom with baby in the sink sold me...I'd rather have it soak up some water than have a useless item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fold up while in use..","review":"I loved the concept of this seat, and it fits well in my sink, also the amount of water was not an issue. The issue I had/have with it is the leg section keeps folding up while in use so it makes it awkward for my son to lay in it. I was imagining it would be like a bouncy seat and almost conform to my son. I found it to be very stiff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"This looked like a promising bath seat. It fit into my kitchen sink, it folded flat for storage or travel, and I liked that it was not hard plastic or foam. However, the foot end would not snap into place no matter what I did and it kept flipping up. I should have heeded those older reviews that said it did this. It was a constant hassle to keep one hand on the foot end to keep it down and keep the other on my baby...I needed another hand to wash her! Not only that, but the seat sits high and it takes a bit of water to fill the sink so the baby sits in some warm water and doesn't get too cold. I ended up getting the Safer Bather and was very happy with that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compact design, but unsafe and unstable","review":"I was excited about this tub design because it was basic and compact. It folds up nicely and is easy to rinse off. The mesh sling is removable for machine washing too.Unfortunately, the bath sling doesn't suction to the bottom of your tub or sink so it slides all over the place and is very difficult to control while holding onto your baby with one hand and bathing her with the other. My daughter is now four months old and I need to discontinue using this tub b/c she is much more active and I can't keep the tub in place.If it had a belt to help secure the baby and suction cups on the bottom, this product would be ideal. Unfortunately, this product was a big disappointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good alternative to a bathtub!","review":"I registered for a 4-in-1 bath tub, but returned it because it was such a hassle! I like it because it folds up and it is easy to store. The hospital gave me a basin to bathe my son in and he would cry everytime I would give him a bath. He loves this bather, he hasn't cried yet! My husband wouldn't give our son a bath in the basin because he had to hold the baby and he would get very slippery. Now my husband loves to give our son a bath!! Don't waste your money on a tub....buy this instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great seat","review":"This is a handy little seat and very reasonable...it works great in the kitchen sink while the baby is an infant. It is nice that you don't have to fill up a big plastic tub, drain it and then find somewhere to put it. This folds up and dries quickly in your dish rack. It holds the baby upright for you while you wash and use the sprayer, it is not meant to use on mobile infants that are sitting up, I definitely would recommend this it was a life saver especially after a c-section....."},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea...bad design","review":"We like the idea that you can just fold this bather up and store it away or take it to Grandma's.However, no matter how hard we pressed down the seat prior, when we seated our newborn into it, the bather folded his little legs up toward the ceiling! We took what we thought was just a bad apple back to the store & got another one...no luck. Perhaps this bather works better for heavier babies, or maybe we just got TWO bad apples, but for now -- sure he's flexible -- but this was a ridiculous way to try to bathe!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesse y Joy, QUE TALENTO!","review":"WOW, tengo que decir que al oir su musica de quede sorprendida.

The quilt patterns range from simple to complex for beginners and the more experienced quilter. For those of you who are beginners, invest in a rotary cutter system for this will make redundant cutting of pieces much faster and easier. I did find that I needed to purchase some extra yardage of fabrics due to my choice in color and arrangements, keep this in mind if you should chose to vary from the colors used in the book. I would have liked to see pointers on how to handle complex intersections in some of the star patterns that would have made them lay nicer. I had to learn by trial and error. (Practice with scraps on these until you feel you have it down.) All in all I found this volume to be well laid out with beautiful photography and helpful. The abundance of available pattern pieces was generous and should keep the reader busy attempting to recreate the wonderful quilts depicted in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Friends","review":"I first purchased this book about 15 years ago, Georgia use to do a show on my local PBS station and I had started to quilt with a church group.

It is full of spelling and grammatical errors, changes in characters and/or personalities in the same sentence/paragraph. I felt as if the author had a pretty decent story but got lost in too many details; which prevented the story of \\"Betty\\" from moving along smoothly. Throughout, the author boldly interjects her comments on the story, which broke my focus plus I didn't care about her opinions (as the author), just tell the story!! The synopis on the back is misleading, I was not inspired or educated at all. ....Mrs. Stevens is open to the criticisms and the opinions of her readers and has a down-to-earth personality (I recently met her).

With all the spelling and grammatical errors I found it difficult to follow. The author couldn't decide if the story should have been written as herself or Betty and it was evident throughout the book where there were references to both \\"I\\" and \\"Betty\\". I felt the synopsis of the book written by the author was misleading and a stretch. It wasn't spiritual, funny or educational. I didn't see any positive resolution to any of the issues presented. It didn't inspire me in any way as the author said it would. Betty didn't seem to learn from her mistakes.On another note, I had the pleasure of meeting the author and she's very down to earth and very accepting of criticism.

Except for the homeless man, the characters are all boring. Apparantly the man who wrote and directed the movie also chose to be the main star. Unfortunately I can only describe him as a bad actor. In fact I knew he was a bad actor right from the beginning. His interactions with his mother seem rehearsed and scripted instead of making it appear like a natural interaction.

Big mistake. BTW, I have Burberry Brit and Burberry Touch and both of those are pretty good so I was looking forward to the Burberry original and I really wanted to like it.

Last time I will do that again with colognes. really should have visited the mall or dealer to smell it first hand. I used to own Burberry Touch, which I really liked for a spring cologne but wanted something a little bit more long lasting. I gave this a shot and I was not only disappointed but it gave me headaches every time i used it. I know some cheap colognes do that to me, but I wasn't expecting this from burberry. The bottle quality sub par and the smell over the top! not sure if it was the spice used but in a closed door meeting at work I noticed that I started to have the headache and also noticed people inching away from the strong smell. And this is just from one spray to the chest under my shirt. I probably would put it up on craigslist for 10$."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light and Fluffy - Doesn't last","review":"I love this scent and so do most people who smell it on me.

Burberry by Burberry is one of the very few that stood out.I loved how it smelled masculine, but didn't have a smell similar to those scents that are associated with \\"manly men\\". The scent is fresh and gentle. Just one spray stays with you for the entire day.It's eight years later and I still buy a new bottle of Burberry every time I run out.If you're a fan of Ralph Lauren \\"Romance\\", Christian Dior's \\"Fahrenheit\\" or Giorgio Armani's \\"Aqua Di Gio\\", you will find Burberry appetizing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blechhh...","review":"This stuff smells like insecticide, like RAID or something.

Unfortunately, due to it being out of print, that is impossible for most us.Please, please re-print Principles of Knitting and bring joy to knitters everywhere! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best reference EVER!","review":"This book serves two purposes. It is the best reference book I've found on things like casting on, casting off, different increases, different decreases. More importantly, the reader learns to THINK about knitting. Why does a stitch lean to the right or to the left, and when would I want to make a stitch that behanves that way?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This is an incredible book, containing information not available anywhere else. For example, it has a modified long tail cast-on that produces perfect results - beautiful and very elastic. I haven't seen this version of the cast-on in any other book. The explanations are very clear. The book might be too comprehensive for a total beginner, and the author is a bit too opinionated on the subject of continental knitting. But these are very minor quibbles. The important thing is that if you know how to knit, but have nagging recurring problems, this book will probably fix that. Practically every technique is explained and/or illustrated in a way as to make easy to understand and reproduce.

Nonetheless, the book is a must have for every serious knitter.Before you cough up big $$$ on eBay, note: According to a 3-2007 posting on the Simon & Schuster site, the book is tentatively scheduled to be released in the summer or fall of 2008.

I'm less impressed with the story, especially the central idea of a disfiguring illness affecting teenagers. This lends itself to horrific imagery, which is masterfully drawn. It's a good metaphor for fears about sexual disease and alienation. However, as a narrative element it's too fantastic for my tastes.Why are teenagers allowed to walk about looking like \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" extras? There's no involvement of doctors, teachers, or parents. Kids turn ugly, then go to live in the woods. A reader has to buy into this conceit, and I couldn't.For me, the ghoulish visuals and the frequent nudity weaken the message about teens growing up. Alienation is a complex topic, and it's overly simplified by making it so graphic.The \\"whodunnit\\" element feels tacked on. The aimlessness of the characters doesn't encourage much in the way of incident."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh? what is this about, again?","review":"I was led to believe that this is a great ground breaking book in comic novel, but came away with a bad taste in mouth. I think the artist lacked the sense of meaningful unity in his story. Then again, I am much older, more comfortable with the underground comix from the late 60's-70's. The artwork in this book gives that nostalgic feel for the black and white comix, but wow...very derivative of pointless highschool \\"drama\\" genre...where there is no drama, but life goes on drearily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half-baked","review":"I'm surprised this book got such a favorable reception. I found it half-baked in every regard. The characters aren't very compelling. The central conceit of the book - that there is a contagious disease of some sort that produces bizzare deformities seemingly unique to each individual -- a tail, a talking mouth in a neck-- is rather puerile. Everyone seems to take this state of affairs in stride, for reasons that go unexplained, and they're more worried about getting laid even if it means contracting the disease. But nothing much happens - the story crawls along and then peters out. The black and white artwork is rather dull. I can't think of anything to recommend this book, actually."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Art, Fantastic Story","review":"\\"Black Hole\\" combines the unsettling normalcy of Dan Clowes with the heart-rending angst of the Hernandez Bros. His images are clean yet complicated, and the story is masterful.\\"Black Hole\\" is a challenging read, revealing the darkest depths of teenage life. This is a story about the things that happen at 3am, after all the good times have ended, and things just get weird. It's also about growing up, coming of age and all that is inherited. And there's a little suspense thrown in for good measure.It took Charles Burns a long time to create this book, and I'm willing to wait for his next one, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Graphic novel, set in the '70s, with a group of teenagers and the very strange mutating-STD that develops. Primarily a character-driven piece, using the weird disease as both metaphor and the driving plot to character transformation. Also has a somewhat unnecessary horror mystery arc put within the larger narrative. The artwork is beautiful, very distinctively and evocatively drawn. I first saw this book in the gift shop for an art museum, and I can see why. The story is also reasonably effective, if not quite as breathtaking. The use of genre elements is poor (the bug pretty much has to be magical, no explanation for the origin is given and people seem remarkably unconcerned about a disease that causes a second mouth to grow on someone's neck). Still, it's effective for some very creepy moments and some solid character progression."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pueblo and Co. Sprs.

His line drawings and sketches are better then usual and are easy to find and follow.My only gripe is that a lot of the southern front range bouldering classics are on private property and no directions are given to several areas. I think when a climber is accessing private property, a simple stop at the owners residence will often gain you legal access to these precious gems.From and ex-greenhorn valley dweller, enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reveals a wealth of Information unattainable before","review":"This book offers easy to read maps and drawings with a personal touch not seen in other guides of this type. A wealth of information has been gathered and revealed within the text. This just one of a series of books that has a unique handcrafted touch were value will increase with time.

The two \\"Heart of Chicago\\" comp discs came out only a few albums back. Anyway, Chicago is one of my all-time favorite groups, but isn't it time they put out an album of new material, as opposed to *another* CD of their greatest hits arranged in a different order? They're still such great musicians that they shouldn't have to rely on gimmicks and touring the oldies-circuit, but for some reason they've chosen that path. They deserve better, and so do their fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"I miss the old Chicago","review":"My friend told me that Chicago didn't really do anything good after Chicago II except the song Saturday In the Park, and I agree with him. Back before they became soft-rock icons, Chicago was tough blues-rock band, as displayed on their debut album, which featured rockers such as Introduction, Poem 58, South California Purples, Someday and I'm a Man. Chicago II lost the rock edge a bit, but still gave us rockers with 25 or 6 to 4 and the It Had Better End Soon suite. After that, they just died. Just like that. Became dull soft-rockers, churning out sleep-inducing, elevator music-ish ballads such as You're the Inspiration, If You Leave Me Now, Along Comes a Woman, Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow?, Stay the Night, What Kind of Man Would I Be and countless others.

This compilation was a great dissapointment. The depth of Chicago's sound has always impressed me the layers of voices and horns. I listened to the first four tracks on my upstairs system and it sounded a little flat like AM radio. This system is under powered and I thought that the dynamics might be a problem. I then moved to my primary system, far from under powered, and listened. No improvement and noticable distortion in the the horns. While I won't take it back, I will wait for the soon to be issued remasters to purchase any more Chicago. Hope they put out a good version of Carnegie Hall. (I still have that on vinyl somewhere.)

All her books are terrific and my husband enjoys them as well. In fact we almost fight over who gets to read her lastest first. I've recomended them to all my friends and they all love her.

Maybe someday, when I have read all my other Doctor Who novels, I'll come back to it, but it'll unfortunately sit on the shelf until that desperate day. I was very sad to have to abandon my attempt to enjoy this novel, because I treasure every Doctor Who novel that I can find, but I think reading 50 pages of a book is a pretty fair chance to give any book. Sorry, Doctor, but this one is just not my kind of story."},{"rating":"2","title":"delightful little confection","review":"Like the previous reviewer, I agree that the writing is simple and there is a lack of depth in the presentation. However, unlike the previous reviewer, I don't believe that that spoils the project. This little volume was meant as a general intro to a subject with many chapters and even more footnotes. For readers with just a passing interest, this will be sufficient information. For others, it will whet their appetites (a short bibliography is included). Either way, there is no denying that this little book is very handsomely produced and a delight to behold. The many vintage photos and illustrations are outstanding - they compensate nicely for the sparse text . If you only read books found in univeristy libraries, this project will probably disappoint. But if you like smartly produced picture books and the story of early flight is of interest to you, you will be happy to have Ms Winter's work. At a mere 5 in. X 8 in., this little volume travels well, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is my mood","review":"I needed to listen to this today because \\"The Stakes Have Gone Up\\" expresses the way I feel so well. Some things did not matter for a while, but we can get quite a song out of Bruce McCabe for \\"Somebody Mentioned Your Name.\\" When every street has become memory lane, Bruce McCabe suggests going someplace else. Buy this so you can listen to it when you need his advice. Also, it is highly musical and rocks. I love songs about trouble, and it take a real musician to do these like a real entertainer. It rocks like true entertainers having a good time bleeding all over the place."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT good for running...","review":"...the stiff metal band in the middle, coupled with the hard plastic edge of the covering and the inability to set a fixed tension point (the design ends up tightening the fit more and more as you run), render these bands extremely uncomfortable if worn around the ankles on bare skin, and not much better around the upper arm or (least uncomfortable) the wrist. I guess if you were wearing it over pants or a long-sleeved jacket it would be less of a problem.I bought this product hoping to use it with my Garmin footpod, but alas the band is actually too wide to fit the footpod's slide-through belt loop casing, so I had to take a pair of utility scissors and trim a part of the band.Now I will have to try and find an ankle band made of neoprene or some other softer material with a velcro closure or some other means of adjusting the tightness of the fit. Oh well, the pitfalls of internet shopping---not being able to try something on first before ordering."},{"rating":"1","title":"reflectivity","review":"I wanted to buy reflective accessories for my kids who often play night games.

I often run at night on roads in my neighborhood.They are very comfortable. I don't notice I have them on. but I always have at least knee hi socks on, if not tights. They also have not rubbed the layer they are over.I rated 4 because I do think they could be more reflective. I would not rely on this as your only safety measure, but it's a great easy addition to the process and a little extra reflective can't hurt. I would recommend this product, just not as a primary source of visibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Price, Good Reflectivity","review":"This product is very good for the price. I place one around my left upper arm, just above the elbow and one on my right ankle. It's winter so I wear running tights, so I can't say if the ankle one would be ok on bare skin. I suspect it is as with tights I don't notice it at all. The arm one takes a bit to get used to, when it's new it has a very tight radius from being stored in the package and the trailing end wants to curl up and dig in. A couple of uses and it goes away.UPDATE - Had some freakishly warm weather and was able to wear shorts. I normally use no-show socks so this thing was on my ankle on bare skin. I really didn't like the feel at all. However, if you wear low cut socks, or any sock that will come up above the collar of the shoe, it would probably be ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very reflective","review":"This product is only reflective to 400 feet. Poor comparative value. Lot of better products available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratchy velcro","review":"These ankle bands are highly reflective, so I was looking forward to trying them. Unfortunately, if you wear shorts, the velcro scratches against your bare skin. I tried all sorts of variations: loosening/tightening the bands; turning the velcro towards the front, sides and back of my ankles; and wrapping the bands clock-wise and counter-clockwise around my ankles. Nothing worked.Nathan could re-design these by using velcro that is narrower than the width of the band. That would be easy to do. With the current design, these are probably better suited to wearing over pants or long socks. Bicycle commuters with long pants would probably love them. However, I will be returning these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Climat 0.47oz. Parfum Splash for Women by Lancome","review":"My mother and I do not believe this product as authentic.

There is no excuse for this product, it is completely unacceptable. Every single page is poor quality in addition every odd page is extremely faint and hard to read especially when the text gets very small as with fractions in formulas. The beauty of online shopping for retailers is the inconvenience of returning items especially if you are ordering from Canada to a US address just across the border. This book would have vanished from the shelves long ago if it were sold only in bookstores. I can only hope that by adding my review I will help to quell this type of nonsense.

The book however strays dangerously close to the \\"New Age\\" in several places. In an early chapter he presents Kants' idea of a priori knowlage as proven fact (it is far from proven). In another chapter he lapses into a discussion that sounds suspiciously like numerology (Mr. Campbell, someone as smart as you should know that there is no connection between the number of bumps on a golf ball and hindu mythology.)

Waste of money. Yes, there are a few decent licks and ideas, but the play-along c.d. is embarrassingly awful. If you ever played Playstation video games 10 years ago, then you will agree the c.d. is reminiscent of the Spyro the Dragon soundtracks. Cheesy drums and keyboard. With technology today, at least get some real drum loops in there and change the tone of the casio keyboard. Also, there are no real songs that anyone would recognize when you get through each section. More fusion based chord progressions that end up sounding the same very quickly. Buy Hal Leonard, which progresses very nicely and you will end up playing songs from Earth Wind and Fire, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and The Commodores :Brick House!

The singers (Jorge Villamizar (vocals/guitars), Andres Lopes (bass/guitar) and Jose Javier Freire (drums/vocal) ) have done an excellent work.Some of the songs are more popular than others, for example: CARALUNA and MI PRIMER MILLÓN. These songs are not the only good ones,because EL EDIFICIO, BARCELONA, BUENA, ELENA and SOLO UN SEGUNDO are great songs, too.I like this CD because it is a different kind of music. The first time I heard Bacilos (in the house of a friend), I liked it. The first song I heard was \\"Caraluna\\": I loved it. But I bought the CD only some months after that, and de only thing that I regret is that I didn't buy it before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the first album","review":"In my humble opinion Basiclos rushed to produce their second CD; using material of inferior quality (compared to the first one).

I have been following the music of Los Bacilos for years as they played the Miami circuit and adored their first album. I heard \\"Mi Primer Millon\\" and \\"Caraluna\\" live several times before I heard the recored version and though the songs didn't grab me right away, I love them now that I have heard them a few times. There is significant growth on the new album, a lot of fiddle, some tango ingfluences, and it is not as beautifully naive and basic as the first album but clearly these guys are working on a bigger budget now that they are touring like crazy with Alejandro Sanz and have one grammy nod in their pocket.Buy this album, you won't be disappointed, but the best thing is that it shows that these guys are not wearing thin and there is still so much great music to come.

It wasn't particularly helpful in our situation - dealing with a teenager.

The symptoms are so similar that separating them into two syndromes seems to add to the puzzle rather than be helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"This book was limited to the author's experience with her own child and at times it appeared that she was bragging about her son, her life, her lifestyle etc. We don't all have unlimited funds to pick and choose private schools.............etc. Then, the author picks up and moves the whole household to find a different school that she heard might be good. Regular families struggling with NLD and autism don't often have the funds to do all this and it made me put down the book feeling less understood than before. Advice in the book was same as you would find in an intro book about the disorder."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"This CD is amazing - it is uplifting, it is soothing, and it has the perfect balance of upbeat numbers and slower ballads. Todd Herzog communicates through his music like no other artist I've ever known. It evokes emotions and often mental imagery - a waterfall symbolizing a new relationship; a rainstorm symbolizing an argument, etc. It speaks of love and life and what's really important in life. Songs such as \\"I'll Be Waiting\\", \\"What I Wouldn't Give\\", and \\"I Guess It Should Rain\\" explore the concept of persevering during difficult times, while \\"Out There\\" and \\"Listen Close\\" give great advice about getting in touch with oneself and discovering our purpose for living. Some of the ballads are so beautiful and touching that I am moved to tears. And Todd's voice is so beautiful - expressive and soothing. This CD has helped me to appreciate what's really important in life.

(Thus far.)Every chess player will find something here to benefit from. If I were only going to buy 10 chess books, this would definitely be one I would purchase.

The book is aimed at the intermediate and advanced player. It starts with a brief introduction to the players and the game for each game and then proceeds to explain and analyze what is happening in the game. It contains the right amount of explanation and analysis to appeal to a wide variety of players and has plenty of diagrams so that the stronger player will not need to have a board and set to follow the action. For the less experienced player, the authors place a aynopsis of the lessons to be learned at the end of the game.Although the description of the book say 512 pages, it is actually 624 pages.

This book has easily replaced that book as my favorite games collection.While \\"500 master games\\" is still great- I feel that this is superior for several reasons; 1) it is in algebraic notation 2) the games span a greater time horizon and include a few more modern games 3)the annotations are by world class players 4) the annotations are based upon a more modern understanding of the game, and 5) the \\"pre-game\\" commentary describing the players, their syles, and the specific tournament all add to the enjoyment of playing over the games.This instructional, historical, and just plain fun factor of the games is excellent.

Also, Fischer/Spassky 1972, game 10. Fischer played, in my opinion, one of the most devestating endgames ever. Finally, Deep Blue/Kasparov 1997, game 2.

For anyone who loves 80's music, this is a great item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time Warp","review":"I guess only someone who was a teen or 20something could really appreciatethis set. The 80s were my high school and college years and I wascertainly guilty of listening to the radio .... This set is awesome andis really made indispensable with the booklet. My only gripe lies withthe artists that were huge in the 80s, but evidently could not be licensedfor this set....Notably U2, REM, Hoodoo Gurus, Wall of Voodoo, etc"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like!

I hadn't bought any '80s collection until this one because none of the others were ever comprehensive enough, nor did the others have the one-hit-wonders that I loved. This set has them all -- indeed, preserves them for posterity. Very representative of the entire decade, with all the songs I loved, from the most hokey to the utterly heartbreaking. Plus, the sizeable book that comes in this package is terrific, with smashing color photos and graphics on glossy paper, a world-events timeline keyed to informative paragraphs about the artists and the tracks, and provocative essays about the music and other pop culture of the decade by pre-eminent figures from the '80s media. A very, very good read, this book stands on its own but adds immeasurably to appreciation of the music. My recommendation: just slip a CD in the player, take the book in hand, and travel back in time. This is the life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"totally radical cds!!!!!!!!","review":"hello! i am only 11 yrs old, so i missed the decade of excess :( but i love the songs for some reason. i got this cds from my birthday and i cant stop playing it.firstly this complation has all the great 1 hit wonders that you cant get on a cd nowadays. for all the people complaining that it doesnt have madonna, the jacko etc-----wouldn't you rather hear a song that you cant find anywhere on cd then a madonna which you can get easily?the booklet is great! so much i have learned from it. i suggest to any 80s fan to get this radical complation TODAY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Songs, Bad Packaging","review":"I loved almost every song here. It's hard to find some of these songs like \\"Puttin' on the Ritz\\" by Taco and \\"They Don't Know\\" by Tracy Ullman, so I liked having them in this set. The only problem I found was the way the set was packaged. It is in a book-like case so I can't put it in my media center with my other CDs. I have to lay it flat on top. That means that I often overlook it when deciding what to listen to because it's not right there with my others. This is the most comprehensive 80's collection I have come across, but it should be in a better case for storage reasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"A whole lotta Eighties for the money.","review":"No compilation, even a seven-disc set like this one, can capture all the significant pop music from a decade, but Rhino has come closer than anyone else. There are a few tunes that I wouldn't have included, but they're probably the very ones someone else has been looking for. That's just the way of compilations. But the number of great tunes that are included makes it easy to overlook that minor quibble.Putting together a collection like this from individual recordings would be difficult and expensive, especially considering the number of one-or-two-hit-wonder bands that show up on these discs.Packaging and artwork is first-rate, and there's a surprisingly interesting booklet that provides a little background about each song and artist.Whether you recall the music of the Eighties with nostalgia, or just want a good indroduction and overview of the significant artists and recordings of the decade, you won't be disappointed with this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell?","review":"As a compilation of course there will always be something missing...but no Pet Shop Boys? no Madonna? no DM? No New Order? No Michael Jackson? Maybe their record companies or the artists themselves did not allow their songs to be included here but seven discs and 90 bucks for a compilation missing these giants are almost a shame...As one of the reviewers pointed out, 60% good music and the rest is garbage- and that 60% is not wonderful music (for instances instead of Broken Wings, Kyrie by Mr. Mister etc etc)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of good 80's tunes missing...","review":"I would have wanted a 10 disc set and include all of the great hits.

I really like the 70's version of this set though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good compilation, awful sound","review":"Some of my downloads from Kazaa sound better than the songs on this collection. I doubt that Rhino used the master tapes for this set as most songs have serious imperfections. That's a shame because the songs selection is very good. After listening to three or four songs, my ears start ringing. This collection is probably more suitable for car listening on long trips. For this reason I will never buy another Rhino collection. Period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Songs I Never Want To Hear Again","review":"That's I would have called it. A DJ at a cheesey wedding could plug one of these in a take a long break.It was certainly the most popular music of the times, but not really the best.The bright side is I can finally not buy them all at the same time, and thats convenient."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 80's collection to have!","review":"This is the only set you need :) This well pacakged set of 7 CD's even includes a fairly thick booklet of happenings and events from the 80's.Great for a trip down memory lane.

It is extremely well documented with references from well respected authors, historians, and social justice/human rights advocates. The author ought to come up with a version that could be more readily accessed by high school students and others. He also might wish to update it, include the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which President Obama has recently endorsed, and offer suggestions for socially just actions to advance the situation of Indigenous Peoples as, for example, Native American men on reservations in the US have a longevity rate of roughly 42 years.Human Rights and Social Justice: Social Action and Service for the Helping and Health Professions"},{"rating":"2","title":"overwhelming in its implications","review":"Along with Native American activist Ward Churchill, David Stannard stands at the forefront of the intellectual movement to elucidate the truth concerning America's (and Canada's) past and present treatment of Native Americans.

Seem to be sturdy and will hold up well over time. Nice smooth thick wood handle. My only dislike, would be the leaf rake, I will say is a little flimsy for my taste. The metal that the fingers (I guess is what you call them) are made of are kinda flimsy. But remember it is for a child, not for hard use as an adult would put on a leaf rake.

We took the tools out of the package and he was so excited that he immediately started digging in the garden. 15 minutes later the shovel was bent in half! I was able to bend it back with just my hands, but this shovel won't cut it!Another big disadvantage of these tools is that the handles are so short.

He adores using them with his wheelbarrow.

Nice and big, yet light enough for the youngest. Had 2 sets for over a year now, quite durable, but don't leave outside all the time, two tools have cracks in the wood because of the kids not always putting them in outdoor plastic toy box. I'm going to buy another set and put outdoor stain to repell water on them.No accidents here. My 4 and 6 do great with these supervised from the kitchen window, just a reminder once when they first got it to keep the tool part from being swung and gave them some distance between patches just in case. The one year old isn't that far from me ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great set for for the kid who really wants to help in the yard.","review":"This is a nice, sturdy set of garden tools for a kid who wants to help with yard work. As a \\"toy\\" I have mixed feelings. On the one hand, they aren't cheap plastic, and are very sturdy...at our house they have withstood 2 years of yardwork in the hands of two \\"helpful\\" boys. However, left in the sandbox with unsupervised kids, these tools make great weapons, and can cause plenty of bodily harm.

The rake tines are too narrow and stiff to be used effectively and the shovel head is too flat to actually scoop dirt with - it could use more curvature or some sort of raised edge. I think the hoe will be most useful as it seems well weighted and sized appropriately. The handles on the shovel and rake could be a bit longer too - better to grow into rather than out of so quickly. I suspect I will be replacing the tiny screws used to attach the tool heads; they seem flimsy and most already have too much wiggle in them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughter loves her new garden tools!","review":"We bought the garden tools for our 4 yr old daughter for christmas, and she absolutely loves them!

About one out of five were even edible. Most are brown or black and if you eat one of those it is the nastiest thing you will ever taste. They are also very inconsistent in size from opening a shell and finding nothing, to getting very small hard brown or black un eatable peanuts.

The camera has been so portable, we even did \\"toddler\\" cam and stuck it in our son's overalls during the holidays.The video quality is good for the price. I have recommended this to many family and friends.I just love being able to have a video camera at my finger tips-it really is worth the $$."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to Use & Clean Picture!","review":"I gave this Flip Video Camcorder as a gift to my daughter and her husband. I had a opportunity to try it out, and now I can see why they love it! It's simple to use and the picture is cleaner than most digital cameras with video! Only reason for the 4 star rating is due to the frequency of having to replace the two AA batteries. Even under minimal use, you need lots of new batteries on hand! Other than that, this is an easy-to-use, fun, compact purse/pocket size video camcorder!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A useful gadget that could be better with just a few tweaks","review":"After more that six months of going along on camping trips, being used for various school projects, and capturing snippets of life, our Flip Video Camcorder (the 60-minute version) merits some praise. I never expected this pocket-sized device to be so durable or useful. This is clearly a niche product, designed for producing fairly low quality video suitable for Web postings or dropping into presentation materials. Its portability is another big plus.The USB flip-out connection is a bit clunky and does not always fit elegantly with some computers. Also the very small control buttons were clearly designed by folks with tiny little fingers who wanted to get a laugh out of ham-handed folks like me trying to press the start button repeatedly. And I would I liked a bit larger view screen.All in all, though, a useful gadget that could be better with just a few tweaks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like taking snap shots? Try taking snap videos!","review":"The Flip is a cool device. It's small size (a fat deck of cards) makes shooting snap-videos as easy as taking digital stills. Perfect for a vacation, for getting stealth video clips, and for anyone who wants to make quick, easy, home made films. The built-in USB connector is a great feature, allowing you to drag .avi files to your desktop. The simple design is also welcome...not too many features to tempt you. After all, this is about quick snap-videos, not perfect film. I would recommend the 60 minute version. You'd be surprised how fast 30 minutes goes. And for the price, it's worth it. Speaking of price, these things are an amazing value. Only downside: although the hard plastic construction feels sturdy, the Flips are not the most resilient devices in the world. I've bought a bunch for a work project and two have broken. But what can you expect for a$100 device."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE save your money!","review":"This thing is absolute crap, with even worse support from the manufacturer and Amazon. I returned it, at my expense, to the maker b/c Windows wouldn't recognize it. A month later it comes back to me WITHOUT the accessories I shipped it with. Now it has the same problem again, and Amazon says I'm past the return date--yeah, by one week, and because the camcorder was supposedly being repaired.Don't buy this piece of garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Digital Video camcorder","review":"We bought this product, Flip Digital Video camcorder for our sons, aged 35+, as a christams present. We were worried once we had purchased it as both of them have I pods and other camcorders. We had no need to be worried they were both highly satisfied with the gift, it gives them instant access, via the computer or TV, to the video they have just taken. It is so easy to operate just switch on and point. The quality of the recording is exceptional considering its small size. As we have just said, the beauty of the Flip is its small size, it will fit into a handbag , pocketbook, golf bag, beachbag or whatever you are taking with you. Think how many times you have seen something you would have liked to record in that instant and have not been able to, this solves the problem. Would I reccommend it? in a heartbeat. This is what we call value for money."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SO EASY AS IT SOUNDS","review":"Christmas morning, we used it for about 30 minutes while family opened presents, then spent the next 2 hours trying to save and make sense of what we shot so we could shoot some more. We never got off the computer with anything to save. Can't burn our own DVDs, can't seem to edit and save in I-movie, can't work with saved videos without having the camera hooked up to the computer (which makes it impossible to continue shooting family footage). Tried loading software until we had so many windows opened that we had no idea what we were doing. For something advertised to be so easy (thanks for nothing, Glenn Beck), I should have known it would be a nightmare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Product, Really bad software","review":"Based on the overwhelming positive reviews on this site I purchased the FLIP Video. I got it home and right out of the box the FLIP Video itself worked great. However, once I connected the device to my laptop (fairly new Dell PC running Windows XP) the software would not work with my computer as advertised. I tried everything I could think of for over a half hour and it still would not work. I ended up just taking it back to the store for a refund. In this case it really was too good to be true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it but no Tripod Mount","review":"I'm having so much fun with this FLIP! The down loads to the computer was easy.

First of all the quality of the video it produces is poor (i.e. very grainy). It is also subject to shaking at the slightest move while you are filming. I have a Mac desk top computer and it also does not seem to work with it. Every time I plug it into my Mac, it asks me to download an update, even though I have already done it. So, it was a bad decision, and it will stay in my drawer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Kids","review":"My 8 year old son purchased this camcorder and he loves it. It is easy to use, durable (has been dropped a few times) and is just the right size to tote everywhere. The films look best shot outside, but overall they are good. Sound is ok also. Worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flip Video Rocks","review":"For the price paid this camera is incredible. I film my sons hockey games and my niece has become a little YouTube star singing for the camera.I would suggest the 60 minute version. Editing is a snap and the zoom is easily used.This camera is perfect for capturing kids, events and is small enough to carry in your pocket. The video itself is clear and the built in microphone picks up sound easily.After my family saw the videos produced they have bought this camera as well. So, now we have five of them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun camera","review":"I bought this camera to take on vacation and it was the hit of the trip. It's so light and easy to carry it fits in your pocket. There's no setup or anything to learn, just hit the button and it's ready to shoot. It's inexpensive so I wasn't nervous about handing it to kids to shoot videos. Showing the videos on the computer or tv is done simply by plugging it in and the camera does the rest. It's great fun to be able to capture anything at anytime. The only thing I wish it had is a light for nighttime shooting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best money I ever spent","review":"This camera has been an incredible find! I didn't have a lot of money in my budget but we desperately wanted a camera for the vacations we were about to take. Keep in mind, it is only my wife and I going on the trips. The zoom feature, which is nice when you have kids so you can see their bright faces, isn't that powerful....so you have to be standing close to the action. But otherwise, it is an amazing picture and sound quality. So small it fits in the pocket and can be whipped out in a hurry and ready for action before the action is over! We took it to Costa Rica and I made a great video out of the 50 minutes worth of material we shot. Plus you can make pictures from the frames of video. Not too shabby. I sent one video to my parents using the software and the video didn't loose any quality being sent through email. I can't say enough about the camera. The best part is, it uses 2 double A batteries. I HATE CARRYING CHARGERS! Perfect camera in may opinion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flip Video","review":"The Flip Video is easy to use and saving the video is also easy.

However, it doesn't work well with Macs running Tiger (OS 10.4) and is barely usable with Macs running Leopard (OS 10.5). The company's technical support says (in an email) \\"The Flip Video camera does not support Mac OSX Leopard (OSX 10.5.x), so we cannot guarantee that the Flip Video program will have full functionality.\\" It doesn't even have the ability to easily export videos to a Mac. Great disappointment. Hopefully, future releases will fix this glaring problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!!","review":"This simple camera is big on picture quality and sound.

I was impressed with the quality of both the video and sound. It played back really well on my television, but when I tried to download the videos to computer I got audio but was NEVER able to obtain video. Although I followed the manufacturers directions for downloading the video files, which required downloading the software to my computer, it never worked. The problem was most likely in the camcorder software itself because after attempting to download several times the camera will no longer even come on. Upon contacting customer support they insisted that it was not a problem with the camcorder but was a problem with my batteries. However, I changed batteries 5 times to make sure the batteries were fresh and it still would not work. And I still do not have my videos. I sent the camera back. Although the concept is a good one, I think I'll stick to a higher-end camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flip video camcorder","review":"Overall the Flip was easy to use and very compact.

While video quality is not as good as a full size camcorder, the picture is clearly superior when compared to videos taken with a Treo 700p or using the video option of a Casio Exilm 5.0 EX-Z55. No problem loading videos to MacBook Pro, converting to Quick Time .mov and writing DVD's. Could use a viewfinder as screen is almost impossible to use in bright sunlight. Also, \\"zoom\\" button is so close to \\"record\\" that it's very easy to unintentionally turn off record when all you are trying to do is press zoom for a closer shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"great little portable camera","review":"This camera is easy to use and looks great.

Contrary to another review I read, the software works just fine in my MAC laptop. It'll do everything that it does on our PC. I play back my clips on our 56 inch TV and the quality rivals network programing.

I remember years ago, video taping was a bulky, heavy job, but no longer. The Flip Video makes it a breeze. The USB connection on the Flip Video plugs right into the computer to download videos and the cable connects the Flip Video to your TV to watch home videos in full screen color.

When my daughter opened the present, she didn't quite understand what it was. After opening the Flip box she was video taping everything in the house within minutes. The best thing was, she did not need me to help her set it up in any way, she opened the box and started taking videos of the entire family. She took it to her friend's house and videoed their new puppy and later emailed it to her.

My grandchildren love to make their own videos - something I wouldn't allow with a more expensive camera.I have captured many snapshots from the videos I have taken. Too many digital photos have been snapped just before or just after the perfect smile or expression. A favorite is one of my son, his wife and their new baby, just minutes after our grandson was born.The convenience of having built-in software is priceless.The only con I have is not being able to edit out scenes from the middle of a video.

They wanted us to give them a credit card # before they sent the 4th. Do we want to try it again??? Not sure. After all this I do wish it worked but my faith is pretty weak. My advise. If you have a Mac don't get it unless you have a lot of time to kill and strong nerves."},{"rating":"2","title":"good buy","review":"I have an animal rescue and I have been looking for an inexpensive video camera that would take great videos and this is the one.

It's because the quality is good and even a fifty-year-old can figure it out. It's that easy. I wish all new products were this simple.

So to make a coherent movie, you have to move the first one to the last order, the second video to the second-to-the-last order, and so on. It used to download in the correct order, but since this last \\"upgrade\\", mixes up the videos so they are unusable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"Got mine and the display wouldn't show any picture.

I am still unable to edit on the supposed movie maker it comes with because it didn't automatically install and when I try to manually do so following the directions given in the troubleshooting section, nothing.

What's great is it comes with cords to plug right into your tv so there's no need for tapes, etc to watch on tv. The other nice thing is when you plug it into the tv you don't have to change the channel to a certain station or anything it just starts. I have a dvd burner hooked to my tv and I'm sure I'll be able to burn straight from the tv to the burner for home movies.

Stern, unseductive, at times verging on the boring - but also, in the long run, eliciting a genuine fascination.

The limitations are obvious in that the unit only supports two CPUs and needs a PS/2 keyboard and mouse.You can however connect this unit to a USB computer through a PS/2 to USB adapter. I used this to connect my laptop over USB. I initially purchased a PS/2 to USB adapter that did not work. I was able to find one model that did work.

My favorite parts deal with the Indians, alcohol, temperance, the costs of things at that time, and how dogs become a necessity of a gold miner's life for home security and frienship.I'm not related to the publisher, so I'm not going to profit from my raving review, though I wish I could.

The story itself is above average for Buk and far superior to There's No Business, which is offered by Black Sparrow Press in this same format. The R. Crumb art is very compatible with the tale. It's the story of a man visiting his wife in a mental institution and the conversations that follow. Typical Bukowski subject matter...madhouses, women, sex, booze & not much hope at all. If your shelves are already filled with the real Buk books, I would definitely recommend adding this to your collection. Keep in mind, we are talking about a fifteen page book here!

You listen to any Minor Threat song and you know immediately that they are dangerous and anti-establishment.Anyway, this album sounds like nofx with a couple of cookie-cutter metal guitar licks. I can't give it much more thought than that because it is pretty obvious that the people making this music didn't give it much more thought than that. It's as if the singer or guitarist or whomever called a band meeting and said, \\"Hey guys, let's play Nofx with some metal guitar licks!\\" and they were all like \\"Oh yeah, man.

Hewitt's broadly academic fear-mongering and religio-political fundamentalism offers some of the most potent conservative propaganda available in print. At best, Hewitt provides a compelling case for do-or-die electioneering, and strong points on how liberalism has failed to keep pace with society's intellectual energy -- if you can get past acres of gratutious name-calling and unilateral hypotheses. At worst, Hewitt fails to offer more than a rote conservative message on how affecting the transfer of wealth to the most powerful in society, in the name of personal security, and holding a lopsided view of values and morality (e.g., greed and violence are good, sex and aiding society's most vulnerable are bad), will benefit all."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring read","review":"Not much new here.

After 9/11 we knew who our enemies were, Al Quaida, and so did the rest of the world. But instead of going after Bin Laden with everything we had the Republicans went after a dictator who was NO THREAT to the U.S. In invading IRAQ, the Republicans created a thousand more Bin Ladens and fulfilled every Islamic fundamentalist prophecy of what the \\"Great Satan\\" of America is trying to do in the world.

The premise of the book seems to be that the country would be better off if the country were ruled by one party, namely the Republicans. This has NEVER worked for any other country, as it inevitably leads to corruption and totalitarianism. Do I need to site some examples?-- Any communist country; pick one.-- Any 3rd world country overthrown by a coup; again, pick one.-- Facist parties taking over Germany, Spain and Italy during the 1930's.-- Mexico. Even though its not exactly a one party government, its close enough. The Revolutionary party has dominated for most of the 20th century and because of this, the current president can't get anything done. The latest problem is that Mexico has a huge off shore oil field, which could mean lots of money for their economy.

The notion that our combativeness has increased the dangers to our nation is not acceptable.Unfortunately, it's just more of the same old paranoid ranting by a grumpy old man who wishes for the return of Mayberry.Oh dear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant *for what it tries to do*","review":"This is not a political manual. This is a polemic -- brilliantly written, fun to read, unabashedly partisan (Hewitt calls himself a principled pragmatic partisan).If you've never closely followed a presidential campaign, much of this will be new and eye-opening: Hewitt gets into some detail how campaigns are actually run and the sometimes very slim connection between the real world of politics and policy and the Bizarro world of campaigning.If you're a political junkie (as I), you won't find any startling revelations. But you will find fast and usable answers to questions like, why are Democrats so unserious about the war on militant Islamism? Can the country survive a Democratic administration? And how can pragmatic partisans deal with fanatics, movement purists, and leaners on both sides of the aisle?It's food for the political soul and definitely worth the price of a steak dinner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pragmatic advice from a smart man","review":"I like Hugh Hewitt mainly because he presents his argument with facts. While he is passionate about his beliefs, he has carefully crafted a book that gives Republicans solid advice on how to win not only the Presidential election, but seats in the Senate and the House. I agree with his first and foremost premise...that if a Democrat (JFK) is elected to the White House, we have a much greater chance of seeing more active terrorism in this country and abroad. He also directs us to carefully consider the history of cheating in the Democratic party. Something I hadn't really considered, but Hugh aptly documents the evidence and makes the case for making sure that Democrats can't get away with it again.This isn't blatant propaganda for the Republican Party and GWB. It is a fact-filled, intelligent guidebook for those who wish to stay safe in this country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"Hugh's book is a disappointment. It seems like a rush job thrown together to peddle during the election. Not much scholarship was done either. For example, he asserts that when Gore tried to block overseas military ballots from being counted, not a single democrat raised their voice in opposition; he must not have done a lexis/nexis search because Gore supporter Zell Miller was very vocal in opposing the effort to block military votes. Further, very little was done to cite specific situations of democrat party vote (...). The way Hugh segments the parties into pyramids and his description of the interplay between segments was useful -- but did not merit a hardcover book purchase. Various Bush speeches re: 9/11 have been attached at the back for reference (perhaps to boost the page count?). I like Hugh and I love his radio show, but Hugh has a fairly cerebral audience, and this book was more appropriate for Sean Hannity groupies."},{"rating":"1","title":"A gimmick designed to help Bush get re-elected","review":"Like the hateful \\"Unfit\\" book(a book of lies about John Kerry),this book is filled with nothing but lies,rumours,bigotry,hatred and false facts.The message i got from this book was\\"Buy this book and crush the Democrats,or we're going to kill you.\\"This was the horrifying message I got from reading this book.Don't buy this hateful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great title for Florida this time","review":"Yes, if only Kerry can win Florida by an unstealable margin, then the Republicans won't be able to do what they did in 2000.Hewitt is a biased moron.

I already knew about Gwangi, and watched it first. I loved it. But I was unsure about One million years BC. It looked and sounded like a rip off of Quest for fire (another good caveman film) and I doubted there'd be much claymation, because if it was anything like Quest for fire, it would be serious and realistic, without any corny FX.So I popped it in the DVD player, and began watching. And my eyes were instantly glued to the screen. There were TONS of claymation scenes (all wonderful) and even a giant Iguana! And Raquel Welch was also a fine cave woman (although she didn't resemble any of the gruff dirty cave men) but it was pleasing non-the-less.Definitly recomended if you're craving a prehistoric adventure full of awesome FX and lovely Raquel Welch."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Million Years B.C.","review":"Watch this when I was younger and loved it, though not true representation of the era it is a very thought provoking movie, with some of the wondrous stop motion animations.

The dialogue is nothing but a bunch of weird sounds and grunts; why couldn't the film's producers provide subtitles?

Then, just this August, they released two more of Harryhausen's on DVD, THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS and THE VALLEY OF GWANGI (plus the Willis O'Brien flick THE BLACK SCORPION). That meant just two more films needed to be released on DVD in order for my collection to be complete. And this was one of 'em. I kept thinking, \\"WHERE IS IT?!\\"But now, and only three days after my birthday, ONE MILLION YEARS B.C. is finally coming to the format, and I couldn't be happier.

And she still looks great. The movie is very accurate since it shows dinosaurs and humans coexisting. However, I'm sure that people didn't live in caves. Apparently the directors must have modeled the primative culture on the Northwest. Furthermore, dinosaurs did not die out millions of years ago. They were with us very recently and may still be with us today.

Nixon hated the Kennedys and would never have been president if JFK had not been assassinated. He was not all bad. He stood up to Khrushchev. He opened up China and ended the Vietnam War even if it took four years. He was loyal to a fault. He denied any knowledge of the burglary at Democratic Headquarters inside the Watergate Hotel in Washington, D.C. It brought him down. Nixon and Watergate became synonymous.

The current \\"reality TV\\" boom in recent years is on a par with the radicals that Faye Dunaway's character wanted to showcase to the country.And the way the network searches for something more outlandish than Howard Beal when his ratings begin to slide was prophetic: Today, the networks compete with each other on a daily basis to outdo the other in outlandishness and who can go completely over the top.A must have for your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"This is one of my top 5 movies of all time.

His comics are short little distillations of rational outrage, done so cleverly and with such clarity that you will love him for it.In addition to this collection, you can sustain yourself on his recent catalogue of strips, which can be found on Workingforchange."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Compilation","review":"The first thing to understand is that this is a \\"greatest hits\\" compilation book - and a dang good one, at that. Having boarded the Tom Tomorrow train (alliteration!) only within the past four years, I missed out on years of his brilliant wit and biting satire. The Great Big Book of Tomorrow is a looking glass into our political past, never pulling punches when politicians or situations required a swift kick in the rear.The new contents are spectacular, including several collages and early works of the author, allowing the reader a unique opportunity to observe the progression of the artist's insight into the political world. Furthermore, the selections of older comics are splendid - inclusive of most I, myself, would have chosen to collect for such a book.In all, The Great Big Book of Tomorrow is worth every penny. Those who think otherwise are wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"well done!","review":"Political cartoons are a personal fav, and nothing beats Tom Tomorrow! I have religiously read and saved my best for years. Now I finally have the best in one great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough new material here to warrant a book","review":"I am a great fan of Tom Tomorrow's and read the new weekly cartoons religiously. But much of the material here (I'd say about 70 percent) is simply reprinted from his previous compilations. Yes, there are some new pieces, and yes, there is a neat colour section in the middle, but when I shell out good money for a book I don't want to leaf through page after page after page of cartoons that I already have."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Great Big Bag of Nothing","review":"Further proof that the radical Left's quest for a sense of humor remains unfulfilled. Tomorrow's work is insulting to anyone's intelligence and, worst of all, not the least bit funny. The political commentary lacks bite, and the humor is puerile at best. His work invites comparisons to Mark Alan Stamaty's Washingtoon, of which Tomorrow is a third-rate imitator."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, twisted and intelligent satire, complete with a penguin","review":"As someone who has been dying for a while to get addicted to a new comic, This Modern World has recently made me very content.Yes, the opinion skews heavily to the left, but the viewpoint is always educated and true of heart. Even if you tend to be more \\"right-minded\\" in your beliefs, there is still an interesting perspective to be heard here. And the humor is dead-on.Plus, maybe it's Sparky the Penguin, but reading this book brought back memories of reading large \\"Bloom County\\" collections in my youth. And I laughed out loud just about as often.If you like comics, politics or social studies, this is a must have.

Let's list a couple of things that don't belong together shall we? 1) base that is poorly fitted to its lid and 2) a paper thin metal lid. It sticks, then you slice yourself. It has a really bad design. I cut myself (really it did) at the base of my thumb, which is a really fun place to get cut.I was not drinking at the time of this incident. This was my first attempt at using it.The worst thing about this is that alcohol inhibits blood clotting. so to make the bad situation worse, you are faced with a decision. Be smart and don't drink and let the body heal itself or do you drink anyway and go through about 20 bandaids more than are necessary. What do you do?Don't buy this.

I have not been able to separate them. I've tried twisting and pulling with no success. And the people who have mentioned that the lid is sharp are not kidding. Trying to remove the jigger piece has left both hands bleeding, quite literally. I wish I had read their reviews before I purchased this--and before I cut my hands.

As some have already mentioned it leaks on any drink that requires significant shaking...and if you can't shake the darn thing then it doesn't even fulfill its most basic function and is completely useless. In addition to leaking between the strainer and shot-glass the seal between the strainer and shaker sticks and is kind of a pain to separate without spilling your drink...or cutting yourself as another reviewer did; and I can certainly see how it might happen because I had the fear that I was going to cut myself when I used it.

Exactly what I expected. Large enough to make two drinks at a time with enough ice to chill. Seals well and has a well designed pour spout. Exactly what you would expect from a cocktail shaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fix Your Own Problems","review":"This shaker works great as long as you typically mix drinks into either giant glasses (1 gal. +) or you have a really big funnel lying around that you could pour through. If you like to use normal size bar glasses, then you are probably going to make a mess when you spill everywhere. Also, I'd recommend a pair of leather gloves to avoid slicing your hand open when using the shaker. I don't like to wear gloves, so I just drilled a hole in the side and pour ingredients through that. Then, when I am ready to mix I just hold my thumb over the hole. That's a pretty good alternative.The best alternative would be buying a different shaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Always drips between lid and body...","review":"This shaker has a fatal flaw. The fit between the main lid and the body is just loose enough that I find it impossible to pour anything through the strainer in the lid without a large amount of liquid spilling from the bad joint. Doesn't particularly leak when shaking. Maybe OK with extra-wide Martini glasses, or if you plan to drink directly from the shaker, but otherwise a calamity. Find a better-made product if you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old - 2 pieces missing!","review":"First of all, the product said it was new, and it wasn't.

It seems that cold causes the material to contract just enough to create an over tight seal. It's almost impossible to get it off.That's not the only problem. Mine arrived with a liberal quantity of polishing compound still on the surface of the metal. This is a nasty chemical that is used to shine up the surface finish. It's definitely not something that anyone wants to dissolve in their martini.Finally, as advertised, the shaker is made out of stainless steel. So how come mine is rusting?Definitely an item to avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does the Job...","review":"While it does the job of shaking drinks, has started rusting after the first use...

It mixes drinks well, and keeps the liquid nice and cold (not to mention your hands while shaking it however!), and seemed to have an attractive and simple design.I can also state it's never leaked or rusted as others have mentioned.What HAS happened, is that the cap is *really* hard to get off.

She is able to find peace and happiness as well as love from total strangers in a little town in Illinois, miles away from her home.She builds her life there, but she finally succumbs to disease.The story in this book may be one that we have heard one too many times, but the way the author writes it and describes the characters and their feelings makes it all worthwhile. She writes with tenderness and makes you feel like you are living Russo's life while she tells of it during her last days. You become familiar with Cookie and Shirley and Sandy and Magda and Yoc and also her son, Trooper. At the end, I felt Troopers tears and I mingled them with my own.I recommend this book to all who love and care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD-single I have","review":"Three wonderful musicpieces, which you can't destroy by playing it even if you did that continuously for the rest of your life.

And fold your hands and pray, that they make a new recording very, very soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is good....","review":"I saw this band, Benzos, open up for Blonde Redhead in New York. They were very impressive. Musically they were advanced compared to the sort of bands that had come out of New York recently. Like bands such as Secret Machines and Inouk, there is a new movement in music that is more progressive. Not so much \\"prog rock\\" as bringing musicianship back into music. Benzos are making complex and unique statements with All The King's Men\\" and \\"You're Forever An Hourglass.\\" Their music is dreamy and thoughtful. \\"It's Amiable\\" almost sounds like Radiohead. The production on this record is very good. The producer has captured the live sound of the band. Every song is a winner. This music needs to be listened to. It is more subtle than many fashionable bands. We will be looking back at this record at year's end and remembering the great experience. This music has some substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review","review":"This book is too dense for what it is. She definitely lives up to her last name.

Better yet, don't use 700 words when 5 will do."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Deep Look at the Craft of Reading and Writing","review":"Francine Prose is a lover of books who found an eternal literature classroom by reading the masters of prose. She is also a terrific writer who uses engaging anecdotes and examples to cover such topics as character, dialogue, and narration, as well as the more technical matters of paragraph development, sentence structure, and word choice. She spins one interesting yarn after another through references to great literary passages. In the process, the author proves that command of language and inventiveness of human elements surpass plot in captivating readers. The subtitle of the book rings true: either the bibliophile or the neophyte author will benefit from reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a treat!","review":"The aptly named Francine Prose's Reading Like a Writer is a total treat. I usually find my attention wandering when I read non-fiction, and although I have a bookshelf or two of writing books, many of them aren't read the whole way through.This book, though, is a chosen book at bedtime, a chosen book on a quiet Sunday afternoon. Prose reinvigorates me, makes me curious about the writers she quotes and dissects. As a product of the American educational system, I learned early on to hate dissection of books - I still can't read The Great Gatsby without wincing. But here, the analysis is fascinating, non-banal, stimulating. It makes me want to both read the books she mentions and re-read my favorites and diagram them.This book will make me a better writer and has filled a gap in my education so I can also be a better reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valuable Advice","review":"I loved this book. Francine Prose puts into words what we have probably all known for a long time. The more you read and the more that you think about what you read, the better your writing will become.

Also an excellent aid to intelligent readership."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly boring.","review":"I was made to read this as part of an AP English Literature and Composition course, and I loathed every minute of reading this book. This is no \\"guide.\\" It is a pointless collection of stories on various writing topics that are never truly tied together to be useful. The stories have basically no impact on the topic at hand. Not to mention that the stories are absolutely uninteresting. Avoid this book unless you are required to read it for a class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing Like A Pretentious Bore","review":"Sorry, but I really hated this pretentious, boring, and useless exercise in academic masturbation. It's all just an excuse for the writer to drone on and on about her favorite books. A lackluster lesson in literary snobbery, this lifeless thesis paper includes iffy interpretations of dry excerpts, unhelpful writing hints, and zero sense of humor or drama. If you don't love the same books, stories, and writers that Francine Prose loves, you're pretty much screwed. As a published writer myself, I often check out writing books for inspiration. This is one of the worst. I prefer something lighter, more engaging and motivational to light a fire under me. I like Ray Bradbury's book, with its infectious boyish enthusiasm, and the terrific book about publishing, \\"The Forrest for the Trees\\" (the first half is inspiring, but the second half a little depressing.) Either way, skip this yawn-fest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept. Poor execution","review":"The concept is great. The product did not meet the promise.

The author appears to prefer long involved sentences and paragraphs. She promotes flowery description a la Jane Austen although such description, to a modern reader, is extraneous filler.

As an aspiring writer myself, it really was eye-opening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your own private coffee date with an intelligent writer friend.","review":"So many manuals posited as books make one wish, upon completion, that one had spent the time writing instead. This, instead, is a book to buy, read slowly, savor, think about, annotate, and buy for your favorite reader/writer friends so you can talk about it with them. Reading Prose is like having a long, thoughtful conversation with an inspiring, creative, and accomplished friend (and not the accomplished friend you kind of hate or envy, but the one you deeply appreciate). The works she studies are a joy to revisit through her eyes if you know them already and a delight to discover if you don't.

I thought this would be really cool for my six-year-old nephew, but we were dreadfully disappointed. I don't know what these other reviewers thought was so grand.

Amazon gives no refunds on these types of items so as another reviewer mentioned, you're rolling the dice.

While sometimes the output files are readable and somewhat usable, they usually aren't, thereby wasting much of your time.

However, I had already edited my video using Vegas Video (a 5 star video editing package), so Video 8 did not offer any value to me for video editing. What had caught my attention were the motion buttons and menu backgrounds. Those work but the customer support could not tell me how to create menus that skipped other menus or assign specific chapters to menu buttons. Above all, on WinXP, Video 8 crashed and sent error reports about 15 times in a two-week period. This forced me to research further and I found Ulead DVD Workshop (ASIN=B00006412S) to be superior.

Thank goodness I never paid for it because it's the worst program I have ever used in my WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE!! I cannot comprehend why a company would put a product out that doesn't work. It goes against every moral principle I know. I could not compile anything for burning. Spent hours editing DV movies only to have program stall during compilation and burning. I did however get it to burn an 8 minute segment of a VCD. But it did so because I just simply spliced a few segments together and then ripped it. It took me hours to figure this out. Basically, if you add the effects, such as fading and animation, the program will not compile properly. Isn't that the whole point of the software, to be able to burn cd's and DVD's of home movies?

The main recommendation, as you have probably heard before, is to make sure that you have adequate hard drive space (my 17 minute edited video took up 20 GB of hard drive space), so that you can capture your video in DV mode. If you do not have enough hard drive space available, you will have to capture video in another mode, and then, during the rendering process, have to reconnect your camcorder to the computer--the burning process takes hours.

Took me 2 days to create a 10 minute VCD, but at least it worked...that time.Now, I'm trying to create a 5 minute movie of wrestling highlights, and the software acts as if I'm trying to create a 5 hour movie. I've been working with it for 4 days now, and still no go. And now, my other programs have started crashing.What a lovely (ha!!) piece of software! Your money would be well spent on almost ANYTHING else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this program","review":"They should sell a program with less features and is more reliable than having the public work out their bugs for them.

The short review: It Doesn't Work... This is the worse kind of software. Very pretty and stylish interface, loads of features....none of it works. I know my way around a computer. I built my present system with video editing as the main goal. The DVD software that came with my DVD burner has few features...is childishly simplistic...and works. Studio 8 is junk and a waste of time and money. You will grow old fast trying to use this software.

While I like the ease of use of the product, I wanted one key feature which does not seem to be supported--ability to use MP3 files from my music library. I have been conversing with tech support at Pinnacle, and it appears that Pinnacle's claim that it can import MP3's is innacurate. I have been unable to import MP3 files created from either Real Networks RealOne player, or from the plug-in link provided by Windows Media Player (XP). Apparently, they record MP3's with 'non-standard' tags. The techs (2 seperate ones) would not provide me with the name of any programs which could record MP3's that Studio 8 would recognize."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD authoring is NOT RELIABLE","review":"Do not think that you can reliably produce video DVD's with this software!!

Yet Pinnacle has no problem continuing to sell its Studio 8 line.

Menus are darn near impossible to get to work correctly. Rendering is not only slow, but 9 times out of 10 stops in random spots. 75% of the time on a project longer than 10 minutes the DVD burn will fail and you've wasted a disc and the 10 hours it took to compile it all.

I use the program for editing my captures, creating DVD menus, and convert to MPEG. The actual capture and burn to DVD are done with other programs I have. Editing is the worst. S8 loses track of where it is. Scenes are marked on the timeline by still-scene clips. Often, the still-scene off by a few frames, sometimes it's off my minutes. This makes it almost impossible to know where you are in the edited movie. Before you buy, check out the many problems on Pinnacle's user forums.

When I bought this, it seemed like a good idea, until the program wouldn't run for more than three minutes without closing without warning. Thats right...the program just instantly closes at random. I mean, they call it a 'professional moviemaking system'; I'd expect a bit more. And it's not just my computer, thats for sure.

First of all, it doesn't have the white in/ white out transition, which I thought was standard. Second, putting in music and getting it to play with your clips almost never works. I tried making a simple 12 second movie, but after several long hours of frustration, I just gave up. You have to convert video files it doesn't accept with Video Wave (which comes with it, I think), and that takes a very long time. Also, when you actually make your project into a video file, it takes an eternity! And it left almost FOUR MINUTES of soundless blackness on the file before it actually had the movie I made. The only thing left for me to try is getting an Apple computer so I can use Imovie. And if that doesn't work... I seriously think I'll go insane.

That's a huge drag and sort of defeats the purpose of owning this machine as far as I'm concerned. Also, the \\"overflow\\" reservoir is where 25% of the coins end up whether the tubes are full or not.

The nickles only do 38 out of 40 and dimes were off as well. Only the quarters were accurate right each time we tested it. Yes you could probably add a coin or two each time but that defeats the purpose since you are still guessing if the right number is in the package.

What I've always loved about this series is how simplistically genius it is. They seem like a bunch of crazy, drunken idiots, but they actually plan and put a lot of work into each and every stunt. What I like about 3.5 is that for the first time, they really show you what's going on behind the scenes. They show you what it's like to be on the set and what goes into the things they do, with in depth interviews, and behind the scenes footage. They also start to go into a different direction, going from the usual stunts and gross outs to pranks and practical jokes, which are utterly hilarious. This is billed as the direct-to-video extra scenes movie, but it's actually a lot more and I really enjoyed this one a lot more than Jackass 3D."},{"rating":"2","title":"Former Student Proud of Teacher","review":"I was one of Edcardo's directing students.

I couldn't have had a better directing teacher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below Average Early 80's Hardcore","review":"You're probably looking here as a result of listening to Slayer's album, \\"Undisputed Attitude\\" (1996). Slayer covers most of this album and does it in such crushingly brutal style, that the songs bear very little resemblance to what you'll hear here (assuming you don't heed my warning and waste your money buying this). The studio tracks sound flat and whiney, while the live ones are a little punchier, but easily annoy with instruments and vocals randomly cutting in and out.Verbal Abuse was somewhat popular in the early 80's hardcore punk scene, but they were less than mediocre as compared with their peers of the time. They play in the \\"Nard-Core\\" style, sounding similar to most bands released by Mystic Records (Ill Repute, Batallion of Saints, Dr. Know, etc.). Originally released in 1983, the production by today's standards is poor. To make things worse, it sounds like Beer City simply burned this straight off the vinyl."},{"rating":"2","title":"A BLACK CANON IN LITERATURE...AT LAST!!","review":"Similar to Bennett's BEFORE THE MAYFLOWER, Clifford Mason's work dives into the rich history of African-Americans in such an intelligent, engaging way, that you almost forget that each and every chapter really happened to black people. It's perfect for those who are interested in learning about both the well-known and the not-so-famous champions of black civil rights. I personally loved reading so much about Ida B. Wells, one of the earliest known champions of black civil rights. With Mason's in-depth coverage of black history and his mastery of prose, this book will definitely become a great work in its own right.

Then the second half is the story of Robin Good, who gets betrayed by his band of not-so-merry men, but like the boy who lost his birthday, learns that God is still with him.The funniest part is a song between Robin Good (Larry) and the Prince of Ham.

Whether it succeeds or not is probably arguable, and a not very interesting question. I also hear some of Hollywood's leading men are a tad short. But assuming it's central thesis is true - that the Professors of America are unapologetically liberal - and that the analogous claim that the media is predominantly leftist is equally valid, what's the point? Our ivory-towered theoreticians and intellectuals (purportedly shuttered from the caustic truths we call reality) and the reporter on the street (supposedly overwhelmed by confronting same) agree on politics.

Did you ever wonder what it was like for Anne Coulter to sit through history 101? This narrow minded rant on open-minded education gives readers a pretty good idea.Life on many college campuses is a time for experimentation, exploration, investigation and growth. If Ben Shapiro had his way, it would be merely a time when corporations and right-winged fundamentalist morons filled our heads with judgemental and short sighted theories.College is for the living and the breathing and the energized. Ben Shapiro should have taken fewer notes on what was being said and instead listened to the message. Then he could have absorbed and investigated it for himself. One thing is for sure, he would have changed his mind about how the world 'could' be instead of panicked about figuring out a way to drag it back down to what his parents taught him it should be.Instead - read anything by Molly Ivans - she'll tell about the real agenda in our country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the Paper its Printed on","review":"A horrible joke of a book. Reminds me of the spineless conservatives I know that mask their hatred for freedom of love, sex, religion, and diversity with phony intellectual dogmas, and overt racist propaganda. This book is selling like it is because people want to be reinforced that Universities brain wash their youth. But Ben provides no quantitative data to back up his bogus claims. One day Ben will wake up like David Brock did, and realize he's been used by the radical right to push their backwards agenda. Ben will be rich, but lonely. And nobody will recall this silly little text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Youth of America","review":"When I was at university in the 1990s campuses were swarming with Reagan Youth. By the time a person is college age they are adults and not children. Other people their age are fighting and dying for the country. They should be able to fend for themselves intellectually if they were able to get grades and SAT scores sufficient to gain entry into college, especially an upper teir university. It is easy to tell this book was written by a college student simply because it is so sophomoric."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vanity Publishing","review":"An entertaining read, but not an intelligent one. For several years, Shapiro's student editorials were worth every read. His opinions are strong, facts be damned. In fact, he screwed up his facts so often that several of us in my office began keeping tally of how often he was refuted, and how often his response would be a print version of \\"Nuh-UH!\\"This book is no exception to the Shapiro style. It's riddled with errors, misquotes and misinformation. But it will probably get him booked on Fox News and result in some pocket money -- and that's clearly his real goal in all this. The more outrageous he can be, the more earning potential -- facts be damned!The only subject Shapiro is an expert in is crying out for attention. The only real question is who gave this guy the cash to publish his book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Conservative Propaganda","review":"Being a student of the same university that the young Shapiro attends, I can sadly say that he misrepresents our institution. I have NEVER had a professor even mention their political ideology in or outside of a classroom.There are so many incorrect quotes in this book that The Lord of the Rings comes across as more realistic than this sad attempt at intellectualism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, terrible, terrible","review":"This book must have been written by a paranoid schizophrenic.

I felt like I was reading Mein Kampf."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Emperor's New Clothes","review":"As one who has spent far too long in college (4 degrees of my own and 7 years and counting now as a professor), I know that Ben Shapiro is right. The problem is not that most faculty are political, economic, and religious liberals, it has been that way for a long time. But what has changed in the last 20 years is the moral relativism and lack of belief in objective truth. The goal is no longer truth but the promotion of an agenda. Sadly, Shapiro is right, indoctrination is the accurate description for what is done in most universities, particularly in the humanities, education, and journalism. As for the reviewer who panned the book, but says he/she did not read it. I sugget that you do read it. Reality is tough, but it would be good for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical right-wing Cliche Attack Dog iffle","review":"Too many of these supposed 'conservative' students enter college ONLY expecting to find all of their preconceived biases and prejudices confirmed--those that they learn at home, from their peers, and their ministers, etc. When this does not happen and they are actually exposed to new ideas, they rebel, whinge, and complain--they adamantly refuse to admit that not everyone thinks like they do and has all of their prejudices. They look for validation in screeds like this--it is only for undiscriminating, tiny minds. Don't bother and enourage this !JUst look at the publisher--radical 'conservative' group who desperately hope that no one shall ever understand what a true 'classical' conservative was and should be!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another waste of higher education","review":"Judging from this book and from the collection of columns posted at townhall.com before he got a book contract, Ben Shapiro's brain was pre-washed and pre-shrunk before he ever set foot on a college campus. Rather than taking up a coveted seat at the University of California at Los Angeles (funded by those tax dollars he feels Golden Staters should keep for themselves), Ben should have enrolled at Liberty or Patrick Henry or Wheaton or Bob Jones or another right-wing one-idea schoolhouse in which the free dissemination of myriad ideas is not encouraged.Shapiro is too young, too naive, and too biased to serve up anything other than this precooked, sweeping indictment of American universities.Come back when you grow up, Ben. You might have something worth reading then. But hey, I'm an incurable optimist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Our universities are failing. . .","review":"to reach people like Mr. Shapiro.

In fact, I would rather that the good guys use the Air Force to kill the bad guys, even if that means some civilians get killed along the way. One American soldier is worth far more than an Afghan civilian.\\" (...)No wonder smart, educated professors offend Mr. Shaprio. Too bad the university failed to teach him critical thinking.

He is a youngster who believes he is right over the thousands upon thousands of Ph.D doctors in the fields ranging from economics to the environment. He does not nearly go into detail on anything, just the superficial facts that appeal to the shallow minded. Of course it is hard to argue that his position on sex and affirmative action is wrong because that is not so defined. But his position on geo-politics, economics, environmental science etc is pure rubbish. Additionally, he is a die-hard supporter of Israel and surprise surprise is jewish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As a college student myself, I was hoping for a revealing study of the academic scene. However, the book is mainly Ben Shapiro's conservative opinion versus liberal professors, and his arguments don't go very deep either - he'll cite a source that shows a liberal bias on campuses, and his response is 'This is manure/bogus/a load of bunk' before moving on to his next point. The tone of the book is also condescending; the continuous references to 'the impressionable young minds' and 'the definitive impact on America's youth' would make you think Shapiro is the only college student in the country who is able to think for himself, and the rest of us are mindlessly accepting everything we hear or read. This becomes insulting after a while. As another reviewer stated, the book's thesis has good potential, but it is executed poorly. This text will teach you nothing new, but rather leave conservatives nodding knowingly and liberals shaking their heads thinking 'Nuh uh!'"},{"rating":"1","title":"sound premise, poorly researched, awful execution...","review":"I was given this book as a gift, and as a fence sitter (a liberal-minded conservative), I looked forward to an objective factual treatment of the central theme of this book. Unfortunately, this it is not. While reading this book, I could imagine sitting at a University pub drinking crappy beer with Shapiro, while he ranted his anecdotes and ideas (Shapiro's writing style is colloquial and overly simplistic). Most of his assertions are based on a single personal experience from his own University experience, backed up by quotes taken out of context from one or two other University professors....how about some research, statistics and facts??!?!? Perhaps Shapiro was simply too young when he wrote this book - a few decades of experience and stronger research would have resulted in a much stronger book. While I still have a strong sense that Shapiro's message is valid, the execution is so weak that it harms (rather than helps) the conservative cause."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shapiro gets","review":"This is the by far the best book available that details the abuses by leftist faculty and administrators at Colleges and Universities. Shapiro really has done his homework, telling many (often humorous) stories about how numerous institutions of higher education have become nothing more than overpriced training schools for a new generation of liberal activists. How these professors have abandoned the University's mission to educate students in order to promote their personal political agendas is disturbing. I strongly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"If Only College Professors Could Write This Well","review":"If this book were merely well written, it would have been enough. If it had only meticulous footnotes and sourcing as it does, it would shine from out of the pile of empty headed rants that pass as serious research. If the writer (barely 20 years old? incredible!)had managed only to present the remarkably tight logic and penetrating arguments that he does, it would have been a great read.Amazingly, young MISTER Shapiro manages all of the above with ease and grace. Even if you believe you could never ever agree with the main thesis of the book, you must read it. It makes you think, and you would be hard pressed to refute the notion that college campuses are hot beds of a one sided (liberal) ideology. Critic or one of the faithful, you owe it to yourself to read this outstanding work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Solid Thesis, Lackluster Development","review":"As a recent graduate from an Ivy League school, I can verify that liberal indoctrination is alive and well on our college campuses. Knowing this, I purchased a copy of Ben Shapiro's book, hoping to find some a thoughtful presentation of the truths I'd found in my own experience, namely how conservative college students are discriminated against or made to feel uncomfortable, as well as how conservative professors can't get hired or get tenured. Instead, what was presented was a tired Rush Limbaugh-like diatribe on \\"The rediculous things that liberal professors believe\\". I walked away saying to myself, \\"of course they think those things, they're liberals!\\" Essentially, while the book is often witty and potent, it fails to drive home its central thesis or reach towards any deeper, underlying issues. For a much better (though slightly outdated) effort towards this end, pick up a copy of Dinesh D'Souza's wonderfully poignant \\"Illiberal Education\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Braindrained","review":"Leave it to a 20-year old graduating know-it-all to continue the conservative wanker-parade of whiners and crybabies mewling endlessly for their self esteem. Instead of earning the right to be right they would rather scratch and claw at their intellectual masters, and scheme oh so transparently for the shorter, easier path to wisdom.Could it just be possible that our universities contain a higher percentage of liberal and progressive educators because the righteous right would rather be out in the corporate world screwing the competition, and the public; grabbing just one more bag-o-cash to prove once and for all that God and virtue are truly on their side?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No substance at all","review":"This book has no substance at all and seems very poorly researched. Many of the arguments the author makes clearly have no empirical basis at all. The fact that this was published mostly seems to be related to its polemic character and the political conflicts within which it situates itself. Reactionary propaganda and not worth reading at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"WEAKMINDED BEWARE OF UNIVERSITIES","review":"Apparently the meany nasty liberals are going to brainwash you.

Shapiro, a former UCLA undergrad, and the publisher both cash in--chapeau. He now goes to Harvard Law, and they have a bestseller.Shapiro paints the devil on the wall (i.e. environmentalists, atheists, feminists, ... ); thus it will sell well with those to whom it was catered, i.e. those that sympathize or look up to a president who claims to hear the voice God.In brief: another, though relatively minor, neo-CON JOB, and somehow reminiscent of Buckley Jr.'s \\"God and Man at Yale\\", though much less eloquently written, and rehashed with present-day issues.By the way, in regards to credence of such arguments: How many GOPher presidential candidates have been elected since 1951, when \\"God and Man at Yale\\" was first published?

It takes no degree to be a writer (even though it takes talent, which is harder to get than the degree).This is the blatant hypocrisy of the author: to denigrate something he's taking advantage of just for the sake of making a quick buck with this book.

I'll admit it, I haven't read this book...but just from the comments I've read here, I don't want to read it. I don't want to read some kid's \\"horror\\" stories about his voice being drowned out by a too liberal campus. Ya know what? He wrote a book! From what I've read about him he doesn't seem to have no say in today's society...in fact, he seems to have more say than the average student.

A book will never replace a Sensei but is a good guide. I highly recommend it, because of the pictures display on each technique. The general information on Aikido history is pretty good too.

His superb rendition of Charles Trenet's \\"La mer\\" (Beyond the sea) and his majestic own composition \\"A regarder la mer\\" carry the listener to distant seashores. Poet of love, he also deals sometimes with social issues, as in \\"Un homme s'est pendu\\". His texts are touchingly beautiful (Emporte-moi, La Chamade), but Barriere's originality consists in his music. Concerto-like piano chords, accompanied by majectic trumpets (A regarder la mer) or a nostalgic spanish guitar (Angela) are perfect examples of the richness and originality of Barriere melodies and arrangements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"This CD didn't have all of Alain Barriere's famous songs, but it had enough of them to make it worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect to use as a multi-purpose pin...","review":"This pin has awesome non-stick properties, but don't expect to use it as a multi-purpose pin. We opted for the French Style thinking it would offer versatility - from pastry to pizza to tortillas, etc. During the first use - pizza dough - there came a loud snap as the pin cracked in the middle. The silicone sleeve did not tear, but there was a distinct bulge. Granted, there was a great deal of pressure applied to each end, however, it never occured to me that the core of this pin would be made of something so delicate. Disappointed, but very impressed with the non-stick properties of the silicone, we ordered the Sil-pin Baker's Pin - sans handles - and are quite pleased with it.Bottom Line: If you plan to roll only pastry, this pin will work . If you want a pin that can do it all, opt for the Sil-pin Baker's Pin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This rolling pin is a huge improvement from the regular rolling pins with the handles for rolling. When rolling out dough for a large pie, it's frustrating when the dough is wider than the rolling pin, but that's never a problem with this rolling pin. I feel like I have more control and it's easier to roll circles that are even thickness throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silicon Rolling Pin","review":"I bought this rolling pin for my beloved husband who has become a whiz at making pie crusts and pies. This rolling pin gives one a better feel for the dough and it's shape helps keep the thickness consistent. It is not as non-stick as I had hoped, but better than the wooden rolling pin we were using."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best kind of rolling pin","review":"I have the wooden version of this french style rolling pin and it's by far the best type of rolling pin I've used.

One of the best low budget indie movies to come along. The special effects great the acting was well done.

It revolves around four friends (all gay) and their relationship with each other. They're pretty nasty when it comes to practical jokes. One scene, wherein all four try to seduce and rape a frightened straight man, was horribly embarrassing. As the ending credits rolled, I moaned at the waste of my time.It's an Italian feature, and I don't know what the current state of gay awareness is over there, but this film, made here, would be picketed by gay men, friends of gay men, and advocates for decent films alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Charming Sexy Realistic","review":"This foreign film is one of the better flicks I have seen in a while. Very realistic, charming, funny, sexy and romantic in many ways.

However, the book reads like a vanity publication, i.e., some over-educated women with too much time on their hands felt like talking about their feelings.

It contains the true power of artists and musicians who work with and feel the spirit energies. This is not canned, new age music designed out of some cheap formula to sound nice. This is profound spirit music that touches my soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lost World","review":"I have always loved Sir Arthur Canon Doyle's best known works, the Sherlock Holmes stories. My favorites among these are the Universal Sherlock Holmes movies starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. Though these are not true to Doyle's original writings, Rathbone and Bruce did an outstanding job in their respective roles. The 1960 version of The Lost World is in my opinion the best. It does differ from Doyle's original novel. What makes this film great is the excellent performances by Claude Rains, Michael Rennie and David Hedison. Rains is a legend with such masterpieces under his belt as Sir John Talbot in the Wolfman and the title role as The Phantom of the Opera. David Heddison will go on to a very successful role as the Captain of Seaview in Irwin Allen's TV Series in Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lost World [ Special Edition] - 1960&1925 versions","review":"This movie for 1960 would have been much better if it were animated by stop-motion models instead of live lizards made up to look like prehistoric animals.But I must admit having a good cast made this film more enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you really have nothing to do. . . .","review":"This has to be one of the worst movie I ever forced my way through - it fact - I could only watch about half of the movie.

A band of explorers travel to an ancient plateu in South America, and encounter gigantic prehistoric beasts. The actors are great (to to Allen form, he made up for the poor special effects with big time actors) including Michael Rennie (THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL), Claude Rains (THE WOLF MAN) Jill St. John (DIOMANDS ARE FOREVER) Fernando Lamas, and many more! Sadly, only lizards with phony make-up aplinces are blown up on film to tremendous size. But using real lizards does have a cetain charm, and the motion is realistic because it is real! So all in all, good production values, good acting, exeptable special effects, a 4 star movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple. Works.","review":"Good, simple design for good simple tool.

I am faced daily with the mother, father who agonizes over what to do when school appears to be pushing for a medication intervention, some doctors are offering one form of medication or another, and they feel if they do not go along - they are dooming their child to academic failure and social isolation. I believe that this book offers information that is not otherwise widely available to parents, who ultimately make the decisons. I feel that after reading this book, parents are in a much more empowered position to make an informed decision and are aware that enviromental factors (including the parents, teachers, school programs) hold many of the answers to working with intense children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now that's what I call quite....dull !","review":"Aside from the super fun and musically spriteful 'Happy Hour' or the two sweet recalls of classics 'Caravan Of Love' and 'He's Not Heavy, He's My Brother', which were so well covered a la accapella by these Brit boys (super job), the rest of the 'best' of them were not really bad.

Briefly, it purports to show how the Pope and most if not all of the rest of the Vatican authorities have lost the plot, so to speak, and are working to destroy the Catholic Church from within. Interesting asides purport to show that Paul VI was replaced in mid-reign by an imposter (identified by slightly different-shaped ears) and that John Paul II fathered a love-child. It is just about possible - just about - to read this as a work of satirical fiction. That its author intended it to be read as fact is very nearly beyond belief."},{"rating":"1","title":"OF HISTORICAL INTEREST ONLY","review":"This edition of this once popular book, is of little use to the modern birder other than for historical purposes. The original was produced in the very early 1900's (my copy is 1901) and does have color photos. What is interesting is that the photos, while extremely accurate, are of dead, stuffed birds placed in what are suppose to be natural settings. Early birders, more or less shot their birds, and not with a camera! I have to give this one two stars simply because the information as to distribution, etc. is quite out dated. I would hate to think that someone would purchase this work in the hopes of owning a good book on bird identification. There are so very many good ones out there now. That being said, if you can find one of the early copies, the ones with the photos, it does make for an interesting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael is \\"jive-talkin'\\" on this album on a new label","review":"Michael Bolton went from Columbia Records to Jive with ONLY A WOMAN LIKE YOU.

Please. A pop star that should have ended his career when Nirvana took over the charts. This music is as shallow as it gets. I understand that he is not angry or loud, which is something I would say everyone respects to a certain degree.

Micheal has done nothing good for music except clear paths for solo artists like himself who have nothing to offer but a voice, and sometimes looks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"The only good thing about this cd is that it has a picture on the cover of Michael with short hair. It's about time that dude lopped off that frizzy lion's mane. I'm so glad i got over my Michael Bolton phase in the 80s. I wish he'd stop singing like he's constipated. 95% of his music is boring adult contemporary for ugly, fat women who will never get a man."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's Back!

For awhile, I thought I was right, but he is back, and he's the best he's ever been! If you enjoyed his music in the early 90s, then you have to have this CD. It's thousands of times more powerful and makes you fall in love (with him or a significant other of your choice) all over again... This is an essential CD for any Michael Bolton fan.

He's Back and Better than EVER!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spend a romantic evening with Michael!","review":"What a great cd!

The story felt a little dated, but the plots twists were better than most modern books and movies. Things were very unexpected and continued to get crazier to the very end.What disappointed me: The only real problem with this book was that is was a little difficult to get into, given the not so interesting victim. A dentist? Sort of boring. The story eventually made up for it, but I could see many people giving up on it before getting to the more exciting parts.Recommended: Yes, a decent, not as well known, Agatha Christie mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing the Last Chapter!","review":"This kindle version of One, Two, Buckle My Shoe does not have the last chapter. It could be that the book ends where this version stops, but in fact the book does not end there.

The author does play around with politics in her conservative, often very naive, way but handles it much more smoothly than she did in her early twenties spy novels. The solution to the killer is both predicatable and satisfying as Christie crawls right up to the preposterous and then pulls back just a little. This is one of the Poirot novels that could have used Hastings a foil and his prescence is sadly missed, particularly as everyone at a certain dentist's office on a particular morning has something to hide and it would have been fun to read Hastings switching prime suspects with each new revelation. All in all, not a classic Christie but an interesting one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book","review":"The book was exactly what I was looking for. The book arrived very promptly as well.

Plus he likes to reach inside the drum and pull the balls out; but his hand & ball together won't fit back thru the whole so his hand gets stuck inside which will casue him to cry, they need to make the whole bigger & make it where we can buy more balls for it when you lose them, hint hint fisherprice"},{"rating":"1","title":"drum","review":"This one is alright.

He kinda liked the lights and music, but pretty soon he got bored with that because it was the same every time. He did like the little plastic balls that came with it. He rolled those everywhere and threw them and to this day (he is 13 months now) will still play with those, but even at this low price it is still too much to pay for 3 little plastic balls. Maybe they could sell the balls by themselves :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"This toy is not worth the money.

I use it just to store her balls in there and that's the one time she's touched it, to take her balls out and that was it. She didn't like and doesn't even play with it now.

She had more encouragment from one on one interaction with myself that she did from this toy.

My daughter is on the petite side (VERY PETITE) so this toy may have been overwhelming in size to her (She's 10mons, 13 1/2lbs.) when I got it for her, she was even smaller then. The other thing I didn't like about it was that you can only roll it one way to make the balls pop out the side because the lines are grooved on the inside of the toy to help revert the balls out the hole. It's a good idea, and reasonably priced, just some toys work for some children, others not so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"So So Toy","review":"I purchased this toy for my 10 month old who loves to put things in and taking them out.

My 1yo loves putting the balls in but hasnt figured out how to get them out, their hand and the ball will not fit through the oval hole, I believe that is on purpose though, so the baby will learn to dump. It makes music and sounds when they put the balls in the hole. My 2.5yo loves putting everything in it, anything that fits goes in there. Even my 5yo plays with it. They like rolling it around.

After all, we can't put Ramses on a pedestal of idealistic manhood now can we? At this age, everything is so intense and you feel strongly and I personally was cheering for Ramses. It was exciting. It was new. It showed that you can fall in love and have your heart broken and still live and love again! I found that message bittersweet. No relationship is perfect.

Commonly used expressions by Peabody and Emerson are replaced with expressions they don't use in other books. There are a variety of disconnects with facts as they appearin later series books--this book doesn't really fit well.

So is EP trying to recall the 'glory days' of this series?I found the story and characters to be 'small' compared to her other books.
