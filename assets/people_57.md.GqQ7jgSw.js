If you do all of the things listed in this book EXACTLY, you will be on your way to an incredible career as a flight attendant. I was a beginner going after a flight attendant career I had always dreamed of, and was just hired on with American Airlines as a flight attendant. There is nothing I could ever do to thank Luanna Rule enough for writing such an informative book. I would highly recommend this book to any individual who is considering becoming a flight attendant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent resource for future flight attendants!","review":"Having been a part of flight attendant training for some time now, this book is one of the best no-nonsense resources I have read. Although the information is particularly US-based, it is easily adapted to wherever you may want to join an airline as a professional in the air. A must before you think of attending an interview!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better resources for would-be trolley-dollies.","review":"Reading at least one such book is essential prior to interviewing with the airlines.

But would still like to become a flight attendant? what should I do?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid Tale of True Love","review":"A splendid tale of true love and the long journey it takes. This deserves 4 1/2 stars because the writing is top notch, the story moves quickly, the plot twists are intriguing and as a whole it draws you into the tale. It's only flaw may be that it was too predictable at some points, but that is no reason to bypass this excellent book. This story is great for vacation since it reads so well and is easy to interrupt and resume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"Get ready for almost 800 pages of juiciness. Not since Gone With the Wind have I read such a sprawling historical novel. The story of a determined young woman is set in Jack-the-ripper London and 1890s New York, and I got a real sense of what it was like to live with and without money in those times. Yes, there is a love story too - but like GWTW, it is the time and place and the sheer grit of the main character that draws you in. Loved it and already have part two of the trilogy on order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good historical fiction","review":"The best part of this book was the rich detail about life in the Whitechapel in the late 1800's. I really became engrossed in the story and the characters, who were really fleshed out. What prevented me from giving this a 5 star was I didn't like how rushed the story felt when covering the main character's rise in the tea world. It seemed somewhat implausible to me and somewhat Forrest Gump-like. I actually was hoping they'd cover this more from a realistic standpoint. I love tea and would have been interested in more of a history there - not a lot, but the tea really was more of a backdrop for the story instead of becoming another character, like Whitechapel was. I also felt Joe's rise was a bit implausible and rushed as well. Other than that, I really liked the story and if you like historical fiction I'd say this is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read story","review":"I will admit right from the start that The Tea Rose is a huge undertaking with 500+ pages, but don't let the size of the book turn you away. The Tea Rose is a gripping tale of love, loss, and the power of believing in yourself and the strength within you to go on. Way to go Miss Donnelly... keep them coming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Storytelling at its Best!","review":"Jennifer Donnelly has created a superb novel with her excellent gift of great storytelling. I was captivated by this novel from the very first chapter. It pulled me in so that I could not put it down and had me thinking about the characters and plots all day long.The Tea Rose is the fascinating story of young and courageous Fiona Finnegan and her family who live in the poverty stricken neighborhood of Whitechapel in the East End of London in the 1880s. After horrible circumstances change Fiona's life forever and threaten to ruin her, she flees to America with her 5 y/o brother. The story continues over the next ten years as Fiona pulls her life together and vows revenge on the people who destroyed her family.The Tea Rose evokes many emotions full of love, romance, courage, bravery, heartache and suspense. I was so pleased with Ms. Donnelly's masterpiece of a novel and cannot wait to read more by this very talented author."},{"rating":"2","title":"I RE-read this book...twice (so far)","review":"I'm notorious for only reading a book once. The Tea Rose is the exception. I've read the book three times now and it keeps getting better. The characters are so real, the world so depicted, and the cadence so comfortable that it's good that it's long because there's more to enjoy.Fiona is an inspiring character, and even though this is a historical novel, the themes are very relatable to today. Fiona is put up against extraordinarily trying circumstances, but through it all maintains a spirit of hard work, optimism, and savvy business sense. I like how her character is strong and cuts her own path; I imagine if she existed in my world we would be close friends.I've read every book Donnelly has written (all fantastic) and eagerly await her next masterpiece. Until then, I may just read The Tea Rose again. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious","review":"A delicious read that finishes just as well as it begins.

I eagerly await more along this line from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must must MUST read!!","review":"I can't recommend this book enough. I could barely put it down, but when I was forced to put it down by work or sleep (or the boyfriend I completely neglected while reading) all I could do was think about it. The characters, good, bad and really really bad, are all so enthralling. The plot twists are numerous and jaw-dropping.My only recommendation is to read this at the same time as a good friend because you will be dying to chit chat with someone about every detail.And don't be daunted by the fact that it's somewhat lengthy. You'll wish there were 100 more pages once you start reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Heartwrenching page turner!!!","review":"This book! This book! This is one of the best books I have read in a very long time. It kept me up late every night and made a 5 hour flight seem like 5 minutes.

Well, never, until now. Donnelly had tears in my eyes by page 37. This book is what a novel should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book EVER!","review":"This book was so good! The only reasons that I put it down was because I had to sleep and eat.I can't give an review because I would spoil the entire story! SO...take my advice, read this book!I'm now very sorry to have finished this book. It's like losing a friend. But don't let that stop you from reading the book!!! I can always pick it up again, but now I feel every other book I look at to read wouldn't be as good as the one I just read.This book is like a drug, once you start reading it, you never stop wanting to."},{"rating":"1","title":"JACK'S BACK..","review":"This towering, old fashioned story vividly transports the reader to the 19th century. There are many threads involving various human relationships as well as the \\"downtrodden woman attempting to overcome the adversity into which she was born theme\\".In addition to the \\"love story\\", the \\"success story\\", the \\"redemption story\\", and the \\"revenge story\\", we are given yet another theory as to the identity of Jack the Ripper.Personally, I didn't much care about The Tea Rose or its'protagonist, Fiona Finnegan, and was more taken with Donnelly's \\"A Northern Light\\". In that novel the characters are more human, the situations more believable, and the heroine is one that the you can identify with. You actually find yourself longing to see her attain a better life.The Tea Rose put me more in mind of the \\"bodice rippers\\" by Barbara Cartland that I read as a teen, with a side trip to Danielle Steele land.Sorry, but no rave notices for this one. Two and a half stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining","review":"I loved Jennifer Donnelly's characters in this book. They weren't perfect, but that only made them all the more realistic and special.The story itself pulled no punches, especially during the first half of the book. It contained many raw and very emotional events, and until those events occurred, I thought this was going to read like a standard formula romance novel. This was a much better read than the \\"standard.\\"No five stars- the Tea Rose bloomed early then faded somewhat at about the 3/4 mark, but it did come through with a showy ending. I was disappointed at how Seamie became a nearly invisible, almost forgotten character- much could have happened with this broken hearted little boy.Overall, this was a lovely, memorable book. I'm hesitant to read the second book- I felt closure at the end of this one, and think the characters all had an appropriate ending. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and full of cliches","review":"Many readers have loved this book, but while I really cared for the protagonist, I found the story very predictable and full of cliches. It just seemed a little too familiar to me--\\"Young, hardworking girl endures a series of personal tragedies, yet through sheer grit and determination, works her way to the top of the (fill in the blank) trade, despite countless personal and professional obstacles along the way.\\" I guess this just wasn't my \\"cuppa tea.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"The author used every cliche in the book.

I happened to notice this book while shopping and just picked it up because I needed something to read. Once I started I couldn't put it down. Fiona Finnegan's tale will have you laughing, crying and cheering for the good guys from page one. After 700 pages, I still want more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, romantic novel","review":"This was one of those stories that I couldn't get enough of. Yet at the same time, I didn't want to read through too fast because I didn't want it to end! Her colorful descriptions left me with vivid pictures of every character. I felt for the characters, hoped for them to make the right choices, and felt truely sad when things did not go their way. Donnelly has written a truely wonderful romantic saga, I hope she has more books to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping","review":"This was a wonderful insight into the harsh reality of life in London late 1880s. The tenacity of main characters and exciting encounters, everlasting love and endurance kept me totally absorbed. Such clever plots. Couldn't wait to read the next book in this trilogy . Superb!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DOPEY romance masquerading as historical novel","review":"Just because a writer places a tale in a particular historical period and cleverly incorporates a few real historical figures into the narrative does NOT QUALIFY IT AS AN HISTORICAL NOVEL! I admit I \\"bought\\" the tale up until the main character easily found passage to New York City with a total stranger. In terms of the realities of economics, class, and the true immigrant experience in America -- the character and her adventures couldn't be further from the truth and no more than a dopey fairy tale romance with so many unbelievable twists and turns one would have to be incredibly gullible to NOT find it outrageously ridiculous. Did I finish it? Only by quickly skim reading pages because I like to verify my judgment based on an entire book. Plus, I like to be able to show students what BAD story-telling looks like. Just because it's published doesn't make it a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"the Tea Rose","review":"The Tea RoseCould not put this book down and hated to finish it!

I could picture many of the settings and loved the various aspects working alongside each other. The mysteries, the family connections and the love story of course.

Well done, once again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious indeed","review":"After reading several really good Historical Fiction books of late I tried this book and was very disappointed. Another reviewer remarked on it being tedious and I must agree. I did not consider this historical fiction, rather it was a very predictable romance novel. If you like that kind of book then this book should be for you but if you are wanting something with much historical substance then this book is not for you. Serious Historical Fiction readers be warned; avoid this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!!!","review":"I loved every second of this book. Didn't want it to ever end.

I was expecting at least a \\"book club\\" level of read from this book. It was a \\"Romance Novel\\". That's all fine and good if that is the genre you enjoy, but just keep that in mind when deciding to purchase.

What it delivered was a Irish lass who always manages to be saved by a handsome rich man.

This novel is dribble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Well Written, but Morally Bamkrupt","review":"An incredibly well crafted epic tale filled with extreme heartaches, soaring loves, rags to riches, rising above the saddest of beginnings.... But be warned this book is morally bankrupt -- even in the twists of the ending. The characters have much contempt for God in their lives because of sadness and tragedy, in spite of being ultimately blessed beyond belief. Would give it 5 stars for a moving (and often even inspiring) read, but was forced to deduct heavily for the lack of values."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tea Rose","review":"I found this book while searching through amazon books just trying to find a good book to read for the summer. This book is great. It has romance, suspense and always keeps you guessing. It is well written, and you don't want to put it down. I just purchased the sequel The Winter Rose. I can't wait to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story, language & attitudes a little unconvincing","review":"I did enjoy this book, and I would read the sequel, but as historical novels go it was a little clunky. Some of the langauge and terms people used seemed too modern, and I did find some of the \\"Cor, guvnor\\" type speach wearing. The main characters were interesting enough to carry the novel, liberally dropped aitches and all, and the novel certainly spans a huge amount in terms of different countries, classes, and ways of life. I would recommend this book to people who enjoy family sagas, with a healthy dollop of romance and imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"In LOVE with this series ...","review":"Talk about an emotional ROLLERCOASTER!

This book was very well written. There were a lot of surprises, and the parts that were predictable, just made you want to read more to see how the characters could untangle themselves.The characters were well defined. You felt like you actually knew them and could sympathize with them. I also loved that this was the first book in a trilogy,while this one was my favorite of the three, the other two are worth reading as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Page-Turner","review":"Makes you want to keep on reading through the night until you find out how the story concludes. I enjoyed reading about the late nineteenth century English culture. It may be a chick book, but it kept my interest because I'm a chick.

Although, at times a little too mushy for my taste, the book was hard to put down! It reads as if you're watching a movie and does not have a single dull moment in it.

I ended up cutting the edges off to make it a true circle and piled on the ganache to even out the top and fill the crack.

The two star rating was based on the overall quality at the Amazon price. This is a perfectly acceptable device at $10 but at $50 I would be very disappointed in the build quality.

Not only are the other negative reviews correct, the poor design on this product had me immersing my toothbrush head into a pool of collected water at the bottom of this \\"sanitizer\\". This seems to be a well put together product because of its sleek and cool looking design. However, as the saying goes, \\"appearances can be decieving\\". Aside from this, the disinfective qualities of this product are probably just as effective as letting a toothbrush naturally air dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mold grew in the \\"Sanitizing\\" device!","review":"Used this product for a few months and just assumed it was working. Then one night my husband took a close look at his toothbrush and there was mold on the end of it. When we examined the inside of the Sanitizer closely we found that there was a variety of gunk, mold etc inside. If these things can grow right next to the bulb how much do you think it is doing for your toothbrush?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy","review":"First about air drying. The only thing about air drying I don't like is that in a bathroom there are lots of germs stirred up by family members sneezing and coughing at certain times of the year. And even flushing the toilet sends a certain amount of bacteria into the air according to the experts on TV.So I kept my brush hidden in the drawer the last 5 years, that was a big mistake, it only takes about 2 weeks to colonized with bacteria. I was getting these gingivitis like gum infections. For a few years I thought the bacteria was coming from my stomach, but after doing some research, I bought one of these and my gum problem went away. I will always have some type of sterilizer, they are too cheap not to when you consider the brush goes into your mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Item worked great for a couple of weeks, then quit working altogether.

Though there is no proven effect, I got enamored by the idea of UV light keeping the toothbrush heads clean. It was a pretty thing to be seen in the bathroom especially when the bluelight is on but it's not really as sturdy as compared to a regular toothbrush holder. The holding cups are difficult to clean and since it pools fluid from wet heads, I don't see how UV light can keep the heads sanitized. And since it is stored in the bathroom, it gets moist most of the time from the steam of the hot water. It was already broken after 3 months of use. It was really a waste of $45."},{"rating":"1","title":"Price and Value","review":"This product is priced by the market and is not not priced by the technology it uses (research and development) or actual components which make it up. Materials and labor cost approx. $5.00 so what constitutes a $50.00 price tag? Is it the value of aesthetics (packaging)or the value of piece of mind (bacteria BE GONE)that sells this product when many other products or practices do the same thing? Perhaps it is the cost of shipping junky little consumables around and around the globe that constitutes $50.00. Either way the mark up on this product is grossly high and other lower cost products should be sought after if this is your preferred method of sterilization (that being an old but effective method of UV light). So if you have expendable income then why not donate it the CEO of a NOT so local manufacturer abroad? You will have a clean mouth and they will have your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"VIOlight = waste your money","review":"Don't buy this crap. I don't think it sanitizes the toothbrush.

How is this possible if the device was truly sanitizing my toothbrush?! There is no detectable mildew on the toothbrush, but the black muck certainly is visible in the crevices.

Sounds like false advertising to me.I've exchanged several emails with them, but to no avail.1 star for lasting <12 months, and it looks nice on the counter top.1 star for first time replacement.

Everything about it is first rate, primarily the skillful direction and excellent casting choices of the leads (Crowe in particular stands out as the rage-filled & brutal scourge of woman-beaters). The script draws parallels both overt and subtle between the illusions of Tinseltown and the P.R. machine of the L.A.P.D. which loom more heinous as the story progresses.

It also has a good soundtract that's kind of fun to listen to. The story involves around a murder where nothing is as it seems to be. It tells you that all cops are not good.

It's not intended to be a shoot 'em up, blow 'em up Hollywood production. If you enjoy interesting characters, complex plots, and amazing period detail, this movie may be for you. The best thing about this movie is the airtight plot. Many movies, at the end, leave us confused. There are either big holes in the plot or it doesn't make sense at the end. This movie ties up all the subplots into a satisfying ending. Also, there are some major surprising twists. When I saw this in the theater a scene involving K.Spacey had a shock so big I nearly jumped out of my seat. This movie deserved to win the Best Picture Oscar, but I believe that it lost because it wasn't as emotionally involving as Titanic. Also, if you have the chance, watch Chinatown, another film noir classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"the BEST movie of 1997!!","review":"When I went to see this movie, it was with some hesitation--this sort of film is not usually my cup of tea.

Confidential to film noir are absolutely valid. Nevertheless, I don't love this movie because of what it compares to - it's a milestone of cinema that stands on its own two feet. There is no superfluous scene, no useless dialog that distracts from the plot, nothing showy to cover up deficits. There are no deficits. The acting, music, cinematography, and plotline are accompanied by an irony and tragedy that makes the characters feel like much more than figures crammed into a film noir mold. Just one example: the montage accompanying Hush-Hush magazine's coverage of L.A.'s crime and corruption illustrates the bitter parallel to the glossy snapshots of glamor we think of when we hear 'Hollywood'. If you want an intelligent, complex crime story, and can handle the sight of blood, this film is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kevin Spacey at it again!","review":"If you're a Spacey fan, you'll love this. It is all about Old Hollywood, both the glamourous and the grimy. Awesome crime story which rivals the Departed way before that movie was ever conceived. Great cast of actors which hold their own, and tell the story together. Due to the strong ensemble of characters no one is responsible for carrying the film, however they all do in their own way. This has become one of my favorites, give it a try, and it may become a staple of your collection as well. It can be watched again and again in order to experience all of the subtle nuances of the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST NOIR SINCE CHINATOWN","review":"This Curtis Hanson flick was sunk by TITANIC at oscar time ( though, I personally, much preferred this gritty, suspenseful, crime-thriller ). The movie has a dream cast, a tight-as-nails script ( by Hanson, and Brian Helgeland ), and fabulous cinematography. The dialogue crackles, and the characters include heroes in varying shades of gray ( Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, and Guy Pearce ), a fragile femme fatale ( Kim Basinger was never better ), and suave, to coldly monstrous villains. The action is well-paced, and the tension mounts steadily. I loved THE USUAL SUSPECTS, but L.A. CONFIDENTIAL blew me away."},{"rating":"2","title":"L.A. Confidential a stunner on Blu-ray","review":"If you are wondering whether it's worth the 18 bucks and change for the blu-ray, in my opinion you shouldn't wonder any longer. Pick this disc up. The movie, which is near-flawless in every way, just gets better in 1080p. You can really appreciate the passion that director Curtis Hanson brought to the film when you pick up the incredible detail in every filmed location. A great surprise was Jack Vincenne's (Kevin Spacey) monogrammed \\"JV\\" on his shirts --- never noticed that before when watching in standard def. It's these little details that really envelop the viewer in the world of corrupt, violent 1950s L.A.The special features on the BD seem to be a port over from the special edition DVD put out a few years ago, but they're still great.

They also have a nearly 1 hr TV movie/pilot called LA CONFIDENTIAL starring Keifer Sutherland which is fun. There is also a bonus CD disc of music which is icing on the cake. I just spent a few hours watching all the bonus features and will absolutely watch them again ( a rarity) and as I said..the movie never looked better..I've only checked out a bit of the commentary which has a staggering number of contributors and should make another viewing of the movie with it running a fun trip indeed.

By the way, I walked out of Titanic before the stupid ship even hit the iceberg......."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great film, but not a masterpiece","review":"The film noir is an interesting genre. Most are crafted in a brilliant manner but the conclusion of the film seems to fall apart, not to mention some of the explanations make no sense. Chinatown has been considered to have one of the greatest endings ever filmed. While it was good, the denouement of Chinatown was definitely rushed and that hindered the film. L.A. Confidential is another noir film, and while it bears similarities to Chinatown, I feel Confidential is the better film. There are many engaging characters with more humor and action. The plot twists are as intriguing as the ones in Chinatown. The performances, especially Russel Crowe, are outstanding. It would be hard to explain this film in a couple of sentences, so I think you should just watch this movie for yourself. Overall, it is a great film, but a rather hard to believe conclusion hurts it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous, simply marvelous!","review":"I felt the need to write this review as a way of off-setting the one or two bad comments it has received here. Did these people see the same movie as I have (numerous times, I might add)? L.A. Confidential is, without a doubt, on my list of the best movies of all time. Every performance is top-rate. As is true in all of his movies, Kevin Spacey provides an amazing magentism which draws me in time and again. I really loved this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Walk behind the Blue Line of Silence","review":"This is an excellent movie. The plot is excellent, the soundtrack is great. It always leaves you guessing and at the same time the movie has some feel good elements that can be crowd pleasers.Set in LA in the 50's when the pitch for tourism is high and the city is trying to promote a crime-free image, their credibility is damaged by drug and sex rings and a late night shotgun massacre in a tiny diner. A young hot shot detective plays by the book and another plays bad cop. Together they have to get to the bottom of things without getting killed.The acting is great in this movie, across the board. I loved it. If you haven't seen it already, you must. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal!","review":"This movie is what films should strive to be!

A greatly entertaining and classic film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best noir in 50 years","review":"L A Confidential will remain the best film noir (modern) made in at least the last 50 years. Every actor performs at peak. The screenwriting is perfect. The music is haunting and unforgettable. Casting was surprising but turned out to be excellent and sets and costumes are period exact. Keep buying the re-issues to keep this classic in your library. The only other movie I can compare L A Confidential to is Casablanca for first class movie making and lasting value."},{"rating":"2","title":"big move, great cast.","review":"With a very interesting script, and a group of high caliber actors. it is always an imposible not to make a great movie.- Kevin Spacey,Russell Crowe,Kim Bassinger,Danny de Vito and all the others put together a classic in this type of movie,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love and hate","review":"I love this movie but hate the format.

I found it impossible to single out a particular actor as each member"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best films of the 1990s","review":"L.A. CONFIDENTIAL is a briliantly made film. Director Curtis Hanson took a wonderful novel and made it into an even better film. With the casting of an unknown Russell Crowe alongside the likes of James Cromwell and Kevin Spacey, Hanson cemented the film's place as a classic. Buy this masterpiece today!In 1950s Los Angeles, all is not as perfect as one might lead you to believe. There is a wave of violent crimes after a crime boss's arrest. Now, it is up to three officers to try and find out who is behind the horrid crimes. Their journey through a world of glamour, glitz, and utmost corruption. This journey makes for a wonderful film.If you do not enjoy crime dramas, a bit of profanity, or even Russell Crowe you will not like L.A. CONFIDENTIAL. Younger viewers may not be suited for the sometimes graphic images of crime. However, anyone who wishes to see a dark, funny, and masterful film should buy the film version of James Ellroy's L.A. CONFIDENTIAL today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely in the Top 20 of DVDs in my collection","review":"This film is a great period film as well as featuring some great unknown acting as well as the stellar performances brought forth by Kevin Spacey and Danny DeVito.

Great story and not to forget Kim Basinger who delivered an excellent role as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Story of Los Angeles and the 1950s","review":"I was raised in Los Angeles during the 1950s and this is one of the very few movies that capture the look, feel, and character of the city at that time. The acting is stunning and the DVD transfer is razor sharp. Jerry Goldsmith's superb score terrific and the locations, particularly the \\"Formosa Cafe\\" and the Bunker Hill area flop houses are particularly authentic. What I have to say about this great film has been said by the many reviews here already. I wanted to add that this gem is brilliantly adapted from the great novel it came from with awesome authenticity. Intricate, brilliant, action-packed and mysterious all at the same time. An easy five stars!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly Plot and Childish script","review":"Whew, what a stinker! This is one of those films that I was forced to fast-forward through many of the interminable boring scenes. Even Danny deVito was wasted in this bomb.

I can not recommend this film too much! Some films just seem to have the magic touch, where everything seems to push it toward excellence. The writing , photography, location selection, musical score, direction, the selection of the cast,the actors dedication in this film are top drawer. This film just shows what Hollywood could do but usually does'nt.This film I believe will stand the test of time as one of the great classics of film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly disappointed.","review":"Having never seen this film at the time of its release, I was very eager to view the DVD based on the rave reviews and spectacular cast. As the plot unwound, I became particularly disappointed in the lack of depth of the characters, the trite dialogue, and the predictability of the story (Guess what, there's a shoot-out at the end). The only element of the film worthy of praise was the performance by Guy Pierce (his character predictably torn between a squeaky-clean image and the corruption and violence around him). The dismal script can summarized in the deadpan voice from another lackluster Kim Bassinger performance, \\"Some guys get the world, and others get the ex-hooker and a trip to Arizona.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfectly Okay, No More","review":"A good enough little movie. Perfectly adequate in all ways, except for the utter tedium that sets in whenever Kevin Spacey appears on screen. Strange that this has become acclaimed as some sort of masterpiece. I can't agree. It is merely an amusing little movie that entertains for a couple of hours. Sad that that is enough, in the late 1990s, to confer classic status on a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Ray but not 1081","review":"this blue ray is not what you would expect of a HD imahe because its 480 image and not 1081 image - this is a pity for a great film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"LA Confidential is a great movie.Great acting, great story line, etc.If you want a really entertaining movie, this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just couldn't get into it.","review":"I know this movie was very high ratings and I am a minority on this... but the wife and I rented this for the first time through Amazon and just could not get into the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Froze during streaming","review":"I was so happy to find this movie to stream because I needed it for a school project.

Never mind the naysayers, this was the best picture in the year of that big boat. The acting is sensational--esp. Spacey's and Crowe's In my mind, the image of Bud White hanging the dirty DA out of his office window is a classic. The extras on the DVD are great, and there is nothing like wide screen.

I love this guitar - I even took it to a music store and the guy said it was a great guitar and for 90$ it was a steal. He also said it had a very cool sound and said he was going to buy one lol. This is a great guitar for ANYONE and for a first guitar I couldnt ask for more. It's crafted perfectly and there are no flaws in the finish. I would definetly reccommend this guitar to everyone.

I hope the seller could contact me ASAP and tell me what should I do right now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateur Guitar","review":"Any Silvertone acoustic guitar is not worth the money. These guitars are low quality. When I play anything, it is hard to hear it since the sound of it is very deep and mellow. Also, the action on it was TERRIBLE. It was so hard to play a power chord in drop D on the 1st and 2nd frets. It left marks on your fingers since you needed so much force to press the strings down. Also, there was a lot of fret buzz on the 1st fret of the E and A string. Lastly, the guitar does not say in tune because the tuners were loose all time (even if I tightened them).I would not recommend this to anyone. Trust me, you can get way, way better guitars for only $20 more."},{"rating":"1","title":"hardly even playable","review":"The buzzing on this guitar was so bad that it was literally not playable.

Worst of all, I hate the handle. he likes to pull it over and either slams himself in the head with it, or leans on it causing the body to flip and hurt him.

I'm not so bad -- I had a pretty good crash course on relational DB ideas and SQL in 2 lectures of a web programming class once, for use with mySQL.

Although Mr. Fiennes has great experience as a Polar explorer in his own right, his claim to be the only author in a position to comment on Scott's decisions, does little to prove he is giving us an objective history of the expedition. Fiennes takes every opportunity to make Scott appear to be a selfless and overly self critical hero, interested primarily in scientific discovery, who was loved by all who are worthy, and has the sole claim to the greatest physical achievement in history. He makes Roald Amundsen out as a selfish, unpleasant, and dangerous man with no friends.

For all Tom and Jerry cartoons fans let usbringing back the oringinal Itchy and Stratchy show of Tom and Jerry cartoon !"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disaster!","review":"I rented this set, and am glad I didn't pay good money to own it. Tom and Jerry cartoons keep getting poor treatment. Censorship, bad prints, and an attitude from the owners like who cares? Tom and Jerry cartoons were originally meant for adults -- only when they were shown on TV did people decide they were children's fare. And there's the problem; you can't take adult cartoons made 50 to 60 years and remold them to what some PC-minded corporate type thinks is okay for children today. What's ironic is that present day animation, from South Park to Family Guy -- all of which is readily available to children -- is way, way more offensive than anything our poor cat and mouse friends might get into. Until I am certain I could get uncut and uncensored Tom and Jerry's, I am passing on this set. Let's hope enough people shun it that WB wakes up and gives the fans what they truly want to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 cartoons omitted and His Mouse Friday edited.","review":"Hey everyone, I just got home from buying this set, even though I knew about the 2 omitted cartoons beforehand. Disc one was pre-scratched for my enjoyment of course.I was shocked to see that they STILL edited 'His Mouse Friday'. The frame has been chopped to omit the big-lipped native prodding Jerry at the end.Also, wasn't it 'Royal Cat Nap' that had the scene at the end (admittedly disturbing) where Jerry and Nephew are walking and there is the silhouette of a guillotine in the distance cutting off Tom's head? That scene is not here. Excuse me if it is in another cartoon.Whatever. I gave up on America years ago - so this doesn't surprise me.Pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puss Gets the Boot","review":"I am tired of incomplete and edited sets. Additionally, I am tired of non restored sets. The Tom and Jerry prints are the same old washed colored, scratchy, debris ridden, muffled sound transfers that appeared on VHS and laserdisc formats. Warner Home Video, please take note. I am tired of spending my hard earned money on inferior product and getting less for it each time. You lost a loyal customer with your poor handling of this franchise. If you can do it with class on the Looney Tunes and Popeye set, why not Tom and Jerry and Droopy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat Emptor! \\"Buyer Beware\\" Read the Reviews","review":"I will not be purchasing this 3rd collection because of the reviews. Thank You Amazon for allowing the reviews, please share them with the manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNER BROTHERS has more problems than the cartoons they are omitting!","review":"In my own personal dealings with WARNER BROTHERS HOME VIDEO I have found them to have more problems than the subject matter they decide people should not see. They have no idea what they own, how it should be handled and don't even involve the people that originally created these classics. They don't even want to give copies to the people that helped with the DVD sets. The fans here are right, we need to omit WARNER BROTHERS and buying these DVDs until they can get their act together."},{"rating":"2","title":"tom and jerry","review":"my kids love tom and jerry, and this dvd has alot on it, more than most, really worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't buy","review":"Well, I own the original Spotlight Collection, Volume #1. I was very happy when the fist disk in the set was recalled to fix the edited cartoons. I received my new disc a few months ago. Based on this I assumed WB would not make the same mistakes with any future sets. Apparently not based on a number of these reviews. Like many others, I too will hold off on purchasing this set until the problems are resolved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom and Jerry Spotlight Collection Volume 3","review":"Tom and Jerry Spotlight Collection Volume 3 is a good volume with some great Tom and Jerry cartoons on it. Hope volume 4 comes out soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusted & Insulted","review":"I bought the first spotlight collection around 4 years ago when it first came out. I returned it the very next day for a refund after finding out that the cartoons were CENSORED. I have not bought any spotlight collections since and will continue not to buy them until they release an uncut set.Warner Bros should be ashamed and embarrassed for treating Tom & Jerry this way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once again Warner Brothers fumble the ball...","review":"...and once again I will not be buying this collection until a disc replacement programme is announced as they did for Volumes 1 and 2.When will they learn?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warner's Statement","review":"Here is the statement from Warner Bros as to why the two shorts are not being included on this release:Two shorts, \\"Mouse Cleaning\\" and \\"Casanova Cat,\\" will not be included in the third and final \\"Tom and Jerry Spotlight Collection\\" of theatrical animated shorts from the Hanna-Barbera era at MGM. Although this collection is intended for mature audiences and collectors (not for children), Warner Home Video made the decision to omit these two shorts because, regardless of their historical context and artistic value, the offensiveness of certain scenes containing inappropriate racial stereotypes would diminish the enjoyment of the Collection's 35 other classic cartoons for a large segment of the audience.How's that for corporate PC jibberish."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT SUPPORT CENSORSHIP!!!!!!!","review":"So, Warner Brothers Home Video has now decided to become BIG BROTHER!!!???? I know that the words I'm about to type are now considered pass�� by the new studio owners but here goes. ARTISTIC INTEGRITY. Leave these cartoons alone and allow us to judge them in their Historical Perspective. We are not idiots! We don't even need Leonard Maltin to tell us it's o.k. to view these cartoons un-cut. Was Leonard un-available to tell us it's o.k. to view these as we remember them!!?? How a studio that did so well answering the requests of the fans of the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies to leave them as they originally were, could so insult those same fans now, is utterly beyond me! Send them a LOUD and CLEAR message. DO NOT BUY THIS VOLUME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WB WTF happened this time?","review":"Warner Brothers you do such a great job on the The Looney Tunes Collections (well save for Whoopi Goldberg) and you did a great job on Droopy;why do you continue to screw up the Tom & Jerry discs? The only thing that offends me about these cartoons is your continuous censorship.I want to see the original uncut,unrevoiced cartoons.I realize we live in different times than we did sixty years ago,but they're just cartoons.If certain PC activists,ethnic groups or hell..anybody is offended by these cartoons then they shouldn't buy or watch them.It's funny how we,grown people cannot purchase sixty year old cartoons yet my 15 year old daughter and her friends can go to a theater and see any kind of violence they like with a PG13 rating.Go figure...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy, set is heavily censored.","review":"I had every intention of buying this set, but when I read of the 2 cartoons being left off for Political Correctness reasons, I decided then and there that enough is enough. I bought the first 2 sets and got the disk replacements, but won't even consider buying the 3rd until I know that I am getting a complete and uncensored set. I am 45 years old and I will decide for myself what I watch or don't watch. I don't need a nanny at Warner Home Video deciding for me. So, let us put some pressue on WHV and see if we can't keep the sales figures down for this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lawyers 1 Fans 0","review":"Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.As it has been pointed out that the label on the box states for adults only. If we're truly adults...why do you think you need to shelter us from things we've already seen. Because we might be offended? If you're offended by this content...then DON'T BUY IT. C'mon MGM...Stop spoon feeding us...It is a very sad state of affairs when I have to rely on Lawyers to edit the content that I as an adult see.By deleting content that was once deemed appropriate and is now deemed scandalous for the sake of political correctness is a complete and utter slap in the face of MGM's consumers.These cartoons are a part a piece of art. And NOBODY has the right to censure art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love!!!","review":"I'm a fan of Tom& Jerry so whenever I see any of there dvd's on sale. I purchase them. The cartoon shorts are from the classics (the ones I used to watch when I was a kid, I'm 30), so I really do enjoy watching them with my kids. Tom & Jerry will never get old, I can even picture my future grandkids watching them!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Release it all","review":"Although it would make perfect sense only to write a review of what is released on the disc and what it is not, I would only say that most of these historical DVD packages have taken a lot of care to give fans their due. By not releasing two cartoons, I have avoided buying as I am not a huge fan of the series, and feel like I wasted my money on marginal cartoons (WB cherry picked Vol#1&2 in which I have) that does not complete the series.Please notice the popularity of the Popeye and Disney Treasures on how it should be released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never knew..","review":"I listened to the Beatles, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones and Neil Young for years and years, and all I knew about the Kinks was 'Lola','You really got me' and other popular U.S hits, But then I played around on the internet and discovered what I missed all those years THE KINKS. Arthur, is the best Kinks album and thats saying alot, because its one of albums that you can play all the way though with no bad songs, like Darkside of the moon, Sgt. Peppers,and Led Zeppelin IV. I think if you like the Beatles, Pink Floyd or the Rolling Stones you have to get this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arhtur has never sounded so good!!","review":"These deluxe additions are something special!! I've always considered Arthur as \\"the low point\\" in the great album run from face to face thru lola, but after spending time with the mono and stereo versions, I'm going to have to reconsider that!!This was my first experience with the mono, and although there are not as many differences as there are on something else, they are there. The main difference with this package over previous additions is the sound-WOW!! Acoustic guitars ring out sharp and clear, the production comes to the forefront and, is that tambourine I'm hearing? On a KinKs song? It sure is!Most of the bonus tracks were included on the last Arthur release, but, again, the sound is so superior! And the backing track for shangra-la-it may not be Brian Wilson, but Ray does a heck of a job!!The only problem becomes what to do with the previous versions? Don't think the neighborhood dog would even chase them as frisbees!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last (nearly) Great Kinks Album","review":"This odd, bloated, slightly unfinished-sounding opus is massively overrated (\\"Village Green\\" it ain't), but it does contain some great Ray Davies tunes. \\"Yes Sir, No Sir\\", \\"Some Mother's Son\\", and \\"Shangri-La\\" are all excellent and nearly up to the standard that this fine band had set with previous efforts. But most of the rest of this album hints at the rot that had set in and just started to fester as the 60s came to a close. Proceed with caution...."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"... I guess I must be a strange Kinks fan, because I found this CD to be very disappointing. I don't believe there was a single track that I found interesting/entertaining.They've done SO much better..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who Ever Knew Imperial Decay Could Be So Fun?","review":"I first encountered this album through Amazon, and the reviews greatly intrigued me. Having listened to it (\\"Victoria\\" about sixty times in a row), I began kicking myself for not having gotten it before. As a student of history (East Asian, but certainly related to British Imperial history), the cultural importance of the album was awfully interesting, but more important, of course, is that it ROCKS! \\"Victoria\\" could be equally a patriotic hymn to the Widow herself, or a love song for a girl named Victoria (and it's great dancing music). \\"Yes, Sir, No, Sir\\" is as good a statement of the alleged \\"good- ol-days\\" as you're going to find, and \\"Shangri-La\\" and \\"Arthur\\" just about say it all. Interesting listening alongside the Who's \\"The Who Sell Out\\" (1967). This is easily one of the best albums I've ever heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Hello Beautiful...","review":"I discovered this album while systematically going through my dad's LP collection. And it's just so perfect.They don't make 'em like this anymore. They hardly even made 'em like this back then. I mean, I'm a diehard Beatles fan and I still find a song I don't care for on each and every album. This one I play straight.So, having just typed the most blasphemic statement of my life (better than the Beatles? Christ!), I say to you: five stars! Five of the biggest stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!!!!","review":"This DVD only has the first part of the story, with no explanation as to how to get the 2nd part. Extreme disappointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great movie to watch!","review":"I like watching movies that are based on true stories.

I really like all these old 70's songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peter Kagan and the Wind","review":"This CD contains 10 songs, including the very hard to find 'Peter Kagan and the Wind'. Gordon Bok wrote 9 of the 10 songs and sings and narrates them in his marvelous baritone.Gordon Bok is a treasure of the folk and music world. This album is certainly an example of the legacy he has given to his listeners. The presence of Peter Kagan is worth the price alone - a 15 minute narrative song of a fisherman and his selkie wife.The quality of the sound is good. This certainly belongs in any serious folk collection"},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect voice for England's songs of World War II","review":"I am so happy to have this cd in my collection. Even though Mr. Sinatra felt his voice sounded tired after a long tour, and did not allow release in the U.S. for many years, to me his voice was perfect for the poignantcy of the popular songs of England during World War II. The rendition of \\"Roses of Picardy\\" could not be more touching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album but sound a bit noisy","review":"I just bought the MP3 album (guilty of instant gratification). At first the sound seemed too noisy for me to wholeheartedly enjoy the music. So I put all tracks through a low-pass filter to get rid of noises, and then sat back and let the wonderful music soothe my spirit."},{"rating":"2","title":"music Lover","review":"This album was good, but I much preferred, \\"Old Blue Eyes is Back.\\" That's the album I'll save my 5 stars for."},{"rating":"2","title":"First time buyer","review":"I purchased the CD for gifts but the receiver of them loved everyone that they got.I was very pleased with the delivery service and the price of each item.

Yes, Frank is a bit tired but it does not disturb the singing or dramatic effect in any way. Heck, I'll listen to this one over DUETS any day!Farnon's charts are superb - he could make strings \\"sing.\\" This is an easy to listen to album but not an easy listening album. There is plenty of feeling in the singing and the arrangement support it.If you can't find it here, search the web.."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST ALBUM BY THE SWEET","review":"For die-hard fans only ! This was their very last original album released only in Germany (not even in the UK !) Arguably their worst album ever recorded and this is not only my personal viewpoint. Banal hard-rock where NOTHING reminds you of what was the original glam-rock by The Sweet. A Repertiore Records (Germany) 1992 release, not digitally remastered, extended booklet, original artwork... This is a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"nearly the best book ive read","review":"I was reading and it took me forever to put it down. It has everything you can think of for all types of people. Mystery, combat, love, loyality, betrayal. I admit it doesnt get to exiting until the last ten chapters, but the rest of the book fills you in with everything youneed to know for the end. I would concider this book for everyone"},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative about the confusing time in the NICU.","review":"This was a wonderful book. After getting home each night from the NICU I'd read up on what they told me about my son (born at 33 weeks). It is very important to read ONLY the sections that apply to your baby. Otherwise you'll worry about things that do not apply. I do not agree with Jenny William's review above. Sometimes while baby is NICU it CANNOT breast feed because sometimes preemies need special formula due to digestive problems. And many (as mine did) have alot of trouble learning to suck and need to be tube fed for awhile. This book covers the NICU from soup to nuts in a manner that the parent can understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technically appropriate, emotionally crippled.","review":"My son was born at 28 wks-while this book gave me all the med info-tech support I could have asked for, ultimately it felt 'hands off'. I am a huge advocate of kangaroo care for preemies, if you have a preemie PLEASE find a compassionate medical provider that understands and supports this kind of mother/child care! If you wish to breastfeed DO NOT GIVE UP! PUMP! It's not fun, but it can work. -DON'T SLEEP WITH YOUR CHILD IN YOUR BED?! At 16 mnths my son is just leaving our bed-it's been sweet, it's been HEALTHY. PLEASE read the Sears' 'The Baby Book' for emotional and common sense back-up, not geared specificly towards preemies, this book espouses the kind of HANDS ON parenting our children really need-especially our preemies. My '28-wkr' is healthy, bright and sweet-I credit kangaroo care and 'The Baby Book' for alot of it! I wish you the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half the picture","review":"The emotional realities of life in the NICU are as important as the medical realities.

Izzard blends pop culture, world history, and anything else he can get his hands on, and creates an intensely funny stand-up. One of the funniest comedians I've seen in a long time. Sort of like Dennis Miller crossed with Steve Martin crossed with Robin Williams. Brilliant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent Humor, Smart Outfit","review":"It is a rare and delightful event to hear comedic ramblings as historical and insightful as they are humorous. Brilliantly witty and bitingly sarcastic, Eddie Izzard wades through the analogs of time. From the Druids to the Death Star; Eddie \\"runs, jumps, and climbs trees\\" through both the pivotal and lighter points of world history. The show is masterfully woven with a number of reoccuring bits some subtle, some obvious, and some spoken in French. Religion, politics, puberty and a plethera of other topics-all covered while wearing heels. Eddie Izzard far surpasses his peers and is one of the single most gifted entertainers I have ever had the pleasure to see. He will grab your attention and never lose it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"Absolutely hilarious, with bits about the Hiemlich Manuever, and how to take over a country just by having a flag.

And to find a man (an executive transvestite) with such great taste in clothes and make-up! It just doesn't get funnier than Eddie Izzard and Dressed to Kill."},{"rating":"2","title":"a humorous lad...","review":"There are a lot of intriguing things in this world, and a transvestite comedian is one of them. Now, that is probably what distinguishes Eddie Izzard most from the run-of-the-mill comedians, or even those better known, however his hilarity sets him off as well.Eddie keeps the humor going, all the while mixing stories and what not. Not only that, but he is smart too, and not just in wit. Some of the jokes, the very few, that do go over the audience are just because of how either complex they are, or how interrelated they are to his other ones.Do not think he just keeps making transvestite jokes either, because he is very well rounded. Simply put, he will have anyone laughing in no time, and that is more then his job; it is his life.(Did I mention he's British?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"What is it Sebastian? I'm arranging matches\\"","review":"Watch Dress to Kill and you'll know what the title for my review meansThere are actually 5 Eddie Izzard stand up concerts out on the old video cassettes (in UK). Dress To Kill, his San Francisco gig, is the only one available on DVD so far. This openly transvestite man is arguably the best British stand up comic today. His material is very Monty Python-ish. If you like the Pythons, you'll like Eddie. If you don't like the Pythons, try Eddie anyway. You'll end up with stomach cramps from all the laughing. I did.By the way, the 5 videos of his concerts are: Live at the Ambassador's, Unrepeatable, Definite Article, Glorious and Dress to Kill. They're all great. I hope they all come out in DVD soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Eddie Izzard DVD by far","review":"Eddie Izzard is so awesome!

Eddie Izzard is terrific!","review":"I had this in VHS format a long time ago and finally decided to upgrade to the DVD version.

I think I own them all now. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eddie at his best!","review":"This is my favourite stand up routine by Eddie, I think it's hilarious and very witty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eddie is tired","review":"If you think a guy dressed in drag pontificating about generic topics is hilarious and entertaining then by all means buy this DVD. I personally thought this was a tired performance that lacked originality or spark. I think Eddie is a strange person and does not compare to the wit or comic energy of Robin Williams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why wasn't the flag bit included? Love Eddie, DVD Ok","review":"This guy is the funniest human on the planet. I really missed the flag part of his act though, which is NOT included here.

I love this guy! His humor is priceless! This was my first exposure to Mr. Executive Transvestite and I became an instant fan. His blend of personal experience, intelligent wit and hysterical take on history and religion (Hello? Jeezy Creezy!) is an absolute must have for any lover of British humor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious! Love the Squirrel!","review":"If Eddie Izzard doesn't get more widespread attention, it would be a great loss to the comedic world. He has a sense of humor that is unbelievable (for those of you who haven't seen Dress to Kill, keep an ear out for the squirrel bit, trust me!), and a comedian hasn't made me laugh this hard since Robin Williams : Live and Uncensored. He is a genuine comedy gem and will hopefully have a much longer and even more successful career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughed until I cried","review":"I was just flipping through the channels last night when I came across this comedy special on HBO.

We own all of his DVD's and we consider this his best performance ever. Definitely for adults, and hysterically funny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Split your side open","review":"This is the funniest man (not just transvestite) alive. He is just so hilarious that you have to own the DVD to catch everything. You spend so much time laughing you miss have the jokes. Not only is he funny in English, but the french language Eddie is just as great, even if you don't understand a damn word he is saying you still laugh until you side hurts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comic extraordinaire","review":"I was introduced to Eddie Izzard's unique brand of humor a month ago. Some may be shocked by his appearance but once you get past that (less than a minute) his brand of intelligent humor is unbeatable. I had to actually pause the DVD to catch my breath! The \\"Executive\\" transvestite is a cut above anything I have ever seen. WARNING: Intelligent humor, some people may be offended by intelligence!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than you think!","review":"I also had originally passed on the HBO special, but my husband didn't. I heard him laughly hysterically at this show that I had to see what was funny! I admit, this \\"Executive Transvestite\\" was quite hilarious! I found the more I watched, the more I laughed. The more I watched, the more educated I got! It's like sitting through a history class, only with alot of humor to make things more interesting. Eddie is definitely one of a kind!!!! I highly recommended this special for anyone living in the US who has not already seen it. I can hardly wait for this to be available for purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny the nth time around","review":"I would like to echo one of the comments of a fellow Eddie Izzard fan, \\"some other stand up comedians are funny the first time around, Eddie's funnier the second time you see him\\". This is so true, i watch him almost every weekend just to get a good laugh or i need a break. There are times i catch myself replaying and replaying a particular spiel of his in my head for a given day, one day its \\"Britain hiding India and a group of other countries behind their back\\" or \\"the Settlers running to the Native Americans for food during winter\\".Another thing i like about Eddie Izzard, and this particular show is that most stand up comedy's have use the same jokes. I've heard one too many jokes about Easter and Jesus Christ and Bunny Rabbits and chocolate eggs. His version i feel is the best.Go out and buy this DVD! i juts ordered the Eddie Izzard DVD bundle of Amazon and i hope its just as good as Dress to Kill!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cake or Death?","review":"A close friend of mine introduced me to Eddie Izzard several years ago via a cassette tape of his stand-up. Upon examining the case, I almost dismissed him thinking a man in full make-up and feminine clothing couldn't possibly produce a brand of humor which would amuse me. Oh I was so wrong! I laughed out loud for over an hour and then listened to the tape again and again on that 13-hour trip. Time flies too fast and unfortunately, Izzard's existence was striken from my mind in a blur of final exams and new jobs. Until about a year ago, when a late night TV bonanza had my boyfriend and I near coma, we stumbled upon an HBO presentation of Dress to Kill. Easily one of the top five comedians of this era, Izzard will have you laughing hysterically, out loud--even if you are alone. He manages to comment on a variety of topics from religion to star wars to make-up. He is witty and thankfully well-versed in both current affairs as well as history. Buy this DVD, you will not regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny!","review":"I thought his HBO show was hilarious so I loved that I could find it here exactly the was i saw it on the tube."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nearly had a stroke laughing so hard","review":"I'm late to the \\"Eddie Izzard as stand up comic\\" party. I'd seen him in Velvet Goldmine, the George Clooney Oceans movies, and known he was in The Riches and The United States of Tara. But... nothing prepared me for the hysterical, insane comic genius of his stand up act, which a friend of mine introduced me to by loaning me her DVD. He's absolutely brilliant, and what's more, it's smart stand-up. He creates comedy about history and the origins of religion, where most stand up comics are making pathetic jokes about their penises. There's no racist or sexist humor, it's just hysterical comedy, intelligently written and beautifully delivered."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Eddie","review":"Dress to KillI've been looking for this DVD forever. I saw this show when it was released on HBO. It won't disapoint! All I can really say is your going to need a flag, a little splashy, splashy. Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wins the Oscar for best makeup!","review":"One of the best things in life is great humor, and Eddie is at the top of my list after catching his \\"Dressed To Kill,\\" on HBO. Many people have already given on-the-mark reviews, so I'll skip the specifics of what makes this video so funny. Suffice to say that whenever I need to raise my spirits with a great belly laugh, I pop in this video. There are a few benefits to watching Eddie on video: 1. You can rewind and watch it again and again and again. 2. You can turn on closed captioning and catch every word. 3. You get close-ups of Eddies facial expressions which are priceless. It is one of the best parts of his comedy--his subtle body language. It gets funnier every time I watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have been great if I got what I ordered...","review":"I received a different DVD in the \\"Dress to Kill\\" case!

This whole show is him rambling semi-coherently until he chances upon one of his rehearsed and \\"supposed to be funny\\" lines which is punctuated by canned laughter. The time I cut myself with kitchen knife while doing the dishes and bled all over the place was infinitely more funny than this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing, a flash in the pan","review":"After \\"Glorious\\" and \\"Unrepeatable\\", this comes as a major disappointment. Izzard is capable of so much better than the materal presented here. I got the distinct impression that he was \\"dumbing down\\" his act for an American audience, i.e., much of this seems downright patronizing. For example, the Englebert Humperdink and Heimlich Manuever material is painfully unfunny right from the start, and it's inclusion seems to be soley for the reason that even Americans will have heard of them.The first 20 minutes has some decent laughs, but then Eddie loses the plot and bumbles along for the remainder of the show.To be fair, all of Eddie's shows tend to be hit-or-miss. On a good night, he's quite literally glorious, on a bad night he's merely diverting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I bought this based on the excellent reviews and was very disappointed.We played it at a gathering and no one wanted to continue the DVD after the first 8-10 minutes"},{"rating":"1","title":"Even he seemed bored","review":"I was told how brilliant this humorous DVD was... \\"like Monty Python.\\" Uh, no, not at all. I love Python and I do get most of British humor. Too many jokes were just flat and not really clever (half the time he says \\"and that one didn't go over well\\") and I didn't really think that very many bits were all that clever. This isn't close to being in the same league as Python. Perhaps this guy is funnier but the material was very bland and he seemed bored. This is not even close to Pythonesque and to compare is an insult. Perhaps the great ratings are a result of a cult following of teenagers. If you are really interested, you'll be glad you rented it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not make me laugh enough","review":"It wasn't what I was expecting.

We STILL go around the house quoting phrases from it. Hilariousness abounds!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cake or Death?","review":"Like many others, I stumbled across this man's comedy routine one night while watching HBO. Absolutely hilarious! Instead of repeating what many others have said, such as how he appeals to many kinds of people and his humor is better the more you watch it, I will mention my personal favorite line.Comparing the English with the Americans:\\"You say basil (with a long \\"a\\"), we say basil (with a short \\"a\\"). You say herb (\\"h\\" silent), we say herb (\\"h\\" pronounced) because there's a [edit] H in it.\\" All rolled off so smoothly it takes you a second, then you're rolling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!!","review":"Love Seinfeld, think Jeff Foxworthy is great... I am absolutely mesmerized by Eddie!I took a chance from the reviews on this site and purchased the DVD without ever hearing of him before. I turned around and purchased two more of his CDs within weeks.The opening with the streetcar scene in San Fran (sorry, \\"The City\\") is so droll, wonderful! I could just listen to his lovely British accent all day. However, his facial expressions and movements on stage are what really make me laugh. I watch this DVD over and over again, never tiring of it. I am so glad that I have discovered Eddie Izzard!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"1 star? Really? That's just nuts!","review":"I just got done reading some of the 1 star reviews for this DVD. Maybe those people were feeling depressed that day? Maybe you weren't in the mood for brilliance?Honestly, ignore the people behind the 1 star curtain. This DVD is HIL-AR-I-OUS. I don't even know how to speak French and I laughed my a$$ off at the French bit. THAT's comedy genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top-notch Wit","review":"His bits, while not always gut-wrenchingly funny, are always entertaining. Izzard really knows how to stimulate the audience's imagination, and it seems like at least half of his material is being created while on stage. This, of course, is most likely not the case. However, it speaks to his genius. Pay special attention to his Star Wars and Church of England routines. Good Stuff. \\"Do you have a flag?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm totally in love with Eddie Izzard","review":"A friend of mine, who used to have his own radio show interviewing stand up comics (Len Belzer) - showed me \\"Dress to Kill.\\" I was completely blown away. Eddie Izzard is truly a comic genius, the best stand up working today, the smartest, funniest, most unique, insightful, lovable, adorable, talented, he's GREAT, BEYOND great.I was walking down the street with a friend of mine after I saw it and I said - do you know Eddie Izzard? And we immediately went into twenty minutes of \\"Humperdink\\" and did half the bits and then ran home to watch it again. Everyone must own a copy of this DVD and then give it to every one of their friends.I love you, Eddie. You live across the street from my best friend.

There are laugh out loud moments nearly all the time and even having watched it more than a dozen times now it I still find it funny. Even when the material isn't that funny (which it can't be 100% of the time for everyone) I always find Eddie Izzard interesting to listen to. Underlying his comedy is an intelligent and thoughtful man.There are some good extra's, particularly if you speak French (as Izzard does)! Many of his shows are worth buying but this DVD catches him at a comedy peak. Sadly since then the shows have not been of the same quality but this one and the ones that precede it are all worth getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"This is very funny.

As usual, Eddie walked on stage looking very sexie-sexie, in those fanTAHbulous shoes! The show is a smorgasbord of anecdotes, history and sharp humor. Eddie brushes upon some horrid facts, yet somehow make them sound so hysterically humorous with his delivery. Simply put, this man is a comic genius! PLUS!!!

He has a comment for nearly every major issue facing the modern world and puts it in such a way that is laugh-out-loud funny. This is one of the best stand-up acts of all time as far as I am concerned."},{"rating":"2","title":"so... yeah","review":"Forget the makeup. Ignore the heels. Just let one of the funniest men on the planet make you laugh until you pee.Izzard covers the gamut on this DVD: Stonehenge to WWII, Scooby Doo to the Heimlich maneuver. He does impressions (well, two). The encore is in French!Unlike most comedians who come onto the scene with a bang and then spend the rest of their careers trying to live up to their earlier work, Izzard keeps his material fresh and funny. His earlier shows are on par with the new ones. If anything, his newer stuff is better.So if you're wondering what all the fuss is about, this DVD is an absolutely perfect introduction to Eddie Izzard.Trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cake or Death...","review":"I write this to try and gain viewers, concert goers and video buyers, so that Amazon will offer the entire collection of Izzard tapes.

You will be hooked and all that will be left to say is...Cake please!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone (or almost) will love this!","review":"Eddie Izzard is my favorite performer - I was going to say \\"comedian\\", but he is way beyond that! He's educated - or is it just that he's from \\"the place where the history comes from\\" - and although his comedy certainly contains the f- word, it is so much less offensive when he says it that I brought this in to show my Latin 4 class.

He helped me remember facts for my AP European History Exam, which I passed, so yes parents, this is very educational. Perhaps he is my mentor and comedic hero. This DVD is quite awesome. His little intros are always soooo cool. My favorite intro is in \\"Glorious.\\" I have \\"Circle\\", \\"Glorious\\", and this one, \\"Dress to Kill\\" and this one just beats them by a second.

He needs to lose weight, so I thought I'd give this ball a try. He's usually a pretty smart cat, but it took him a few weeks to figure out the ball. Once he did figure it out, he didn't chase it around as I had hoped, but rather he just hit it into a corner and bounced it around there, thereby circumnavigating running around after the ball. Even when I pulled it back to an open area, he still found ways to do minimal effort to get the food out of the ball. For now I am going to work on devising another plan for him to get his exercise. It's not the ball's fault, so I'm giving 4 stars (it works as described), but didn't give a full 5 stars because my cat found a work-around to using it for exercise so it isn't quite doing its job."},{"rating":"2","title":"My small dog loves it!","review":"Purchased this ball for my cat and my small dog loved it! My cat is too lazy to paw the ball around to receive his treat. I guess it would work if your cat is very, very food oriented. Unfortunately, my cat could care less. However, after showing my Chihuahua how to paw the ball around to receive treats, she could not leave the ball alone. She actually begs for the ball when I get it out! I place a small amount of treats in the ball and she has fun chasing the ball around for about 15 minutes or so. I love how you can adjust the hole size. I also like how the ball does not unscrew. Instead you take of the bottom and fill with treats. My dog picks up the ball using the bottom piece so it stays closed pretty well. It's a great way to keep my hyper dog entertained. Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My cat couldn't figure out how to get food out.","review":"My poor cat wasn't able to figure out how to get food out of the ball.

She tends to scarf her food and often vomits as a result. She's also experiencing obesity, in spite of proper diet, simply because she is sedentary.It did not take her long at all to figure this out -- not to mention, we had a great time laughing at her method of discovery. All it took was one roll across the floor from us for her to figure out that, \\"Hey, I can get food out of this!\\"We have it set at the smallest opening, and only one piece comes out at a time of her small kibble. I'd say for every good roll she gives it, she gets 2-3 pieces of kibble.This accomplished just what the vet ordered -- cutting back on her food and increasing her exercise.I just ordered a second ball, so that we can have one in the dishwasher while one is feeding her."},{"rating":"2","title":"My little dude loves it","review":"I have a 6 year old cat on prescription diet...he can't switch over to a weight loss diet and doesn't need to gain any more weight. Being very vocal at meal times and very food motivated, he figured out the food distributor ball pretty much immediately. It's great for incorporating mental stimulation and physical activity at dry kibble meal times. As other reviewers have mentioned, it works quite well to keep him from wolfing down (and then vomiting) his food. The mechanism for adjusting the openings for food distribution is easy to use and can be set at many size increments. The ball is easy to clean and air dry, and it seems very sturdy. Definitely a great deal for under $6."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Cat New Tricks","review":"I was going to buy an automatic feeder, when I saw this one, it is half the price and does more for my cat. He is a \\"Scarfer\\" and this slows him down with the added benefit of working for his food. He use to just lie down in front of his bowl and eat everything in ten minutes -now it takes several trips around the living room and an hour or so depending on if he stops. I would say this is not a very good option for a \\"Causal\\" or \\"Grazer\\" eating style. You can pop it in the dishwasher very nice feature. I wish there were a couple more options with the dispensing holes, but what is there does work fine. I am happy with it and will continue to use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting","review":"This is an interesting toy.

The vet said to give her only dry food, so I have one \\"light\\" variety in her bowl at all times, and the other \\"light\\" variety in two of these balls. It gives her a choice, and she spends a lot of time rolling the balls around, eating the \\"treats\\" that drop out. It must work, because she's stopped gaining weight in the past year and a half since I bought the first two balls. I bought another ball for my sister's cats for Christmas, and she keeps her Greenies in them.

I'm considering getting another so I don't have to worry about food bowls anymore. It's easy to operate. Other feedback says its hard to twist for the settings but I didn't find that problem at all.

She's unusual in that she won't touch people food, and the only food she'll eat that's offered to her outside of her food dish is an occasional cat food \\"treat.\\" (She's not picky about her food, but obviously feels it belongs in her dish and not on the floor in other areas of the house.)

I had hoped it would be good for our overactive Siamese kitten. When she did push it around, she scattered food all over the house, but wouldn't eat it. I also wanted our elderly British Shorthair to use it for stimulation. She totally ignored it, even though I didn't give her any alternative food. Since both of our cats are at ideal weight to slim, I hated to leave them without food too long to try this out. I really hated the mess, as the food seemed to pour out, or not come out at all. Right now it sits in their toy box and once in a while the Siamese bats it around the house, so I guess it's not a total loss. As a feeder, however, it didn't work for our cats."},{"rating":"2","title":"For my Tubby Tabby...","review":"We bought this item in the hopes that it would simultaneously get our \\"large\\" cat some exercise, and get him to leave us alone when he's hungry long before feeding time.

Currently, my cat is eating Wellness Core (a very small kibble) or Wysong Epigen (which is even smaller!)This item has a major design flaw and thus is NOT appropriate for smaller kibble. The food pours out of the 3 holes all at once and does not slow down her feeding at all! Instead, the ball should be adjustable so that only one hole is open at a time and even the one hole should be adjustable to 1/3 of its size, which it is not.Mission not accomplished. Incompatible with small kibble. Will try another product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Flaw...","review":"Used this twice - it worked ok. The kitties didn't immediately get the hang of it, but I think they were starting to figure it out. We'll never know - because it is in the trash!

I figured I could put some dry cat food in it and he'd have to \\"work\\" to get it. I got two of them so my other cat could have one too. What I found was that the Less Hungry Cat would nudge the ball and the Hungry Cat would gobble the food.

It just didn't happen to work for my three cats, two of whom are 3 and one of whom is 10. It has mostly resulted in me playing soccer with the ball while the cats watch. Little pellets of kitty food are sprinkled all over the floor, which the cats refuse to eat no matter how hungry they are because, you know, they're cats. I do think if you started your young cat out with this, it might be successful. But then, young cats are typically getting enough exercise already.

I don't know if she was in a tizzy about something or not but I stopped using it for a while and try to switch it up now. I also had to get 2 of these because there would be times that I couldn't find the ball because it would end up in the other room.

Now, I alternate between the treat ball and hiding treats, to keep him on his toes! He will push it around with his nose and head or bat it with his paws. Once it is empty he will bat it really hard, almost as if he is mad that it is empty. It is fun to watch. And all the reviews about how hard it is to open and the instructions being inside. Hello - you twist the little top off and it opens right up - not rocket Science! :) You do have to play around with the sizing of the openings based on your food or treat size.

The holes in the sides of the ball, while adjustable, are still too big and thus allowing the treats or food to fall out too easy. The point of the ball is to grab cats attention and have them play with it and have treats or food randomly fall out. I filled it with food to test it out and closed the holes to the smallest setting. My cat played with it and with one hit all of the food fell out onto the floor. My cat then ate all the food and had no further interest in the ball because was empty. I am not happy with this product at all and would look for another similar toy if looking for a ball toy dispenser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design","review":"Great idea, poor execution. The ball is cheaply made, the \\"locking tab\\" slips under the lip causing the ball to come apart. There is a gap between the two halves. The smallest possible setting on the size of the dispensing holes is too large for normal cat kibble. Will work for dog-sized kibble, but ball is far too flimsy to stand up to a dog. I purchased the fun kitty Egg cersizer next, and it was much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay for now","review":"My two cats took to this toy immediately, but on day one, I see that the build quality may not be that great. The screw cap where you put in the kibble becomes loose after the cats play with it. It hasn't come off yet during play, but it's really only a matter of time. The mechanism to adjust the aperture to release the kibble is also very flimsy, and doesn't hold the exact setting....so this means that more food could fall out fast or that no food could fall out at all. I like the concept, and this has come closest to what I'm looking for, but the execution could have been handled better.

This item stops the binging, and does not bother her older \\"sister\\" who never had an eating issue. Get these in differing colors, the favorite of our cats is the pink food ball. Easy to fill, several settings to dispense dry food, and it works! Do not expect the cats to fall in love with this right away, in fact, our binge eater kept begging for her old dishes back for over a week. I would take her to the food ball, roll some food out of it, and then walk away each time, she eventually understood that the dish was never coming back. Patience is key, as with all pet training.

(see picture)I picked up a few of these food distributor balls and a couple Bergan Turbotracks from Amazon and created a little area to contain the food ball, so you don't end up stepping on kibble as the ball gets pushed around who knows where.The distributor ball is plastic, but its dishwasher safe, brainless easy to use, durable, adjustable, and takes seconds to fill as you just twist the top off and scoop it right into your bag of kibble, no need to measure since you can just fill it half-way or full and easily know how much you're feeding. =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just made a mess","review":"The kibble we use is pretty small so we had to adjust the holes so that only a few pieces would dribble out at a time.

Fat cat has lost a couple of ounces in the past month, middle cat is maintaining her weight, and scardy cat is getting his fair share of the food now. Everybody took to the SlimCat balls pretty quickly- fat cat sulked for a couple of weeks, but would reluctantly use the balls to eat. Now, a month later, he goes right for it.

He will eat until he throws up if given the chance. He scarfs his meals and then runs over to eat my other cat's food. It has been annoying having to wait around for cat #2 to finish eating, or having to lock them in separate rooms for meals. That's where the food ball came in. My cat took to it in seconds. He knew his food was in there rattling around and it clicked for him immediately. This video is actually his first time using it, and he successfully ate the whole meal this way. With cat #2 safely eating his dinner from his bowl and cat #1 preoccupied with his new food ball, they finished at the same time and no food was stolen!

It's the only way I serve dry food.I followed the written instructions and started out with the holes on the large size. As they got the hang of it, I gradually decreased the size of the opening. Now they have to work to get their food. Plus my one cat can't binge (and then vomit) like she's prone to do.The first time you try to open the balls, it's a little confusing (the instructions come inside the ball). Open the ball by turning the end that says multivet.

For those of you who gave up after a few days, i can understand the frustration, but you might have success with more patience. Note, we certainly removed all other sources of food, but this does not mean we starved the cat as demonstrating the toy in front of the cat obviously spits out food. We also started the ball on the easiest setting and left it there until the cat seemed pretty confident. The first cat learned the trick with repeated demonstration after perhaps a day. The second cat failed to understand for a while. However, over eight days time with too many demonstrations and too much coaxing to count up, the cat finally figured it out. And it is so worth it!

I would recommend this to any cat owner - even a small dog owner (smaller than a Pug)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"So I have a very healthy sized cat. My vet says she is too healthy and could lose some weight. Well giving her less food just made her whine. I found this food ball. It is tiny.

I can adjust hole size much more precisely than I expected, and the size is locked in place once selected - altogether a simple but intelligent design. Also easy to fill and clean.

Holds a decent amount of food and provides nice entertainment while helping to cut down on overeating while not making a mess. I (and my cats) would like it a lot better if it was much smaller and made of a soft rubber type, chewable material rather than semi-transparent, hard plastic, but on the whole both the felines and I are very pleased and I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.

Then with a full belly, he goes back to sleep.

My cat (a Maine Coon) weighed almost 30lbs at the time I received this item (a Christmas gift from concerned extended family members!). He was used to getting dry food whenever he wanted, but after a few days, he acclimatized to how it's going to be from here on out: roll the ball. I can't say that he's lost weight since using this ball, but he definitely eats LESS food, and the food bits that come out of the holes seem to be more valuable to him as they hit the floor. (I have tile floors, which may make a difference in performance.)The ball does what it's supposed to do: deliver food only when the pet plays with it.

He figured it out in seconds on an easier setting; now I'm gradually increasing the difficulty to make it slightly more challenging each day. *Please note- ferrets should never be fed primary food this way, only treats or \\"secondary kibble\\".

It's hard to think of a hard rock/metal band that put out such a pile of garbage after some strong albums. Perhaps the Scorpions', Savage Amusement is in the same league. First of all, Krokus again go the route of the cover tune. This time the Alice Cooper classic \\"School's Out\\" gets the Swiss treatment. It's okay, but hardly innovative. After this tune, however, there's not a decent song here. Synth drivel, & boring, dumb lyrics. The guitar playing is weak, which doesn't matter because it's buried under the syntho-slop. Marc Storace puts in a half-hearted effort vocally. It's as if the band knew this thing was bad from the start.

There have been many stories written about the hardships mariners face at sea, but very few capture story like this book. If you want to understand the challenges of command at sea you need to read this book.RADM Terry McKnight, USN (Ret)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Resource for Writing Biz, Not the Best for Erotica","review":"If you're looking, as I was, for a book specifically as a guide for breaking into and excelling in the world of writing erotica/porn, buy Katy Terrega's book (It's a Dirty Job...Writing Porn for Fun and Profit). In addition, buy Susie's to add to your general writing resource library. Besides, an unexpected and unwanted amount of this book being devoted to the history of erotic literature and women's lib, it IS a great source for general insiders' info on the publishing industry, marketing your material, and what it takes to be a success as an author. Susie covered the \\"other end\\" of the writing biz that most writers avoid or don't want to share the secrets and challenges of.

Reading it or publishing it, yes, but she's not any kind of expert on writing it, or even editing it -- she puts together a yearly \\"Best of\\" book of previously published stories, edited by other people.

Unfortunately, the content organization is somewhat confusing--and the sheer size of the book makes it fairly difficult to find what you're looking for.The contents have so many hints and tips that every programmer will learn something. I've been using Crystal Reports for many years, and reading through the book I would frequently learn little tips or timesaving processes.I might note, however, that several of the examples are specific to certain database platforms or certain report implementation methods. For example, I didn't have easy access to SQL Server while reading the book, so testing out some of the examples was nearly impossible.Nevertheless, one of the best Crystal Reports XI references available on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite reference","review":"I really like this book. it not only helps answer thing but makes suggestion and gives real world scenerios at end of a chapter. I use it mostly for a reference tool as chapters 1-11 pertain to CR XI report creation part, which is what I need refresh on the most.

The plot itself was bizarre and incoherant, and the additional characters they added to make it run were completely flat and uninteresting, even by video game standards. One in particular -- whose name I shall not name out of respect for spoilers -- was enough in one package to flush out any interest I might have had for the story. As a fan of Fullmetal Alchemist, I hated this game. As a fan of fighting and roleplaying games, I hated this game.

I don't read Japanese, but I would assume that Murakami doesn't write as clumsily as some of _South of the Border..._ comes off as. What happened to Jay Rubin and Alfred Birnbaum, two excellent translators? Despite that, a fine book. I wouldn't say it's Murakami's best, but it's excellent by any measure."},{"rating":"2","title":"mellow Murakami","review":"This is like all of Murakami's books in that it is devoured easily - and over too soon. I was excited to read Murakami stripped bare of fantastical elements - eager to read a purely 'humanist' novel from Murakami - an insight into the male experience of relationships and women in Japan. While I was reading it - I felt warm and comforted by the blanket of excellent Murakami writing...but in the end..I feel a sense of disappointment in the portrayal of women and relationships - where women are silent mysterious almost vaporous creatures...which men latch onto to fulfill their desire for sexual mysticism - without needing a 'person' to go along with this. In this sense - these deep silent relationships left an empty aftertaste. Yet if this is an honest portrayal of marriage and affairs in Japan then it is also honest and perhaps meant to be distressing and unflattering of the modern male."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unremarkable","review":"Usually a book evokes some sort of reaction in you whether it be minor or major, but I was surprised to discover a book so unremarkable I was left with no reaction at all. The simple writing style I found quite dull, though I suppose his technique might have been lost in the translation. As for the story, it's a nice enough idea - pining for something you can't have - but you need a fair deal of tension and evocative writing in order to convey the anguish of lost love, and I'm afraid this book just doesn't have it. I've read the other reviews and many other people have commented that a) this is one of the worst of the author's works and b) that the story has many loose ends. Well, I haven't read many of his other books so I can't comment on his talent as a writer, but it is true that the story has many loose ends. However, you care so little for the characters you don't care about the unexplained aspects. Easily forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I read the Wind Up Bird Cronicle and absolutely adored it.

Don't let any personal attachment you have Mr. Murakami's other wonderful novels convince you to give this one a chance. It stinks. The most boring of male fantasies. It stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretension at its finest","review":"This book's only good point is that it's a quick read. I found the protagonist shallow, overly sentimental, but most importantly, static. While his journey through the cliched upper middle class man's midlife crisis translates easily from Japanese to American culture, perhaps the reason I should empathize with him was lost along the way. Hajime grapples with obstacles and problems that everyone experiences, but his inability to learn from anything, to form an attachment to people in his life or a moral compass repels me.If you want something fluffy, exotic, sexy, and sentimental, if your suspension of disbelief is amazing and you don't care too much about the likability or depth of your characters, maybe you'd enjoy this book. Otherwise, I'd suggest picking something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"love is this dull?","review":"I completely cannot understand how Murakami gets away with peddling his superficial characters and their trivial interactions as narratives worthy of a literate reader's time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not up to Murakami's standards","review":"I am a big Murakami fan, so was expecting a high level of writing as in 1Q84 or Wind-up Bird Chronicle. While Murakami continues to impress with his style, this is yet another of his explorations into middle-aged, male angst over life and lost love. The theme of boy losing girl then finding her years later (a la 1Q84) is a bit styale and the novel contains little of the magical thinking Murakami is known for. The translation is not as good as those by Jay Rubin."},{"rating":"2","title":"First love","review":"The main character, Hajime, forms a strong bond with Shimamoto when they are both 12 years old. He looses track of her and continues his life. He continues to look for her while he develops his life. They finally have the opportunity to get together, but he would have to throw everything away to be with her. The story has an interesting conclusion. As with other Murakami books there is a lot of reference to music. Murakami examines the dimensions of love in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"my kind of story","review":"South of the border, west of the sun is my first Murakami's novel I have read. Since then I read this story over and over again. This seems to be very personal story to the author himself. The main character Hajime carrys on his love for his first girl friend for 20 years and he could never once forget about her. This might seem unrealistic and obssesive but ,to me, this is reality and sanity itself. I am offen surprised by stories of people that could get over their old love so easily and find new one in a short time. I wonder how true was thier love and how sepcial they were to each other. However, the main character Hajime also hurts his second girl friend Izumi unrecoverablely and after He lost Simamoto at last, he gradually forgets even about her. In this story, I could see how he lives intensely and looses powerlessly. It is sad but worth to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"South of the Border, West of the sun","review":"I couldn't stop to loving this book when I read it at the very beginning time, in fact, I like all the books of Mr. Murakami. His books always give me a wonderful reading time, When reading his books, all the words are organizing an unknown world which attract me to to see what on earth people can give up things like that way, or indifferent to the social rules. It may not suitable for those pestimistic people, but it is very good for people who want to find some words to help him out of desprate."},{"rating":"2","title":"A love story with wonderful loose ends -- imagine that.","review":"The ultimate story of a man growing up -- issues of love, money, and responsibility are prominent in this novel. It's also a strange love story: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, man meets woman, man loses woman.This is probably the most mainstream book Murakami has written to date. Many loose ends, but I wonder -- is it sometimes better to leave loose ends with stories? It's kind of like what H.P. Lovecraft did with the cthulu stories -- all you see is the monsters' shadows; it leaves a more powerful impression in the end.In any case, nothing is ever easy in Murakami's world -- especially the matters of the heart. Nothing is ever quite resolved, but hey, that's kind of like life, isn't it? It's funny that even though Murakami writes more fantastic stories than most folks, his endings are quite ground in reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey, where's the rest of it?","review":"Frankly, this is only half a book. Too many plot lines are left unanswered. I'm all for some things being left to the reader's imagination, but hey, throw me a freakin' bone here.

A quick read, but more suited to the beach in summer, and not literature.Symbolism is heavy-handed. His life is the desert, and Shimamoto is water. She only appears in his bar when it rains. The author feels the need to point this out to the reader.When Hajime's wife discovers his infidelity she earnestly proclaims that she only wants him to be happy, and if he wishes, he can take everything, even their children. Right. Even cultural differences do not allow for this over the top male fantasy to be credible.I don't understand why this book has been so well-reviewed. Maybe it is a romance novel written for men. Guys--there's lots of this stuff out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"hopefully, it was just filler","review":"Three things draw me to Murakami's works: 1. his beautiful prose, simplistic yet flowing 2. his dreamlike plots 3. his fatalistic characters<i>South of the Border</i> is bereft of all these traits, or rather displays them in an alarmingly facile manner. Earlier works like <i>The Wind Up Bird Chronicle</i> and <i>The Great Sheep Chase</i> (esp. the former!) were the kinds of books that left me thinking about the characters each time I put them down, sometimes even causing me to feel like my reality wasn't quite... real (you know that hyperrealistic feeling you get when you've immersed yourself in an engaging story that's set far outside of your normal purview). This one left me thinking, \\"If this is what we can expect from Murakami in the future, it's time to move on to another author.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Still very Murakami","review":"On the surface this may appear to be an un-Murakami work. However, it is more like viewing a classical figure sketch by Picasso rather than a work from his \\"blue\\" period or from his better known cubism work--it is still a Picasso.What is still very Murakami about this work is whether the mysterious women he meets up with at his bar is someone he really is meeting or is this all within the head of his everyman.This work demonstrates that Murakami can tell a story that is not replete with devices and intricite flights of fantasy; and yet take us introspectively to the tension between serenity and banality of what appears outwardly to be the model of a successful life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...","review":"Certainly not his best work.

In most of his books, Haruki's main character is aimless and the magic of his books is in what happens to the character, not the character himself. It seems that Haruki wants you to like the main character in this book, but unfortunatly he's just not very likeable. Still, though I liked reading it, but if you have not read Haruki before I suggest not reading this one first. Try \\"A Wild Sheep Chase\\". There are too many loose ends to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"say what?","review":"Murakami is a master author. his talent, however, is wasted on this hackneyed plot. After a string of masterpieces that astound and push the envelope of literature, Murakami retreats into a soft-porn world of rehashed characters. It seems that he is afraid to excercize himself. This book is something I would expect from a writer like Danielle Steele, not a master craftsman like Murakami. The talent is still visible through the haze of predictability, though, leaving hope that forthcoming books will return to his previous standards of excellence."},{"rating":"1","title":"This emperor has no clothes","review":"I can't fathom how this book could rate so many 5-star reviews. It was a nicely-wrapped bit of soft-porn fluff. It reminded me of another prettily-packaged piece of cotton candy from 5 years ago, The Bridges of Madison County. I felt the story line was weak and unrealistic (obsessed by a friend from 7th grade? Hey, buddy boy, get a life!), the writing style -- or translation -- incredibly juvenile, all of which led to a non-ending. Having read these reviews before buying the book, I truly anticipated a great reading experience.

I can tell you right now that this game is way worse than any Blizzard RTS you can find, the missions are way to easy, the armies are just clones, some heroes level up way faster than others and the cinematics are just HIDEOUS !!!I'm really desapointed by this game I expected a huge change since all the complains from BFME I but I guess EA never listens (NFSU anyone ?).So, if you're a huge Tolkien fan consider this game, if you're a serious RTS fan the buy Medieval II and the expansion and finally if you're a cinematic fan then try Command and Conquer 3 (which has some nice movie-like cinematics)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good game","review":"I was impressed with the graphics even in the up close mode.

The book has a very large number of incomplete sentences, as well as an annoying number of complete sentences that do not make any sense. In other words, the book could have used a better editor. On top of that, the characters in the book are rather poorly fleshed out: they are rather cartoonish, paper-thin, cardboard cut-outs and none of them stand out as remarkable or even rememberable. To tell the truth, it required an act of will to finish reading the book: several times I resisted the urge to give up.If left with nothing to read, I would read this book.

But it was under $3 on sale and had some good reviews, so I decided to risk it and went ahead and bought it. I think I'm glad I did. I like the length of the workout. The 35-40 min workouts have their place, but I like to work out for longer than that some days. Allison's instruction and cueing are very good. I found it to be a fairly challenging workout, especially when working with the loop. The steps were difficult for me to master the first time out, but that has been the case with other Firm workouts, and I've generally found that if I do it a few times, I'll get the steps down. All in all, a solid addition to my library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Quiet","review":"I'm a big fan of the firm videos but this one never get's played because the volume of the background music is barely louder than a whisper.

I work out an hour or more daily, most days are total body workout classes or DVDs. I've tried this one about 6-7 times and find it extremely frustrating due to all the fancy footwork. The instructor changes the moves quickly too, and doesn't explain the move, just jumps into it - both arms and legs. She has some fancy terms for her moves, and if you're a dancer, they may be familiar. I never took dance other than ballroom, so perhaps that is why I cannot figure them out. Too bad there is not a tutorial on all the dance moves as a bonus feature, because the workout moves are way too fast to learn them. I never thought of myself as uncoordinated until I got this DVD. I wanted to get a workout, but I feel like half the time I need to run in place because she loses me - NOT because I am not fit enough. I don't recommend this video to people unless they are trained dancers."},{"rating":"2","title":"good workout","review":"Let me start by saying that I really like Allison's workouts - her cueing is always very precise and she is, in my opinion, a very likeable and motivating instructor.However, I have a bit of a problem with the cardio section of this particular routine. I have to be quite careful when it comes to high impact moves and this workout has a lot of those. If I follow Allison and do all of them I can feel my knees acting up but I get a decent workout. If I follow the modifications shown my knees are safe but I burn only 100-150 kcal on average, which is not too good for 55 min spent exercising. I can only hope it will get better or that I'll come up with some better ways of modifying the moves.Otherwise it is a very good workout, I really liked the sculpting section with the ( provided ) band. 55 mins go by without you noticing it, but if you don't have time you can choose one of the premixed shorter workouts. Great idea!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Dangerous Curves Ahead is a great addition to my Firm collection. The instructor is an excellent cuer, explains better than most (except maybe Karen Voight) what you should be doing when performing the moves and motivates you without being overly sugary. The Firm Loop is cool. Felt a little awkward because I've never used anything like it before, but I adjusted pretty quickly. I'm very happy I bought this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best yet!!!!","review":"This is Allisons best yet.

The cardio has some fun, unique moves I really enjoy. The problem I have with it is that the performers other than Alison aren't very nice to watch. One seems to have a deformity of her belly and it is very distracting and unpleasant. One of the performers looks like a skeleton with hair and the other two are chubby. I like to watch performers who look like they have improved their bodies by doing the workout - that helps motivate me. Watching these women is very discouraging."},{"rating":"2","title":"FirmBand","review":"Alison does a great job of instruction in this workout. She allows plenty of time to get the band on and the steps are easy to follow. It's a great workout and I've definitely seen the benefit of adding a band to my regime. My only complaint is the band rolls sometimes, but I think all exercise bands do that..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout, bad music","review":"As usual, the Firm will get your heart rate going, but the music in this is really annoying. The workout is ok, but there are so many jumps, bounces, and calf pumps, it gets old pretty fast. I don't think this is one of those DVDs I'll do over and over again. It's just a little too repetitive. Also, maybe it's just the copy I have (though it shouldn't be, I bought it new) but the video quality is terrible. I was stunned to read this was made in 2008. It looks like it was shot in the 80s and the video quality is grainy and fuzzy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dangerous curves","review":"The DVD is really good, make you work out a lot. The only thing I have little problem is that goes too fast, fast pace and somtimes when she changes to another routine I am still working on the first one.I prefer to select which exercesis I am going to do rather than doing the whole DVD is very long although you get to swet, but still have good results. It is funny when the instructor says \\"Listen\\" very serious hahaI recommend this DVD if you like to work out hard.Silvia"},{"rating":"1","title":"So So Mediocre Movie","review":"I was disappointed by the movie: The plot was lethargic and implausible and the acting by Roberts was so-so. While it is better than many other B-grade movies, it simply lacked the suspense, drama, set-of-your-pants compellingness to make it a worthwhile film. I would avoid it. A far far better film for the money is A Murder of Crows, one of the best acted and scripted films on this decade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book: Little O","review":"Description said some marks in margins.

Unlike many cookbooks with recipes that have not been tested, it is obvious the labor of love this book must have been. The Arroz con Pollo Guatemalan style is a superb dish and so delicious (and was easy to prepare in quantity). I love the recipes, the food histories of the Central American countries and the \\"Ingredients and Cooking Methods\\" section.

The low budget photography did not add a rawness to it. Just distracted. I wasn't scared, concerned, engaged at all with the characters and plot. I too would be wary of all the praise for this flick. Apparently it doesn't take much for people to give this 4 or 5 stars to a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful release","review":"As a big fan of Ray LaMontagne, and blue-eyed soul singers in general, I immediately fell for this CD. I must be the only one who thinks John Mayer is lame- but James has the perfect balance of growl, \\"edge\\" and emotion in his voice.

This is a great CD, and I definitely recommend buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A NATURAL SURPRISE!","review":"I happened upon James Morrison's video on VH1 and just before I was about to change the channel because \\"Oh here we go again..another soulful skinny white guy moaning into the camera\\" but I stopped. It was the timbre of his voice and the fact that I IMMEDIATELY started humming along. I watched the video to the end and then wrote down his name. With much tepidation (one cut and I know it will be trash) I bought it. I was absolutely and pleasantly surprised that I loved every single one of the songs on this cd. Mr. Morrision is talented and his music comes from his soul. I'm glad he's only in his twenties because that means we've got a lifetime to hear his music. You cannot put a price on a CD that exceeds your expectations and that you can't put down for a loooonnnggg time. I have yet to open up my other purchases because I keep allowing his CD to continue to play and I'm still not tired of it yet.

This is a great disc though for anyone who loves good soulful pop songs. His voice sounds like a cross between Ray LaMontagne (not quite as raspy but with more energy) Stevie Wonder and Terence Trent D'Arby. The music is a perfect blend of old-school keyboards and horns without being overtly retro. It will appeal to fans of Van Morrison, Marc Broussard, Josh Kelly, Gavin DeGraw, Maroon 5 and more recent Jonny Lange. There's not a bad song on it. He's not that much like James Blunt (as some say) but he may reach the same cross cultural/cross generational audience and be one of \\"the\\" discs to buy this summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS!","review":"James Morrison has such a hypnotizing voice.

While this original recording lacks some of the polish and subsequent tweaks to the score itself (the addition of Beautiful City for the film; the addition of the original opening, Tower Of Babble, to the show recordings), it is the first recording to capture what has always made Godspell such a powerful piece of theatre -- its raw, musical joy, and its captivating sense of innocence. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good. Real Good.","review":"An excellent C.D. The score is overall very good, but By My Side and Day By Day, in my humble opinion, hurt the score.

I liked the simplicity of the songs, the biblical narrative, and the creative way in which the play was staged. So, I went out and bought the soundtrack. Wow, was I disappointed. I do a little performing myself, and I know my singing is not very good, but I felt like I could easily have been a featured singer on this particular album. The quality is uniformly poor. It's too bad that a soundtrack by an original cast is of such bad quality. I wonder if anyone else has recorded it, and done the musical the service it deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than 'Superstar'","review":"I love this soundtrack. The opening number always wants to make me get up and dance. My favorites are: PREPARE YE THE WAY OF THE LORD, TURN BACK, O MAN, SAVE THE PEOPLE, AND DAY BY DAY. The music quality is good too.

It consists of a bunch of puppies in a glass box, barking and interacting with each other as puppies do. I think I counted 7 puppies, of various pedigrees, and it appears that it was filmed at a pet store. There's also some kind of background noise that is very distracting... not sure what it is. You are given the option to play some canned electronic music instead of the original soundtrack, which helps.The write-up on the DVD case states that the purpose of this DVD is to enhance one's mood (or something to that effect).

The author is especially enamored with DLSw and NSLP. This wouldn't be so bad, except that neither topic seems to be covered much by the ACRC objectives, and neither were on the test I took. There are other off-topic questions as well; it appears that the author wrote to what he knew instead of the exam objectives.All these less-useful questions come at the expense of subjects which are covered on the test. For example, OSPF is barely touched on in this book -- an inexcusable omission given OSPF's importance (on the ACRC test as well as in the real world).Try Cisco's ACRC Study Guide, or look to the Boson tests (Encapsulated mini-review: the main Boson ACRC test is better than the expansion; I don't care for the latter's painfully abbreviated sentence-fragment question structure)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Book for CLSC Test","review":"It's help a lot on my CLSC test.

I thought \\"Famke Janssen (of Xmen fame) and fast cars. Its obviously not Gone in 60 Seconds, but probably worth a look.\\" Oh was I wrong.The acting was BAD from the get go, with actor David Arquette faking his way through the opening scene. His supporting actors, from the villain of the piece to the Interpol detective, do not a thing to redeem this lemon.Other distractions include the plot, which has holes big enough to drive a truck through. The sound is atrocious. At times the dubbed lines don't match the actors' lips. More often, the background noise, or pitiful soundtrack, drowns out the dialogue. I was constantly reaching for the remote trying to compensate. I shouldn't have bothered.Again, I wasn't expecting The Fast & the Furious or Gone in 60 Seconds, just a mindless romp with fast cars and some eye candy. I had to work far too hard at this one.

David Arquette is a goofy guy trying to act tough. That in itself is pretty funny, but I get the impression he's doing it for the comedy. This movie is like a low-budget Bond film with Pee Wee Herman in the James Bond role.The stunts were equally silly (like the car running up a tunnel wall had \\"miniature\\" written all over it). Sure the plot is a bit cheesy but it's fun enough to keep interested, and David Arquette (and the rest of the cast) is hilarious.Let go of your super-critical mind and just sit back and take it for what it is.

Finally I figured the price was right so maybe I'd check it out. I should have saved my money.Now, I'm a sucker for low budget B-movies. Usually you get what you expect(or deserve) when you buy or rent them. \\"RPM\\" had a name cast and was nicely packaged so I expected a derivative but enteraining action flick. Boy was I wrong. Watching paint dry is a much better way to spend 90 minutes.Actually I couldn't even make it through the whole thing. I'm just not that masochistic. I watched the first half hour and then skipped to the later scenes to see if it would get any better. It didn't.I can usually find some sort of redeeming quality for even the worst film, but I'm still scratching my head over this pointless and childish affair.

Great price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully soulful singing","review":"It is a delight to find early music, especially a mass, sung with great expression. But this style of singing is so wonderfully soulful that I recommend Graindelavoix above most recording groups. They take a great risk with the music, and for listeners such as myself who are thirsty for variety, I am indebted greatly to them for their risk.This CD is a great change from the style you typically hear from early music vocal ensembles. The singing resembles folk styles such as pighella from Corsica or Georgian traditional polyphony, with strong, reedy tone and lavish embellishment. It is thoroughly human, and warmly mystical. It is an approach that leaves me with little reason to think that this was not the way men sang this music when it was written, and how we should continue to sing more often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just......odd","review":"I've been listening to Ockeghem for over 35 years, from the eccentric instrumentation of Venhoda to the more austere work by the Hilliard Ensemble. I don't know what graindelavoix is aiming for here, but it simply does not sound like Ockeghem. If anything, it sounds like Ligeti. Plainsong is scattered throughout. Since I purchased this a an MP3 download, I have no liner notes to fall back on for an explanation. Frankly, I couldn't recommend this - there may some point to it, but it is wildly unrepresentative of any performing tradition of this type of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"I particularly appreciated the fact that this brand ...","review":"I particularly appreciated the fact that this brand of moisturizer is noncomedogenic (doesn't clog pores) and has no fragrance, no color. My skin is very sensitive, so gentle is the key. However, it was a little too waxy feeling. It wasn't greasy, but it didn't completely absorb right away. This product would be excellent for a nighttime moisturizer for someone with dry skin who needed extra moisture."},{"rating":"2","title":"The consistency of the moisturizer was just right ...","review":"The consistency of the moisturizer was just right and I liked that it was unscented. It was great to use prior to applying makeup since it wasn't greasy. It's a bit pricey for the size of the jar; however, a little goes a long way and it would last longer than most moisturizers. I would use this product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The overall product was not bad in terms ...","review":"The overall product was not bad in terms of moisturizing. When applied, it left my skin feeling tacky until it dried. Definitely not a huge plus. The moisturizing aspects of it were adequate but not exceptional and no more so than a store brand or low end line. The product was fragrance free or without use of perfumes so the smell was not overly pleasant and the back of the jar said to use with another product by Zia but the other product was not supplied. Overall a mediocre moisturizer in this critic's opinion. I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would recommend Zia, particularly for those people ...","review":"I would recommend Zia, particularly for those people who prefer unscented moisturizer. Most unscented moisturizers have a peculiar scent even though they're unscented. Another thing I liked was that when I use it on my hands it didn't leave them greasy so I can use it at my desk when I'm on the computer and it doesn't get the keys slippery. I should add that even my husband liked it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked the texture and the feel of ...","review":"I liked the texture and the feel of the product.

This was my first Zia product, and I'm happy with the results."},{"rating":"2","title":"It felt wonderful the very first time I ...","review":"It felt wonderful the very first time I used it. There was no oil or residue to interfere with smooth makeup application. It really does disappear completely into the skin. The flaky dry spots from the cold, dry winter air have disappeared. This isn't perfumed either, which is great for people who are sensitive to fragrances. I've used several moisturizers from different companies but none have worked so well, especially when putting foundation over it. I really recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"I used Zia Natural Skincare Skin Basics Fragrance-Free ...","review":"I used Zia Natural Skincare Skin Basics Fragrance-Free Everyday Moisturizer and I won't use it again. It gave me an allergic reaction. My face was red and burning for several hours. Even if I liked it, I still wouldn't buy it at its regular price.

The overall feel of this moisturizer on my face was disgusting. The product didn't soak into my skin and it left me with a feeling of bacon grease dripping from my face. As if that isn't enough, this product doesn't claim to be \\"\\"non-comedogenic\\"\\" which is probably why I broke out after using this product. How ironic, since this product claims that it's for sensitive skin. Which I didn't have until I used this product. Still trying to be optimistic about this product, I used it as an overnight foot lotion. The results were average and unimpressive."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was the first time that I've used ...","review":"This was the first time that I've used a product like Zia Natural Skincare Skin Basics Fragrance-Free Everyday Moisturizer. I didn't like this product. When I put it on my face, I had a tingling feeling. My skin absorbed it right away. It felt like it had a reverse effect. Instead of moisturizing my skin -- it was making it dry. I don't know how it compares to other, similar products because I've never used one, but I won't use this moisturizer and wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really like this face cream.

We buy it, get it home, install it on our daughters crib and it worked for all of maybe 2 minutes. We took it off the crib, the rubber band that makes it spin had come off, so we put it back on and put it back on the crib. Again the same problem. Finally we had enough and stopped using it, but she still liked to look at the fish. So I wait a couple days and try it again. The lights no longer come on, the music plays for about 30 sec. before it turns off, and the mobile still doesn't spin. Oh and the remote NEVER worked, however if you wanted to watch TV in our room you would turn the mobile on and off. Needless to say I wish we would have bought the mobile that went with her bedding set."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK!!!!","review":"This mobile is so cute and has so many cool features, but it is a piece of JUNK!

It has some issues, but i guess i am a bit perplexed by folks that buy this item and expect it to run forever on batteries. You do have to change batteries as they do wear out. My mobile stopped turning, but i took the batteries out and had my husband check them and they were no good. Replaced with new ones and it works great. Reading some reviews before i purchased my mobile, I think some of you are expecting too much from a battery powered toy. If you have older children, and they have battery operated toys, check to see how long those batteries last, with my kids,,about a day or 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"The good things...the mobile is very cute and I like the song choices.The bad... the mobile broke in less than one week of use! The aquarium sounds feature began making just white noise and wouldn't stop until I took the batteries out. Also, the lights that the mobile projects began to get too dim to notice.I exchanged the mobile and the second one had the same flaws. In addition, the mobile does not turn unless I push it to get it started. The music will play for so long that it runs the batteries dead within about a week, and the batteries are a pain to change because you have to take it off the crib and unscrew the battery cover. During this process, the fish usually fall off of the mobile.I kept the second mobile for looks only. I don't bother using it's mechanical features anymore. Save your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Luv it but it does grind","review":"I love the mobile but the motor does make a grinding sound and it drives me nutts.

Plus, with the new one the fish didn't swim so now I have to call the company back again and ask what to do.....IT IS AN AWESOME mobile and my baby doesn't care about the grinding. Who is the mobile for anyhow...me or the baby?? I'm going to keep it no matter what the problem may be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk!!","review":"I'm really sorry that I didn't read these reviews before I bought the mobile. I was attracted to the features and the cute fish bowl, and the colors matched my baby's room. However, two weeks after installing it, the fish completely stopped turning. At first I thought it was the batteries, but we changed them and it still didn't work. I'm really disappointed, because my son really enjoyed it. At least the music still works... A real bummer for me is that I bought it in the U.S., and I live in Israel. I threw out the box and the reciept figuring I would never have an opportunity to return it anyway. Now I'm sad that I did that. I really like it though. :( For those of you looking to buy this product, be warned by the majority of these reviews!!

Keep in ming these things don't stop unless you take it off your crib & remove batteries. Want to have your babies sleep interrupted, buy this! Don't waste your money!!!

This mobile was the worst purchase, but my daughter is hooked on it so I keep replacing the broken one every month(or less). The motor breaks for no apparent reason- the fish stop rotating so the main thing the baby is looking at is broken after a few uses. Ive had the same problem someone stated already where the thing wouldn't turn off a couple of times and started buzzing loud, I had to take it off the crib and take the batteries out to make it stop. The main reason I bought this was for the rotating fish and bright lights that accompanied them- but for some reason that is the first thing to break. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Malfunction city","review":"Although this mobile is very cute, it also does not seem to function very well.

Even though my son really seemed to like it, I'm not going to buy another one of these pieces of junk and will instead get the Ocean Wonders mobile. Can't believe they actually sold this for $40!

This was the WORST BABY item we've bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!Beware!!!","review":"Just like everyone else (man i hope this company reads reviwes of their product!!) it's stopped working. Unfortunately it's been since October 2004 since it was purchased (after our baby shower with gift cards) I have no idea where the receipt is so it looks like we have to buy another one. Our daughter loves the colorful fish but how boring that they won't rotate anymore. I love the fish in the bowl but it starts making a griding noise then lo and behold the fish stopped rotating. When we purchased in October there weren't as many reviews so we thought we were safe, now reading everyone else's it seems we're just another upset set of customers. And to make it worse, we spent another $6 for batteries that we thought we needed, Man! DO NOT BUY THIS!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Take a chance, it's a GREAT MOBILE!!!","review":"I bought this mobile without reading the reviews, and I am glad I did. We have had NO TROUBLE with the mobile and it has been 6 months now. It has not had a battery change either. My daughter loves it. The music and nightlight that makes designs on her ceiling are very soothing and the little fish in the bubble makes my daughter laugh. She is now 1 years old and I have taken the mobile part out and installed the nightlight. We have kept it connected to the crib because she loves to turn the music and the fish on by herself when she wakes up. The nightlight works perfectly. It fits into the slot that the mobile arm comes out of. The moblie fish are now very cute toys. I would tell you to take a chance with this one. When it works, its great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby loved it, until it stopped rotating","review":"Unfortunately I purchased the mobile before reading the reviews.

This one lasted for another week. Now the mobile will \\"sometimes\\" turn, the music will \\"sometimes\\" play, and the bubbles will \\"sometimes\\" work, but never all at once.I got this simply because of the fish theme, but I think I am going to take this one back as well.

Then two days ago, we turned it on and it wouldn't spin. We threw the box away the day before, so now we're not sure if they'll take it back.

Worst chapters are on people like Howard Hughes, Michael Dell and Ross Perot, where lots of biographical material is already available and much better than what she has. Her Ross Perot chapter was almost all taken from the books, \\"On Wings of Eagles\\". An important moment in Perot's life but only a small part of it.Catchy title that got me to buy it.

I had read other reviews before purchasing and many people had terrific results with this item, but I followed instructions and have been using it for over 2 months now and it just does not eliminate static from my clothes. I had high hopes for the idea behind this product but it is nowhere near as effective as they claim, or even as others claim. Extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more static...","review":"I bought these because I was getting major static this winter even with 2 dryer sheets. I tossed them in with some dryer balls, and my problems were solved! Now I have the dryer balls for fluff and the static sheets to remove static, and my clothes are fresh, dry, and non-clingy with not of that greasy dryer sheet residue or fake floral smell! I found after about a month that there was some static, but I threw them through the wash with my next load (like it says on the box) and the static was gone again.As an added bonus, I have also found that my dryer vent no longer clogs with lint - I guess no more of that waxy dryer sheet chemical to stick up in the pipes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wham, Bam, thankyou Ma'am.....","review":"Sorry about the one line summary up there. It's wanky, I know, but I couldn't help it-I thoroughly enjoyed reading May's latest novel. Being one of the premier sci fi authors in the world, the Grande Dame has a following of several million who are already predisposed to flip out over her works. Although this novel is no where near as deep and thought provoking as its' predecessors, Julian May once more wends a tale that is so easy to fall in love with that you can literally see it unfold as she describes it to you. All the other reader reviews have just about said it all- and I too love the way that this book emulates the style of old, whilst also take the piss out of it. It's no brain strainer, but May has obviously had a LOT of fun with this one..... Makes me think of Dr Who for some reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing from Julian May","review":"I really enjoyed the Saga of the Exiles. I thought the characters were well developed and the plots satisfying. So I was expecting a lot from this book. I hesitate to criticise what seem to me to be its failings, since it is obviously meant to be light and not to be taken seriously. Certainly it is packed with action and there are some amusing situations. But it has a bit too much of a feel of it doesn't matter what obviously stupid decisions the hero makes, because the writer is on his side, and she'll make everything turn out OK. Oh, and kill off any character who becomes inconvenient, because we can always invent more characters, but you don't need to be sad about them, because they weren't real anyway. I'm not going to bother with the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"May isn't what she once was","review":"While this book does have its moments, it have large holes in its logical underpinnings and a rather annoying main character without much depth.

It can only have been produced by a Haluk replacement with no writing talent whatsoever. The author of the 'the Saga of Exiles' must currently be floating in an a tank of gloop somewhere.Perseus Spur actually isn't that bad except that if you do read it, you might be tempted to read the other 2 books. The last one is particularly dire, if you can just imagine the most predictable and uninteresting outcome for the trilogy, you will not need to bother reading it.Finally, the trilogy Hero character. What a completely irritating [bad]. I really did want the 'baddies' to put him out of our misery, preferably in the first 3 pages of book 2.Huluks, please release the real Julian May."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak characterization and head-shaking version of \\"faery\\"","review":"This is basically a spy/intrigue type novel, although it is fairly short, so the plot is pretty simple. That's not so bad, just light reading, but what I didn't like was that the characters are pretty much just paper cut-outs, and worse, the way the various \\"supernatural\\" races are portrayed is just silly. As far as I can tell, their non-humanity is just a plot device and was given almost no thought. (The names are ridiculous too - Elves come complete with last names of Irish cities like Dublin and Cork; Leprechauns do not, but are named things like \\"Ransi Milbert\\"; and \\"Dorton Hraavik\\" for the name of a Faery? oh my.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for converting to Quick release","review":"I bought this to convert my daughter's bike to quick release axles.

It's nearly impossible to understand what the voices are saying, and the record/play back feature is also garbled.Despite these flaws, my son seems to love it and has enjoyed it.

The acting is terrible, the directing is terrible, the CGI is terrible, the writing is terrible. There is absolutely nothing positive about this movie. Bijou Phillips is a much better actress then this, it looks like she just didn't care. The CGI baby looked terrible when it was on screen which was rare.

This time around, Bijou Philips and James Murray play the parents of the murderous, blood-hungry little tyke, who isn't quite as mutant-looking he was in the original film. That being said, there really isn't too much in the way of explanation as to much of what goes on in It's Alive, as we witness some people doing some very stupid things, and some non-sensical moments within the plot that are nothing short of head scratching. Still, there's something to admire as there are some genuine shocks to be had, but other than that, this new take on It's Alive is pretty limp, and pretty pointless too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad remake","review":"I thought the original was okay.

I bought these because I love the zia oil free moisturizer and the zia deep moisture repair serum... but I'm finding that those are the only 2 zia products that are right for me.

My headphones had good sound to start with, but were often too high on the bass end, and depending on whether I was watching a new DTS DVD, or an old, worn out VHS, I needed some more adjustment than what was available through the receiver. So I saw the Beringer, and was initially hesitant, because it was so inexpensive. I had to buy a 1/4\\" jack to dual-RCA line splitter to make them work, but when I did...WOW!! Granted this is lightweight and plastic (not a heavy duty, daily adjustment, studio level EQ) but for any home theater headphone guy like myself, these can't be beat. There are plenty of adjustments to help knock out low-end hiss on VHS, and enough subtlety to deliver a full DTS range with lots of punch. Thanks Beringer! As they say on their logo..

I waited (like a child on X-Mas eve) for the DVD to be released only to see get disappointed when I saw that their is a difference of roughly one second between what you hear and what you see, it sounds as if it was re-recorded in a studio, even the crowd clapping sounds computerized. Please don't take this review as if I don't like Sanz music, I have loved his music ever since he released \\"3\\" his third CD and own every single CD he has released, my recommendation is buy the DVD and listen to it with the TV off, or just buy the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fielding's outstanding folk performance","review":"For those who remember folk music at its best, this is a real find.

There are stories that pivot on comedy and surreality in France, others about work and class structure, and adolescent efforts to identify oneself within a white American culture during the 60s and 70s. There is a lost brother, a conflicted hunter, a naive forest ranger. What the reader gets are layers of complexity buried beneath great stories. The pull of this book is extraodinary.

But then, about half way through our Hiero meets an adorable princess and from then on the story becomes way to precious, coquettish and coy to stomach. No one told the author that once the lovers declare their love the romance is over, I guess. What this book needed was an editor with a red pencil to cut all this flowery language, redundancy and cuteness. If he's still alive, the writer is in his eighties, but the prose reads as if a teenager wrote it. This comes from a romantic, by the way. Anybody want to buy a copy (and the sequel) cheap?

Even today, I think that \\"Rock and Roll Animal\\" is a pretty good album (CD). I bought this recording 15 years ago. I wanted to like it. I did like it. A couple tunes are - at the mo - a bit catchy. BUT, this album does not wear well. It's simplistic. The idea of a 40+ pop star singing about playing video games is just dumb. What is really annoying about this recording, though, is the song \\"Fly Into the Sun.\\" In this tune, Lou confesses that he has no fear of nuclear war and welcomes the chance to meet his maker. It's the swan song of a potentially talented musician who basically sold out, gave up, and proclaims his own death wish. Lou, if you're reading this, GROW UP!"},{"rating":"2","title":"rockin' Lou Reed on a roll","review":"I went through a period in which I could only stand to read Hemingway and I can could only stand to listen to Lou Reed (and classical music). From \\"The Blue Mask\\" through \\"Legendary Hearts\\" to \\"New Sensations\\" Lou Reed was on top of his form: a new maturity, instrumental excellence, not yet pretentious (think \\"New York\\"). I should admit though that I usually play only about half the tracks on each of these three records. My favorite \\"New Sensations\\" songs follow each other on the disc: \\"New Sensations\\", \\"Doing the Things that We Want to\\", What Becomes a Legend Most\\", and \\"Fly into the Sun\\".Also recommended: \\"The Blue Mask\\", \\"Legendary Hearts\\", and \\"Pentatonic Scales for the Jazz Rock Keyboardist\\" by Jeff Burns."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have For Any Lou Reed Fan!","review":"Yet another Lou Reed Classic!

He found his best guitar teammate since Sterling Morrison in the great Robert Quine, and this is a simple, playful, rocking good time, as the cuts will attest, especially I Love You Suzanne and Turn To Me. Pick up a guitar and play along."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOU LIGHTENS UP","review":"Wow, what a great album. From the rocking opener I Love You Suzanne this is one song after another of Lou at his melodic best, with horns, keyboards and backing singers used to great effect. As a celebration of life, it does occasionally hint at the dark side (like violence in Endlessly Jealous, My Friend George and loneliness in What Becomes A Legend Most) but the overall impression is one of finding magic in everyday experiences. My favourite tracks are Doing The Things ... with its glorious girl chorus and the almost ethereal, breezy High In The City (\\"Don't wanna talk politics today/Feelin' pretty witty/Getting' high off of the city ...\\" and that just about sums up the mood of the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a masterpiece, but damn entertaining nonetheless","review":"Everyone seems to think that Lou Reed is nothing but a downbeat, serious artist that doesn't know how to loosen up. But NEW SENSATIONS is one of those rare albums that shows Reed is far more mellow than he's made out to be. Not surprisingly, the production on this album is forever rooted in the '80s, so if you think it's a little dated, you're not alone. With synthesizers instead of guitars being more prominent on this album, this can really be looked at as Lou Reed's last (and therefore most successful) attempt at being commercial. Why NEW SENSATIONS didn't become a huge success is a mystery to me because it sounds like it should have been. While not Reed's best album, it certainly is one of his most interesting and entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"an awful book","review":"This book really doesn't give you imformation about any kind of web programming.

There are no pictures of finished banners, not even on the cover, which was not very inspirng to me; I needed pictures when I first started. The \\"Quick and Easy Reference Guide\\" was not, for me, either quick (\\"outine all the design pieces with narrow strips of black felt...glue each strip along the very outside edge of each piece, carefully bending or stretching the felt to match the curve\\") nor easy (17 steps!)

Not a holier than though type of religious person.I laughed so loud at some of his mistakes, and the fact that he was willing to share them, and laugh at himself makes this an enjoyable read.Chapters are not too long, you don't get characters mixed up, just enough detail, and did I say laughs?The first few chapters give the readers a background on his life.The last chapters each have a theme, and he shares hilarious things that happened in his church home, and the characters he meets throughout his life.If you were raised in a traditional church, or not- this is a lighthearted, quick, enjoyable read.!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stories I couldn't tell while I Was A Pastor","review":"If you are or have been in the ministry - this book will give you the chance to see the \\"other side of the ministry\\" - very amusing, but so very true of the strange things that can and do happen.

It is such a powerful book but in saying that, it is also an easy read - you get into the story straight away - I had it read in a couple of days. Although there are several characters who feature in the book, you never think to your self 'Who's this person?' and have to go back to find who they are. Also, the book goes backwards and forwards in time and characters, BUT the story isn't hindered by this - it just flows.

Mistake. It was a complete waste of time and I was almost furious by the end when the plot developed exactly the way I'd predicted. In addition, I hated being reminded of plot developments throughout; why does the author feel she has to remind me of something that happened a few chapters before? At several points I wondered if this was written for pre-teens especially pre-teens born after WWII.

Not one of the \\"actors\\" should have even been put on screen; the effects are entirely laughable; the sound and lighting are so far beyond professional standards, I don't see how a studio could have released such a horribly made movie.

The storyline to this movie was so bad I couldn't take it. I actually fast forwarded this movie, and I live for B-horror. The rubber suit creature is funny (when you can see it), but like a lot of low-budget horror, the camera work is so bad you often see a black or heavily shadowed screen. I agree that the cover is one of the highlights of this movie. The endless dialogue in this movie makes for a great sleeping pill. Most of the \\"made for the SciFi channel\\" movies blow this out of the water. I give one star for the DVD cover and one star for the brief topless scene.

The horrible acting, lame effects, pathetic music,the furry little monster who looks like a hampster on steriods and oh god the horrible cliche storyline as well as every cheap monster cliche trick possible.Such as the creatures hand grabs hold of acorner and it's head slowly apears around the wall or it leaps at the camra just to suck every last thrill into the movie.

(Which is why I picked it up at the local library in the first place - please don't waste any money on this.)This is apparently some kind of home movie attempt at a monster movie and how it ever got a DVD release is beyond me. It's like the type of movie you'd encounter on youtube - one made by drunk college students who don't realize how bad their production really is.

I realized that even if I felt like God's grace wasn't prevalent in my life, it actually was, because God has kept me safe throughout my life. There's multiple reasons that Ron had to go through this ordeal, but I believe that at least one reason was to reach people, people that feel lost or hurt, or like there's no reason to live, becasue Ron's been there, and he's been through that.

He would touch on topics in one section, only to later go back to those topics in their own sections. I had the feeling of \\"didn't I already read some of this?\\". Also lacking was any maps that showed the developement of Chicago's railroad network. At the very least, a map of the current railroads and where they go in the city could have been included, and can be easily gotten from the Chicago Operating Rules Association (CORA).

In fact, this album as the original Off - Broadway Cast results such a poor choice if you want to buy one of the greatest musicals ever imagined (The Phantom, Jesus Christ, Cats, Les Miserables, etc.)Schwartz based his carreer in this soft and boring recording of a Jesus Christ dressed like a clown singing bad songs as Day by Day, Alas for you and Light of the world. But, however, it has a couple of songs that deserve a little atention like All Good Gifts and By my Side. The Cast do a good job with a poor lyrics and even worst orchestrations. Victor Garber have a beautiful voice waisted in s poor material like \\"Godspell\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lynne Thigpen","review":"When I was about eight years old us kids became catholic. Thisfilm came out right around that time and I saw it more than once.For me, it defined christianity. My father's friend gave me thealbum because he was tired of me asking him to play it. These tunes were some of the most important music in my life. I'veseen the movie as an adult and it is definately not the same aswhen I was a kid. But the music itself is timeless. Whether youare a christian or not, there is some creative and funky stuffin this one. Sure it's corny at points and it gets a littleheavy with the message.

The recording quality of this Soundtrack CD is excellent, though the original mix is a bit \\"notched out\\" or hollow in the drums and bass-typical of many '70's pop recordings. Vocal quality is excellent in the Soundtrack version--infinitely more polished and musical than the Broadway recording, which is, ironically the more popular recording. Ditto the production values and mixing. Just compare \\"God Save the People.\\" Sort of bombastic and a bit off key in the Broadway version. \\"Bless the Lord\\" in this Soundtrack version blazes! But it kind of whimpers in the Broadway recording, except for the bellowing male backup vocals. Even using Real Time player you'll hear the difference. Godspell is as inspiring and uplifting now as then. In fact, the words of several songs are right out of of the hymnal (All Good Gifts) or the Psalms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings Back Memories","review":"When this musical first came on the scene, it was marked \\"scandalous\\" by some. But my pastor/father liked it nonetheless. He taught me about symbolism and showed me grand things like CS Lewis' illustrations.

As Chief Wiggum says to his son Ralph, \\"What is your fascination with my forbidden closet of mystery?\\" Be it fraternities or Skull & Bones or most especially, motorcycle gangs, every detail is a nugget of info to be savored.Mr. Langton gets so deep inside the mind of Walter Stadnick and so deep into the life of the hyper-secret Hells Angels, he provides an amazingly clear window into the workings of the organization. Observations both great and small give civilians a taste of this nomadic and dangerous existence.The topic of motorcycle gangs continues to be pressing and current, especially in light of the murders in Shedden over this past weekend. The story of this Hells Angel is important knowledge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I knew Nurget and had the pleasure of riding with him in the mid 70's when I lived in Hamilton. He was a fun, smart and happy guy. I was surprised that he made such a name for himself. Langton seems to jump around throughout the whole book, leaving the reader confused at times. Perhaps he could have got some help writing the book from a real writer. It is obvious he sides with the police authorities, giving a very one sided view of the biker lifestyle. He has made several errors pertaining to the biker culture and some of the events that took place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written And Poorly Researched","review":"The author should have called this book A History Of People Killed In Canada as he does very little to chronicalize or write a biography about Walter Stadnick. He has way to many people involved in the book, some who arent even Hells Angels, who have no connection to Stadnick or the Hells Angels and on every page some one else is being murdered. The information gets shot out of a cannon in an unorganized explosion leaving the reader wondering when the author is actually going to talk about Stadnick and stop talking about every murder that took place during the alleged Canadian Biker Wars. As another reviewer wrote, he misstates facts and writes things as fact in regards to the Hells Angels MC that aren't verified and are pure speculation. Would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horseshit...","review":"Not only is the author a bad writer.....jumping from timeline to time line...not able to tell a story in order.....he tries to pose the Hell's Angels as the bad guys.

Historically, the Book of Jubilees was claimed to have been revealed to Moses but some claim that the book was simply a copy of the original Books of Genesis as found in the common Bible. Some label ancient books with similar stories as pseudepigrapha, material not suitable for inclusion in religious books.The Books of Jubilees, details the celebration of every Jubilee (49 years) since creation to Moses's adult life; about 2410 years. There is a lot of detail in The Book of Jubilees and I wonder how the ancient authors could have had such access to personal lives of those times.

To make matters worse, the ref seems to think he's officiating a legit boxing show and breaks things up anytime the action gets interesting. That's when he's not adjusting the ill-fitting headgear. Naturally this disrupts the flow quite drastically and at least one match apparently peters out due to lack of interest.As a final note, the host is more than a little annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful completion to his Mahler series","review":"Chailly is a very interesting conductor of Mahler. He really has his own, individual approach to the music. He is never over the top (as Bernstein can be) nor is he cool and detached like Boulez. I think the first movement under Chailly must be the longest ever recorded. It clocks in at over 30 min. but never does he lose sense of the breath and sweep of the music. He does well with the inner movements. I especially like his handling of the mad third movement. Chaiily takes the great final movement slow, not as slow as Bernstein but he plays it slow, heatbreaking and beautiful. A great performance and a great series. This disc is happily priced as two CD's for the price of one.

The cooler doesn't have a drain so it's a pain to drain the water when it's still full of food and drinks. The removable lid was a good idea but very poorly executed.

Texas Trilogy, the story of a crumbling fraternal organization and the paralelled crumbling dreams of rural Texan families. This book explores the passage of time and more so, those who are left behind by their culture, family, and home. More than that, this is an amusing read that had me laughing out loud several times--something that usually only Oscar Wilde can do. I still wonder why this went out of print after recieving rave reviews at the time of its release.

But the script for O.S.2 is so bad that what passes for humor never even made me smile though I did wince any number of occasions. The screen writer's idea funny is a power/control obsessed frison biche, and that might have been funny. Unfortunaly the writer gives it an endless stream of angry frothing dialog that is as witless as it is tiresome. And that's the movie's high point. Being an older person I sometimes wonder if I'm missing humor that would appeal to the youngsters. But try as I might I can't find anything good to say about this film for any age group."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good new and bd format","review":"THE SHIPPING WAS BAD IT TOOK PAST THE ALOTTED 3 AND A HALF WEEKS TIME PROMISED BUT THE CONDITION AND QUALITY ARE WONDERFUL......THEY JUST NEED TO GET THE MOVIE OUT ON A FASTER DELIVERY...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laugh Count","review":"Aside from the trite story line and really cheap animation the real reason for watching this animation was going to be it's anticipated hilarious humor. So here's the humor count: Half chuckle 10 minutes into movie; another half chuckle around 23 and again 45 minutes. Fell asleep between 23 and 45 so there may be more.

The barely veiled foul language references make this movie completely inappropriate for younger children. The quality of the art work was poor. The dialogue was annoying.

We bought it without any knowledge of it, and basically threw our money away. I seriously doubt we will ever watch it again. My 2 year old recognizes the characters, and actually watched the first 30 minutes of the movie. However, he grew tired of it and we had to put in WALL E.The animation looks like two separate groups developed the characters. The characters from the first movie look like they did in the first movie. The new characters look like cheap CGI. Hope you know what I mean because it's hard for me to explain otherwise.Overall, I can understand why it went straight to DVD. Buy it at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a film for kids??! Huge waste of money!","review":"It takes a LOT to offend my husband, but after enduring a half hour of nothing but sexual innuendos, he couldn't stand it anymore. Neither of us could believe this film is actually marketed to young children. I've never wanted my money back so badly as I do with this DVD. I encourage parents to watch this film BEFORE allowing their kids to see it. (Our own children are 5-1/2 and 7.) If you are liberal minded, you probably won't care. But if you are more on the conservative side, you may find this film quite offensive. This was the biggest waste of money and I want every penny back!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Animated Comedy","review":"Sequels usually aren't as good as the original, but in this case I enjoyed Open Season 2 more than Open Season.

The characters are easy for kids to remember and understand, and the storyline, while really uninspired, also easy for kids to follow. I think the word to describe this animation is \\"relaxed.\\" It doesn't break any new ground in animation techniques or storytelling, but it also does not require a Ph.D. in animation psychology to be entertained over, say, family dinner.

So needless to say, I had no intention of buying this one. But with enough \\"kid pressure\\", I did. And I was hugely surprised. It's a really fun and frenetic movie. Lots of running around and screaming -- which my kid loved. Also, many jokes that went over her head, but made me laugh out loud.If you're looking for an Oscar winning drama, this is not it. But, if you want to entertain your kids for a few hours with a funny movie with a good moral, you'll be pleasantly surprised by Open Season 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring movie without original voice-cast","review":"My kids were mostly entertained by this, but I was bored to tears.

The animation was poor, but I could have forgiven that if it had been written well, but it was not. Instead it has an embarrassingly dumb story line.

After watching all three of the Ice Age movies repeatedly (my son's favorites), I was expecting the same level of storyline, humor, animation, voice-overs, etc. Open Season 2 doesn't even come close. I'm sorry I wasted the money on it and will probably put it back up for sale. There is some inappopriate sexual innuendo and a scene in the beginning in which the animals in some sort of twisted game throw live bunnies at each other. I don't know why anyone would find that funny, and it may even traumatize some kids. My wife and I looked at each other multiple times during the movie with that, \\"What the he## kind of movie is this? look.\\" Keep your money in your pocket on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoped for better story...","review":"Doesn't compare to the original.

I wanted a reliable watch that I could read long after dark under a variety of conditions, and one that I would not have to worry about battery life or malfunctioning when I was \\"outback\\". This watch has beat my expectations. The dial is so bright at night that I can use it to light a path or find things in a pack.

Combines great debating material (Who's your top 100?) while also showing great clips, reliving great memories. The best part is the use of former NFL coaches, players and other celebrities to introduce and talk about each member of the Top 100. Using people who love the sport and the player really makes it a great show. My nephew enjoys it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So much foul language! :(","review":"My boys (10 and 13) were dying to get this dvd collection and were thrilled to receive it for Christmas. Imagine my surprise when I walk in and hear the comments about sex (I had nothing against the context, but it was totally unnecessary.) The \\"F\\" words are bleeped, but are still quite obvious. Way too much other foul language that isn't bleeped. I was incredibly disappointed because the dvds have so much other great information and historical value. Unless I can find someone to edit them, we will not be keeping them. They hear plenty of inappropriate language at school; there's no reason for them to hear it at home as well.

The arrythmia practice strips are excellent and having the correct answers in the back of the book allows the adult learner to verify their interpertations or seek further learning in an area.

I have had many complaints from class participants about the inconsistencies in the book. Many of the practice rhythm strips are incorreclty interpreted and do not follow the rules presented in the early chapters of the book. I found the information presented in the chapters regarding pathophysiology and rules for each arrhythmia factual and accurate. However, the fill in the blank approach makes it difficult for a first time learner to obtain the information they need. Many class participants have also complained about the fill in the blank parts of the book.

It is certainly a book worth having."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"It has the look, weight, and price tag of a text book, but contains such a small amount of information it could have been a classroom handout. This book begins with a BASIC description of the \\"rules\\" for interpreting rhythms, which is a very small portion of the book. There is nothing wrong with this section, and as far as I can tell the information is accurate. The rest is made up of practice strips (Lead II only, one per page), that the reader is supposed to interpret.The reason I felt this book deserved two stars (as opposed to none), is that it came with somewhat useful flashcards for practicing rhythm identification. My recommendation is to use it if it is provided for you, but don't spend money on it. All of the information in it (and MUCH more), as well as thousands of practice strips, can be found for free on the internet."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"great book. gail walraven does a great job with this book explaining how to read ekg's and how to interpret them as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book! just a few inaccuracys from 5 Stars","review":"This book is great it is a very boiled down what you need to know way to learn rhythms and even comes with flashcards in the back. The only thing that this book could do better is redo their practice strips. There are several inaccuracy in their practices strips but there is never enough in one chapter to be more then a minor annoyance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate this book!","review":"Every sentence has a blank which makes it really annoying to read. The words for the blanks are off to the side which makes the whole concept idiotic. The first thing I did was go through and fill in all the blanks so I could read it. Once you start reading it becomes apparent that the authors copied all the facts they could find about the current subject and put them in \\"bulleted\\" numbered format. There are no paragraphs, the facts are repetitive, it is obvious that the \\"facts\\" were taken from different places.The good news(?) is that if you don't have any medical experience or know medical terminology the words and definitions are dumbed down so that anyone can understand them. If you have to have this book as a text for a class and don't care about learning any more than you have to, then go for it, it does seem to cover the very minimum basics. If you want to learn anything about the heart and how it works I'd get something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Text or workbook?","review":"I believe it's technically called the Socratic method, but I call it the \\"guess what I'm thinking method\\" of teaching. Regardless of the content, this text is written in numbered paragraphs with random words missing within. The missing words are in a column to the right of the text, like it's a quiz. I find this distracting and unhelpful. There are parts of the book that actually are quizzes, which is fine, but leaving out every instance of the word \\"electrical\\" on a page and putting a blank line in its place is just teaching me to work through frustration. Maybe that's the point, but I doubt it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for new readers","review":"I have used this book with new students learning to read EKG's. Result have been excellent.

After a house fire we tried in vain to find a copy of the album or cassette but always came upon dead ends. Last year our daughter - now 25 and a senior at Harvard - called very excited as she had found the cd at this web site. She was totally elated and couldn't wait for her copy to arrive.

Marlo Thomas created and consolidated this wonderful compendium of vinettes demonstrating for children that they can be themselves and be loved for it. She's joined by some of the entertainment giants of the time....Alan Alda, Rosie Greer, Mel Brooks just to name afew. And the real joy for any adult is that we get to laugh and join along too. The message is clear. Girls can be smart and strong. Boys can cry. Just about all jobs are gender neutral. And everyone can love dolls.

And they're political dynamite, as proved by the nasty reviews seen occasionally below.Get this disc to remember. Get it for your kids, none of whom may ever have the luxury of taking tolerance for granted, as some of us did in an abbreviated era when cultural moments like \\"Free to Be...\\" helped heal the past, and made the future seem infinitely bright.Belated cheers to Marlo and all participating artists.

That \\"Housework\\" track was never my favorite as a child, but now that I am older and have my own place with my fiance, I know why I always expect him to help out when the house needs cleaning up.And I like one of the messages in \\"When I Grow Up;\\" that \\"I don't care if I'm pretty at all/.../I like what I look like/...\\" That more women would recite these lines while being confronted with those magazines like Cosmo and Ladies' Home Journal--where you're never *quite* pretty or thin enough.

Until I heard that snippet in the movie, I had totally forgotten of the music -- and hearing it again as an adult, I now realize the great talents on this album ... but also, how much it influenced my beliefs about gender roles for the better.

I think that this is a nice little album to share with the kids and for us adults to sit back and reflect on our times in growing up...If you listen closly...

I also know in the 70s women's lib was a big issue after the 60s so it was showing everyone is free to be you and me, a wonderful message for kids, showing they can be anything and everything but one thing remains for sure, they cant be gramdmas and mommys if theyre a boy vice versa for girls who cant be grandpas or daddys. I also like where it says it is OK for boys to play with dolls since they will someday be a daddy I always try to bring that point accross when someone complains of a boy playing with a doll because my boys have always liked to play in housekeeping at school. This is a must purchase for children, showing them they are free to be you and me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Free to Be You and Me CD","review":"The Free to Be You and Me TV special was one of my childhood favorites, as was this album. (I actually still have the vinyl album my mom bought for me 30 years ago!) I introduced my 4 year-old daughter to the video, and she immediately fell in love with the soundtrack. So I purchased this CD for her and it has become the only thing she wants to listen to during any car ride. The only thing that is disappointing to me is that not all of the songs are exactly the same as what is on the video... not that they aren't good, they're just not the same. While my daughter doesn't seem to mind, I have to admit I prefer the versions on the video. There are a lot of extras on the CD that aren't on the video as well, which is a bonus. Overall, this is a great CD to own if your child loves the video/DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lesson everyone could learn from!","review":"This soundtrack is a must have! It doesn't matter that it was created for children, it has the learning power and all around fun loving songs and stories that everyone can love! Each one has a powerful morale that is comical and can be appreciated by everyone!My top favorites are definitely \\"Boy meets Girl\\" and \\"Ladies First\\", they are beyond cute and I've listened to them so many times that I can literally speak along with the voices! Which leads me to...the voices! They are so well projected and distinguished, you don't have to have seen the show to understand this album.Don't hesitate before buying this, you'll be humming \\"Parents are People\\" for the rest of your days!

His class did their year-end play to the entire albumn and I still remember much of it. I was talking to my sister-in-law once and this albumn came up and we sang some of the songs we remembered.

Hoping they release the show on DVD soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"memories","review":"My grandchildren, ages 8 and 4, have memorized all the songs on the CD since Christmas, and love to dance to them. I wondered if the music that so appealed to their mother in the '70's would interest them, but they absolutely love it.

Although I did not realize it at the time, my parents had done me a tremendous favor by buying me this little gem. It really made me feel good about myself! The memories I have of sitting with my Mom and listening to William's Doll while she explained to me the lessons of the song, are priceless. I just bought the CD for my little boy and as soon as the opening guitar strings played, he was instantly hooked. I am so excited that I am sharing this with a whole new generation of little ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recommendations are misleading - what a dissapointment!","review":"I bought this CD based on the recommendations listed here on this site. I thought the songs were outdated. It isn't the music that is outdated, but the values that are being taught in the songs. The song relating to housework just about blew me away! Why not try to teach our kids that working together to get unpleasant tasks done can be fun? This song teaches kids to look at something with a negative attitude. Housework is not tops on a list of fun things to do, but I at least want my kids to have a positive outlook about it. Don't buy, this is a waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Even as a child, I hated it","review":"Perhaps in 1972 this was a bold statement. But even then, as a nine-year-old, I despised the self-righteous but whiny tone in almost every song. Of course men and women have equal potential, and a just society must recognize that. But this album is only a celebrity vanity project: it is about feeling morally superior, not about changing anything.................When I remember this album, I think of John Belushi in Animal House, when he hears the smarmy soulfulness of a campus bard. If you don't know what he does, get that video for your kids instead of this record. At least that is genuinely funny, unlike this humorless propaganda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Begs more questions than it answers","review":"I read a ton of the reviews and decided to check this CD out at the library to listen to it before buying. I was not one of the nostalgic parents who remembered this from childhood. After listening to it, I decided not to buy it. I REALLY did not care for this CD. Not only did I feel there was too much talk and not enough music, but the talk itself begged questions that probably don't even cross the minds of your average 2-3 year old (such as the \\"girls are just as good as boys\\" theme)-- your girl won't even wonder if she's as good as a boy if you don't make a \\"thing\\" of it and just treat her right. Anyway, this CD bugged me a lot because of issues like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for the Parents maybe.. but not the kids","review":"This CD was a little old for my son.

I was born in the mid 70s and this album means nothing to me, except something that maybe my parents older siblings would like to listen to because it brings back memories of their childhood. Maybe I haven't listened to the lyrics as closely as I should have, but the music is so damn annoying I can't get past that to listen to the lyrics... hearts love flowers were a time of the past.

Bok's singing of \\"Western Boat\\" while not as good as Stan Rogers' version (called \\"Cape St. Mary\\" on the CD \\"For the Family\\"), is a better than average folksong. The only song that I don't like is \\"Peter Kagan And The Wind,\\" a telling of the silkie legend. It just goes on and on and on (it's over 15 minutes long).\\"North Wind's Clearing\\" is a CD that I listen to more than most others that I own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forgotten opera","review":"Paisiello was justly famous in his day as a composer of opera.

Out of the box, one of the buttons was unresponsive.After a long call with an abrasive tech at Logitech, I was told my problem would be submitted to their RMA department and I would receive their decision in 3-5 business days, even though the remote is under warranty. If my request for service was approved, they would repair the remote and return it to me in 3-4 weeks. Irritating.I would otherwise be happy with the remote, and would continue to use it if it worked properly. As is, however, I can only recommend this product if you can purchase it locally along with a replacement plan, as dealing with Logitech itself is obnoxious at best. This is not the first time I have run afoul of Logitech's customer \\"service\\", but I just couldn't resist trying the Harmony."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent remote, but does not last","review":"I bought this remote several years ago for almost $100 and figured for that price, it would work and last for more than a couple years. While it did work adequately for most functions, there were a few glitches. For example, the tivo controls (FF, RW, etc) were not as quick to respond as the Tivo remote itself. The real problem came when after 2 years several of the buttons used on a regular basis stopped working. In contrast, the FREE remote that came with the Tivo still works flawlessly after years of use. I love the idea of a universal remote, but beware that spending $100+ for a remote does guarantee that it will work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Logitech Harmony 670","review":"So happy we bought off of Amazon.

I usually wouldn't spend this amount of money for a something like a remote control, but after using it, I would do it again and would tell others to free themselves from multiple remotes. It was easy to install the software on the computer and set up the remote. The initial set up, once the software was installed probably took about 20 minutes. It did require a little bit of resetting a couple times just to get it the way we like it, but it was fairly simple. I'm especially impressed at how well the remote operates all the features of our DVR. You can also program buttons for specific tasks, such as easily accessing the recordings from the DVR. It couldn't be easier to operate the remote. Want to watch tv? Just press the top 'watch tv' button and all the necessary components turn on, and when you are finished watching, press 'off' and all the individual components switch off. I would recommend this remote."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragile remote","review":"The Logitech Harmony remotes are technically useful, but for a family with children, they are too fragile.

The idea of only needing one remote to control all devices in my home theater system is fantastic. Hit one button and BOOM all devices turn on and set themselves to the correct input.It even works on my XBOX 360 which was an awesome surprise, and I was able to play with it one day and get it to control the fan that is in my den with my TV so I don't even need the remote for the fan anymore. (I know it sounds lazy, but its nice not needing to find 5 diff remotes).I do notice that sometimes it is not as responsive as I would like (especially when the batteries are not so fresh). I have had a few instances where I have had to go thru the help menu to make sure everything is off.The first time set up was a breeze, however thats probably because my father has an older model which I have set up before, so that probably helped.All in all, this is a great product and I highly recommend it to anyone that asks."},{"rating":"2","title":"harmony usage","review":"Having recently purchased the Harmony 670 Universal Remote I highly reccomend this product.

Its simple and easy and you can read the print on the buttons.Ray Collins NC"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"I thought I would share my opinion on this nifty remote so buyers know what they are getting into. Having had \\"universal remotes\\" in the future, I was skeptical since I inevitably had to dig up one of the several remotes I had to change or undjust some functions, but not with this.Out of the box, you will spend at least an hour connecting it to the USB, getting model numbers and configuring it, but it does do what it promises (almost) and has a nifty help interface to assist you when things get a bit off. If you are not comfotable configuring things through a computer, look elsewhere. But the software was pretty good. I was able to get my TV, DVR, DISH, Receiver, DVD, PS2 and PC stereo (including iTunes) to all run from ONE remote, which was a MAJOR accomplishment. The only thing I could not configure was the remote control ceiling fan (yeah, I know, but I am REALLY not that much of a potato).Great product and almost perfect...now we will see how I like it in a few months.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Start but not there yet","review":"I have had the Harmony 670 for about a month. I can see where they are going with it but it definitely needs improvement to make it useful. The set up was not bad and it handled most of my hardware. It did not handle my RF direct-tv receiver and it could not get the line-in on my Sony vcr to work correctly. I have worked around both of these problems but the main difficulty with this unit lies in the overall design. The buttons are tiny and very close together. The button labels are nearly unreadable because the font is so small. My eyesight is not perfect but I have no problem reading the newspaper without glasses. To read the labels on the harmony I have to have full light and magnifier glasses. Every logiteck device I own has been a delight to use but this thing will probably end up in the closet before long.

I live a couple states away and was getting sick of the calls that she wasn't able to watch TV or watch a DVD and I would have to blindly walk her through getting everything on the right input and what not. So I bought her this for Christmas and it has been great. She can easily navigate between all the functions on her TV.

It never does any of the multi functions its supposed to. The tv function, it controls the volume 1/3 of the way and stops. I have found more functionality in 10 dollar universal remotes than in this thing. Im glad that some people found it useful. But it just consisstantly would not control any of my many devices.

Press the key more firmly to try and compensate, and you're likely to get the number coming up twice. I can't recall ever throwing a remote across the room, but I've been sorely tempted with this one. It does managed to get all my components turned on at once, but the annoyance is hardly worth it.

The process and the software worked fine, it just took a little time to get everything together.But be very wary that these and some other lines of Harmony remotes come with a serious hardware flaw that Logitech refuses to recognize - after about 1-2 years, the LCD on the remote turns blank. The remote is still functional, but given the many features that are dependent on the LCD display, it's basically useless. If you call Harmony CSRs they'll give you a 50% off coupon for remotes on their web site, but that price basically mirrors what you can get online elsewhere. So you'll need to spend the full price again.So, if you're willing to gamble that your remote won't break - it's a good unit. Otherwise it's $120 every two years."},{"rating":"1","title":"to much work for a remote","review":"I have 4 components on my harmony remote.

The web based configuration was a snap. The product is easy to use. Built in help leads you through any problems. My one complaint is that the buttons are small, which means my father-in-law still has difficulty with fat finger syndrome. This would be a perfect device if they made the buttons larger and crisped up the contrast for the LCD to help out those that our older so that us youngin's could buy them gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harmony 670","review":"Once the realization hit that this device, while excellent, can't think for itself, we were very happy with it. It depends on the components it controls being synchronized, so they all turn on at once etc...so if one component is turned on manually by a foolish meddler the synchronization is destroyed. The remote's help feature is then used to restore status quo ante.Setup software was well designed and easy to use.

I purposely did not go to the 680 because I did not want to worry about charging another gadget. This one works on batteries.This remote requires quite a bit of programming and you need to know each and every model number of the devices you want to control with the remote and the inputs of each.

Not a bad remote. The programming is o.k. though it would be nice to have a stand alone application instead of the web app. It did operate all of my equipment (media center pc, samsung plasma, yamaha receiver, and xbox) and the macros and learning functions all worked as expected.Two complaints:1) It really sucked down the batteries, and it seemed to do so randomly. Using the same brand of batteries, sometimes they would last a couple of months, sometimes only a couple of weeks. Very weird.2) As many others have posted, the LCD died after about 18 months. The remote still works, but without the screen, it's not really what I paid for and isn't usable by the rest of the family. It's outside the warranty and I don't feel like paying logitech $100+ for a remote for a year and a half, so I'm going with another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Bought this particular remote for the backlit buttons, which other models do not have. Initially it did not switch to the right channel on my old TV when using the \\"Watch DVD\\" button, but using the Help button on the remote it fixed the problem easily.

Nothing I had found in universal remotes prior to this would control the HTIB.The activity buttons work great (\\"Watch TV\\" and everthing comes alive with the correct settings) and the ability to program the \\"soft buttons\\" on the computer helps a lot.BEWARE - little or no documentation.

But these action keys were never able to change my TV's input properly. Everytime I would power up it seemed that it randomly selected an input. Then some times it would get into a mode where it would start cycling my TV on and off based upon key presses that had nothing to do with the power.Outside of the problems that I had it did have some other peculiar behaviors that I did not like.I was very disappointed with Logitech."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great remote - Does everything you want it to & then some!","review":"After some setting up using Logitec's CD, it had every one of my components.

And some of my equipment is OLD like from 1990's, but it controlled that too! There were some minor problems upon the first set up, but then you just plug it back in to your computer and fix them!

This remote controlls all of them , even sets the hdmi switch to the right channel ( which i didnt even expect it to do.) Setup was a very basic and easy, though it took some trial and error to customize the buttons on the lcd screen, but after a about an hour and a half evrything was ago, and put my 4 remotes to rest in a drawer.

They are junk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for consolidating remotes","review":"For a remote that does so much, it's incredibly easy to set up. I plugged it into my computer and just found each device in a list and the remote downloaded all the proper controls.I found only a few downsides. One, it has buttons like \\"watch TV\\" and \\"watch movie\\" which sends a series of signals to set up all your devices for that action. You have to use those buttons. You can't just turn the TV on or off by itself. And, when you click on one of those action buttons you have to hold the remote pointing at everything for about 5 seconds while it executes everything.My only other complaint is that there are some \\"custom\\" controls you can set up but they are confusing and I haven't been able to get them to do a few actions that I believe should have been standard with the remote. But if you have the time and patience to figure it out then you'll probably be fine (or if you have all equipment that is fairly new)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I was a little concerned after reading a few of the reviews, but it took me only 15 minutes to set up with Sony, Denon, Rotel, B&O;, DirecTV, and California Audio Labs equipment.

Only the components you are using stay on, one button and everything turns off - all of this without any tweaking after the initial configuration. I'm sure that I'll want to fine-tune some of the functions that we use the most but after the multitude of crummy \\"universal\\" remotes that took hours to set up and I still had to go through several steps to do what this one does with a single button press, I'm absolutely thrilled!I would NOT have spent the $233 MSRP for this, but well worth $80.I've only had it a few days, if I run into trouble later (poor battery life, crashing, etc...), I'll update this review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very functional \\"CLICKER\\"","review":"THIS IS A VERY GOOD REMOTE.

By mid January the display occasionally would freeze partially drawn, but we thought nothing of it since any function that could change the display still worked. Less than two weeks later the display stopped working altogether while all other functions still seemed fine. The batteries were still going strong, and the device had been handled well.Logitech tech support sent instructions to update the firmware but this did not help. They requested my contact information in that message, but my response--twice sent--received no reply [Update: beyond the initial reply, Logitech's responses were dated FIVE DAYS LATER!].Since the device failed within Amazon's return window, I'm washing my hands of it.

If you know how you turn on the TV, DVR, DVD with your multiple remotes you can program the Harmony in about 20 minutes or less. After programing, my Harmony worked flawlessly. Time Warner has since changed the interface for the cable/dvr, but I have had to make no changes to the Harmony remote. One button for all functions. The only negative is that once in awhile I have to turn on the backlight to make sure I hit the right button. On the other hand, there is a backlight and over time, I'm sure I'll have all the buttons memorized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great functionality, but too fragile","review":"First let me say that I love Harmony Remotes. They are great products in terms of functionality. Unfortunately the I've owned two 670's, both of which broke in the same way. The USB connector and IR light in the front became detached from the device. The thing is just not durable. Sure, it has been dropped or knocked off of the coffee table a couple of times, but the darn things are just too fragile. I believe the fact that I experienced the exact same issue on each of my remotes is proof of this fragility. I'm going to give Logitech one more try with the Harmony One.

I got it a few years ago and used it all the time! It could even control my xbox 360 to a certain degree. The software that comes with it is super easy to use, and if you spend the time, you can have a fully custimized remote. Be warned though, the view screen can take only so much punishment. I dropped mine on the tile floor all the time, and the screen cracked, rendering it useless in my opinion. I use it for my stereo's volume now, but not much else. Take care of it, and it will serve you very well. I will probably end up buying another one of these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!","review":"This is one slick remote. The USB programming is so much easier than the \\"old days\\" programming by pointing the old remote at the new one.High Points:1. It's Smart: it has a great way of dealing with situations where the devices are out of sync (e.g. TV on, DVD off).2. USB Programming: much easier to setup each device3. Most Devices Preconfigured: only my relatively old receiver took some time to setupChallenges:1. Software: it kept freezing until I uninstalled and reinstalled the version from the Logitech site. Who knows, maybe user error, maybe my laptop.2. Activity setup separate from devices: I was confused by having to setup both the DVD player buttons as a device, then doing the same setup for the activity3. Settings on the web: Not a huge disadvantage, but it seemed like overkill to setup a user-id and password to store my remote setting on a website. On the other hand, I guess if the remote is lost or broken, it's easier to setup a new remote.Overall, a great remote."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Remote","review":"We purchased this with our new Sony Bravia LCD TV.

I never could get the remote to link with the cable box remote (Time-Warner) or find a code that would work. It took many tries to get the other remotes to sync with the Harmony. Even when I got most units to work more steps were needed to turn on the TV, cable box, etc. than with a much older RCA universal remote as well as the original cable remote. I actually had a much easier time programming my Marantz amplifier remote to pretty much do the same thing that I was hoping the Harmony would do.

It's overly complex in trying to make life simple. Getting the remote to properly interface with my Sony blu-ray player was an exercise in frustration. First of all, it's ridiculous that the setup software for the remote did not include blu-ray or hd-dvd in it's menus .....really????? Secondly it's ridiculous the remote needs setup software (I'm sure many will argue this point). Once I got the remote to halfway work with my player it then would not let me add it to the watch a movie action, stating that none of my devices would output video. Why is this remote telling me what my devices can and cannot do??? Am I not supposed to be the one telling my remote what to do?

After spending at least an hour with a tech support person who was unable to help, I was referred to a next-level supervisor, whom I was never able to get on the phone because of long delays.

Then it asks you a bunch of questions. Then it crashes. Then it uploads the codes to your remote. At which point your remote will turn off your t.v., and not let you turn it back on.

There are only 2 issues that I have with the remote and, frankly, they are very minor:1) The center \\"wheel\\" that has the up/down/left/right arrows and ok button in the center is of the clicking variety. So, not only is it sometimes hard to press the direction required if you have large fingers but it also requires a click.2) It took some fine tuning to get it to properly control the TV input and power for a DVD player. In reality, it might have taken 15 minutes extra to get these working properly.I would purchase this remote again, no doubt, as it is easy to use, has all of the features you need to control a DVR, and will control about anything you can find that has a remote."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Choices Out There","review":"If you want to buy this watch because you think Navy Seals wear it--they don't.

I'm in the later category. I was originally disappointed by how quickly it went through batteries. Then, the minute hand came loose and now it just dangles. I've seen cheapo watches made better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Money, Poor Quality","review":"I have owned one of these watches for the past 4 years and replaced the battery once. One day the illuminated part of the second hand fell off and moves loosely on the clock face. The piece is big enough that it was able to jam the second hand stopping the watch. I did not notice for 2 hours. Customer Service was no better, send them $12.00 and the watch and they well call back later and give a price to repair it, no guarantees.Another complaint is the small date, you need a magnifying glass to see the date. Don't Navy Seals care about the date? If you are looking for a watch that ONE Navy Seal guy wore during his daily workouts, and don't care about the date or time, this is the watch for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the trash goes #2","review":"These watches are basically crap! I never read the reviews because I never actually bought one. I found my first one in a river near a Marine base in the Sierras and was impressed that it was working. When it failed (water under the crystal and it stopped working) a year later I sent it in to the company and was told that the warranty could not be validated. I received the second one as a gift. I only wore these watches while camping, fishing, and backpacking. I never wore it diving, and neither one went deeper in the water than 10 feet. The second one just failed. Again, the problem was water seeped in and it stopped working. I can't believe that Navy Seals or even Navy cooks rely on this watch. I would not reccommend that anyone buy the watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke twice in 2 years","review":"bought as a gift for $200. It failed the first time after 18 months and Luminox fixed it. Now it failed again 12 months later and Luminox will not fix under warranty. I believe they damaged the internal seal when repaired last time. They offered to replace it at $200 - when it has a street price of $150 or less.My last $25 casio digital watch lasted 5 years with no problems. Would not buy Luminox again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this watch","review":"After owning this watch for three months one of the lugs holding the strap broke off when it hit the edge of a table (this a watch supposedly made for Navy SEALS?). The manufacturer refused to repair/replace the case under the warranty and wanted $110 to do so as a watch repair. Add that to the fact that the watch is really light weight and the strap is stiff/uncomfortable to wear. Do yourself a favor and pass on this watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT USE THIS RETAILER - Arrived Damaged and Dead","review":"I was incredibly excited to find this watch for this price. I had already tried one on and knew the product would be of excellent quality, if it arrived in the condition it was supposed to. I first noticed a large green tag on the product which stated that the watch could not be returned if it was removed. Obviously this raised suspicion as it implied that the company anticipated a lot of returns. Watching the action of the watch, it continuously stalled and would not keep accurate time, indicating a near-dead battery. In examining the back of the watch, there was a large dent in the carbon casing in the back of the watch body. I am immediately sending this back and buying from a better retailer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great features, poor quality","review":"I bought this watch brand new from a large military/police supply site online and loved it for 10 months. Then for no apparent reason, the second hand fell off. It lodged in the minute hand and stopped it. I went on Luminox site and found that they wont even fix a watch of theirs unless you prove it came from an \\"authorized distributor\\", which I found out to my dismay the site I bought it from is not (of course they dont tell you that when you buy it). So if Luminox wont stand behind their own products bought brand new in box, they must know that they are garbage...Who doesnt stand behind their products anymore? Wow"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I had the same problem as the others, bought it, looked great, had to have it repaired, they charged me for the repair, came back and still did not work.

I don't know about its water-proof ability but have tested the stress durability of this watch. I'm really hard on things and have worn this daily and after 15+ years only has a couple of scratches on the front. None of the minute numbers have worn off as other mentioned. In contrast, I received (also as a gift)an equally priced sissy metro-sexual Italian watch (can't even remember the brand) and wore it ONCE before gouging the bezel glass. I threw it in a draw somewhere and haven't seen it since. I'm thinking about buying another Luminox soon and hope the quality hasn't decreased as some of these reviews indicate. I don't get it cause something that ticks away for 15+ years keeping perfect time and can be clearly seen day/night is an outstanding value."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAP PLASTIC WATCH","review":"My model 3001 just broke for the 3rd time. The first two times it just quit and they fixed it under warranty. Now that I'm out of warranty, the stem will not go back in. I was told there is NO warranty on the stem, even if it was new. They will fix it for $95 - it's $165 new.It will still keep time, but is no longer waterproof. I don't think I'll throw away any more money on this watch and I won't buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"I have had two of these watches. I went swimming with them on but no diving. They both stopped over time presumably because the battery needed to be replaced.

Who really wants a $200 disposable watch?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a quality product... stay with a Seiko if you want quality","review":"My Luminox is 18 months old. I'm not tough on watches at all, so I'm mystified why my Luminox is looking ratty.The crystal is cracked and I never remember any traumatic episode involving this watch. The luminous numbers on the outer dial were wearing off within 2 weeks. I've had better luck than others with the watch band. I bought this watch as a slightly more expensive alternative to a Seiko 5. Frankly, the Seiko 5 would be a better alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as I expected GREAT","review":"I wanted a rugged quartz watch for everyday wear.

Second attempt four days later I received a somewhat vague \\"Our Service Center can help you with this at 401-946-0920 or info@saltzmans-watches.com.\\"To say I'm disappointed in Luminox, both their product and support, is an understatement."},{"rating":"2","title":"This company provides a fantastic service.","review":"This is by far the best watch that I have ever owned.

It is a great watch, as long as you never use it!","review":"Would not own another one of these if you paid me. Twice the second hand has fallen off. The seller states that will easily happen if the watch is dropped. Really, a watch that is marketed as one used by and up to the rigors of the Navy Seals? The funny part is, the watch has never been dropped and is treated like it is made out of egg shells. I have owned many watches over the years and never has a second hand fell off any of them once, let alone twice.

Mine had the tan background.The watch worked fine until the battery needed replaced about 2 months ago.I had a jewler replaced the battery, and soon after the time ran about 2 minutes slow.I replaced the battery myself, and the watch died.I took it to a Luminox dealer, and they told me the movement needed replaced, and the repair estimate was$97.00.I told them to forget about repairing it.This is suppose to be a Navy Seal watch that should take some hard use?I sure hope the Seals don't actually use this watch.I will never buy another Luminox product!!!Save your money, and buy another brand. This watch is a POS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Customer Servcie","review":"After about three years the watch died. Fair enough, it needed a new battery. The Luminox website states that it needs to be send back to Luminox for a new battery. So I printed off the pdf form the Luminox website, but had a simple question, so I emailed them. Nothing, no response. So I finally took it to a local jeweler who inserted a new battery and it now works just fine. I suppose that I now cannot send it back to Luminox, but who cares? In summary, a neat watch that is not backed up by its supplier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible watch, worse service","review":"Please do yourself a favor and avoid Luminox watches at all cost.I am a firefighter and assumed that a watch good enough for Navy Seals would meet my on the job needs as well. How wrong I was.After less than a year I cracked the crystal by setting the watch on a plastic countertop. Apparently they are not made to handle impact of any kind. Navy Seals must be a fragile bunch.After considerable hassle, the Luminox service center repaired the watch, but charged me an outragous $120 dollars - and it took them all of 16 weeks.Several months later the glow-in-the-dark paint fell off of the second hand and now sits inside the watch housing, getting pushed around by the hands.I like the look of this watch, but the quality is terrible. Even worse, it costs more to fix the frequently broken parts than it costs to buy a better watch.Give your money to a watchmaker with a quality product who cares about its customers - Luminox is not that company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a G Shock Instead","review":"The tritium is nice but the case is flimsy; leaked after battery change.

Take note that the watch was never abused or damaged in any way. I called JOMASHOP to get a return order for repairs. First off the person I got spoke such broken English I had to have him repeat everything he said. Sometimes several times. The watch is in the two year warranty time frame but JOMASHOP will not back up the warranty.

I tried it one time and it seemed to be better, but who knows, it was only one time to test it out. I just think for this price, it should work flawlessly (at least do what it is supposed to do).

I read the instructions on the hose about waiting a minute to turn it out, etc, etc.I can hold my hand over the flames for well over a minute, this thing just isn't getting hot enough.

So I hope it's not the grill that is severly underpowered.As someone else said - this should be slamdunk but it isn't. One star rating until I can figure out what's going on here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough heat","review":"Bought the Weber Q for Christmas. Tried to grill that day. Weber Q doesn't put out enough heat. Seems like the propane doesn't flow well enough in the cold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Animals chew through my hose","review":"I've had this hose only two weeks and some animal chewed through the hose. I think it was a squirrel. Some of the other reviews say not to let food/grease fall on to the hose, but I've had it only two weeks and my hose is very clean. The squirrels still chewed through the hose. I think Weber used a very tasty rubber or something. Do not buy this hose if you intended to leave your grill outside."},{"rating":"2","title":"tip for using this adapter","review":"When we first hooked up the hose and ignited our weber, it lit right up. But then the flame was uneven and wouldn't stay lit. It turns out that after you hook it up and open the propane valve, you have to wait 60 seconds before igniting the grill. It does say it in the directions, but of course, we didn't read those first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough heat (same as the others)","review":"I have had the same problems as those who comment below with this adapter hose. I can't grill using the adapter hose because there is not enough gas flowing to the grill. One day the hose would not work and I had an extra small blue tank (portable tank) and hooked that up and it worked fine (so its probably not the cold weather). Something is wrong with the hose. . . review below mentions waiting 60 seconds to turn the gas on the grill. I will go try that now and see if that works if it doesn't then don't waste your money on something that you can't use.EDIT:Used the directions below, and that seemed to make the hose work normally, I'll change my rating to 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"$17.00 at Lowes","review":"Not the same brand but it is the same thing... This ain't brain surgery here kids! lets keep it real!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but Touchy","review":"Like the other reviewers here, I find that this connector is a little touchy. The directions say to turn on the gas slowly and then let is \\"settle\\" for at least 60 seconds. In my 1-2 times per week usage (yes even in the Winter months in the Northeast), I have instituted the habit of turning it on (not carefully) and leaving it for 5 minutes while I go to get stuff ready to put on the grill (instead of the other way around). In this way, I side-step the whole issue of whether I've tripped the safety mechanism in the hose.I will say this, though: I know why they put the safety device in the hose, and I've already needed it once when I turned on the tank not realizing that I had bumped the grill dial into an \\"ON\\" position. If it wasn't for the safety mechanism, I would AT LEAST have wasted 10 pounds of propane or worst case taught my kids how to file a life insurance claim.It's a good feature to have; it would just be nice to be able to \\"have my cake and eat it too.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible. Don't bother. (Read for update)","review":"I bought this to go with my Weber Q. It worked maybe twice, and now I can't get any gas to the grill. I've tried the reset procedure over and over. I've tried opening the valve of the propane tank over a 10 minute period, then waiting 5 mins before trying to light the grill. Nothing works. Now I have a 20 lb propane tank that's unusable with my grill. My advice, don't frustrate yourself with this product. Obviously with this many people writing that it doesn't work, odds are pretty good you'll be disappointed like we are.**Update: I contacted Weber about this problem and they quickly agreed to ship me a replacement. Apparently there is a known issue with some of the hoses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined in 1 month","review":"Buy this hose only if you have no squirrels or other rodents where you live. They bite right through this Weber hose, they ruined mine after just 1 month of use. A far better product that does the same thing is the Freedom Grill FG-50HA hose. It is stainless steel braid hose, and animal proof. It is slightly shorter, but still plenty long enough to reach from the Q grill at table height to a 20 lb cylinder on the ground. Thanks for earlier reviews that point to the FG-50HA. I bought it and it works great with my Q."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Blocks","review":"I have to admit that I was a bit nervous about the price, but after reading so many great reviews, I was willing to give it a try. The blocks came packaged very tightly, so there wasn't any worry of damage during shipping. The colors are beautiful (if the yellow is a bit light in a dimly lit room), and I love the embossing. The animal pictures are very cute, and I'm thinking of getting the lower case blocks for the baby versions.My one complaint is that while there are four complete alphabets, there were several blocks that had multiple versions of the same letter on the block. It made it quite a puzzle to spell out my little one's name for decoration until she is old enough to play with them.They haven't been played with, so I can't comment on how well they hold up, but they seem very sturdy and well crafted. If nothing else, they make a beautiful decorative addition to a traditional nursery."},{"rating":"2","title":"good quality blocks","review":"I bought these blocks after a lot of research for my daughter for her 1st birthday. I read about a lot of blocks with toxic paint and ones that the wood chips off, but these blocks have held up great!

She likes to stack them and carry them around!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Blocks","review":"THE PRODUCT:1) These are unsealed wooden blocks with a non-toxic paint. Great for kids.2) They are beautifully embossed and painted. When opening the box, my wife gasped at how beautiful they were. They truly reminded me of my childhood and have the feeling that they've been passed down from a time when toys were meant to last.3) Each side has a different shape, pattern, animal, letter, etc. so there is plenty that you can do with them, besides build.SHIPPING:1) My order was placed and I received shipping notification within 2 hours of placing the order. They arrived 2 days later.OVERALL:These are a great product and remind me that quality products are still available. If anyone is looking for a timeless gift of high quality, these are the ticket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware sharp edges and corners","review":"These blocks are beautiful to look at. But dangerous for small hands. They are fresh off the cutting block. No finishing touches to smoothen the edges and corners. Had to use fine sandpaper to smoothen edges myself. Easy to do, but very time consuming. For the price of these blocks, you shouldn't have to put in the extra time and money to make them safe for kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best ABC blocks, but not the best blocks","review":"After searching high and low for ABC blocks (a toy that I feel is essential in a child's staple of educational toys), Uncle goose's ones are probably the best I have come across: big in size, thus absolutely safe for kids, NO chemical smell since water based dye is used, no sharp edges. The finishing is quite good also, though not as good and fine as HABA's blocks'."},{"rating":"2","title":"great block set","review":"We recently ordered this set for our 8-month old son, who had shown interest in other wooden blocks when he had a chance to play with them. These are slightly bigger than I expected them to be, but he has no trouble picking them up, even in his relatively small hands. In fact, they present just enough of a challenge to make it interesting, and he loves picking them up, putting them in his mouth, banging them, and on and on. It's wonderful that such a simple toy provides so much joy.The blocks are very well made--not cheap feeling at all. They were more than I wanted to spend, but because of their size and quality of build, I think they are actually a really good value. (We only take out about 8 at a time to play with at this point.) They seem like they will last a long time and continue to be fun to play with for many more months, at least, for my son. I look forward to purchasing more products from Lindenwood, as I am very satisfied with the worksmanship and value for these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drool proof!","review":"We've had these for 2.5 years, now on our second kid. We had some cheapie blocks from a big box store and my daughter put them in her mouth. Next thing I know blue paint was in and around her mouth, yuck!

They are high-quality, very attractive, wooden blocks. My nine-month-old LOVES them. He doesn't yet know how to stack them, but he sure loves knocking them down when I pile them up. He enjoys taking them out of a box and spreading them around greatly. That they are made from wood (without the concerns about phthalates and BPA) and with non-toxic paints were both reassuring facts as, of course, many of them have been mouthed. Highly recommend these blocks if you're in the market for some."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant blocks, made in the USA, perfect size","review":"Got these when my little one was a year old. Now he's three, and he still loves playing with them. Very elegant. I've seen these in parenting magazines several times.Light weight. Won't hurt as much as heavy blocks if they topple over your little stacker.Perfect size. A 6-month old can get a good grip, and it's not too small to be a choking hazard.No worry about toxic paints. It's made in the USA.I love these blocks. They're worth every penny. My mommy friends liked them too and ask me where I got them. Some of them even bought a set. Highly recommend them.Caution for adults though: Don't walk around barefoot with these blocks scattered on the floor. It will surely hurt when you step on one.

So I was glad when I found these online. They are a little more expensive but well worth it. The carving on each block is beautiful, the colors are saturated and do not peel off, and each block has letters, numbers, and picture of an animal. My son loves to stack them up to make towers and so does my husband! They play a game where my husband stacks them and my son runs up and knocks them down. They are blocks so the corners are sharp but if there is a block out there with rounded edges I haven't heard of it or seen it. Absolutely gorgeous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality, Made in USA","review":"Why buy these blocks rather than Melissa and Doug?1.

My mother in law had ones just like this from when my husband was a kid, and my daughter loved them so much that I bought us a new set! Very high quality!

I'm very very pleased with these."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love these!","review":"I love these blocks. I bought them for my son as a Christmas present.

I also remember enjoying blocks as a kid myself. I got these because of the good reviews on Amazon, and I was not disappointed! They are handmade in the USA from quality wood, and are completely non-toxic (ink, wood, all), which is great because my baby likes to put almost everything she can get her hands on in her mouth. The designs on the blocks are pretty and bright, which are stimulating to baby now and will be fun to help her learn letters, numbers, and animal names as she grows. Additionally, the manufacturer offers individual replacement blocks in case any of the set becomes lost or damaged. Definitely worth paying a little more for these blocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well made!","review":"These blocks are colorful, fun, and well made.

So why do the western writers of today think they must use God's name when cursing in their books. It is a real downer for me and I have quit reading several books I have bought and would like to give them back for a refund if I knew how to do that.

That will never change. I personaly find this album a little sad to listen to, with Jerry singing on only 1 track. I don't think anyone can say \\"I'm happy that the band shifted creative control to a back-up singer.\\" with a straight face. If you want the best of the Dead, you need \\"Europe '72\\", \\"Jerry Garcia (1972)\\" and \\"Mars Hotel\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrapin Station Pt. I is a masterpeice, album is bad.","review":"Without a doubt, Terrapin Station Part One is an absolute masterpeice, and, in my opinion, by far the best Dead song. Estimated Prophet is also good, but all of the other tracks on the CD really suck. Dancin' in the Streets has to be the absolute nadir of the Dead's musicianship. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this CD. Besides, nothing compares to Terrapin Station live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obvious talent but....Who is this?","review":"Objectively, this is not a bad CD. Estimated Prophet is a great tune for example. However, after that opening song, it's not the Dead experience (of course many would argue that the Dead experience is only live but I love their studio sound as well). Side 1 is completely missing Jerry Garcia's vocals which is to me one of the signatures of the band. The whole side sounds like Fleetwood Mac (a great band, nothing against them). And side 2 sounds like of all people, Jethro Tull...musically anyway (another great band, nothing against them either). Finally there are actual arrangements for massed strings! It does not surprise me that people like or even love this album, but if anyone thinks that this will be an extension of the four 5 star studio albums from Workingman's to Mars Hotel will be really surprised.....and possibly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars for the Journey","review":"This is the one CD that I listen to again and again- it really stands the test of time. A special album as far as Dead releases are concerned, the song \\"Terrapin Station\\" takes up half the CD and is great to listen to on road trips (and other trips). The orchestration, instrumentation and recording job are superb- every note rings true. The song \\"Passenger\\" is an upbeat, convoluted jam which has a rolling groove. \\"Sunrise\\" has an exceptional female singer and gets to the heart of the Dead message (listen to how the heartbeats at the end dovetail with the lyrics)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative If Not Spectacular","review":"Boy I never thought I would see or hear the day when the Grateful Dead would record a symphony. The Terrapin Station Suite is very different from anything the Dead has done in the past. And its done quite well. I just wonder who they got to supply the orchestral arrangements. The other songs are quite interesting as well. The quality falls short of American Beauty, Workingman's Dead, Shakedown Street, and the live CD's due to a slightly unnatural sound. However, the quality is still there."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Dead Album","review":"This has to be the worst Dead album of them all. The only reason I bought it was because it has Estimated Prophet on it. Why in the world did they let Donna sing a song solo? It's terrible! If you want to hear crappy disco buy this. If you want to hear GOOD music buy Europe '72 or American Beauty. DON'T BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Largely awful","review":"Garcia is barely audible amidst the cacophony of disco, microphone-hogging Donna, new-age Mickey Hart noise, an orchestra, and a choir. This album is, above all, sad; it's hard to imagine Garcia was even conscious of its recording. In 1977 everything the Dead were had been displaced...their glory years were over and disco, materialism and new conservatism predominated the culture. Unfortunately, Garcia withdrew and fell into heavy drug addiction. With the exception of Estimated Prophet and the first half or so of Terrapin, this album is forgettable at best. The bombastic orchestral and chorale segments of Terrapin are laughable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grateful Dead's second-best studio album","review":"Even though I hate ranking things, if someone were to put a gun to my head, I would consider this to be the Grateful Dead's second-best studio album.Being a collection of ultra-produced songs--in a manner invoking British art rock--, the album provides a perfect contrast for the band's live recordings. The album gets even more interesting when one notices that the band, years after its release, starts to imitate parts of it in their concerts.As an owner of the album for over 20 years, I only recently developed such a high estimation of it. I used to do what many other listeners did: skip the first five songs and focus on the seemingly more ambitious title song. Now, however, I can also appreciate the layers of care that have been placed into the shorter songs.My only complaint about this album is that it is too short. All I am asking is for an ultra produced version of every Grateful Dead song!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boy(band) was I disappointed...","review":"I guess I got completely swept up in my new love affair with Robbie Williams. I really was excited to order this retrospective of music of the band that help shape and mold the funk/pop/sex-god/in-yer-face Robbie Williams into the master of Escapology. Nothing on this CD remotely reminds me of Robbie. All I can say is thank God he was able to escape with his talent! Not only is the music here sappy (and, believe me, I expected that to a degree) but the recording is weak. I have to turn the levels up on my system so high that when I play any other CD the volume scares the hell out of me. Weak songs, weak voices, weak harmonies and a weak recording make for an investment I regret.

Very different, not your cookie cutter bockbuster, seen it a thousand times plot. Also not the type of movie where any actor with a pretty face could fill the main role.

Despite the huge collection of cake books I've managed to accumulate in the last few years, and the constant baking and recipe experimentations going on in my kitchen, I was captivated by how accessible, yet professional and versatile it is. Starting with all the basics, it goes in details and techniques, which are clearly explained and easy to follow. Loved it - I'm buying another one for my own cake decorating library.One thing a beginner may find confusing is the fact that the recipes are listed in weight - read: you need a good kitchen scale. Weighing ingredients produces much more consistent results than using the popular cup/spoon measures, so don't be scared by this. Instead, befriend the kitchen scale to enjoy scrumptious cakes under the masterful decorations - which this book definitely guides through and helps achieve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie theater GOOD!","review":"I LOVE this popcorn!

Diane Kruger is the bait that lures Bastien into a weekend at their country estate. It is here where the real fun and nightmare begins. As the invited guest, he is treated to the an evening with the wife, later given the frightening experience of feeding a caged flock of vultures. This is a beginning ...

Although this CD is expensive for five songs, its worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Standard-setting rock/techno. Charged with disturbance.","review":"Considered the breakthrough album for NIN, this heavily rhytmic Alernative CD contains some of the best musical elements of the genre. The band's use of hard hitting guitar against relentless rhythms and solid synth work makes it a sure bet. The lyrics are no less expressive. Dark desperation intertwines with an even darker humor, to take those willing to listen deeper into the obsessive-compulsive mind of Trent Reznor."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this series","review":"Yu Yu Hakusho is one of those animes that is better enjoyed when you have time to sit down and watch the episodes in succession. It is very good, and has a very well-developed plot in my opinion. I would recommend this series for anyone who enjoys animes such as 'Inuyasha' or 'One Piece' (just to name a couple). It's very light-hearted, the fights are not too violent, and the teens in this series actually act like teens. I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally incomplete","review":"Carnegie Hall has been around for 100 years and this documentary tells the story in less than one hour. Give me a break. It should be at least twice as long. There are plenty of comments from performers but not even one complete performance. And way too much time is spent on the upstairs studios.

I was introduced to Bill Evans on a Jazziz magazine CD and was hooked to the song \\"Swing Hop\\". Enough so to actually buy the CD and it was fantastic. \\"Reality\\" has to be my favorite song if I must just choose one. <G> I love music that combines different genres together and Bill knows how to do that.

The author's first example in Chapter 2 I did not even realize was an example until they expected me to run it in chapter 3! There were no instructions on how to create the COM client, just several lines of code. This set the tone of the book.When I tried to run the author's code examples they failed.There were also multitudinous spelling errors and discrepencies between the Figures and the instructions.Though the authors clearly know their subject, I will have to find another book if I wish to learn COM and DCOM. This book is basically worthless as far as the examples go."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recommanded","review":"the title is misleading! there isn't much DCOM in the book. it is also very expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic, confused but an ok Step-by-Step","review":"It has some interesting basic examples that are helpful to figuring out how to use ATL Wizards and playing with some basic COM development.

For example, it fails to mention you need a #define _WIN32_DCOM in your clients StdAfx.h file in order to be able to call CoCreateInstanceEx(). Only one chapter is devoted to distributing COM classes, and it is only 15 pages long."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good *practical* introduction to COM","review":"This book is ideal for any proficient C++ programmer who needs to delve into the practical world of COM. Though riddled with typos, which i am sure is a testament to how quick the authors had to get this to press, the book is easy to follow. The examples though are sometimes a little misplaced but if you read the book twice over which i did for the second time in three days, then you should get something out of this book.However the title of the book is inappropriate since the authors really only devote one chapter to DCOM, which is a little lame to say the least. The best chapter is the one that deals with callbacks and bidirectional communication. Those who need to implement push/pull applications well be delighted with this.If you persist and work thru' the examples,then you will get a lot out of this book. If you want to understand more about how COM really works, buy Don Box's \\"Essential COM\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of errors and \\"look elsewhere for answers\\"","review":"It's a nice introduction to COM/DCOM. The authors go over the basics, over and over and over again. Then they lead you through several simple examples.You get a step-by-step overview to very elementary COM/DCOM concepts.You will find phrases such as \\"if you want more information, buy a book on OLE/automation.\\" That's what I thought I bought *this* book for! Too much goes unexplained, waved away with a magic wand. Many of the examples don't compile (the authors tell you to build a project without MFC and then use MFC classes within it).Recommendation: If you have trouble getting started with COM/DCOM, this will help. Expect to obtain more materials to actually understand what's happening and how to do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"If football is about enjoyment, the FA got it wrong!","review":"If you never believed that 90's football was about enjoyment of the masses and had a sneeking suspecion that it had more to do with business then this is the book for you! It neatly dismisses all those long forgotten myths that football is for the fans and replaces it with the notion that football is about the business ethos. It takes a look at power, control and the men in grey suites who are determined to take the game away from the true fans and place it in the hands of the only people who can afford the ticket prices! It also serves the excellent perpous of confirming the fans view of their identity and where it comes from. This will make all football fans realise that you don't have to be a Nick Hornby to care . . . but it helps! If you are one of the few who still care and want to know a bit more about how they are dirtying the beautiful game, get a copy now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful read for kids and parents","review":"My four year old and my six year old (who reads very well) both find all of the Alistair books delightful.

Excellent reads, very enjoyable. The only drawback is this particular edition is edited into modern English, so the original flavor of MacDonald's writing is lost. While that has its advantages, especially in readability, still this aren't the books that MacDonald wrote and that C. S. Lewis named as some of his favorites. If you are a casual reader that just wants some of the finest English fiction from the late Victorian period, I highly recommend this edition. If you're a fan of MacDonald, though, you might want to keep looking for the unaltered originals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good","review":"When a friend recommended this book to me, I thought she was out of her mind. The stories were written in the 1800s and the writer was from Scotland, of all places. I decided to read it anyway, and was greatly surprised! It takes a little while to get into it, and if you can overlook the fact that it's not a modern setting, it actually gets pretty good. This book is actually three books in one. It starts with the story of an unmarried vicar in a small Scottish town, and ends years later with his daughter's story. There are some very interesting characters in this book. The vicar is very human and very loving (and non-judgmental). I would recommend this book to middle/high schoolers. It would make a great summer reading or even a homeschool supplement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hobby tool","review":"I just purchased this rotary cutter and Im delight with it, it just slides over the material like butter, it cutts the same over paper than fabric, my only gripe is that it would benefit from a guide to use with a ruler but is is a minor concern.The handle is easy to grip and feels solid, overall a great purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT LITTLE TOOL","review":"I'm very happy with this nifty little tool. I have a cheap and tiny rotary cutter that I never used because it didn't work well. This is a huge improvement.

You defiantly get what you pay for. I started to use it when making a quilt and it began to fall apart almost from the start, the screw that holds the blade in is attached to the safety (or not so safe) guard and the screw begins to loosen with every roll of the blade.

Well I tried 3 pieces of thin cotton and it would not cut period, checked blade it is in correct, went to one layer and still have to run blade over the cut several times and it still would not cut through the material, had to finish some cuts with scissors. Not impressed with this expensive piece of junk"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment and a waste of money","review":"While I like the handle design of this cutter, the blade it came with couldn't cut a slice of pie. I tried to cut through two layers of muslin. Plain old muslin. It couldn't do it although the packaging states, \\"Cuts through materials including several layers of fabric, paper, felt and vinyl\\". So I tried cutting through just one layer of muslin. It made a few half inch slits after I ran the cutter over the muslin 5 or 6 times but it never cut through a 14 inch length, I wound up using scissors. I've had great luck with Fiskars' scissors but I'm not even going to try replacement blades for this. If the blade that came with the product can't cut, right out of the package, what hope would I hold for more blades? None.

After that I took up quilting and this cutter has done a wonderful job for me on almost every cutting task for >15 years. Recently the retraction button snapped off -- no surprise that plastic got brittle after that long. I bought an identical cutter to replace my old favorite. While tossing the packaging I happened to see the lifetime warranty on the back. I wrote to Fiskars on their web site to ask if my old product carried the same warranty. They didn't need to see the broken cutter... they just sent me a new one. Great product, great company, GREAT customer service. I recommend this comfortable cutter to all my quilting friends. Regarding reviewers who said the blade retracts spontaneously, I suspect this was due to unintentionally allowing their thumb to lean or press against the retraction button. Keep the thumb on the thumb rest atop the cutter and that problem disappears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not handy","review":"I used to have a rotary cutter that had a guard that was spring-loaded so the blade only came out when I pressed down to cut. That way I could slide the cutter sideways up to the ruler edge and cut. The blade on this one is always exposed and I have to carefully position it. It takes more time and I nick it on the ruler edge frequently. It has a comfortable handle, but that doesn't outweigh the drawbacks for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"I purchased this product after my sewing instuctor talked about rotary cutters in our class. It seemed to take me forever to cut out a pattern so I decided to purchase one. I'm so glad I did. It's so much easier and faster than working with ordinary scissors. Since I'm new to sewing I don't have any experience working with other rotary cutters. However, I have not had any issues or problems with these and the price was affordable. They were less that the scissors I purchased. I would recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy Addition to the Tool Box","review":"One hand operation makes these a handy addition to the scissors in my sewing tool box and will let me cut fabrics which I've been afraid to try before.

I anticipate great success even with a stretch satin bought for an evening dress."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I bought this cutter because of the reviews it got here on Amazon. Unfortunately I cannot say I like it much at all and I'm hoping Santa brings me a new one this year.

This makes it a bit tedious to read at first. However as she grows older in the story, her language matures too.The most striking point is that unlike Azadeh Moaveni's book, Ms. Latifi has had a more rounded exposure. I heard from my own father who was there during the upheaval, that Arabic was constantly heard on the streets of Tehran. Knowing that Arafat was the first other important and equivalent Head of State to arrive in Iran at the time, I am releaved to read that she too (through her mother) attests to the fact that the first firing squads were made up Palestinians.

Read it as fiction and you'll be fine. Placing any significant amount of factual value on it is like taking the National Inquirer as a legitimate source of news.Unfortunately, this is yet another book in a series of a dozen or so which very similarly chronicle the life story of children who were forced to leave Iran when the revolution hit and are now grown up to write their own \\"memoirs\\" with amazing recollection of the events of 26 years ago, when they were mere children.

The two Stereotomys, Beaujolais, and In the Real World are all good juggling songs. Light of the World and Limelight are very good ballads. The only weak points of the album are the instrumentals. Where's the Walrus and Urbania are both good, but could be much better. Chinese Whispers I am not sure about, as the moment it sounds like it is about to start, it turns into Stereotomy Two.This album is made even better by the fact that it marks the end of an Era for Parsons. After this album, all of Parsons' work (excluding Gaudi, which I don't have) is full of interesting concepts that are just missed by the lyrics, or even, in some cases (Call Up on Time Machine), downright butchered by the lyrics.Stereotomy is a great album, has lyrics that hit the concepts on the head, and is very much worth owning.Oh yeah, a great juggling album as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alan Parsons Project - One Of Their Hardest Rocking Discs","review":"\\"Stereotomy\\" is another good APP disc. This one is probably one of the band's hardest rocking. APP is never really heavy, but there are some really good rockers on this one including the title track, \\"In The Real World\\", \\"Beaujolais\\", and \\"Stereotomy Two\\". The ballads are all strong as well. \\"Limelight\\" is outstanding and \\"Light Of The World\\" is also a nice one. The only weak point on this disc is the instrumentals. They are ok, but are not on a par with some of APPs better ones. It is also notable that Eric Wolfson only sings a portion of one song on the whole disc which seems unusual. Overall this is not the best APP album, but I have always enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book!","review":"This book is high quality. It stands up to hundreds of readings, and has lasted through three children. The verse and illustrations are engaging and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Illustrated and Fun to Read (or Sing!)","review":"I was fortunate to buy 4 hardback Iza Trapani books through a special offer at my child's school. This is my favorite of the set (the others books are The Itsy Bitsy Spider, Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, and I'm a Little Teapot, my other favorite). All of these books are just beautifully done. Ms. Trapani takes favorite nursery rhymes and turns them into entertaining stories that just beg to be sung (she even puts the music on the last page in case you don't know the tune). Her exceptional drawings really add to the fun. My 5-year-old son and 2-year-old daughter absolutely adore these books and they are short enough that I don't mind reading them every night (only Twinkle Twinkle sort of wears me out singing it). Baa Baa also provides a morale to the story centered around not assuming and giving from the heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angels & Monsters","review":"Children's perspective of cancer is presented in this uplifting book through their own words, drawings, and photographs. Despite our natural sadness when confronted with this subject, the reader senses courage and hope when turning the pages of this book. Sadness is there as well, but the faith and fighting spirit of these children remind us of the resilience and strength and unceasing hope within all of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart and Soul","review":"What impresses me most about this touching book is that the children tell the story. Through their candid words and telling pictures, we enter a world that no one ever expects to find themselves in; much less a young child. And yet, the message conveyed is simple: hope. Hope to enjoy life... no matter the length of it. Billy Howard's photograpy allows the soul of each child to shine through. Buy this book. You won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It has its moments, but overall disjoint and unfocused","review":"Robert Sheckley has written some great, absurd satire, so I'm interested when he comes up with something new. I enjoyed the early chapters of this book, but as it went along, it simply lost focus, randomly introducing and abandoning characters and situations. It was clever in many ways, but the disintegrating structure lost me.Sheckley wrote many short stories in the 1950's and 60's, and some say those were his best work. It has probably always been a challenge for him to hold a long story together. But some of his novels have been great -- my favorites are \\"Mindswap\\" and \\"Journey of Joenes\\". Most of his work is out of print, but it's worth looking for if you've got a taste for the absurd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"This book had some interesting ideas and situations in it, but the author never bothered to bring closure to any of it. The focus shifts bewilderingly from character to character without much in the way of a unifying plot to it. The final pages are a stopping point rather than an ending or resolution. It was extremely frustrating to have spent the time reading this book, only to seemingly watch the whole thing come apart by the finish and result in nothing.I won't be reading this author in the future. And I'd suggest the publisher hire better editors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real view of VR future","review":"This books shows you, how the world is changing and what could be the result of those changes.

People play this virtual game a lot and it is the biggest virtual game in the world. But people have been taking the game too seriously and are trashing people's apartments, and ruining their computers and hurting them. They hire a girl to figure out who's been doing this and some interesting things happen but I won't tell you. This book is okay but don't buy it.

Comparing his book with his last book, Virtual Vandals, This was somewhat more than expected. I enjoyed this book even more because of the huge amounts of suspension. I admit the book was very slow to begin and i thought that there was excessive amount of description and detail in the book and not enough dialect.

To keep it short I don't see the beneficial effect of avoiding 'confusing' descriptions of movements and therefore the actual link between the positions depicted in the photographs. This book is still of some use to me but only after I grasped the basic movements in a training (luckily with a Chen family member). Once these basic ideas of the various positions are somewhat clearer the book helps to recollect the steps one might not be sure of.Anyway if you plan to train with a master more then 3 times a week you will simply not have much use for the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Cost of Shipping","review":"Read the title.

Obviously, it is not possible to learn Taiji from a book. The job of a Taiji book is therefore to provide answers and insights not available in the normal course of study. This book provides virtually nothing; in fact, it seems more than anything to be a marketing pamphlet for Ren's school.

At least that way, I'd have my ten minutes back.Chen Xiao Wang's 38 form is not \\"standard curriculum\\" in China.

The lyrics and music are powerful. \\"Heroes\\" is an appropriate and thoughtful song for honoring and recognizing heroes of the past and present. My least favorite is \\"Washington's Hat.\\" It takes some creative liberties with the lyrics. The children love the catchiness of the tune, however. This would be great for all ages of children.

The film seems to focus on meaningless interactions between characters that do nothing to move the plot along, and all of the action takes place in about the last 10 minute. There are several places where you may think things will start to pick up, but it never does. Edited down to about 20 minutes, this could have made for a mildly amusing short film; as it is, it's just overwrought and boring.Of course, if you're like me, you are going to watch this movie no matter what you read about it--and you should!

While not, perhaps, meant to be a tourist video, I do think that showing some highlights (surely there must be some) of this unique city might have been shown.

I'd just like to add that it was poorly edited. Two examples follow: In more than one instance, research assistants are referred to as undergraduates after they have been introduced as graduate students. Also, on page 167 (hardcover) a graph is displayed with 10^4, 10^5, 10^6, (powers of 10) on the x-axis. Two pages later, while discussing the graph, the characters state that the axis is labelled 4, 5, 6, etc...While I'm irritated by little things like spelling errors, I can usually read over them. _Cosm_ suffers from a criminally bad job of editing that makes a mediocre story worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's rare that I don't finnish a novel","review":"I usually slog through to the end, even if I'm not really enjoying it.But I just couldn't bring myself to start another 10 page chapter on the protagonist's dating woes. I picked this book up because I thought the idea of a new universe appearing inside of a particle accelerator was interesting. So far, 100 pages in, the science fiction has been a subplot to the more important story about how tough it is to juggle an academic carreer and still have a social life.Benford ought to realize that people read science fiction for the ideas, the science, not deep character studies. No one expects Les Miserables when they pick up a book of hard science fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"good modern hard science fiction","review":"I liked this book a lot. I think it's a modern update of the hard science fiction I grew up on in the 50s and early 60s; that is, it has the developed characters we have become used to in modern fiction, but the science is central to the story and is kept plausible and interesting.I thought the author's view of the daily life of a university physics professor was pretty much on the money (no surprise, he's in a position to know).Not a real cosmic shaker like Ringworld, but a good read anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat, boring, stagnant","review":"I have read other books by Greg Benford and have been surprised by the difference among them. His weakness is characterization - they just sit there No true internal development; this was especially true in this case where he stars as a young black cosmologist. The premise sounded great (don't they all) but NOTHING HAPPENED. The characters never really showed any excitement over what could have been a defining moment in science.

It still does to me, and I wish someone would write a good book about it. Cosm is condescendingly simple, especially about science (molecules! wow!) and people (dialog and characters). When I tossed the book aside after a couple of pages (chosen at random throughout the book) my wife, who reads John Grisham, looked at the first page, chuckled at the wooden cliches, and also tossed it aside. I don't read much fiction, but I did just finish Babbitt, by Sinclair Lewis, and that is some mighty fine writing, and nothing cosmic happens at all. Don't waste your money on Cosm; Benford is capitalizing on the current cosmology craze, and it's not even good sci-fi. Insulting."},{"rating":"1","title":"6 good ideas do not a novel make","review":"I eagerly picked up this title when I saw it was out. As a scientist, I've always appreciated Benford and Cosm looked like an excellent prospect. Unfortunately, the book is strictly linear, with gobs of filler in between the 5 or 6 good ideas that it contains. Unlike the best in SF, Cosm does not present the reader with a small view into a much larger place. Instead, it reads like a mechanical excercise in churning a book out. Benford can and should do better. A disappointment. Only saving grace is the insiders look at the world of big science."},{"rating":"2","title":"hard sf at its best","review":"I just heard Dr. Alan Guth (The Inflationary Universe) give a talk here at Cornell, and Benford's novel is an excellent account of the phenomena.I am a scientist and someone who grew up in So. Cal., so the novel hits close to home, and I even laughed out loud at Benford's accurate and funny insights into Orange County pop culture idiosyncrasies.But most important is his portrayal of real science. Continuing the tradition of his masterpiece 'Timescape,' Benford treats science fiction as \\"fiction about science\\" and succeeds marvelously. The novel's exciting second half brought up many \\"what if\\" questions, a treat for serious SF readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story, good characters, great science!","review":"Set at Brookhaven and UC Irvine only a few years from now, this story manages to capture the excitement of scientific discovery and the wonder of modern cosmology, while presenting a good story with interesting characters.

He is acclaimed to be a science fiction writer's \\"scientist\\" in that he deals with a lot of \\"hard\\" science. In this case, the result is pedantic and - the ultimate sin - boring. The main character was not exciting nor interesting - just smart. The great experiment and the result were so-so. I kept waiting for something - ANYTHING - to happen but soon realized that this was it..a globe that was tested, studied and explored.

COSM does not present a story that interests me, on the contrary. I found the characters and what they did very boring, the whole plot seems to be centered on issues that are quite trivial considering the weight of the subject (universe in a lab): the heroine's amateur-like struggle and way of plotting to keep the cosm out of reach of the other petty scientists' hands, etc. Wow, that I call true inspiring and visionary science fiction! There certainly are more interesting tales out there that start with less and accomplish more, e.g. Clarke,Cube-McDowell: The Trigger. But maybe one should not blame Mr Benford to much --- how do you make a page-turner out of a book that start out with a major event such as a newborn cosmos in your lab?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sci-Fi can be good literature, but Benford's hand is heavy","review":"COSM was recommended by a friend who reads a wide variety of science fiction. I grew up reading authors like Heinlein, Dick, Silverberg, Brunner, and Clarke, so from her glowing praise, I assumed this fellow Benford was a writer with similar skills. My assumption was wrong.Let's just say that characterization, dialog, and creating suspense are areas where Gregory Benford needs a lot of practice.

I had to use more than one bag to make a decent cup of tea. And yes, the water was hot enough, and yes, I steeped it long enough. There was no expiration date on the box though there is a place for one. Even using two bags, it was practically flavorless. At more than a $1 a bag, that is ridiculous.

The author (who is a woman) talks about what she wants from a guy and tries to make the reader think that all women want it. The author basically makes men think that women are goldiggers (which is absolutely false). She says that you need a nice car, money, nice clothes and that you need to spoil a girl in order for you to date her and continue dating her.I read about 1/2 this book and I was disgusted with it. As a matter of fact I threw it in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"This book treats the reader as if you're a small, dumb, helpless child. Maybe some guys are - I don't know. I thought I was just as baffled about women as the next guy but if this book is the \\"definitive guide\\" then I guess I'm a genius (obviously I'm not). I found maybe one or two sentences that were useful, the rest was just obvious. Unless you seriously know absolutely NOTHING about women I highly recommend you spend your money on another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book on dating I've ever read","review":"You've heard of the dating book for women called \\"The Rules\\".. well, this might as well be the companion book to it.. the book for men on how to play by THEIR rules. Her advice? Get a higher paying job, buy a fancy sports car, dress nicely, always pay for everything on a date, and buy a woman flowers to show her you're interested.All this book will teach you to do is how to be the nice, boring,supplicating guy that a woman will dump, as soon as she is seduced by a man who's been reading all the RIGHT books on dating.The real kicker is, the title of the book is \\"understanding women\\" and yet the actual advice of the book is, women are impossible to understand, so you'd better just follow all these rules if you want any chance of being worth dating. This is total B.S. and I'd recommend pretty much any other book out there on dating.. written for men from a MAN'S point of view, on how to actually be successful with women."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest guide to women!","review":"This book is the most superb guide on women I've found.I Read the book in under 2 hours.Just read it right through.Its the definitive guide.No understatement there.This book covers the do's,the dont's,why's and why not's and in a honest way.If you want to understand women(and what guy doesnt)this book is for you.There is so much in this book to help improve your chances with women.Find out where you're going wrong and if you're doing the right thing too.Great advice for all guys.Great value.I also recommend these books:1)\\"U.S.S.\\")By Leil lowndes.(means undercover sex signals).A new edition is now available from this site.2)\\"How to pick up beautiful women:secrets every man should know\\".By John Eagan.3)\\"How to meet the right woman:a five step strategy that really works\\".By Roger Ratcliff,David Conway and Diane Ohlsson.There are plenty of books on the subjects like \\"dating\\",picking up girls\\",etc on this site."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jesus....and other Sigh Remarks!","review":"Bro...if you want to wind up a wimp who's starting an Avon club or enjoy doing the dishes,...then purchase this book. Actually, if you want to be successful in the dating world...buy this book...and \\"do the exact opposite\\" of what the author advises (lol). First of all, a women cannot teach a man how to pick up another women. Why? Because women are the most confused creatures on God's green earth and certainly another women is just as confused about what she likes and dislikes. Read surveys on what women like, then see them in real life; They do the exact opposite of what they wrote in their survey answers. Unless you want a book on \\"what not to do\\" to meet and date attractive women, find a better book....they are out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-centered, bias garbage.","review":"Despite a warning that her book wasn't a substitute for psychological advice, and that her words were 'in-your-face', Miller's words are clearly out of frustration with her own problems with men. Instead of giving advice that is neutral and useful for men, she instead complains about things that she finds unacceptable to dating and life, this mindset is more reflective of materialistic women, thus giving the female gender a bad name, and further driving men down wrong roads to 'love'.If you know what's good for you, you'll stay away from anything Romy Miller has written. Perhaps when she grows up and acts her age (whatever that is), and understands the fact that men are human, and not something women can leech off of, then maybe people will start to take her seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"This book was a real waste of money and time. The advice is delivered in a very condescending tone, and the author contradicts herself repeatedly. This would be forgivable if there was any actual good advice in here - it would be generous to say that 20% of what she writes is useful. The book has the feel of an article from a poorly-written men's magazine that has been padded out to book length, and just barely at that. I'm sure there is a better book on dating out there than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Weak","review":"This book just arrived last night and I read the first 84 pages and thought to myself \\"what a waste\\" The writing and mentality is that of someone who's 21-25 years of age who stayed up one night jotting down ideas for a dating book. This book is written for young men under the age of 25. For instance in one chapter titled \\"wheels\\" she starts off by saying \\"have a nice set of wheels\\" two pages later she start off the chapter by saying \\"get a good paying job\\" as if one can just walk out of his current job and land a better paying job right off the bat to impress the woman he desires. Unless you're totally in the dark about women and dating this book will do nothing for you but reiterate things you should already know. A much better book for men is How to Succeed with Women and a better book on attraction is 'Irresistable Attraction' by Hogan and LaBay. Whatever you do, don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might help if you're really clueless","review":"I might have found this book useful when I was a teenager. It's got some decent basic insight, but not a lot, and it also has some things I totally disagree with, like the advice to spend lots of money on women, and get a second job if one doesn't have enough money to do that. Some women might stick around longer for more free stuff, but it won't buy anyone's respect or affection.What I really don't like about the book is the insulting tone, especially in the beginning. The attitude is the reader must be a serious loser, why else would you be reading the book.There are many much better books out there on understanding women, don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"just plain ol' common sense","review":"I bought this booking thinking it would give me some secret advantage over other guys in meeting more women, but after reading it in one sitting I feel like I wasted a few hours of my life reading this crap.

If you want a book that will convince you to let any and every woman take advantage of you in every way possible get this.

If you want to be demoralized as a man and be told ever page of this book that you are not in control and you are lucky to have any woman talk to you then read this book. This book is meant to shoot men down and build women up.

I own a dozen books on meeting women and this one is the most arrogant and condescending. Virtually all the advice is covered in other books yet the author, a woman, suggests things like 'the man should always pay no matter what' while she talks to men like they are stupid and should accept the role of victim when it comes to meeting women. don't waste your money on this book. I suggest books by Clink or especially Louis and Copeland who actually write to empower men instead of treating them like idiots. The author claims to be qualified simply by virtue of being a woman.

For me, the author goes out of her way to voice her bitterness towards any guy who is looking to date and invents her own pyscho-babble and reiterates what all common sense who tell anyone. She is at time vulgar, mean, and insulting.The read is very much like reading a person who got dumped and wrote a book to blast any single guy as a way to cope.It offers common sense advice, so if you want to buy a book telling you all the things you should already know or have heard, this is the book for you. Don't waste your money is my opinion!For me, it is like reading a book from a 15 year old girl who got her heart stomped on, very immature in parts and the author goes out of her way on advice how to date her and not what all women are thinking necessarily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!!","review":"This book is very basic and tells you what a guy should do in order to meet a girl.

Dating is a game, and women do have the advantage. Those books helped a nice guy to know the right things to do and say to do very well with women. This book, Understanding Women, DID NOT. Romy Miller and all women would like it if more men behaved the way she is instructing you to behave.

I'm glad she insisted. Pozo makes learning the basics really easy. I only tackled the foxtrot and the waltz for the wedding, but I've started on the Salsa one. What's great about what Pozo does is that he doesn't give a lot of steps but spends a lot of time in teaching how to lead the steps he gives you. My wife loves the Dancing With the Star show. I was never too crazy about it. But now I can at least understand how difficult it most be for some of those sports celebrities to do those routines.

I found the material extremely fragmented in presentation, seemingly jumping from one focus to another. It was a challenge to associate the context with the section headers, as the flow was not comfortably predictable. The text often assumes a prerequisite of knowledge that I didn't expect of introductory course material.

The organization of the text is fine for those familiar with the subject and the definitions are helpful for those who are not.The book is overpriced for the amount of actual classwork it could provide.

It is easy to drink without spilling. The temperature can easily be set. I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not hot cup","review":"First the cup is top heavy.The real problem is it takes for ever to get hot.I thought it was so you set the heat and would be done. No-- you have to keep pushing a button to the heat you want, but when it reaches say lukewarm and you want hot it resets itself to lukwarm, then you have to push again to reset again and again to get to hot. Not to good while driving in LA traffic..I just made a 250 mile trip in my car and my cup never went more than lukewarm but one time to Hot. Problem is I stopped to gas up and it reset itself to Room Temp. Finally threw out the coffee and bought a cup togo.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need my money back!","review":"I used it for a couple of weeks then the charger broke now I can't use it. I should have take heed to the reviews and did not get this piece of junk. I wish I can have my money back, I paid $31 including shipping I think that's too much for a 2-week use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Big","review":"The first one I received failed in two uses. The somewhat sophisticated control panel is located on the side and it is NOT sealed. If you spill any fluid onto the side and it goes into the circuitry, it can short out. Another problem is the plug recepticle is on the opposite side of the handle...may sound good, but that makes it too big for my Acura TL's coffee cup holder. Lastly, the cup lid is flimsy and doesn't secure well. This cup was a great concept that was poorly executed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smart Mug","review":"The first time I used this mug, it broke. I filled it with coffee, plugged in and smoke came out of the display area and the digital display was fried. This was a lot of money to pay for something that breaks the first time you use it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Product","review":"The features of this product seemed promising to me. Reality didn't fufill expectation, however. The handle broke off when I adjusted its position in my car's cup holder. After two weeks the electronic system built into the mug failed. Not only does the temperature indicators stay blank, but the heater no longer warms the coffee at all. I believe this item is made by a Chinese firm. China has given the world silk, gunpowder, and printing. A shame it has been premature in giving us a reliable travel mug."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Smart-Mug\\" NOT a wise buy.","review":"Where should I start? 1, Not fast to heat. 2, Too tall/narrow/tippy in any mug-holder that I know of. 3, Placement of power cord input on mug is Not handy. 4, Lid closed still leaves a 1/8\\" hole for liquid to leak/splash out of when you hit a bump or jostle the mug. 5, Exterior finish on \\"Stainless Steel\\" Smart-Mug has a clear urethane, or some other coating that is very easily marred and chips off. 6, Stand this mug on a table top? DONT BUMP THE TABLE It barely stands on its own. 'Nuff said.

Suggest not purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality but the Cord isn't Interchangeable","review":"This is a good quality mug. I tried many stores to find a cord that fits this mug but couldn't. You might as well buy two so you can have a cord for each car. The same company also makes a version that plugs into a USB. It's perfect for a person with long commutes who doesn't even lukewarm coffee, but who does? I haven't been using it long enough to speak to it's sturdiness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dribbling talents underrated","review":"I bought this item after reviewing comments on it and several other alternatives. Though its heating capabilities were as advertised, comments did not reveal a damning flaw. This is a dribble cup in disguise. It should be sold to pranksters as a novelty item. It splashed all over my shirt, coat and pants. I had to get my coat cleaned. It stems from a design flaw. The wide lip allows coffee to spread out to the sides as you drink. It stays there, waiting to spill over the edge the next time you draw the cup to your mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"This product works sometimes and somestimes it does not.

It does a remarkable job keeping my coffee at the proper temperature. I use it every day at work. Sometimes, I'll be out of my truck for over an hour, and my coffee is exactly the same as when I left. Never scorched, etc.One of the biggest shortcomings of this mug is that it is topheavy. If your cupholder is larger than the bottom of the mug, it will want to tip over. This newer version is much lighter than my earlier one, so it doesn't tip as much. It is still worth mentioning, though.On the previous model, the lid was fairly loose fitting. They have made it a lot tighter.I love being able to set the temp to my liking. The thermostat holds very steady. The calibration is off a little bit... My first mug I kept set to about 130 degrees, and the new one to get the same temp of coffee, I have to keep it at 123 degrees.I would recommend this mug to anyone who gets pulled away during the day and always comes back to cold or scorched/overheated coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for less than a month","review":"My wife gave me this as a gift and I do not use it everyday (10-12 times in the past month).

It worked for a short while but now I am without a heated travel mug for my long commutes for work. Will not purchase this brand again."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've owned four of these","review":"They seem to have finally fixed the problem of the connection to the mug being to loose. But it still looks like the control isn't sealed very well. One just has to be careful not to get any liquid on it. I once was given a Plug-N-Heat mug that was a far superior design. A friend mistakenly put it in the dish washer, it still worked for awhile after it dried.

Anyone who read Victor Niederhoffer's The Education of a Speculator published almost four years ago will be intimately familiar with these topics. Victor's book was published before the tech-boom caused everyone and their uncle to even care about the market, and was backed up by the stupendous performance of its author who at the time was a top-performing fund manager. Mr. Hagstrom's coverage of these topics is brief, specious and uninspiring.

With sound derived directly from toy instruments (guitars, flutes, and even a chicken named Brunhilda), and vocals by Galia Durant, the band delivers a humorous take on a sometimes an all too serious genre. Enter a live performance with hand-made flying cats, and you've got a hit! Favorite memorable first track : Hi."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice followup to Tiger My Friend","review":"I, like many others, was hypnotized by 'Cosy in the Rocket', a portion of which is used in the ABC drama 'Grey's Anatomy'. I purchased Psapp's first US release, Tiger My Friend, in May 2005 and have listened to it often. I'm not a heavy music consumer but I didn't hesitate to purchase these CDs (support independent labels!) I preordered this album mere days before it was due to be released; I received it only one day after the release. I am listening to it for the second time. I'm not sure if it will grow on me like Tiger did, yet - time will tell. I can say that listening to the last track, 'Upstairs', is best experienced in a quieter room with immersive headphones - the sound effects of creaking floors above are uncannily real. I guess this album doesn't seem quite as experimental and unique to me, but that's okay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good one from Aled","review":"If you enjoy a good,sincere Christian,singing from the heart, you will enjoy this CD with Aled. Some familiar,some newer numbers. A good mix. I recommend this CD. I prefer O HOLY NIGHT version with the young Aled singing dubbed with the adult Aled but this offers a change which is still very meaningful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sort of Boring","review":"I think that if you're not from the Chassidic world, you might find this film interesting. However, if you are orthodox or know anything about Chassidim, there are no major revelations here. I didn't really find any of the interviewee's stories about breaking out of the Chassidic world very compelling. Basically all of their stories are the same, and even though they have managed to break out they still seem sad about it. This documentary should have either been about the couch or Chassidic drop outs, but I don't think that the two mixed very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addie Pray is a wonderful book about life in the Depression.","review":"Addie Pray is the best book I have ever read! It's about Addie, a 12- year- old girl who travels around the South with her \\"could- be\\" father Moses Pray. Also made into a movie called Paper Moon with Tatum O'Neal, this is one book that is AS GOOD as the movie!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My all-time favorite!","review":"I can't believe this book is out of print! Although I enjoyed the movie when I saw it at the age of 12, it doesn't begin to do justice to the book, set in the deep South instead of the Midwest. How a man managed to capture the emotions and perspective of an preadolescent girl is simply amazing-reading it feels like you're sitting on the front porch, listening to your favorite eccentric aunt tell her life story.The down-home language and expressions had me rolling with laughter! This is a must-have if you can find it-when I lost my copy, I borrowed one from the library and photocopied the whole thing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yu Yu Seasons!!","review":"I enjoyed this season alot. I like the way they had the first few episodes of the Dark Tournament in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great anime","review":"I love this anime but the dub is horrible, its among the worst i have ever heard. The guy that voices kuwabara is just plain awful, he tries way too hard and it just is the worst voice over i have ever heard, but the good news is it has the original japanese voices with subs, which is the only way i can watch it. Comparing the english to the original japanese its nowhere near as good. Bottom line is, its a great show if you like dragonball z and naruto and bleach and other anime like that, but be ready to read the subs because the dub is awful!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"It arrived on time and in great condition, and since I love this anime, I was more than pleased with my purchase. Yu Yu Hakusho is full of action, humor, and truly heart-warming moments--and it manages to do it without seeming obnoxious! There's even an element of mystery to everything (After all, Yusuke is a spirit detective). You can't go wrong with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"The Yu Yu Hakusho season one dvd is everything that any anime fan can remember. Every episode lives up to its original standards. I love it and will continue to watch every season. This is a must have product for any anime fan who loves to watch the classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yu Yu Hakusho review","review":"I haven't really reviewed anything before but i'll try with this. Yu Yu Hakusho is a 5 star top notch quality anime following the story of Yusuke Urameshi who isnt your typical student. Dying in a selfless act to save another he is given a second chance at life by ruler of the spirit world, Koenma. There are different arcs with something new and surprising every time.This anime has different genres such as supernatural, comedy, martial arts, folklore and honestly I dont think im doing good with this review right now but i'll just put it in short words. If you love fast paced action fighting anime with no filler, comedy, beautiful artwork, great characters, and a comelling story lasting over a good 100 episodes this is your show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yu Yu Hakusho rocks","review":"I'm so glad I bought this box set. Yu Yu Hakusho is one of my favorite fighting anime ever. I got hooked watching it on Cartoon Network as a kid and have never regretted watching it. ^_^ This particular boxset is awesome. It has 2 slimcases with 4 discs total for 28 episodes. Compared to other anime which put ~4 eps to a disc you get to watch twice as much before having to make the switch. ^_^Plus the price can't be beat. I got my set for $21 and will be getting the second season for $19 since I preordered it. I've never seen anime so cheap! But its still great quality. I will be ordering the entire series from Amazon because no one else can beat these prices."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"Well worth the pricehas all the episodes up to the first match of the dark tournamentplus its only 2 disc so its not a big pain to have to put a new disc in maybe every 4 episodes like other season box sets"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shot Gun!","review":"Let me just start off by saying that this anime is one of my favorites of all time from when I first seen it on \\"toonami\\" to when they put in on adult swim.Its one of those animes that just keeps you going and grabs your attention when you start to watch it, getting better and better as you go through the episodes. The opening and ending songs are great to listen to and I adore the music of this series. It is one of those animes that you shouldn't pass up. As you watch the show you will laugh, cry, and love the characters, in my opinion there is no character that I didn't like. If you like actiony, funny, a little romance anime then this is for you!Another plus that I have to include is that this price is amazingly good and you get 28 episodes in just the first season which is good. So your getting practically 1 episode for less than a dollar, how great is that? So make sure not to pass up this anime, give it a try it will be worth it in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yu Yu Hakusho","review":"Great buy, any anime lover that doesn't know about Yu Yu Hakusho, will want to see every episode consistantly till the end. It hooks you in and never lets you go. Plus the packaging and dvd case's are magnificent. Great animation and story line no matter what point of view you look at it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was not good at all.","review":"This was by far the worst book I have read in a while. Who's perspective is this supposed to be from? It amazes me what can be published and saddens me that someone was paid to edit this. On the plus side, it gives me hope that I could write a novel better than this! Not to mention, that this is a total Outlander rip off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely dreadful","review":"Having picked up the audio version, I had no idea this was a romance pretending to be a fantasy. The story makes no sense at any level. The characters are so one dimensional and not believable. There's no actual plot, and the fantasy element is just there as a back drop. In short, this was utterly atrocious and it reminds me of why I hate romance novels.Carl Alves - author of Two For Eternity"},{"rating":"2","title":"Under the Highland Kilt","review":"Socks and shoes. This is my favorite book by Karen Maire Moning. Hawk is introduced to you as a womanizing cold hearted man who who could care less about his new bride. I like the fact that at the start of this book you really hate Hawk and that by the end you are so in love with this man that you want him for yourself. I have read alot of romance novels but this is the only one that i have fallen for. enjoy your reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Story","review":"I have a 6 hour long commute I drive every week so I have started to listen to books on tape. I highly recommend this story on the CD as the narrator brings the characters to life and the most entertaining way. He does a madly hot scottish brouge. (10 times better than braveheart) Hawk the main charactor is bigger than life and so incredibly sexy. I am in love with the Highlander series after listening to two of the 7 novels. I have plans to purchase all of as they are produced on CD. I highly recommend these stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"buyer beware","review":"I thought this was one of the worst romance novels I ever read. First of all there was no romance. The hero was a perfect specimen of the male body. He also slept with more women than 50 men put together. Not at all my idea of a romantic figure. The heroine was immature and idiotic. What a stupid reason for not giving the hero a chance. Plus, she was also too perfectly formed to be believed. I hated the protagonist Adam. He was a spoiled little boy in a perfect man's body. The fact that this story was supposed to take place in Scotland was almost beside the point. If you are looking for a Highlands of Scotland book, this is not it.If you don't want to read a book about two men who have no redeeming qualities fighting over a woman who was too stupid to be believed, don't read this book. Romance was the very last thing this book was about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific story.Keeps you interested, but has annoying parts.","review":"This is the third \\"Highlander\\" book I've read. I previously read Moning's \\"Kiss of The Highlander\\" and \\"The Dark Highlander.\\" Both were 5- Star reads for me. This one was also excellent, but there was one thing that annoyed me: The leading lady's meanness at times. She purposely calls the hero (Hawk) by another man's name whenever he kisses her. She does this because she was hurt by another man in the past, and she has sworn- off men. But she has no regard for how much it hurts Hawk every time she does it. She treats him with a generally mean spirit through most of the book.Other than that, the overall story is captivating. There is plenty of mystery, romance, and action. The love scenes are great. The book is really hard to put down. Moning truly knows how to write a story. I'm anxious for the next Highlander book coming soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love her poetic writing...","review":"I really loved this book overall. I did love the poetic prose she uses! What I didn't love was that Adreinne said Adam's name one too many times and hurt him deeply. I hated that he kept getting so greivously hurt! She's such a great writer I could just 'feel' the Hawk's pain, and wanted it to end, so the book went on a little too long for me. One reviewer had it right-on, when you saw how Hawk really is, you wanted him for yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the plot?","review":"In a way the characters were interesting, but pretty much one dimensional and did not always behave in ways that made sense. the worst was the plot, I just kept waiting for something to happen!

The combination of power, romance, and satire in the story line created a perfect mix.

I thought about Hawk and Adrienne for days after I finished reading.I can not wait for Karen Moning's next book to be released!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wow!!! loved them all","review":"i have just finished all 5 of karen s books and they were all great, funny , kept you on the seat of your chair...i just mailed them all to my sister because i thought they were so great!!!! good for you karen moning"},{"rating":"2","title":"The beginning","review":"This is the First book in the 'Highlander' Series although you can read them in any order this one has some charcaters that show up in the next books. I really enjoyed this story the heroine, adrianne, is a likeable girl with a dark past. Our hero, Hawk, is 100% alypha male and drop dead gorgeous and there in lies the problem for our Lass. The story is if you have an open mind beliveable, our hero can be stupid, male and idiotic as well as warm, caring and 100% sincere. If you are thinking of starting the series this is a great place. Loads of characters are introduced, the saucy scenes are beautifully written, all in all a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good novel to escape into","review":"I recently was ill and bored when I came across this novel.

This really isn't my usual sort of novel, but I really loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"FOUR PLUS PLUS STARS!","review":"A highly entertaining novel by a writer new to me. The plot was well done, the writing quite good and the characters real. It takes real talent for a writer to blend the hearts of a 20th century woman and a 16th century man. The differences in social culture were convincing, although I wondered if Lydia, the hero's mother, might have done a little time travelling herself - so modern were her sensibilities. Adam was a unredeemed villain, an evil being without a soul. He made an interesting contrast to the gorgeous Hawk who, after all, just wanted to medieval castle husband. I'll read more by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This is the first book of a great series. I read all of them,then passed them to my daughters to read as well.

So - make time to enjoy this one! Lots of twists and turns and beautiful descriptions of lovely Scotland."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Bad","review":"I found Moning's book seriously lacking in believability and sexual tension: necessary to a good romance, no? The more I read, the more I found myself hoping to lose myself in my own vision of the characters . . . never happened. Hawk and Adrienne never came alive for me. Instead, I was painfully aware of someone writing the drivelling dialogue and one-dimensional plot. Beyond this, I wished for elements of reality, some element of grit, to make the plot a bit more palatable. Unless you're 15, leave the mist behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"E for effort,","review":"This is the second book I have read by Karen Marie Moning. I like to give writers at least a second chance at nabbing me up as a fan. I do love romance novels! But, this writer just didn't cut it for me. I truly wanted to like this writer as I have heard such wonderful things about her novels. But, the things I have heard did not turn out to be true. Beyond the Highland Mist was just sadly lacking. Lacking in spark, lacking in excitment, and lacking in story line. I will stick with the more sizzling writer like Holt, Graham, and Leone when it comes to romance. I'm bored with the supposed tried and true writers like Roberts, Howard, and this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story line gone bad...","review":"I had high hopes for this story and \\"new to me\\" author after reading the reviews.

It could have been so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"I've read \\"kiss of the highlander\\" first and loved it so much. I've ordered all the books by this author!I really like this one too. but a big minus for the cover, I really don't like halfnaked people on the front of the book...I have to admit that I fell in love with the cover for \\"kiss of the highlander\\" and \\"the highlander's touch\\". That's why I bought them and I'm really not at all diappointed. the stories are great.Especially if you like fantasy, romance, fairy tales!I love the characters but mostly I'm curious about Adam Black and I hope to read a book about him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An author to keep your eye on.","review":"This book had all the right elements to catch my attention; fantasy, history, sexual tension, a really hunky hero, a hunky villan and a heroine who doesn't take any guff. I laughed in some places, cried in others and was generally sorry to see the story end. There were some historical inconsistancies, but I could overlook them by this first time author. I will definately be putting this on my keeper shelf for a rainy day re-read. Try it, you won't be sorry. I await Ms. Monings' next book to see if it lives up to her promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"After devouring Moning's fever series, I was so excited to read the Highlander series also by same author. Boy was I disappointed!!! It wasn't the worst book I have ever read. Yet another sappy romance novel. If I have to read one more romance novel where both heroine and hero fight their feelings and deny their love for one another I think I may gag! Unfortunately, I may be gagging for awhile as I bought the 1st four books in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"After reading all the Black Dagger Brother series by JR Ward, this series was highly recommended. I was a little hesitant because Scottish men in kilts don't do it for me. Surprisingly this book was really good. I love any romance book that has time travel in it. It's a great story and has intriguing characters. Can't wait to read the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Karen Moning Fare","review":"I've loved reading Karen Moning's Fae series so I thought I'd see what the Highlander Series has to offer.I was entertained - enough so that I will read the next Highlander book - but I was not immersed. A lot of romance, a little intrigue, a little magic, a world to escape to, but easy enough to return from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is it a \\"Series\\" of great Highland romance or isn't it?","review":"This is the first book in a series of \\"Highlander\\" books. However the term series might be a loose phrase for these books...This book \\"Beyond the Highland Mist\\" and the next book \\"To Tame a Highland Warrior\\" are connected and would definatly be considered a series of 2 books.The 3rd book in the series (if going by publication date)\\"The Highlanders Touch\\", stands alone. It's a whole new story.The 4th book \\"Kiss of The Highlander\\" starts a new story once more, but book 5 \\"The Dark Highlander\\" continues that story.I've enjoyed each story so far and look forward to the 6th book, although I will say that I prefer a series to continue on like books 1 & 2 did, not start a whole new story like book 3 & 4 did. That's the ONLY reason I gave this series 4 stars instead of 5"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!","review":"This book really disappointed me, so much so that I simply couldn't finish it. Adrienne's character was no more than a petulant child who, after learning 'no' as her first word, refused to say anything else. I'm all for a woman trying to preserve her virtue, but her character just came of as spoiled, unreasonable and contrary. I actually cheered when Grimm finally got sick of her and told her off! Then, rather than taking his words to heart, her pouty response is 'I'm not such a bad person.' PLEASE! Unless you are in to predictability and and frustration, I'd pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"Awesome! From the first page to the last, I couldn't put one of these books down for a minute without thinking about the characters and wanting to get right back to the stories!

To Tame a Highland Warrior3. The Highlander's Touch4. Kiss of the Highlander5. The Dark Highlander6. The Immortal Highlander (Not Yet Released, I am anxiously awaiting it's release.)This writer's work is a great escape from an everyday ordinary life.

Really enjoyed this book and plan on reading the author's others as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!!!","review":"After being completely engrossed in the Fever series by Ms. Moning it took me quite a while to get around to her other books. I didn't think she could top that series. While waiting for her newest book in that series to be released I decided to try the Highland Warrior series. I couldn't put this, or any of the books in this series down! I didn't read this series in the exact order, but they all stand alone so it wasn't a problem. All I can say is READ THIS BOOK!!! You will be hooked before you know it :-D"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read like a college writing assignment","review":"If you enjoy a complete lack of character development and motivation, then this book is for you. The only reason I didn't give it 1 star was for the requisite sex scene, which was pretty juicy in the standard \\"throbbing\\" and \\"heaving\\" sort of way. However, if it's adventure, Scottish Highlander hunkiness (and sex), a heroine with some true gumption, a well-researched plot, AND a bit of magical time travel you seek, I highly recommend the Outlander series by Diana Gabaldon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adam Black. woohoo!!!","review":"I swear it , this is the best romance novel I've ever read. I loved everything about it. The time-travel, the fairies, and especailly the way Hawk and Adam Black kept fighting over Adrienne. Adam was dark and mysterious and I think I fell in love with him just as much a I enjoyed reading about Hawk. There are some unexpected surprises in this book and when I finished reading it, I wanted MORE! I didn't want the book to end, it was so good. I will definatley be getting all of Karen's other books now cause I'm totally hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Work of Art...A MUST READ","review":"Karen Marie Moning is a Genius! I have always been intrigued with time-travel into ancient times and Karen Has It ALL. I picked \\"Beyond the Highland Mist\\" by sheer boredom...and WOW what a find! I zoomed through the book so fast and was so drawn into the story that I found myself at the bookstore the next day buying her other two books \\"To Tame a Highland Warrior\\" and \\"The Highlander's Touch\\". Now I am waiting for her 4th, \\"Kiss of the Highlander\\" and I'm just busting at the seams to engross myself into another one of Karen's wonderful, timeless, and exciting romances. A MUST READ!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Diane Gabaldon","review":"I had read a review that indicated that this series of books was similar to those of Diane Gabaldon so I bought them since Diane won't have a new book out for a while. Unfortunately, the quality was nowhere close. I don't read romance novels, and even though Gabaldon's books are found in the 'romance' section of a book store, the 'Dragonfly In Amber' and the others in the series are more historically-based, well-researched and well-written. I read the first one by Moning then drove to the local library and dropped off all three without reading the other 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must","review":"This book is a must for all who love Scotland, for all who read romances, for all who just enjoy a good story.Some scenes just make you smile, others just squeeze your heart. High emotion. A wonderful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"So cheesy, so... typical, so...","review":"I couldn't even convince myself to end it, it was that bad. This book is about a pefect guy who doesn't love any woman but has sex with dozens of them and enjoys being a womanizer. And then there's the young woman of the book, who is so beautiful and so all perfect as he is, and she has vowed never to let herself fall in love again with a perfect man because the last time she did it turned out awful.So, two characters who aren't interested about falling in love or in settling down, but then, when they see each other... only upon seeing each other, they hadn't talk by that moment, is all hotness and need and I-don't-know-why-but-I-want-him/her. Then, they talk some more, they argue, he tries to woo her, and she says no, but they are still in the I'm saying no, but I-don't-know-why-but-I-want-him/her.So I suppose these two end together, but I didn't like the book and didn't get on reading. I have another book of this author, I expect it to be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who are these people?","review":"This book had high ratings from many reviewers, but I'm not sure why. I can suspend belief for the gods/fae toying with the human hero, but at least the characters need to be believable and their motivations comprehensible. Adrienne seems positively blas�� about being dropped in the 16th century, actually prefers it to 1997 because there is no traffic noise. Hawk and Adrienne have barely met and they're madly in love, in spite of her distrust of men and his vast experience of women. Most of the conflict arises from Adrienne refusing to admit she desires Hawk. Overall we never get to know or care about the characters at all. There is essentially no realistic context (sights, smells, activities) to ground the action in 1513, and even the 1990's back story is unrealistic (were there orphanages in New Orleans in the 90's?)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mess of a story","review":"The author, I'm afraid, tried to put in too much in one book. Time-traveling fugitive abused heroine meets oversexed rakehell man, both perfect humans with no physical flaws. Then there are faeries and lame court intrigue, a quest towards the end, and I'm sure there's a kitchen sink buried in the story... somewhere.Also, the writing is overflowery, with lips, tresses, torsos, bosoms, and er, love organs described in melodramatic purple prose that had me cringing.At last count, there are 6 misunderstandings.I don't have patience for these sort of books, really. Here's hoping 'To Tame A Highland Warrior' is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing....","review":"I actually bought this book based on the recommendations on Amazon and I was really disappointed when I finally got to read it. This is Ms. Moning's book and I think she should have spent more time editing it. Although her plot was certainly intruiging, I found her story to be choppy and incoherent at times. Like for example, Adrienne's life in the future was spotty at best, and I wish Ms. Moning spent more time developing Adrienne's background.This book is also not nearly as humorous as her other books. The author certainly tries to be amusing in her dialogue, but it just seems forced rather than clever and lighthearted like in her other books.But don't let this book turn you off from the wonder of Karen Marie Moning's writing. Her other 4 books are absolutely superb, all in the top 20 of my favorite books ever. I especially loved Kiss of the Highlander and its sequel the Drak Higlander is a close second. I highly recommend buying her other books; they're really worth your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't suspend disbelief","review":"Okay, I liked the idea of this book. I even liked the idea of the wounded heroine who had to relearn trust. But I found it annoying that the author repeated the \\"almost together...no wait...go away\\" scene several times more often than necessary. And I also found it grating that the hero was consistently referred to as \\"the Hawk.\\" Like \\"the statue\\" or \\"the giant.\\" I mean, what mother calls her son \\"the Hawk?!\\" And some of the language was jarring and out of place...e.g. \\"enormous cock.\\" I just couldn't get over that one! I did like some of the conversations between Hawk and Adam though...nice writing there. All in all, this book was a disappointment. I'd read the great reviews, and bought it because of a personal recommendation. But I'll sell it to a used book store with no qualms. It was a frustrating read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply desappointed","review":"I was deeply disappointed with this book, especially after the good reviews that it received. The flaws are so many that I don't even know where to start this review. First of all, this is supposed to be a paranormal time travel romance, but there is no historical or paranormal details whatsoever, the storyline could happen easily in a contemporary romance. The characters are poorly developed. The Heroine has a prejudice against beautiful man because of a past experience, which the author expect us to believe that gives her the right to treat the Hero badly, being rude and calling him by another man\`s name repeatedly! The Hero, on the other hand, is the most perfect man ever seen, with a pick of every woman breathing, but falls in love with the heroine on the first sight, even while she is being rude. There is no romance. The plot is weak which enhances the poor development of the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't stop reading..!","review":"I was at a bookstore browsing among the latest titles when I stumbled upon 'Beyond the Highland Mist'. I sat down and read the summary on the back, it seemed interesting and I had time to spare, so I started reading page one too.. Many hours later I finished the book and purchased it. Definately a must read, but beware.. no work will get done..!P.S., I highly recommend this book to be read where you won't be bothered and have pesky bookstore clerks interrupting you!*a-hem* excuse me miss but you're not allowed to read while... yadda yadda yadda..."},{"rating":"1","title":"predicatable","review":"I loved the fever series and thought I'd try some of her other books.

More Fae please."},{"rating":"1","title":"so lame!","review":"This is probably the 30th highlander novel I have read. EVERY SINGLE ONE of the others I have read are better than this one. The characters are boring. There is no history involved. The girl travels back in time, no big deal, to find a man who wants her. Whole book is him offering to have sex with her, her saying no. Finally they do it, then they're in love. end of stoy. No plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional","review":"Karen Marie Moning has done it again. An exception reading experience, and a book I know I'll be re reading soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"This is quite possibly one of the WORST books I have ever read. Like a previous reviewer mentions, the characters were underdeveloped, the plot line was weak, and the phrase \\"I hate beautiful men\\" came up over and over again. I am truly sorry I wasted my time and money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"I really hated this book. I bought it based on several good recommendations and can't remember the last time I was so disapointed. The characters are flat and you don't understand why any of them are doing anything that they do. Ms. Moning never fleshes them out through their actions. She says they are great and noble and witty and super special but she NEVER shows any of this through word or deed. The heroine hates the hero for a silly reason and then is cruel to him and then she decides she loves him for no reason. These clowns do not have one romantic or interesting conversation in the entire book. And why do I have to read about man parts that a stallion would envy? Eww. My husband kept telling me to stop reading it but I hate to leave things unfinished. These are a few hours of my life that I wish I could have back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasyland meets the Highland","review":"I chose this book because I am interested in everything about England/Scotland. At the same time, I like to \\"lose myself\\" in time-travel books, so I thought this book would have it all. While the whole fairy connection was humorous, it went a little too far in my opinion, eventually taking away from any credibility the book may have had. I would be interested to read other books in the genre, maybe leaning a little more toward the historical, and less toward the fantastic. It was a good \\"summer read,\\" though, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in the romance/time travel scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Escapist Story - if you like to escape to Never Never Land","review":"Maybe I'm spoiled as I've read all of Diana Gabaldon (whose time travel books are stretch the imagination into believing that time travel can happen). My husband purchased this book for Christmas for me knowing that I love Scottish romances and that I liked the time travel books of Gabaldon. I found the book to be fantastical but simplistic and on the order of unicorns, magic crystals, and elves. The most deperate and annoying aspect of the book was that the unbelievably (and I use that word negatively) studly lover of the main female character demanded that the fairy prince (who banished her back to the future) bring her back to the past and to make sure he brought her cat back too. Her CAT?This book had everything (and I mean everything: an oily rich bohunk who finds his \\"true love\\" and saves her cat...) that a woman desperate for bizarre extreme escapism would want. Maybe I'm cynical. I didn't enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No text to speech option","review":"No text to speech option for this title. Disabled by the publisher.

I read the \\"Fever\\" series first and thoroughly enjoyed all of them. I will not read the Highlander series. Karen is a good story teller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tacky Romance Novel","review":"If you have read the Outlander series by Dianna Gabaldon you will be quite disappointed. This book was placed under the historical fiction category. It is more romantic fiction than historical. That is not my style of reading material."},{"rating":"1","title":"No way two characters could really be this stupid","review":"By the time I got to the middle of this book I wanted to screech with agitation, frustration and impatience. NO ONE could be as stupid and misbegotten as these two people. The silly assumptions and mis-communications ruined what could have been a really good story line. I know Ms. Moning has to be a better writer than this. I assume she is trying to stay true to the romance formula but really this took it too far. How can people who read these books be satisfied with the same plot over and over again.I ran out of other fantasy paranormal books so I turned to this one. Unfortunately, it fell too close to my read of Echo in the Bone by Diana Gabaldon and that's like comparing Stephen Hawking to a first grade primer.I'm going to try and remember that frutration the next time I'm tempted to read a romance again. I gave it two stars because it had a good idea for the story. I'm just sorry she couldn't flesh it out better."},{"rating":"2","title":"gave away","review":"I thought I was buying a cd but I got an album,I don\`t have a turn table so I gave it away,I havn\`t heard anything from the person I gave it to"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Carly's most commercial albums","review":"I've been a fan of Carly's music since her early albums. This album, her first on the Arista label, was really a commercial comeback for Carly spawning several radio singles, music videos, and an HBO concert video at a time when her career really needed a boost. The melodies, songwriting and vocals are top notch on this album, even if the arrangements sound a little dated now (80's music was synth and sax-heavy, after all). As with all of her albums, some of the less commercial songs end up being my favorites. \\"Do The Walls Come Down\\" is a haunting ode to a former love. I love the narrative and harmonies in \\"Two Hot Girls\\" and the last verse is still stuck in my brain (\\"Thanks for introducing us, said Dwight, polite, and I waved goodnight. I wondered why it wasn't me, I guess it's just that the time's not right.\\") I think \\"All I Want Is You\\" is one of her best pop songs and her harmonies with Roberta Flack are sublime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Itsy Bitsy Spider","review":"I bought this album because of the smash hit single \\"Itsy Bitsy Spider\\".

A decade later, three songs stand out: \\"All I Want Is You,\\" \\"Coming Around Again,\\" and \\"You Have To Hurt,\\" the latter one of the most affecting songs I have heard Simon sing.

This CD is full of cookie-cutter ballads and posturing up-tempo tracks. Whitney DAZZLED us with \\"Saving All My Love For You\\". Then she threw her talent away on this CD- except for the bright ear candy of \\"I Wanna Dance With Somebody\\" and the smooth \\"Just the Lonely Talkin' Again\\". Whitney has it all. Looks, talent and enough money to hire some great producer who will just LET HER SING. My suggestion for producers with an ear for the artist of this type: Phil Ramone : he does wonders for Streisand or, yes, Richard Carpenter: the music was subtle and classy, but he let Karen's voice \\"sell\\" the song. If these choices don't work for you, Whitney, run back to David Foster!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheese at its finest form","review":"I think Whitney Houston is a great singer, she has a very powerful voice.

It is CHEESE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Date Well At All","review":"Her first desperate-for-credibility CD (the next one she put out followed this trend). Pretty sad given the class she showed on her debut. The ballads are the best thing about this one. However, the dance tunes (esp \\"I Wanna Dance w/Somebody\\") are pretty embarassing.

Apparently, he found a mine full of treasure, and he went inside and never came out. But, before that, his wife died, and is said to haunt the train. Jake Hurly set out clues for someone so they'd find his treasure after he died. So, its up to you, as Nancy drew, to find the treasure of Jake hurly.This game has wonderful graphics and has nice puzzles. Two mini games where hard to beat, but everything was smooth sailing for there. It wasn't super easy, but it wasn't mega hard. It was very enjoyable. Please, take my advice and get this.

Lots of characters make a game better. The characters had incredible animation, and were very well developed.I think that the the scenery was also a highlight of the game.

This one was one of my favorites. I loved the new cell phone idea and that you can take pictures. The story line is good and there are some definite plot twists. I won't give anything away, but the whole kidnapping and finding sequence is great! I loved how that turned out! Well, the ending is ok, i guess. It wasn't as scary and high energy as some of them. I recommend Secret of Shadow Ranch. It's got a majorly suspensful ending and it's kind of a new expierence in the Nancy Drew games. But overall, this game gets 4 stars. It's definitly worth buying. I think this is good more for teenagers, but its good for adults too. The puzzles are definitly challenging and i noticed that in this one, there are a lot more puzzles than usual.

However, like a lot of fans I was extremely disappointed at the way Cosgrove and Meuer decided to release the show on DVD. If Unsolved Mysteries hadn't been such a fantastic show, I would understand cutting down a lot of material into these segmented box sets. I watched the show from beginning to end and always hoped (even before the onset of TV DVD box sets) that somehow I could own every episode ever made. I thought it would've been crazy to try and tape every single episode when it went into syndication on Lifetime but now I'm kicking myself for not doing just that. The creators could've done a much better job at choosing what to include in the sets. For someone with a mild interest in the show I'm sure the sets we were fortunate enough to have will do just fine. But for the serious fan like myself it'll leave you very frustrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing special features and box in picture is wrong","review":"I read Jonathan T's review and realized that this product has changed from what it was originally.

My daughter's enjoyed the episodes provided, but wished there was more and were expecting the special features described on the box.

I liked the plot and the setting, but the execution was simply horrible. Point of view shifts happened from paragraph to paragraph. The main character was lifeless and dull. There were long passages detailing emotions (sensitive?) but then the plot would be summed up in two or three sentences. It was telling instead of showing at its worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite good","review":"I picked this book up on a whim and was very pleasantly surprised. The author has done a very good job of creating a believable world. The story combines elements of war, politics, social interaction, hiding, and the evitable chase. Although it is similar to a number of other \\"high fantasy\\" series, it is different enough to be very enjoyable. The main protagonist is a young girl hidden through her childhood to protect her from her half brother. Although the characters are young, this book may not be appropriate for some younger readers. Although not extremely graphic, there are instances that are both violent and sexual. Some of this may increase as the main characters age throughout the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the price, can't be beaten","review":"So I was in the market for a man bag but didn't feel like blowing a whole ton of money on one of mediocre quality. I ordered this bag since it was dirt cheap, functional looking and of the size I was looking for. I must say so far I'm quite satisfied, it is light and carries the man stuff I've been hand-carrying around without being obnoxious. I ordered the olive colored one. I think for the price, you aren't going to do a whole lot better.I would really prefer if it had a handle on top for hand carrying as well, as it does seem somewhat purse-like slung over the shoulder. That's just me though. Also, the buttons that close the flap aren't particularly friendly.. a magnetic closing mechanism would be ideal. This might change after using it for a while and \\"breaking in\\" the buttons.If you are just looking for a cheap satchel for carrying a few loose items and essentials, this is a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"no snaps.","review":"my bag arrived without the snap closures on the front flap. there is no way to close it. now i have to go buy some velcro strips and fabric glue to secure the front. rather disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent bag for the money","review":"I bought this bag to use as a grab-and-go \\"kid bag\\" with first aid kit, water bottle, diapers/wipes and a couple other things. With the interior divider I'm easily able to organize those items, with space left over for toys and other incidentals. The pen loops on the outside of the front pocket are tight, but I can get pens into them. The only issue I've encountered is that items are prone to fall out of the front pocket. Velcro would help that. The shoulder strap is a bit narrow and can start to bite when the bag is loaded down, but that's easy to fix.All in all, a good bag, especially for the price. I can think of plenty of other jobs it would work for - geocaching bag, school bag (at least if your books are mostly on e-reader), hiking/hunting, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"I pad bag","review":"I bought this bag for my iPad and it fits just right and has room for cables and other things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strap broke after 2nd day","review":"After only my second day of using the bag, the strap broke.

It holds just enough crap so you can take all your gadgets and other things. I would advise removing the board that is in the back. Inside the bag there is a thin piece of cotton sealing in the board. Just slice it across the top, being careful not to cut through the back, and pull the board out and now you have another inner compartment! Overall highly recommended. Perfect for jaunting around town or in the woods."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really poor stitching","review":"I'd send it back but that is too much bother. The stitching is awful. It is just a single very thin thread stitched around the border.

It wouldn't really fit and textbooks, but I'm an english major, and it definitely fits any novel-sized books with ease. Though the bag is small, it has a surprising amount of storage. I usually hold my Kindle fire, an art notebook, a package of art pens, art pencils, erasers, my ipod, and a book, and there is still a decent amount of space left in it. I've actually never really run into a situation where it didn't have enough space. If you wanted to, you could probably fit a textbook in there, but I don't think I would recommend it; though the bag is durable, constant textbook storage might cause some wear. Overall though, it's great, and it fits everything I need without looking or feeling big and cumbersome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic bag","review":"Size:I needed a man-bag that could hold a water bottle and other random things as I go. This bag fit the bill perfectly. It's small enough to maneuver easily, yet large enough to hold a water bottle, kindle, notebook, and other small items. I've also used it as a pseudo-camera bag to hold my little Nikon D40 and a spare lens with a water bottle. For traveling, it is small enough to fir inside a carry-on or larger backpack for a flight, and can then be pulled out once you get to your destination.Durability:I've used this bag for 2 years, across 3 different countries and it is still going strong. It's starting to show some signs of war, but it looks like it will last at least another year.Cons:- The strap that comes with this bag is too small and thin to be really good. I recommend replacing it.- This bag does not like to stand up when it is set down.Overall, this is a fantastic bag, and well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bag","review":"I have been carrying this bag for over a year, and it's perfect for what I do.

The length and height are about the same, but the width...it opens up to about 4 inches. The quality is fair...the stitching looks pretty solid, but not strong. The strap is pretty thin (just under an inch) with buckles bordering on flimsy. I would not try to carry anything too heavy in this bag.If you want a bag to carry documents or an ipad or some such, this will probably be too big to be convenient. The bag expands to a four inch width, so the contents are unlikely to be held securely.

Short synopsis: the original (Japanese) \\"King Kong vs. Godzilla\\" was a widescreen tour-de-force as far as story and SFX are concerned--the original film, believe it or not, was a cleverly written SATIRE, and not just another \\"bad\\" sci-fi film from the early Sixties. The American version quite frankly butchers the original Japanese film...apparently John Beck (the producer) and company didn't have a CLUE as to what this film was actually about. I'll sum it up simply: if you can get an uncut, Japanese version of this flick, then by all means, get it.

An electric blockade is put up to stop Godzilla. Instead, Kong appears and for some reason draws strength from the electricity. Now, Kong is taken to MT.

It may be no blockbuster, but it is not an aweful movie. The only part of the film that is what gives it a bad reputation is King Kong's costume. It looks terrible. He looks more like a screwed up orangatang than a gorilla. But the action scenes and the magnificent Godzilla suit makes up for it. A big surprise is when they tried out Kong's classic claymation special effect(during the final battle). So if you're a giant monster fan, watch it with a light eye.

I enjoyed this version much better. There was more character development, better pacing, and a much more enjoyable movie all around.

A battle between a 150 foot tall reptile and a 135 foot tall Gorilla. Seriously though, I could have expected much better battle skill from Godzilla. I mean, Godzilla has an Atomic ray and King Kong just has his strength. But it seems that they gave King Kong the power to get stronger by electricity. Anyway, Godzilla\`s Atomic ray could have easily stoped King Kong. Trust me, if Godzilla used his Atomic ray that much, King Kong would be dead. In the end, the monsters roll off a cliff and into the water. After a landslide, King Kong surfaces and swims to his home on Faro island. I really think that King Kong looks ouite bad in this movie.

To be honest, even if you never tried any of the well-detailed recipes included in this book, it would well worth your money just for the breath-taking photography and cultural insights included.

No. So much is missing from this book that it would take me days to list it all. For people who care about the creative process of putting her career together, keeping it afloat, and the progress she's made as an artist, it certainly leaves you wanting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick To Singing Donna","review":"I like Donna Summer. She has a good voice and seems like a decent lady, but this book is boring at best. For someone who has been in show biz as along as she has, I expected more from her. Granted it was refreshing to read a celeb book not drowning in self pity or immoral escapades, but there is just so much a person would want to know about Donna and this book does not satisfy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major diappointment","review":"What a missed opportunity this book has turned out to be! Although it contains a few (not many) insights into Donna's personal life and beliefs, fans hoping for an examination of her music, creative processes, and working relationships with her collaborators like Giorgio Moroder, will find virtually nothing to satisfy their curiosity. Much of her career, the hits, the good and bad times and the controversies, are only touched on lightly or not even mentioned. With masses of pictures filling out the sparse 246 pages or so, the content of this book is so light I feared it would fly away if I wasn't holding on to it! I guess this is all Donna wants her fans to know about her, but frankly, it just isn't interesting reading. Hopefully some other biographer will write a more informative book about Donna and her music some day."},{"rating":"1","title":"what about the website?","review":"I rushed out and bought this book, since I am a very avid fan of Donna Summer. There is simply no finer voice in the pop music world. However, for those of us who are drawn to her musically, this book is sorely lacking in detail. I enjoyed the insights into her personal life, but I would have loved to have read about her creative process, her experience with the various producers she's worked with, and how she's managed to keep her audience interested over a 28 year career span. [] Also, the website mentioned on the inside back cover flap is still under construction....what gives? Your fans deserve better, Donna!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extra ordinary girl!","review":"A very candid look at the life of Disco queen, Donna Summer. Very sensitively and well written, and with lots of previously unseen photos too.I came out of reading this book with a deeper love and respect for this class act.

Fans wanted more but this is the only information they 'get' from their QUEEN.However at the end of the day, this is what Miss Summer wanted to write and yes I agreed with some reviewers, there are a lot that she could write about and tell her fans. Her researchers surely have provided enough information but that's about it! Just a pile of papers and link perhaps for her and Marc Eliot to 'just' view them. Still what is the problem?

The book included many lovely photos, a bit of her 'life' tales... and her musical journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"R U Kidding!!!","review":"Let me begin by saying I've only gotten through half of this book. Whether reading about how she was supposedly shot, almost attempted suicide, was the victim of domestic violence or was the star witness who singlehandledly served justice i found it all to be unbelievable. I make this statement simply because whenever there was someone who could attest to the statement Ms. Summer openly states that she has conveniently changed the names to protect them or they are all dead. She doesn't develop the story line to even begin to explain the affairs and only alludes to them seemingly well after they've begun. Each chapter leaves me scratching my head. I certainly expect that hopefully with each chapter, the book will somehow pick up but at this point i'm totally disappointed. In fairness to the Ms. Summer I hope at some point she chooses to be open about her experiences and give her fans a true look at her life. If you don't want to tell the story don't write the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely Music Performed by a Master","review":"I suppose this is close to being a Furtwangler \\"Lollipop\\" concert, but it is desirable nevertheless.

The \\"Egmont\\", \\"Freischuetz\\" and \\"Rosamunde\\" pieces are the special treats on this disc for me, at least, but I am sure most music lovers will treasure all the works as presented here.

Don't let other reviews tell you that Unifix cubes work - to do some of the lessons correctly (if you are using the lessons) you need snap/interlocking cubes. You also need attribute blocks and pattern blocks. The purpose of this series is developing cognitive skills, so just having kids do these as \\"worksheets\\" doesn't do that. You are teaching them about their own thinking, and how to talk about their thinking. Just be careful when ordering that you have the same year teacher guide to match the year of student book - I got a mismatched set and had to order again from another seller to get the right year student book.

You'll love this CD!","review":"This CD was originally released in 1994 and has become my personal favorite, although I love all of Bill's CD's. I think it's partially due to the depth of some of the songs, including \\"Sound Of The Rain\\", \\"Light Up The Candles\\", and \\"Proud Of Our Blindness\\", which are all favorites. However, every song on this CD is a favorite, from the first song to the last.\\"Turn Your Love Around\\" is another of Bill's grammy winners and it's also one heck of a great song.\\"Just To Be Loved\\" is a song that I absolutely love, but I can't tell you why. For some reason it just reaches out and grabs me.This CD also features Tom Saviano, Greg Mathieson, Bruce Gaitsch, Tamara Champlin & others.Buy this CD. You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A gem from Bill Champlin","review":"Bill Champlin never made it as a major recording artist due to his work with Chicago and session work.

Falling Free is a relatively quick read, but every page is delightful. My only criticism, and it's not very significant, is that many of the characters are not quite as developed as in her other books; but their depth is more than sufficient. As typical of her work, the plot is flawlessly laid out and the unfolding story is believable, both from a human and technical aspect. I am pleased with how she satires impersonal, amoral business practices, including how a simple, stupid policy can wreak havoc on innocent lives. Not to fear, Lois provides a hero that we can relate too, and who stands up to monolithic bureaucracy and overbearing technocrats. This is high-grade science fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"I read this book when it first came out years ago, and I really enjoyed it. Bujold's writing got better after this novel, but don't let that stop you from reading this non-Miles adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weakest novel in the Miles Vorkosigan universe","review":"This novel is set in same universe as the Miles Vorkosigan series, but about 200 years before the birth of Miles, so connected very loosely to the main series. Main character Leo Graf is an engineer who is assigned to the quaddie project - quaddies being bioengineered humanoid workers who are specialized in freefall work because they have 4 arms rather than 2 arms and 2 legs. I've become a Bujold fan after reading a handful of Miles Vorkosigan novels, but this is by far the weakest novel I've read by the author. The plot is very thin and extremely predictable, the characters are flat, and if not for Bujold's talent in keeping the story moving and the dialogue lively, I would have ditched this book after 100 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising quality for the price","review":"I purchased this chainring with double chainguard to use on a small bike I am fixing up for my grandchild.

She did write a song with that title, but \\"Time After Time\\" is a jazz standard written by Sammy Cahn and Jule Styne that first appeared in the 1947 movie \\"It Happened in Brooklyn\\", long before Ms Lauper was born."},{"rating":"1","title":"only a good documentary","review":"Like many have said around here, this is only a documentary, kind of like the ones you see on television on a sunday afternoon. While it is interesting to know more about Miles and where he came from and how he lived, it's not something that deserves such a price on DVD. What really peeks the interest of the viewers is the footage shown inside the documentary. whether it is Miles playing live with the orchestra led by Gil Evans, or with the Kind of Blue sextet, or the 60's post-bop quintet... etc This documentary should have been a bonus disc to a collection of live performances by Miles.Buy this only if you need a documentary about Miles, otherwise get Live in Munich."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomplete","review":"I do understand what a documentary really is, but why these guys give us just a couple of SECONDS of the vintage video tape material. The classic quintet; the first shows with Chick Corea and Keith Jarret; the Charlie Parker period...everything is there but absolutely and dramatically abridged (not even one single track is shown complete). I don't like this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Cigarette, are you kidding?","review":"How can you trust anything as factual when the picture on the cover is altered? Where's the famous cigarette and smoke column? Of course we all know that Apple made the changes for their ad compaign many years ago. But, to actually use the \\"politically correct\\" image rather than the real one is beyond description. The producers should have used another image and the fact they didn't has got to be reflective of the rest of the DVD. I haven't seen the DVD, and won't simply because of the insult on the cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not agree more....","review":"It is a DOCUMENTARY, not a CONCERT. And a pretty good one at that. If you're interested in learning more about the Man behind the \\"incredible music\\" this is a great place to start.

I couldn't even make it through the whole CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music and the Inhaler!","review":"The movie has been made in Europe. It has good locales. There is evidence of fine taste for paintings. A. R. Rehman's music is good, but not great. Anil Kapoor comes out as competent. The story is quite thin and the narration is unexciting. Boman Irani gives an entertaining performance. Zayed Khan, Salman Khan, Katrina Kaif et al, disappoint.The story is about a rich father in London who dictates to his friend and Attorney (Mithun Chakrobarty) how to play out his Will. There are millions in the estate. The ultimate aim is to bring about strong brotherhood among his 3 children from 2 marriages. There is a scheming \\"Mama\\" (Uncle). And, there is a very little boy. There is a talented singer who has severe asthma.Increasingly, numerology is dictating the spelling of movie titles. However, the story is thin and the movie falls flat, although Subhash Ghai has directed and made this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie!","review":"If I listened to the critics, I would have missed out on a great movie. Classical music in a Bollywood production definitely works here! A good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yavvraaj (2008) Not an original","review":"The version of the movie Yuvvraaj that I bought turned out not to be an original copy as advertised. This movie turned out to be 24 minutes shorter than the original released DVD. Major scenes were edited out of the movie, and what was left was a seriously butchered version.I have a copy of the original released DVD, and it is 180 minutes long, and quite entertaining. Salman Khan did a great job portraying the dislikable character, Deven. He redeems himself before the movie ends, but without the missing scenes, the movie really falls flat.I advise anyone to not purchase the shortened and edited version of Yuvvraaj, because now it is a waste of time. Instead of returning the movie, I tossed it in the waste bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful girls, but poor quality DVD","review":"Notice that this is NOT a Penthouse video, even though one of the models (Jana Cova) did appear in their magazine, and boy does it make a difference. Everything about this DVD--lighting, editing, choreography--has a very cheap feel to it. The girls are very attractive, but they look plain under these conditions. The whole thing looks like it was shot in about an hour. The camera is plopped down in front of the models and they strip. That's it. It's boring after only a few seconds. The price is low, but for a reason. I recommend reading reviews of some Penthouse videos (because not all of theirs are great either) and choose the best. They feature stunningly gorgeous girls with feature-film-quality photography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yep.........","review":"I must say this video is hot. Very sexy women. Most are naturally endowed and sensuous. This is almost a 5. Big breasted lusty women, small petite great body, sexy women. Jana is p-h-i-n-e fine. I can find nothing wrong with this video. I didn't give it a 5 because one of the models wasn't that good to look at. This is one for your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather Disappointing","review":"I was very upset with this disc. I know that the bits from the movie are classic, but I was hoping to have more of the incidental music from the film, most notably the mock heroic theme that accompanies our \\"heroes\\" through their journey.The additional material can be funny, but it is also extremely raunchy, more so than the actual film which is my favorite Python film because it is the cleanest.All in all, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better if it was limited to the Soundtrack","review":"Indeed, when this recording first appeared as a vinyl record album, it was the only source for sound clips from the movie. Some of the more famous HOLY GRAIL bits are on this CD, but the recording is cluttered with other superfluous routines and supposedly funny commentary. This CD would be much better if it contained the whole movie soundtrack as Python fans need no explaination of what is going on at any given moment in the recording. If you buy this CD, be prepared to skip the unrelated comic bits to get to the pure GRAIL dialogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"We really like Tums, but had never tried ...","review":"We really like Tums, but had never tried the extra strength.

Poems and an introduction by Boston poet William Corbett illuminate some sources of the beautiful collages.At 67, Coble is an accomplished artist and a brilliant reader who does what many of us would like to do in any medium--express gratitude to others, movie stars and writers--for what they've added to our lives. More than that, Coble's gravity and canny realism make us see what we haven't before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended!","review":"I bought these under the assumption that the low profile, comfort and sound protection would be good.These are VERY uncomfortable, are hardly sound protection, and are just plain junk!These broke the first day at the range, trust me, these are lame!I returned them!

It's actually a treatise on how to misbehave in the most socially acceptable way. There isn't ANY useful information on manners or decorum as far as I could see. I feel like I wasted my money. The cover illustration is very cute, but don't let it fool you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible and Silly","review":"I picked this up just like every other woman thinking that it would be a funny book about how to live gracefully. I was wrong! This book basically states that you are fabulous if you always are in a bad relationship, sleep around a lot (or are always ready to), and have no morals at all. In every chapter of the book there was some mentioning about sex and even a whole chapter devoted to it. It was like reading a script from Sex and the City. Don't let the words \\"Fabulous girl\\" and \\"Decorum\\" fool you into thinking that this book is about fabulous girls who are well behaved. It is actually about how to live a pathetic life and have no respect for yourself. Oh, and have whiny friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better books","review":"I think this book would be ideal for a woman in the 1920's. If you are a woman, looking to be empowered, this is NOT the book for you. It talks about never losing your temper, never using your horn and never getting angry period. If somebody is rude to you, you are just supposed to shut up and smile. It is wordy and has personal stories. Not the advice I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"As another review had already stated, don't let the cover fool you. This is exactly how I was sucked in. I took this book home and upon reading the first few pages, I realized it just wasn't for me. I just don't buy into their definitions of decorum, female empowerment, or plain reality. To summarize this book: \\"Appearance is important whether you agree or not, so shave your legs regularly and always be sure to wear flimsy underwear (or none at all) so you can impess men in the event of a one night stand!\\" To quote my sister, this was basically a loooooong issue of Cosmo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"This book was a total waste of money.

Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turns out I don't want to be a Fabulous Girl","review":"If being a Fabulous Girl means sleeping around, putting style above substance, lying on your resume \\"the right way\\", being shallow and snarky in general, etc., count me out. These authors are so off the mark it's embarrassing. Or maybe it was all a big joke. I think the joke's on them, though. I can't see anyone admiring people who are responsible for this book, except for perhaps the slimiest cretins. I normally donate books I don't like, or resell them; this is the first book I've ever read -- and I've read a lot -- that I am literally going to burn so that no one else has the misforunate of reading it. Absolute trash that I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy."},{"rating":"1","title":"so pathetic","review":"This book doesn't offer much advice at all.

It's the worst book I've attempted to read in a long time. It's so bad, it's the ONLY book I haven't finished reading in the past five years. I couldn't even get past the second chapter. The so-called 'tips' in this novel are blatantly obvious and sometimes misinformed. I concur with the reader who stated in her review she could get more information out of an issue of Marie Claire.

Al Stewart's genius was in writing songs that were intelligent enough to provoke thought and even study but, at the same time, be accessible enough for Top 40 radio. This collection shows that genius in all of its glory.Song after song on this CD is a classic. While not everything is included here (Soho (Needless to Say), Carol, and If It Doesn't Come Naturally, Leave It would have fit in nicely) this is a very good introduction to one of Scotland's finest exports. Although Rhino's recent collection contains more songs and represents nearly everything here, this release does contain two songs (\\"Delia's Gone\\" and \\"Nostradamus\\", two of my personal favorites) that the Rhino disc does not. If you want a good snapshot of Al Stewart's heyday, this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Colour Reproductions disappoint","review":"The colour reproductions of Morandi's oil Paintings are very disappointing. The prints didn't \\"live \\" at all and have lost the subtlety of colour that characterises Morandi's work. There is little or no depth to the colour. Morandi's deep toned accents suffer and appear thin. Those marvellous flashes of apricot/orange are maddenly deadened. There is often an overbalance of a greenish ochre in the colour print. The textural quality of Morandi's brushwork is curiously flattened and lifeless.Fortunately the Watercolours, drawings and etchings have not suffered to the same extent: although I cannot believe the grey cast that is given to what must have frequently been a variety of white papers.Good text. Informative photographs but overall a disappointing purchase - especially in NZ dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Reader's Digest Version","review":"If you have had the opportunity to see the (out-of-print) show catalogue (Giorgio Morandi: [catalogue of] an exhibition of paintings, water-colours, drawings and etchings) this skimpy overview will not only disappoint, it also will not whet your appetite for more of this insightful artist's oeuvre."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Morandi title under $200.00","review":"The great strength of this book is its inclusive nature and the quality of printing. Morandi, like many painters, worked out in drawing what would he would find later in the paintings, his best known medium. There are enough water-colors and etchings to enhance the understanding of his paintings by featuring his interests in color and tone in the former, shape and tonal areas in the latter. All these and clearer reproduction (especially of brush strokes, surface textures) make it a better buy than the also useful K. Wilkin book on Morandi. Morandi fans won't mind owning both books; even among the paintings there is not great overlap in particular works. Where there is a double, the differences help remind you of the limitations of reproductions, no matter what book they're in.

The film delivered Romance, Music, Jeff Bridges as the hansom male actor and Barbra Streisand was lovely as the main character Rose, Lauren Bacall was a scene stealer all the way through the film and I only wish it had been longer, I enjoyed it so much I did not want it to end, it left a nice feeling."},{"rating":"2","title":"She eats carrots now, Isn't that tragic?","review":"I adored this movie! maybe there were a few too many shots of Babs but it was really well done.

But what I want to say is that one of the other viewers wondered what became of the boom mike he saw hanging in several scenes when he saw the movie in a theater.

What was she thinking when she made this pasted-together film about a fiftyish \\"ugly duckling\\" who marries an asexual professor and can't figure out how to \\"un-platonic\\" their relationship? Part of the problem is that Streisand never fully commits herself to looking unattractive at the beginning: her idea of looking homely is long, dark clothing and brown hair, but with all the movie star lighting firmly in place. Barbra then drops the original film's plastic surgery transformation for a make-over that changes her looks into a Barbie doll of ill repute. Voila!

Within 6 hours of using this... i had blemishes. I have very clear skin. If you have sensitive skin this tanner would be a pain for you :( i wanted it to work... it didnt. point blank. In fact, the color didnt really show up the first day, which i didnt expect it to since its a gradual tanner. I had to stop using it because of my skin. Maybe if you dont have sensitive skin, this may work for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is good stuff!!!","review":"I love this product!

My recommendation to anyonewho reads this book is to follow up on as many of the referencesyou can, not taking for granted that Wise is representing themaccurately. In all likelihood, he isn't.

Not the very best WWII first person shooter (Call of Duty) but very good and different in important ways. First, it is not (mostly) about running through the fray and killing, it is about stealth and guile. You get to see a first person shooter from an angle not widely explored, literaly behind enemy lines (as the spy). Watch German soldiers doing PT, getting drunk, dressed down, and visiting with local females (french). Although Amazon lists it as an E rating, it is actually rated T, and probalby should be rated M. Cussing, bloddy violence and sexual themes are common and add to the \\"real\\" feel of the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS AN EIDOS GAME!!!!","review":"Wow!

This time, Eidos put it all together, a great game with fps lunacy, stealth and thought which is required to beat this game along with great simple controls to boot.

It doesn't have the look and feel of what made Commandos famous and it tried to imitate all the other 1st person shooter and yet failed miserably to do so.

The performance and sound quality are those of a live performance, so be prepared for that. However, it is very interesting to hear Python captured live, where their humor is at its rawest (no time for editing in a live performance). With Monty no longer out on the road, this is a great way to hear what they were like in the flesh at their prime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too good; trust me, I should know!","review":"I happen to be familiar with most of monty python's material. I love it. But this CD was done apparantly in some sort of concert form so it's constantly interrupted by wild clapping from the audience. Annoying. And there ARE some of their funniest sketches on there, but they do them 1. at the top of their lungs which does NOT add to the humor and 2. with slight changes in the dialogue, mostly to accomodate their addition of expletives that weren't in the original sketches that also detract from the humor.

The trick is finding the right book and getting the teen to agree to read it. Author Regina Doman has made this trick a little less challenging by writing a series of books that are both engaging and appropriate for teen (and \\"grown up\\") readers. The title of Doman's latest installment, may sound a bit dark on the surface, but the story abounds with a light and faith that transcends the classic fairy tale it is based on. I had the opportunity to share this book with my thirteen year old son, who joins me in highly recommending it to other families."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap black and white photocopy of original","review":"I am only reviewing the format of this book. It is a black and white photocopy of the original which is bound in softcover. To read it, you have to turn the book sideways, i.e. it is printed in landscape format but bound vertically.

The croc pattern looks ok, but the way the bag feels is how you can immediately tell the poor quality. Most importantly, it is too big for everyday use. At 5'2.5\\" I looked incredibly disproportionate with it and even on my taller coworkers it did not look flattering. As for travelling purposes, why would you want to lug something so large and heavy when you can just use regular suitcases?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"With all the positive reviews I expected this to be a very nice bag.

The bag has a great interior with a zippered pocket, slots for pens, electronics, business cards, separate compartment for laptop, and another area secured with velcro. It also has a clasp to attach your keys to and comes with a small clutch you can use when you are traveling and don't want to carry your laptop with you. I love that the bag has a zipper closure. No worries about things falling out! I tend to overstuff bags and this bag handles it with no problems. The feet on the bottom help the bag stand upright on its own. The handles are long enough to throw something on top of it while carrying and/or while wearing a coat. I'm 5'6\\" and this is a great size as well!

Fast forward 30 odd years later and who is on Unsung but Angela singing \\"Tonight I Give In.\\" I was elated and a very sad because I more than likely will not hear this amazing woman live.

It should also be required reading for anyone doubting the very real commitment to change of those on the left. A refreshing anti-dote to both the right wing corporate media and the extreme hippie left (that sometimes characterizes the neo pagan movement), this book argues the case for change in our society.A rich thought provoking text, stock full of concrete examples of the forces aligned against the environment, this book is both a call to action and a justification for that action in the protection of our existence. Yes it is that serious, but justifiably so. Dangerous Religion is a must for those who want to see a better \\"tomorrow.\\"Outlining the case for global animism and the protection of our environement, the book nourishes the neo pagan movements future growth. With serious authors such as Myers the future of neo paganism is in safe hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once again....","review":"I'm blown away by another superb album by an incredible, little-known band named Pinback. This album is wonderful. From the first song, until the last, this album holds me captive. The first song, \\"Non Photo-blue\\" has the same Pinback sound expected from previous albums, such as Blue Screen Life and the self-titled album. This song is great. I bought the album two days ago, and I can't stop listening to this song. There is a sense of maturity on this album that is not present on the others. Maybe absiv and robc are growing up. They are coming into their own as artists. Other great songs include \\"Bloods on Fire,\\" \\"Fortress,\\" \\"The Yellow Ones,\\" and the closing song, \\"Scent.\\" All of the songs on this album are incredible. If you have never heard Pinback, I recommend picking up any of their albums. And, if you get the chance to see them live - do it. They are amazing live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different from the norm","review":"Summer in Abadon has some great songs, such as non- photo blue, and fortress, however, the album can get old over time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plateau Music","review":"Pinback are really talented musicians, but I can't help but feel like they achieve only half their potential. I can appreciate that they are going for a unique sound, but in keeping with that, it inevitably makes all their songs sound too similar. Each song sounds like a track that would go between two louder, harder, edgier or whatever tracks. There's such a lack of tension, build up, and climax with this singular, Drop-D acoustic plucking approach. There's no uphill or downhill in the listening experience - just a plateau.That sad, I really like the song \\"Fortress.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh How I Love Thee","review":"I absolutly LOVE this album along with Blue Screen Life. Pinback's music has great lyrics, nice chords, and a chill atmospheric tone. They could possibly be compared to The Kings of Convenience sound wise but with added lyrical depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is amazing...","review":"It took me a lil while longer then most to get into Pinback but when I did... HOT DAMN! Yea this isn't there best album *cough* BLUE SCREEN LIFE*cough* but it's def a 5 star album. All songs are just amazing to listen to, and it's one of those CD's you can just put it and listen to over and over.

See them live, there amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pinback discovered!","review":"I heard Pinback first on Sirius Left of Center and I bought their recent album.

Just watch them blossom...I hope they come to northern California!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Desert Valley Abandon","review":"You see, San Diego, California -where Pinback comes from- is both near a Pine and a Desert Valley, and that brings forth the sort of \\"hurried melancholy\\" you can find in the songs. If you've ever traveled through that area, you can easily plug this music and find yourself in tune with your surroundings, in a manner that recalls that first time when you realized things had a way of appearing beautiful in a sense.There's the intricate, intertwined melodies, the slow build-up of the songs, from a simple foundation of nature to an almost tender rising that leads to the beginnings of a city.Perfect music for when you are travelling, and you still want to feel the \\"spectactlar entrance\\" of things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book ever?","review":"Ok, I am a great fan of Harry Harrison. I think he's a magnificent author. But, this book, is the biggest piece of trash I have read. I have a version printed in 1976, copyrighted in 1973 and it reads like something from the 1940s in attitude, content and style. If it's supposed to be serious, it's not, because you can't take it seriously; if it's supposed to be funny, it also misses the mark. If I wanted people to become fans of Harry Harrison and his work, I would steer them away from this book. I can not imagine what anyone was thinking to suggest this be reprinted again in the 2000s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Traintastic Fun!","review":"My boys love Chuggington and this DVD makes it easy for them to watch their favorite trains anytime!

And the worst thing is, he lulls you into thinking you're going to get an unbiased account. He begins with a fair assessment of Adam Smith and does manage to be critical of the various socialists he parades in front of us. My first clue as to his socialist leanings was the mere passing reference he pays to Jean-Baptiste Say as part of a long chapter on Ricardo. But it really goes downhill from there. The Austrian school, Laffer's curve and the supply-siders, Milton Friedman and the monetarists: none of it ever happened according to Heilbroner. These are not just slighted - they are not even mentioned. Not one word!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mixed Bag, Indeed!","review":"One reader of this book has noted that this book is a \\"mixed bag\\". I think he/she is exactly right.Obviously, this author has done something pretty remarkable, and has compiled a unique treatment of the history of economics. And the writing style is engaging and entertaining. In many areas, too, the author is very balanced and accurate. In other areas, not very balanced at all nor accurate.The author resorts often to equivocation and the adoration of Keyenes is sometimes nauseating. And the omission of any significant treatment of Austrian economics is glaring.In the final analysis, the strength of this book is also its downfall. The unique narrative style of unfolding the content makes it intriguing and sets it apart from other economics books. But it also contributes to a lack of objectivity and a lack of balance at some points."},{"rating":"2","title":"referential","review":"I've read and reread this book so many times, it's like an old curmudgeonly friend and I hate that it ignores von Mises and van Hayek! If you want a good basic all around picture of how economics was born and the people (mostly men) who painted the weird landscapes of money and morality, I'd recommend this book. It's not the end all... as I pointed out at the beginning, Heilbroner ignores the Austrian school entirely. Is there a better book with biographies of the most influential economists? If there is, please post back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Intro to Economic History","review":"The Worldly Philosopher's is a great introduction to economic history. It's very well written (unless you're an English professor, you may want to keep a dictionary/thesaurus nearby!), very comprehensive for a ~330 page book, and very engaging. Heilbroner is able to weave the lives, times, and ideas of the great economists into eminently accessible stories. I especially recommend it to those who don't know much about the great economists or economics but want to learn about the field's history."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brief review of economic history-no more, no less","review":"A decent review of economic philosophy as it changed across time. Not very much depth, but that's the point. This book is on the \\"List of Unrequired Reading\\" from UT-Austin, my undergraduate institution. I can't say it's well-written, but probably as easy to read as economics gets. As other reviewers have noted, you read about one period/economist and wish there was more substance given. However, if this were the case, the book would be 1000 pages. After each section, I found myself going to Wikipedia for more information. At the end of the day I learned quite a bit. I'd say this makes a good quick read that would be useful to those lacking a basic understanding of economics and/or the concept of free markets (some of my liberal friends come to mind here).For a better combination of educational (history) and entertaining reading, I'd suggest something by Daniel Boorstin like The Discoverers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic!","review":"I read this for a college economics class more than 30 years ago, and now I am buying it for a high school graduation present for a friend. This is a book that gets beyond the dry charts and numbers to the fascinating problems that economics studies and the creative thinkers who tackled them."},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting contrast","review":"I recently assigned Heilbroner along with New Ideas from Dead Economics (by Todd Buchholz) in a college course and found them a useful contrast. Buchholz is a bit to the right of the mainstream and Heilbroner is far to the left, so they usually give different perspectives on the economists of the past. If I were to use only one, Buchholz would be the clear choice. Heilbroner is a better writer than he is an economist, while Buchholz is both a gifted writer and a sound economist. Perhaps because he is unhappy with most of what has happened in the past half century in economics, Heilbroner ends his book with Schumpeter in the 1940s. In contrast, Buchholz believes that the past half century has been a creative and exciting time in economics and, hence, one gets from him a better sense of what is happening in economics today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keynes and Smith chapters were great","review":"An \\"ok\\" read, I only bought it because Greg Mankiw recommended it on his blog.

A great place to start to get an understanding of the thoughts of some of the leading philosophers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keynesian Bias","review":"While the book covers most of the early economists and John Maynard Keynes and those following in his footsteps, it leaves out Ludwig von Mises and Milton Friedman and it only mentions Friedrich Hayek 3 times in references to letters written to him. So as far as Heilbronner is concerned, Austrian Economics does not exist. He also admits that he leans toward Social Democracy and he glorifies Europe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and important people omitted","review":"Despite being really interested in getting a good overview of the various ideas and lifes of great economists and being highly motivated I have not managed to get past page 132 - it was such a boring read. It would be much more informative and quicker to print out and read the wikipedia pages of the economists mentioned.Furthermore the book does not discuss (in most cases not even mention) very influential economists like Friedman, van Mises and it also gives the wrong impression that the first person ever to think about economics was Adam Smith."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was poorly written","review":"This book was not one of my favorites...in fact I didn't like it at all. I think they undermind what it is to be a writter. I don't think this author should write any more books.

For that purpose it works very well. I can tell that traffic approaching me on side streets and taking left turns in front of me sees me and reacts to me. Also, it was simple to mount, and the batteries last a long time. So, I'm quite satisfied with this light.However, if you are riding in truly dark areas, this light is definitely not bright enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bright light, crummy mount","review":"I really liked this light for the 3 months or so that it lasted. It's bright, uses readily-available AA batteries (I found rechargeable NiMH ones, which held a charge for a long time). The problem is the plastic mount is well behind the center of gravity, so it bounces a lot on rough roads. That's what killed my light: I was riding on a gravel road, and the fatigue simply caused the light to break off its mount. The light itself still works, but the mounting is irreparable, so I had to toss the whole thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect light for my jogging stroller.","review":"I use the EL320 on my BOB jogging stroller, not so much to illuminate the road/path in front of me, but to make the stroller highly visible to oncoming runners, cyclists, cars, etc. I previously used a cheaper cateye model, which worked fine, but its light was very yellow and not very bright. The light from the EL320 is far, far brighter than my previous light, and is much 'whiter.' The beam is a bit more focused than my previous light, but there is still plenty of 'spill' to the left and right. The light is compact, lightweight, and mounts easily. Highly recommended for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"These look and feel good but the little nobs do break off pretty quick, ruining the shoes completely.

I would wear them all day if I could. I haven't had any nodules break and have worn them inside and out over the last two months. I am considering the Kenkoh sandal but at nearly four times the cost I could get several of these. I think the Kenkoh has raised nodules in certain areas the addisage does not.

Unlike most other Neutrogena soaps, it has a moderately strong floral scent, sort of sweet and musty, which lingers on your skin after a shower. If I hadn't found the fragrance so unpleasant, I would've given this product four stars. It's thicker than Neutrogena Rainbath -- thick enough to use with or without a washcloth.

Each story has some different way of offering a thrilling glimpse into the stuff from which the human soul is made. The title story is an intriguing journey into self-actualization, and I rarely find this kind of depth and quality in fantasy. Most of the other stories are equally inventive, and similarly revealing, but \\"Daughter of Regals\\" is my favorite of the bunch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks like a magazine; offers great advice","review":"Looks like the best of teen magazines but carries real-world advice with a Christian perspective. I really liked this book! It had good, but not judgemental advice on everything from clothes, pierced belly buttons, tatoos and friends to boyfriends, sex and beauty. It doesn't go into explicit details... but it offers solid advice for teen girls growing up in tough times. I think maybe the best section is quotes from teen guys talking about what they wished teen girls knew! I plan to give this magazine/book as a gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book/Series","review":"I bought these for my fourteen-year-old daughter, and she absolutely loves them. She says that they've really helped bring her closer to God and answered a lot of questions she had. The series addressed issues such as purity, gay marriage, abortion, modesty, fitting in, guys, and friends in a Christianly way without derogatory statements. The books are set up like a teen magazine with several pictures and quizzes that helped keep her attention. All in all, I think the series would be a great gift to any teenage girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right Idea Wrong Direction","review":"90 percent of worlds population will have sex before they are married.

But the kindle edition is the very old first edition. This was my first kindle purchase, and I am very disappointed. Now I have to go buy the paper version, since it looks like that is the only way to get the updated second edition. So amazon has effectively tricked me into wasting some money. Granted, I should have looked closer, but amazon should not put a link to the kindle first edition of the book directly on the second edition's paper page.As for the book itself, it is very well written, and is a great introduction to the topic. I would have given it 5 stars if Amazon had not misled me and cost me some money. If you are just looking for an introduction to the topic, the first edition still isn't bad.

But this book was written several centuries too late to provide the payload.The style of the book is classical scholarship.

The author treats this subject with understanding and spiritual wisdom. It's so hard sometimes to give your life to God and let the pain go.

The first part was quite good, mostly because it had to do with the inheritance of a 16th century house (...me and my old English house obsession).The final chapters were a little spotty and uneven and could have used about 20 more pages to wrap everything up better.

And it marches in a totally different direction than usual. Unlike the last album (Freedumb) which was heavy on the fast-punk (not that there's anything wrong with that), this album seemlessly blends many musical styles including funk and metal (also with the good o' punk rock). Think Red Hot Chilli Peppers on Stereroids. They almost seem as if they are headed in the direction of the older Infectious Grooves albums, while the the new Infectious Grooves Album (Mas Borracho) slid even more in the direction of funk. (Note: Infectious Grooves is pretty much the same band as Suicidal Tendencies). Why aren't these guys more famous?"},{"rating":"2","title":"quite untypical for Suicidal","review":"There has not been one ST-album that I haven't enjoyed so far and yet, Free Your Soul ... And Save My Mind made the impression of being the first exception to this rule at first. It took a rather long time until I acquired a taste for it and it's not that I'm not used to the fact that every Suicidal-album needs its time to sink into my auditory canals properly to unfold its full power. While tracks like Self Destruct, No More No Less and Start Your Brain, that follow the direction of Freedumb, immediately made me shout along, the majority of the songs show much stronger funk and ballad-like influences. And still these tracks have debth that waits to be discovered. The Infectious Grooves - impact is clearly recognisable, but there is also the unique Suicidal-spirit to be felt. Straight From The Heart is such a track that owns both these qualities."},{"rating":"2","title":"4-and-a-Half Stars, Solid Release from Suicidal","review":"Free Your Soul is one of the more eclectic ST albums, sounding much of the time like a mix between their hardcore punk sound and Infectious Grooves. This blend is pretty interesting and several of the songs get stuck in your head right away, like Su Casa Es Mi Casa, the title track, Straight from the Heart, and Charlie Monroe. The album ends like the previous release, Freedumb, with a slow track called Home, which I think is one of Suicidal's better ballad-y songs. I've been a fan of this band since the late 80's, but didn't get this album until recently. To me, the riffs and some of the songs are not quite as great as Freedumb, which I thought was incredible, but I think it fits in nicely with their other material, and I plan on listening to it many, many times. ST is one the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody Please Define \\"Christian\\"","review":"What makes this album \\"Christian\\" and not secular? Is it the absence of trashy lyrics, replaced by themes of self-confidence, self-assurence, and self-praise? My sister plays this all the time and it drives me batty. I love Christian rock when it's quality stuff, but this is not quality. It's not unique and it's not inspiring. We need to stop making stuff that's just a \\"notch\\" above secular music.

After reading this book impressionable young kids may feed their dogs chocolate","review":"I liked this book but in the book the dog, Harold shares that he and one of the kids often share a snack of chocolate. He does say that they aren't supposed to but it could give younger readers the idea that it is okay to feed chocolate to dogs, or their pets in general without knowing or thinking about what could happen if they do.

Ms. Warwick's vocal stylings have always been poor and the song selections here are even poorer. The thiness of Ms. Warwick's voice is only outweighed by her less than appropiate ability to carry a tune. One must really concentrate for even a smattering of music that can even pass as average on this set. That sad thing is, Ms. Warwick probably could not do any better.

I couldn't put it down. There is plenty of action, and it is gripping. His writing makes you want to skip ahead to find out what happens. The aliens are really alien for a change, instead of just being intelligent earth animals, like in most Sci-Fi. The aliens also have different subcultures, which is also missing from most sci-fi. Mr. Allen shows great imagination and writing skill with this one and I look forward to all his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting plot, stilted style.","review":"Allen, in his prefatory notes explains that this is compilation of two previous works. He is also careful to point out that he has polished the earlier works with acquired skills as a writer. Had I had the misfortune to encounter those earlier works, I can guarantee I would have avoided this book. The plot is interesting, but the characters are flat and contrived, plot devices appears as afterthoughts and undeveloped inventions, and the style is plodding. Still, one hopes this author matures in his talent. Occaisionally the flash of style is there, yet fades too quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snap World Power...

As soon as I heard the sample tracks, I knew I had to have it. I have been a devoted Ray Price fan for over 40 years and have always liked to listen to any song Faron Young recorded. Their vocal styles blend perfectly on this collection. Their voices compliment each other on the duets and the singles that each of them chose to sing were perfect choices. Every selection is top drawer and I listen to this wonderful album over and over again. Unfortunatly we have lost Faron, but I will treasure this collection of masterpieces always and it will always be a jewel in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dean Martin style","review":"This CD will appeal to people who like Ray Price's second career, that with pop instrumentation.

This CD gave him an opportunity to do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Spirit; Interesting Colors","review":"Contains 13 Spirit stories, with odd coloring.

It worked well for a year. I only connect my mouse and keyboard through this hub. Last week there was this terribly strong burning plastic smell at my desk; it was this device and it was very hot. I tested the product without the ac adaptor and it still got hot. I let it cool for a week and tested it again; it still got hot and smelled. It's in my garbage.

I make that recipe more than any other quick chicken recipe (besides Sam Gugino's Chicken Puttanesca with Polenta). It is delicious and totally simple. You literally stuff Boursin under the skin and, voila, you have chicken worthy of company. You can mix it up by using different flavors of Boursin, too.I gave four stars to the book because there really aren't enough recipes included, and there are no quick and easy desserts.

I will not buy a reconditioned one again. The reconditioned mixer lasted only 2 1/2 years. I do not consider that to be acceptable. My Sunbeam mixer lasted 30 years (inherited from my mother) before I broke the housing.

The locking mechanism pops out as soon as I turn on the mixer. I pretty much consider this purchase a $150 bowl of mashed potatoes. Spoke to customer service yesterday and sent customer service the details of the invoice as they requested--have not heard back or even been acknowledged that they had received the copy of my invoice.

It you're an art lover or history lover, this video is for you as it goes into great depth going over the history of Hungary and of detailing the country's art. I thought I bought a tourism DVD, not a history DVD. If you're looking for a video to show you what to see and what to do while in Budapest, this video had very little to offer.

I would only recommend it if you are very new to chaos magic, so new that you don't know who Austin Spare is at all, or the basic tenents of chaos magic--which are study all systems, take what works for you, and hit the delete key on what doesn't. Chaos magic is wonderful, it allows you to be free to practice whatever gets results (don't you wish everything in this world was that simple?). I wouldn't recommend this for anyone who is already advanced through at least 1 magical system, it is strictly a beginner's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Information!","review":"With Chaos Magic books being still rather rare, this is possibly one of the most essential of the bunch as it gives some history and perspective on what it is all about without all the hype that traverses the e-lists.

I really enjoyed using the maps of Spares old residence to make a 'Chaos Pilgrimage' when I visited London, and the background of Chaos Science, fractals and strange attractors are explained in a simple easy to understand manner.

It took me about 30 seconds to understand why it was so cheap. In the interest of saving space and, I imagine, money, the editors of this edition eliminated the spacing in front of paragraphs. The effect is that one feels like one is reading a single giant paragraph. The effect is jarring and not at all pleasurable.Additionally, this edition is filled to the brim with spelling errors and other typos. There are probably errors every 2-3 pages.

I'd never go that far in trying to restrict anyone from reading anything that's out there, but in Dubliners there is a certain sense that for those who have trained their minds to seek out the nuances hidden within literature, a great reward lies waiting. These ultra-realistic, almost dry stories of ordinary men and women and the para-extraordinary in each of their lives, is set in Dublin, circa 1900, and is one of those collections that shows a new side of itself on every reading. Plus unlike most of Joyce's work, this book is easily readable."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of a kind!","review":"I first bought James Joyce's \\"Dubliners\\" for the story 'The Dead'. I read this story over and over before finally looking at another story. I was quickly hooked and read the book from cover to cover in a matter of days. (That is incredibly fast for me) The amazing thing about \\"Dubliners\\" is that you can pick out a story, read it and be more than satisfied, but then read the whole thing and get a completely different, but equally gratifing, expierence. Do yourself a favor and read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your time","review":"perhaps you enjoy reading James Joyce. that being the case, ignore what i am about to say lest you take offense...James Joyce is the biggest joke. nothing but a drunken Irishman, he writes both predictably and AGITATINGLY. his diction bothers me and his language frustrates me more.these stories, all written about Joyce's passion for Ireland do capture the lifestyle, i'll give the man that much, and he does utilize his poetic styles, but overall, i can't stand reading him. but let's be honest here, he needed more than some eye-catching words to attract and keep my attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chinatown","review":"Arguably the most boring book ever written, Joyce excels here in causing premature napping in most of his readers. If he's not describing the cobblestone archways or the giant marshmallow who lives down the street, he is trying to convince us that Dublin is in Ireland. I'm not biting."},{"rating":"1","title":"No one should read Dubliners","review":"This book is so full of crap. It's awful. If you really wanna read it, set aside 15 hours of your time for each story! Criticism is non existant and high school seniors should NOT be made to read this book. Yes, I know all of the stories have some sort of \\"greater meaning\\" behind them, but it is so full of detail, every single word has an impact on the meaning of each story as a whole. I recommend that you find another book to read that you will actually enjoy, like Mercedes Lackey. Actually, Frank McCourt's Angela's Ashes is a very well-written book and very enjoyable. Much more so than Dubliners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"A number of short stories focusing on different aspects of life in the city. I can't speak as to it sociological value, but taken as literature almost all of the discrete pieces is very nicely done. The stories are very short--most under ten pages, and within the limited narrative scale Joyce provides a lot of punch to his depictions. There's never the space in any single story to manifest the same scale or psychological complexity afforded by novels--and right here is the basis of my main reluctance with short stories--but there is some very good plotting and characterization on display. Best of all, the fact that all these stories in some degree make Dublin a central character in the drama allow them to be read in aggregate effectively, showing with skill a wide variant of scholars, merchants, priests, sensualists and politicians. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Published on demand version full of typos!","review":"Dubliners is a fabulous set of short stories.

Story line was great and it contributed a lot to my learning for english class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection","review":"There is rare art that is perfect -- unintentionally and unconsciously perfect (there is no other way to do it). If you like music, think of Bach's unaccompanied cello suites or a late Mozart piano concerto -- alter a single phrase, change a line or a breath of it, and the whole is belittled, even ruined. Joyce's stories are of this kind of art. It is where, as Keats would remind us, truth and beauty are one, timeless, and sufficient. Human art can achieve no greater purity than this. I read \\"The Dead\\" every year at Christmas (well, it is a Christmas story, after all), and every year my eyes stream like Gabriel's before the softly falling snow, Michael Furey's living song, and the opening of the great mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Than Just a Smattering of Stories","review":"Joyce's only published collection of short stories feels like a whole work, instead of a smattering of pieces, the idea running throughout the collection that Dubliners (and perhaps humanity) are all looking for adventure of some kind. Whether adventure is finally settling down in life or not wanting to settle down, the adventure is that next unknown and shows itself in different forms throughout the stories.Reviewed by Jonathan Stephens"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest works of fiction","review":"In his early twenties, Joyce composed this avant-garde collection of short stories which--and this is merely a suggestion at the complexity of the work--may be considered a novel. It is comprised of 15 tales that exhibit the Joycian \\"epiphany,\\" a moment of clarity or insight for the character and reader alike. The reader, beginning with \\"The Sisters,\\" is a pre-10 year old boy walking past the window of a dying priest and by \\"The Dead,\\" the end of Dubliners, has gradually become a 45+ year old man staring out the window overlooking a snow-covered landscape contemplating the essence of his existence. This is the beginning for Joyce, who would later pen what most consider to be the greatest novel of the 20th century, Ulysses before completing his career as a writer by constructing the enigmatic tome of Finnegans Wake."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dubliners","review":"Excellent experience with this order.The book was in perfect condition and arrived far earlier than I expected.I appreciate the service and would highly recommend this seller to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"speaks to the soul","review":"James Joyce has a way of stringing words together that brings life into his characters and tells poignant stories in just a few pages. He does this throughout Dubliners and his stories are like a string of pearls bound into a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A snapshot into the lives of the people of Dublin","review":"The stories in this anthology were captivating, the language is filled with slang many of which I was not familiar with. I did notice the pattern Joyce took, he began with childhood and moved along from adolescence to adulthood, aging then death. He began most of the stories simply then they developed in complexity. Some have stuck with me while others I vaguely recall. While the stories had no real conclusions, that forced me to think and even re-read some of them in order to understand, leaving me with many questions. Most if not all of the stories were sad and depressing but allowed me to peer into a culture at a time of economic strife and how that tied in with it's strong religious persuasion. Well worth the read, especially since I received it absolutely free!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dubliners","review":"Joyce's book depicts episodes of middle-class Catholic life in Dublin at the beginning of last century; \\"Dubliners\\" was first published in 1914. The topics related in the opening stories range from the disappointments of childhood, the frustrations of adolescence and the importance of sexual awakening. Joyce was 25 when he wrote this miscellaneous collection of short stories, among which \\"The Dead\\" is probably the most famous. Considered at the time as a literary experiment, they are refreshingly original and astonishing ant the beginning of this century as they were at the beginning of last century!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetry as Prose","review":"This is a wonderful collection of stories by the unique James Joyce. This book reads like impressionism on paper, painting transcendent watercolors with language. Each story is a portrait of Dublin life, but the Dublin portrayed here could have been any city in the world, full of pain, joy, laughter, sadness, regret, and Humanity. This book is the best place to start with Joyce, because the narrative hasn't developed into the ambiguity found in later works such as Ulysses. For first-timers, Dubliners is the Joycean work that is most friendly and affecting. But it's still miles away from any other author's work (Including JOyce's own)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it for \\"The Dead\\"","review":"To me, \\"The Dead\\" is one of the best short stories I've ever read, but that is a highly subjective opinion as I connect with it at a personal level.If you're concerned about what you're getting for the price, snag it from a library first (the order of the stories is not important, so make sure you read \\"The Dead\\" if nothing else)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Vignettes Of Dublin Life and A Great way to introduce yourself to James Joyce","review":"Admittedly Joyce's better known works can seem quite daunting to the uninitiated but here in these short character sketches a reader can begin to understand what all fuss is about and enjoy some wonderfully written short stories in the bargain.The stories are consistently good and from the very first where a young boy encounters the death of someone he knows for the first time the tales and the characters are engaging.

Some of the questions are ridiculously trivial - yes, I know that's the name of the game, but we had to make so many wild guesses (all of which were wrong) that the game got to be really too frustrating. The wedge holders are nifty,and the way the wedges just slide into place is cool. The DVD questions were more exciting than the card questions, but we weren't able to answer more than half of those, although at least in that case you are given some kind of picture clue which allows you to have fun while you're guessing.Overall a big disappointment - we got rid of the game the next day!

Donnell Rubay's rewriting of Muir's story makes the story exciting and clear for young children, and the fantastic illustrations by Christopher Canyon enhance the drama. The version published in 1990 includes the original text by John Muir, which is interesting to an adult, but too hard for a child, and excellent but too few black and white illustrations. I doubt a preschooler would stay interested. The version published in 2004 includes Muir's text rewritten by Julie Dunlap and Marybeth Lorbiecki with illustrations by Bill Farnsworth. Both text and pictures are ok, but lack the drama of the wonderful 1998 Rubay/Canyon book."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOP GIFT for all young children","review":"John Muir's original account of his experience with this dog (in his Travels with Alaska, and separately published 10 or 20 years ago) simply cried out to be retold for children and illustrated in a picture book. Thankfully, Rubay and Canyon have done the two things brilliantly. Rubay's text is a gentle reduction of Muir's own words, preserving his own 19th century phrasings and terms such as chasm, crystal, crevasse, and ice bridge so that their meaning is clear. And Canyon's 25 paintings are fabulously true to life depictions of the Alaskan wilderness in snow and storm, yet each one moves the story. Like all great children's books, it's one the parent wants to read as often as the child wants it read. A book that truly deserves a place in every classroom and on every child's shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good read","review":"I enjoyed this book.

Instead of training tips, diet or even mental exercises to help the amateur prepare for extreme sports, the book only skims the surface of why extreme athletes do what they do. In trying to cover so much ground, the author fails to even inspire the reader to get outdoors and try one of these sports or to train harder for the sports they might currently be engaged in. Pass this one up and spend the money on a subscription to OUTSIDE magazine, you'll be more satisfied in the long run."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"This really works great, I installed it myself and it holds the screen door real well.

Absolutely ridiculous, so definitely buy it from here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing parts","review":"The lock would have been very nice if all the parts were in the package. It was missing the stem which is impossible to latch the door without! Wasn't worth the cost of returning so I had to go to Lowe's and purchase another.

Once the science part was just about over and the government part really started I gave up on Eater. If astronomers are really like what is described here I'm glad I went into geology. The characters seemed to take on what ever characteristic necessary for a particular scene. I never bacame familiar with the characters, it seemed that any one of them could be speaking any part of dialogue. After a while it seemed that Benford changed the plot just to keep ahead of the reader. I never knew what was going to happen, in a bad sense.

Parts were painful to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"too implausible, story ran out of steam halfway through","review":"The novel had too many implausibles for me to suspend disbelief. Examples: Astronomers do not outwit spies. Humans do not outwit 7.5 million year old entities whose brains operate a million times faster. The rest of the world doesn't sit around and let the U.S. conduct negotiations with an alien that can destroy all of humanity. And there is no \\"Hawaiian chic\\".The story was essentially over by page 190 (of 371). What you learn from the subsequent pages has no effect on the story's denouement. Fat books sell better than skinny books, I guess. If you're like me, by page 250 you'll be hoping for some friendly rutting among the astronomers to relieve the monotony, but your hopes will be in vain.For good Benford, try Cosm or Timescape.

The coincidences are so close that they cannot be accidental. \\"Eater\\" differs by making the creature hostile, but I preferred Hoyle's ending, even though (because?) it was philosophy rather than star-wars.

How could a woman take any blame and offer almost instant forgiveness in a situation like this? Joy had found her husband in bed with her sister. The sister is now pregnant with her ex-brother-in-law's child and is inviting Joy to their wedding. Joy \\"runs away\\" for a few weeks and comes back full of forgiveness, happily awaiting the birth of her niece and helping to plan her sister's wedding. Yuck! Through all of this absurdity the sister and ex-husband show no remorse. Adultery is a deal-breaker in a marriage. The husband and sister have lost the right to have any relationship with her. I won't even get into the absentee father and son that Joy meets during her \\"magical\\" experience. Joy was portrayed as a weak, needy individual. What sort of role model is that for women? Shame on you, Kristin Hannah."},{"rating":"1","title":"weird, but not memorable","review":"Okay, so this is suppose to be a modern-day fairy tale? Come on! There were a lot of blank spaces in this so called story. I too agree with the other reviewers regarding the sister's affair with the husband. I was actually incensed that there were no consequences to this extremely immature and insensitive behavior. In real life what goes around--comes around. No matter how close sisters are--how could forgiveness come so readily? The quick forgiveness and acceptance of the situation by sister #1 certainly adds to the unreal life aspect of this story. Thankfully my library had this nonsensical book and I did not have to spend any money on it.The basic story line could have been intriguing if presented in a much more believable manner w/o the \\"fairy tale\\" aspect. It was actually an insult to adult readers in my opinion. \\"True to life\\" fiction is what makes for a memorable read and this one certainly does not meet the qualification of true-to-life."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Predictable and Sappy","review":"This book is my first introduction to Ms. Hannah's writing and I'm very disappointed. The writing is hokey, sickeningly sweet and syrupy. The \\"twist\\" was minor and didn't really impress me. I bought this as a travel read for the plane and couldn't wait to get back to my home airport to get my Read and Return 50% refund.

So not the case. Her sister cheats with her husband and by the end of the book, all is well between them. The sister and her husband are having a baby and getting married and she just seems to think it is all ok. I hope with all my heart that if that really happened the lying, cheating sister and husband would get what they deserve and it would not be a happy marriage and a baby! The magic seemed to be thrown in there to help ease her pain. It was such a waste of time and a great disappointment for a holiday book. Please don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Think, Just Read","review":"I just finished reading this book, didnt take me that long. I found the story fasinating and really captured my attention and made me want to continue reading on. When I got to the second part where she finds out the truth, I went back to reread most of the conversation parts and its like all of a sudden I'm like Joy, putting the pieces together.I guess to read this book, its pretty much just an enjoyment. I mean for me, the ending was pretty much how I imagined it to be so if you do too much thinking into the logic and reality, it pretty much spoils it. So Im trying not to overthink the whole possibilities of what mightve happened there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comfort and Joy","review":"Let me start by saying that I LOVE Kristin Hannah's books. THis book is the only one I really do not connect with....it is not good at all, I am finishing it just because I bought it and want to know what all of her books are like.

Out of 8 books, this is the ONLY disappointment.The first-person writing style only highlights the main character being self-absorbed and selfish.

Best thing I can say about this book is that it was short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpredictable and odd","review":"Not only did this book confuse me but it made me feel uncomfortable.

I know this book is cheap but not worth the $7"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm confused","review":"This was the first and last Kristin Hannah book I will read. The story started out OK. I get the infidelity, I get the plane crash, I get Daniel and Bobby. What I don't get is Part 2. The author didn't explain at the end how Joy was there and wasn't there and Bobby knew who she was. I kept waiting for an explanation on that. It never came. The ending could have been so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheer coverage with the added benefit of moisturizer and spf","review":"I have a minimal make up routine but this has been a must for 3 years now. Initially I hesitated at the price, but it's worth it. It offers a sheer coverage that evens out my completion in a way that looks natural. It can also be layered for extra coverage when there's a breakout.During summer months, I use this as my primary moisturizer and in winter I apply a lightweight, oil free moisturizer (Dermalogica Active Moist) several minutes before this because it doesn't seem to have enough effectiveness for my dryish, winter skin.If you like a minimal, clean and even look - this is worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Foundation is heavy","review":"I wanted to find a high scale foundation I could use on my oily skin that had light coverage.

I have very oily skin in the summer and dry in the winter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome product","review":"I absolutely love this cream! Doesn't make my acne worse but makes my face all even because it's tinted. I have tried other tinted creams but they simply don't do the job. My friend told me about this one and I tried in Sephora and Loved it! I just keep reminding myself it's really not a makeup, its moisturizer and it has decent spf protection. But, most of all, it really makes my skin flawless (I have lots of sun damage -freckles on my face and forehead. The only downside is, it's pricey but I would rather invest in this and love it than keep buying cheaper products and keep returning them or just throwing them away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not blendable","review":"I just got this yesterday (I know I shouldn't review so soon) but I am having trouble putting it on. It doesn't really go on smoothly. It kinda just dries quickly. I use Kiehl's Blue Herbal moisturizer in the morning and even with that underneath, it wasn't going on smooth. I had a powder mineral foundation on in the store yesterday and I asked the girl to wipe off a lot of it so we could get the best shade. But I guess it wasn't all off so the Nude looked all right. But this morning with my bare skin, the Nude looked kinda too dark for me. I want to go back to the store with a clean face and try the lighter shade and see if that's better. But yes, my overall problem is the non-blendability. I hear the oil version is more \\"creamy\\" but I don't want to make my face break out. I will go back today and ask. But the coverage is really good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this product","review":"I love this tinted moisturizer by Laura Mercier. It is very light, offers some SPF protection and istill allows your skin to breath. This one is oil free and I like it 100 times more than the same product with oil. The one with oil clogged my pores the one without did not. I'm way too old for clogged pores. This one is a winner. You also don't get that annoying makeup/skin transition line at your neck with this product. The color is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"light, light coverage for day","review":"Light coverage that looks as if you're not wearing make-up.

After reading all the glorious reviews I purchased it, opened it, put it out and gagged. Smelled rotten and looked like 3 dollar coverup from the drug store.

I recommend trying it in a shop, do not buy online - you can't return it and it's a lot to pay for a major miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE LOVE LOVE!","review":"Laura Mercier has hit the ball out of the park with this product. I suffer from rosacea and this lightly tinted moisturizer tones down the redness with looking like I am wearing make up. It's creamy nature makes it easy to apply and it lasts a long time. It is also lightweight and actually feels lighter than most regular moisturizers. I prefer this oil-free product although I have used her other one which is not. This actually has better, more natural coverage than the original. This product is a staple in my medicine cabinet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seriously Oil Free!!","review":"I have oily skin and had a heck of a time trying to find a moisturizer/sunscreen that wouldn't leave my face looking like a grease pit.Luckily i found it in Laura Mercier's Tinted oil free.It works like a charm, dosen't leave me looking shiny or oily at all and protects your face from sun.Better yet it has the sheerest hint of color that will dress you up when you dont feel like putting on an entire face.And say the morning after a long night out, you can even layer it for additional coverage on the under-eye circles.Its not heavy or thick feeling on your face either.Would I recommend this to someone...a best friend or family member, maybe? Definitely.It was a life (face?) saver and I will be back for more; it is also on my \\"Top 10 products I can't SURVIVE without\\" list.Its an ace of a product and is absolutely worth every penny.Highly, HIGHLY recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Product!","review":"This stuff really works!! I'm always skeptical about trying new stuff, especially since I've never used this particular brand, but it is awesome! Great coverage, and goes on easily with an angled sponge. I'm definitely sold!

However, for a few years now, it's been getting harder to find, even online. So, when I found that it was still available here, I bought more... of course, knowing that it would probably be the last few I would buy. However, the I received looked yellow, not white, and had an odd smell to it. It also didn't lather the way it should or take off my make-up as well as it used to.

More folksy than bluesy, it's a nice listen from the very first song - Rueben and Cherise, through Palm Sunday and the title cut.

Personally I could have done without the Rhapsody in Red if one were to point out any minus with this record.

And If you don't know Terrapin Station either, you have two good albums to hunt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bonus Tracks are better than original tracks!","review":"This album has some good songs, but I was a bit disappointed at first. That is, until I ventured into the Bonus tracks which are EXCELLENT! Mighty High, Dont Let Go, The Way You do, they are all great it seems! The audio quality is terrific sounding re-mastered finely. The Gospel influence is becoming even to atheists as the swing and message are written on every human heart (by the way the Dead often via Hunter feature many biblical characters and topics).

Read the directions and it says to use the patches except on seams. Great. What are we to do then?I called the company and they said to return it because there's nothing they could do, they are out of stock or discontinued. I tried the patch. Nope, it didn't work.

For the private poet words mean something to the writer that they don't mean to the reader. Regrettably most of the exalted poets of the 20th century were private poets. With the public poet's words, what you see is what you get (i.e., the emotional contents of the words are the same for the writer as for the reader). While Keeler's poems are intensely personal, and seemingly private (e.g., he often using family member's names), the observations, anxieties and the sometimes playful, sometimes sardonic sense of humor all resonate with the reader. Keeler's work is delightfully accessible and masterful (e.g., He makes dying in a La-Z-Boy chair seem as other-worldly and significant as an astronaut being catapulted into outer-space)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keeler, trying hard","review":"Greg Keeler wants to have his poems mean something; at every turn, he's trying to define the indefinable, which is the job of every poet worth his salt. Unfortunately, too often these poems simply work by the numbers instead of shocking and surprising us with the sense of bewildering discovery that this poem holds the truth. At times, the poems are simply derivative; his poem on \\"The Guilt Bug\\" is a spiritual rip-off of Philip Larkin's paean to the inherited complexes one gets from parents, \\"This Be the Verse.\\" His memo poems are very like the poems William Carlos Williams wrote on his little prescription pads. He works in the confessional mode, but has none of the nuttiness that the confessional mode requires to be truly shocking. Overall, there are moments when I enjoyed his folksy twists away from the poetic, but nothing stuck in my head as truly marvelous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made me want to try again!","review":"This is a must read for couples who are experiencing daily frustration, ongoing bitterness, unforgiveness, distrustfulness, anger, or even hatred toward one another. I've read a lot of books on forgiveness in relationships, but this one had some unique concepts and practical principles that I had not come across. The content is helpful for the couple experiencing only small irritations or for the couple who has experienced a major crisis in their relationship. It's filled with real life stories, but not slurpy, or fairy taleish. I read it in one night! I only wish I wasn't divorced, so I could try to love, honor and forgive again in my marriage! This book will give you a Christlike approach to redeeming your relationships!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CD","review":"This is a true MCC CD, she sings with experience and wisdom of daily life events. This is my new favorite CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets Better with Each Spin","review":"This is easily MCC's best since \\"Stones in the Road.\\" While it may be true that several of the songs are introspective, her mixed feelings about time, sex, and love are beautifully expressed. This very personal CD contains a blend of styles. The standout track is \\"The Dreaming Road,\\" a wonderful ballad that tells a story in only the way Mary Chapin-Carpenter can. Much better than her last studio effort, \\"A Place in the World.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully textured adult pop","review":"Mary Chapin Carpenter's latest effort may not burn up the country charts, but it should find a niche among fans who appreciate thoughtful, insightful lyrics and richly layered musical arrangements. While the country-folk vibe of previous work is still evident, Carpenter injects her sound with some lovely \\"pop-isms\\"-- Beatlesque harmonies, strings, flutes, etc. If you're a fan of literate adult popsters (Aimee Mann, Shawn Colvin, Jon Brion) time*sex*love* is a worthy addition to your collection. (And be sure to check out the hidden track at the end of the disc!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful look at what drives us","review":"As stated in the title *Time*Sex*Love* Mary Chapin Carpenter adresses themes that we can all relate to...growing up, growing apart, unfulfilled dreams, looking back with longing, all these are a common bond. At first listen, this did not set as easily on my ear, what was it? Finally, I figuredit out. The inclusion of more electric instruments(on some tracks)lends an unfamiliar sound. Unfamiliar, but not unwelcomed. What the listener gets is 14 tracks filled with outstanding song writing and tight musical arrangements. Standout tracks \\"This is Me Leaving You\\",\\"Simple Life\\",\\"Alone, but Not Lonely\\" and \\"Late For Your Life\\". This CD does not fit into the MCC mold, there is a change in tempo and musical instrumentation. What is unchanged is the rock solid songwriting and the insight into the human condition, top notch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing Music","review":"Mary Chapin Carpenter is on the top of my list as a performer and composer, so I bought this CD with high expectations and, sadly, without previewing it first. Talk about a downer! Not an upbeat song on the CD! One or two lost love sad songs are fine, but this sounds like Mary Chapin can't climb out of the doldrums. Now I know what she's been doing since her last CD: pining away. Please cheer up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"self-pleasing self-pity","review":"the cover tells a story, the title another one. What has happened to MCC ? I really adored her in her days up to Live at Wolf Trap. Another gracious voice has sailed into self-pleasing mannerism (see Mary Black). Sorry to say that. Where are those life-enhancing songs like The Hard Way, This Shirt or Almost Home? Were it not for the lyrics... , I address myself to June Tabor, Eddi Reader or Cheryl Wheeler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glorious, Haunting, and Beautiful","review":"She delivers again! Time*Sex*Love will remind you of why you're a Carpenter fan in the first place. \\"The Dreaming Road,\\" \\"Swept Away,\\" and \\"King of Love,\\" are absolute perfection. A great album in every respect, and well worth the wait!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well below her capacity","review":"Not an awful album if you know and love MCC. But even the most defensive reviewer here can't argue this ranks with her best work. As a whole it's self-indulgent, with unfunny in-jokes (the 'mind the gap' tripe at the end) and too much repetition. There is good stuff here but if you're looking for an entree into the MCC catalog, go back to _Come On, Come On_ or _Stones in the Road_."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring.","review":"With every other MCC CD I've always come away with at least one song I couldn't get out of my head. Not this time. There's nothing here worth playing a second time. Over-produced and dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long time fan says: \\"Pass\\"","review":"There is a hidden track at the end of this CD that is just marvelous---the musicians jam with such spirit and a true love of music. Unfortunately, the rest of the CD suffers from overproduction and belabored writing. The songs are mostly forgettable--- I have a difficult time remembering even the titles to the songs once they're over. Much slower tempos than in her earlier work, too. I love her earlier work and would recommend \\"Come On, Come On\\" and \\"Stones in the Road\\" to anyone just starting to appreciate the work of Mary Chapin Carpenter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puts me to sleep","review":"Just what we don't need today is more navel gazing. We need ENTERTAINMENT. We used to get it with \\"shut up and kiss me\\" and even \\"passionate kisses\\" but there are no \\"hits\\" evident here. BTW I saw the last concert of the tour here in Columbia just a couple of weeks ago, and it was also very low energy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't listen to the PR fluff reviews!","review":"The record comapny has written some nice 5 star fluff on this site. I'm a real MCC fan, and feel that she has hit bottom after peaking with perfection on Come On Come On, which has so many classics on it. Of course she couldn't top COCO, but SITR started her downward spiral. I didn't think she could get much worse than Place in the World, but this disc has no memorable songs, nothing that begs me to learn the words. I agree with whoever said it sounds like Beach Boys, Mamas/Papas and MCC put into a blender...a bloody mess!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No hits here","review":"As others have said, there is not a \\"hook\\" song in this collection. I liked her earlier work, especially when collaborating with hit writers like Don Schlitz. If she wants to regain any market visability outside her limited fan base, she should record at least one melodic song to \\"sell\\" the record. I get the feeling that she is much more comfortable in the \\"folky\\" world than Pop/Country, and that this record may signal her gravitational return to her introspective coffeehouse roots. It's not a positive direction based on what can be heard from this disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Judy Collins with a guitar","review":"If you are looking for a CD that you can sing along to, you'l take a pass on this CD. Sounds more like California coffee house ballads than Nashvile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What she Used to Be","review":"I have utmost respect for MCC, but this album isn't the cause. Highly cerebral and no catchy melodies or lyrics. Love, life, and relationship introspection is great, but Come On, Come On, Mary, give us something we can sing to! Definitely a great disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet Reflections","review":"This is one of Mary Chapin Carpenter's best albums she's recorded yet. I look forward to her new one BETWEEN HERE AND GONE with lots of excitement. *TIME *SEX *LOVE is a great CD of reflective songs that you will more than likely enjoy. Her first new album since the lackluster 1996 album A PLACE IN THE WORLD, this is a step in the right direction. There's some really nice ballads with her warm vocals all over them. \\"Alone But Not Lonely\\" is a favorite of mine, some really nice lyrics and a nice melody. The closing \\"Late For Your Life\\" is also nice, and it has a bonus hidden track. \\"What Was It Like\\" is another great ballad, heartbreaking. There's some nice uptempo songs like \\"Slave to the Beauty\\", \\"Whenever You're Ready\\", \\"In The Name Of Love\\", \\"This Is Me Leaving You\\", etc. Other good songs include \\"King of Love\\", \\"Swept Away\\", \\"The Dreaming Road\\" and \\"Someone Else's Prayer\\". Overall a strong album from Mary Chapin Carpenter that should have a place in every CD collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice!","review":"This isn't one of MCC's BEST works, but it is still very very good. She is a master story-teller and song-crafter. Every album she has ever done shines, and this is no exception."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical Realism Never Sounded Better","review":"What an amazing song suite! Mary Chapin and her band draw the listener in to an otherworldly realm. Magical realism never sounded better. Yeats asked, \\"How can you tell the dancer from the dance?\\" The point is, when art is this good, you can't. An inspired offering. She sings, \\"Don't be late for your life.\\" Don't be late for this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't give up any Time*Sex*Love to listen to new Carpenter!","review":"A long-time fan of Mary Chapin Carpenter, I looked forward to her newest with anticipation. Unfortunately, her introspection seems to have gotten the better of her. She's always featured a number of tunes that were rather flat-- the better to sing about some complex inner issue -- but these were leavened with an equal number of songs with great hummable melodies or fetching blues riffs (When Halley Came to Jackson, I Feel Lucky, and the delightful Down at the Twist and Shout). The songs on Time*Sex*Love seem to be one long recitative -- nothing tuneful and mostly rather boring, if not downright dolorous. You'd be better off buying a couple of Margaritas for the price of this CD and writing your own song! Or better yet, buy Come On Come On, which shows what the lady can really do!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment","review":"I love Mary Chapin Carpenter -- especially the melodic tracks that she gathered together for her last album, \\"Party Doll.\\" Unfortunately, TIME SEX LOVE veers in the opposite direction. Her soulful vocalizing is missing and the lyrics are stilted rather than bittersweet and thoughtful. The up-tempo tunes have none of the raw beauty of \\"Down at the twist and shout.\\" Replay her old CDs, but save your money here. I hope she finds her way back home on the next go around."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Ghost of Tom Joad\\" wasn't \\"Nebraska, \\" either!","review":"It's not \\"Stones in the Road?\\" Who cares?! T*S*L* is loaded with gorgeous, introspective lyrics worth paying close attention to. This album delivers exactly what we've come to expect from this artist; bullet-proof integrity and thought provoking musical genius. We won't be hearing much of this on the radio...it's way too smart for the masses. Keep it that way, Mary!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive, Useful Reference","review":"When I need a quotation, or need to verify one I want to use in an article, this edition of Bartlett's Quotations is my reference of choice.

Very interesting to browse, too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Refrence but DON'T BUY IT.","review":"This very large book is 50% index and everything in it is referenced to the source, unlike competing products. But, it is such a giant waste of physical resources (trees) I can't encourage people buying it. Think about it, it's 50% index!

As other reviewers have noted, it's arranged by author. To find quotations on a particular subject -- love, wisdom, war, politics, etc. -- you have to consult the index and laboriously look up each reference, which is a royal pain. Hoyt's New Cyclopedia of Practical Quotations, among other books, is much more useful, and a much better buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Passable but certainly not the best ...","review":"This edition is a bit too trendy (and, especially, too \\"politically correct\\" in some respects) and omits many classic quotes featured in previous editions. I shall stay with my 15th edition and actually wish I had kept my 14th and 13th as well. Hopefully, the earlier variations are still available in nice condition at a reasonable price.

The material used for the research was gathered during the 1930s but not published until after the war. Written in that wonderful style that only factual books of that age have, it shows that concern about over-use of the Earths resources and particularly loss of fertile topsoil due to man's mismanagement is not something that was invented yesterday by environmentalists. The causes and effects of topsoil loss were quite well understood by the author and the material is well presented and illustrated with black and white photographs vividly demonstrating the major points of the argument.For anyone interested in the subject, this is recommended reading - if you can find a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"important book","review":"This book covers information you can find yourself through a good research on the Net, but for what it cost I would get the book and save myself hours of research.For the lazy type of person this book is a must ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Quality, good value.","review":"Nice quality doll furniture should provide years of fun.

Sure, when it's fun, creative puzzles that take a few moments. However, after a while it just ranks up there with doing your math homework and eating your broccoli. A heinous chore. Some of the puzzles in Haunted Mansion were just frusterating, and not in the fun way. More like a half hour ordeal when your not fighting any monsters, just figuring out which way to point some frigging mirrors.In the end, if you have a Game Cube or have a friend who does, rent Luigis Mansion. Same principal, but a lot more fun. The ghosts are tougher to catch, but you don't have to deal with those ridiculous little puzzles. Otherwise, leave the Ghost Busting to Bill Murray and Dan Akroyd."},{"rating":"1","title":"it sound good","review":"i dont no one thing about this game but it sound good and the name make me one to may be by it i dont play xo much but i no game i hvae a xob a game culb and a ps2 and if i puy this game i think you need to to hop you like what i have told you by by the way i have been playing game for 22 years now"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy It","review":"This one is great! 4 out of 5 stars. Camera, gameplay and graphics are really good. They seemed to have mastered camera control and the gameplay is a modified shoot-em up.

Anyone who enjoyed this series, and who can afford to buy it, should pick it up. The first three seasons are great! Then at the end of the third series, where Arsenio Hall is no longer the voice, the writing/episodes become real cheesy and uncreative; a gradual building-up of Slimer's role becomes more and more dominant in the subsequent episodes (Peter suddenly becomes fond of the little \\"spud,\\" when in the earlier episodes he hated Slimer--which set a very humorous tone).I'm probably overthinking this, but it's just my two cents.

The securities fraud and the SEC involvement were realistic and there also was a tantalizing sub-plot that ultimately revealed itself. The villains were deliciously heinous and one had a wonderfully nefarious name (Vince Sliney) that would have made Dickens proud. The \\"good guys\\" grew on me so that by the end, I really felt for them. Insights into court reporting added a nice touch.

Jimi Hendrix's death wasn't just a typical self-destructive, drug abused tragedy that one had perceived it to be. There's a lot more to that. Jimi was a good soul but terribly vulnerable and naive. Various people manipulated and exploited his goodness.It's not a great book from a literary point of view, but if you've been a Jimi Hendrix fan, you'll find it tugging at your heart-strings with a cold anger towards those that caused him so much pain. Definitely worth a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jimi Hendrix: The Man, the Magic, the Truth","review":"Ironically the word \\"truth\\" is used in the title. Having been a fan for decades and have read quite a bit of Jimi Hendrix non-fiction I found this book ridiculous. I have also been in the music business for 30 years. It sounds like the author bumped into Hendrix at a party and maybe thinks she knows enough about his inside life that she could wait until every contester is gone before deciding to write this malarkey. I could have written a better story from my research on Jimi Hendrix saying I hung out with him, her's is just inane. She takes a simple sentence and drags it out to a paragraph with flowery adjectives and adverbs probably to produce more pages as if to make this book appear to have more content. Save your time and money and read \\"Room Full Of Mirrors\\" by Charles R. Cross, informative and a more historical account that is well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hendrix fan since 1968","review":"Ms. Lawrence' book tells the story a longtime Hendrix fan has known but not known for sure until now.

The game is pretty straight forward and frankly a bit boring. Your goal is to catch ghosts and that's about it. The character is limited to jumping, shooting, and sucking up ghosts. The character movement is rather rigid. The graphic are ok. There are some nice touches like the ghosts that appear but other than that the graphics are average at best. The camera might drive you nuts (did me) as it spins everything around you instead of smoothing looking ahead of you. All in all it's really a rather boring game and so is the character.

I have 16 of his Tae Bo DVDs and have greatly enjoyed them. This Funk DVD sadly came as a very big disappointment. The set was not the format I was used to with his usual \\"crew\\", rather, it was large with many more people. Some of the crew were lacking the positive engery that is usually put forth in Tae Bo videos that keep it fresh and fun. The sound was a little poor and the funky moves were not really all that different from the usual moves. Billy was fantastic at \\"funking\\" the moves up in slow time; he really looked great and funky but when the fast time count comes, the moves are more or less the old tae bo moves. I normally am pushed physically during Billy's work outs, but I barely broke a sweat. If you have high expectations like I did, you may not enjoy this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Billy's best","review":"I have been doing Tae Bo for nine years and have a large assortment of workouts. That being said, I was extremely disappointed with this DVD. For one thing, it is fairly easy compared to other Tae Bo work outs. I didn't really feel as much of a muscle burn as I had with other work outs. Some of the newer moves are fun but overall most of the moves are just repackaged Tae Bo. Also a lot of the people in the background don't seem to care about the work out like in other DVDs. My biggest complaint, which I have noticed when I bought the Tae Bo Amped DVDs as well is that the music they have picked is super annoying.I actually wish I could return this DVD. If you are a die hard Tae Bo fan you might (emphasize might) want this, but if you are looking for good Tae Bo I would not recommend this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back!!!!!!!!","review":"I love Billy and his past Taebo workouts, but this video was ridiculous.

I've tried boot camp, Amped, with and without resistance bands and have loved them all. This DVD however is a joke.

There is a part where they play \\"horse\\" and another part where some guy in the background is pulled out to break dance while we are supposed to just keep moving.

The company was bought out by giant LEARNING CURVE who then replaced all the quality ingredients with cheaper stuff that doesn't work and added a bunch of perfume instead to mimic the herbal smell.

It's made by a California company and the ingredients are almost all natural/herbal. So I thought \\"great, this is the perfect product for me!\\" Unfortunately, as soon as I opened the jar, I was assaulted by the extremely strong fragrance. This is a product made almost entirely of herbs of one kind or another, so it would probably be very smelly on its own (in a nice way!), but Bella B thought it would be a good idea to ADD fragrance (listed in the ingredients as \\"fragrance\\" -- what does THAT mean?). It's extremely strong-smelling, and the one day I tried it I had a headache all day from the fumes. Just awful. I am so disappointed that a product made almost entirely of natural ingredients would have such a strong unnatural fragrance added.

The butter is very thick and extremely greasy. I would only put this on at night, because I didn't mind so much if my pajamas stuck to it (it is very sticky). I would never use it during the day under normal clothes for fear of staining. The butter is also really gritty and grainy. My tummy did not like it because as soon as I started to use the butter, my belly broke out with little bumps all over it. The only pros are that it is thick and it stays on your skin for a long time, but the cons out way the pros. I will not purchase this butter again.

So far, so good, but this product is extremely thick! It does smell good, so if you can handle the gooey, thickness of this, it's not a bad product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely made, light aroma, very thick","review":"This has a thick consistency, so it kind of looks like wax, but you can run your fingers over it in the container and get a thin coating on them to rub into your skin. It's slightly sticky. The aroma is light and not too strong to upset my super-sensitive morning-sickness nose. It smells a bit like honey and flowers. I will probably use a more lotion-textured product for easier, quicker, and less-sticky coverage more often (especially in the morning when I'm in a hurry to get dressed after the shower), but will still use this product occasionally or on particularly dry or itchy spots as it seems very luxurious and natural. I haven't used it long enough to determine if it will prevent stretch marks but it seems like it will keep the skin moist. It has that emollient effect so it seems to sit in a shiny, thin layer on top of the skin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I bought this as a desperate attempt to prevent further stretch marks during my second pregnancy. In addition to my stretch marks, my skin was extra dry and itchy so I was hoping this product would do the trick (as it says on the container it \\"soothes itching\\"). The \\"honey butter\\" felt more like sand paper. The consistency was petroleum jelly like but very grainy as well. For that reason, I hated applying it onto my skin. I would have at least endured through the pain of putting it on my skin if it somewhat helped my condition but it did NOTHING for me. After a week, I ended up buying the Belli brand instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"To be fair, I have to say I didn't stick with this product for the long haul. Given its thick, grainy, beeswax-like consistency, I'm not sure I could stand it. I started using this when I was 2 months pregnant and now, at 3 1/2 months, I'm already completely out. A little really doesn't go a long way in this case, though I did use the product sparingly.On a positive note, the smell is amazing. It's sweet and not overpowering. However, scent alone is not enough to draw me back in for a new canister. For now, I plan on sticking to tried and true products like plain old cocoa butter which are less expensive and easily absorb into the skin, unlike Bella B's sticky, grainy residue.

My belly is soooo itchy that I'm online right now looking for something else to buy. The tummy butter says anti-itch on it but my belly is itchy! It looks like it will moisturize your skin because it goes on thick and greasy but it doesn't even last a few hours. The smell and greasiness does not bother me - I just wanted it to work. I am 7.5 months along now and the itch has gotten progressively worse. I bought it because I am trying to use all natural products and was willing to spend more money.

I went on a search this pregnancy to find something with natural ingredients that didn't smell so bad and that wasn't a lotion and found this product.I like the smell of this one, it has a very light scent that is almost undescribable. It almost smells like a candle oil that you would burn or some kind of floral incense.The formulation is simular to a lip balm and when you put it on it has tiny little beads that exfoliate the skin (which I enjoy).I reccomend this product. It smells much better than some of the stretch creams that you typically see in drugstors.It does leave a light greasy feeling to the tummy after application, but it's nothing to worry about. Just put a tank top on and your good to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful texture","review":"While this product smells nice the texture is very grainy.

That's my only complaint, because it works well, it smells great and most importantly (to me anyway) it's paraben- and phthalate-free! <3 Out of all the brands I've used and smelled, this one is definitely my favorite as far as the scent. It's light and fresh. I would recommend this to anyone with a baby bump. They say only genetics can determine whether you get stretch marks or not, but this belly butter definitely stops the itchy uncomfortable feeling and is worth a try!"},{"rating":"1","title":"geneva02","review":"Absolute waste of money.

Stretch mark prevention? More like a drunken challenge with stretch mark to a vicious battle and losing badly. It felt greasy on my skin, my clothes got greasy and even though I washed my hands it felt like the grease would never go away. For all I know I could have been rubbing lard on my tummy. My skin felt itchy from all the stretching and adding grease to the itchy tummy just made it difficult to scratch. I've used it since I was 3 months pregnant and still came out of the pregnancy with warrior scars. I know stretch marks are genetic but I was hoping this would at least soothe the itch away. It didn't.The only thing I liked about the Bella B Tummy Honey Butter was that it smelled nice. It reminded me of Anthropologie or Urban Outfitters candles.*I'll post up my embarrassing zebra patterned tummy later on."},{"rating":"1","title":"very grainy....","review":"I purchased this product a couple of months back. I purchased 2 containers, the first one was good just like how I remembered it to be when I used it with my daughter 3 years ago. when I opened up the 2nd container a few days ago I noticed that its very grainy....seems like it was sitting for a while and is old or something. I am still using it since I already paid for it, but I am not happy with this item at this time....."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good. Unless you like sand in your moisturizer.","review":"The only thing this product has going for it is the smell. It is not offensive, smells nice, and does not trigger the morning-sickness gag-button.However, it does not work. I used it several times a day, and really layered it on...stretch marks found a home anyway.In the container the goop is solid, and becomes more vaseline-like as you apply it. Also, I was not expecting the graininess. It feels like there is sand in it. Most importantly, it does not keep the \\"moisturized\\" feeling throughout the day. It leaves a dry, shiny film. I am very disappointed, especially since this was not the cheapest product on the market.I recommend going with Lay It On Thick from B&BWorks.; And increase your water intake.Good Luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"Good product, love the smell becuase it's not very strong.

I didn't like the texture either; it's heavy and waxy and sticky and i just felt gross with it on. :-( a friend bought me some palmer's cocoal butter skin oil from the drugstore, and i like that better. i thought i'd like this more because it costs more - was just a waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little stinky, a little greasy.","review":"I'm really not terribly happy with the product. I had been using Palmer's Tummy Butter (half the price at Walmart) and decided to try this instead and have been disappointed.

I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy!","review":"I had high hopes for this butter going by reviews but I was very disappointed. The rub is oily, I felt like it never really got absobed into the skin. There is also a 'grainy' consistency to it so hours later I would my tummy still covered in 'bits' unlike exfoliation rubs where the beads usually absorb. There isn't a scent which is great if you don't want a scented item but I just felt like I was being lathered in lard!! I have since tried 'Lamaze belly rub' and definitely recommend that one a hundred times over. It leaves a soft, silky feel to your skin, has a pleasant smell and best of all - no grainy bits!! I used this butter in my 4-5th month of pregnancy. I'm now in my 7th using the lamaze rub and I'll never go back to this Bella B product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this product!","review":"I used this for my first pregnancy as directed and didn't get stretch marks even though they run in my family.

You defintely don't want to put this product on without a tank or tee to absorb the greasy \\"butter.\\" Otherwise you run the risk of ruining a shirt or sweater. It is too early to tell if this really prevents stretch marks since I am only 5 1/2 months along. But so far so good. We currently live in a very dry winter climate. While I am constantly applying lotions and creams to the rest of my body, I only need to apply the tummy honey butter once a day. I would with the above reservation recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!","review":"This stuff is so amazing I wish I could put it on my entire body, but that would start getting expensive!Absolutely a must for pregnancy!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ick","review":"After reading all the positive reviews, I was excited to use this product. I think it would be better described as a salve, it is thick and sticky, difficult to spread on, and just sits there, leaving your belly sticky, and your shirt then sticks to your belly. Its kind of really gross. I only put it on at bedtime, because it really soils your shirt, and the smell is just too strong and perfumey for this pregnant nose! Really dissapointed with this product, and will be going back to the cocoa butter which moisturizes well and doesnt leave such an oily and uncomfortable residue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greasy and Runs Out Quickly","review":"This \\"butter\\" is just like a thick vaseline and sticks to my clothes. I hate the feeling of it on my hands and would have to wash it off after applying to my stomach. I'm 6 months along, and it did keep the itch away; however, I had to wait 15 minutes in the morning for enough to absorb that I could put my clothes on and not have all of it rub off. Although the price is much less than other products I've read reviews on, I used up the whole tub (applying liberally once a day) in less than a month. I used the Burt's Bees tummy butter originally, and that was cheaper and lasted a good 2 months. I loved the feel and absorption of that product but stopped using it because it contains Willowood extract. Not sure how serious of a concern that should be, but I don't take any chances when it comes to pregnancy. I guess I'll try the Mama Mio butter next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable","review":"Considering Groom's talents as a writer, I was disappointed in this book. I got so bored with it that I practically had to make myself finish it. The campaign itself is a very interesting one, but the book does not read that way. That being said, the book does serve as a decent introduction to the Army of Tennessee and the campaign, but just is not in-depth or compelling enough for most buffs, I would think. This book is useful as a start, but if you find yourself interested in the campaign after this book, move on to Wiley Sword's The Confederacy's Last Hurrah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Cheap...","review":"Very cheap. materials are cheap and very flimsy. would not recommend it for fuel. reminds me of the giant pixy stix powder candy."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Effect @ All","review":"I have these dark undereye circles for many years.

I ended up ordering another brand of sports bra that is on its way."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Vangelis' most accessible albums","review":"Released in 1988, Direct has to be one of Vangelis' best and most accessible albums. He infuses elements of classical, rock, funk and jazz into his electronic style, squarely placing it outside of normal \\"new age\\" boundaries. On one of the best tracks, \\"The Will of the Wind\\", pan flutes are used against a slow, funk beat -- we can see that he has beaten Enigma to the punch, along with all the other abusers of the pan flute sound. Upbeat, streetwise songs like \\"Rotation's Logic\\" and \\"Ave\\" are balanced by gentle, classical-esque pieces like \\"Glorianna\\" and \\"The Oracle of Apollo\\", not to mention the ominous, portentious operatics of \\"Message\\". \\"Intergalactic Radio Station\\" serves as a terrific closer with an intergalactic DJ signing off (or on), no less!Anyone remotely curious about Vangelis -- looking beyond his movie scores -- should not miss this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vangelis Classic","review":"I've been a Vangelis fan since the early eighties and must say \\"Direct\\" is my personal favorite. This album rocks but also has some absolutely beautiful pieces as well. It's not so much ambient as it is a work of themes. If you have just found Vangelis, be sure to get this one. A true classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've bought five copies of this so far!","review":"Because I've found my self forced to give them away or just worn them out. I've played this album for friends that don't anything with a genre \\"New Age\\" in their collection, and feeling like i'd be taking somthing from them afterwords, have either kindly left it be hind or have outright given it 'directly' away. The title explains the album, no wistfull hidden meaning here. The music is present, up front and very easily listened to, over and over again. To quote the last song, Intergallactic Radio Station: Hi John! Let's break some rules! It's been a beautiful morning, man!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sorry.. But it doesn't get better than this","review":"Old Electronic, but absolutely awsome.Good Beats.Super Feelings.Great emotions.It's perfectly Ambient, but you still have to tap the floor with your feet. \\"The Will of The Wind\\" and \\"Dial Out\\" are pure masterwork, in my opinion. I don't think that any other Vangelis got better than this one, Ad I'm yet to find a better Ambient with beat album for my ears... If you do find one, let me know !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cookie-cutter, watered down Vangelis","review":"DIRECT is full of shortcatchy tunes, with plenty of pop appeal andtoe-tapping fun, and an easy-on-the-earcommercial 80's metallic rock edge.Your typical lush and romanticVangelis sound right? Of course, no!I have nothing against a composerredefining himself; on the contrary it isone of the reasons that I am constantlydrawn back to his music: who would haveexpected after Heaven and Hell he woulddo Beaubourg? Or, Invisible Connectionson the heels of Soil Festivities?Or that after Voices, wouldcome the deeply impassioned El Greco?Certainly these surprisesare what make Vangelis a force tobe reckoned with. But DIRECTblights almost everything that makes him unique.If I found myself enjoying this I would probablyhate all his other music; it would seembizarre and unappealing.Up against commercial radiomusic, it's a five-star item. For what Vangeliscan really do, it doesn't satisfy.I am very glad he never returned tothis watered down style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Songs for mankind's future are superior","review":"The titles and artwork of Direct imply a musical forecast of mankind's future. Most tracks don't convey that premise, but it's an insignificant gripe. Vamgelis performs twelve distinct, wondrous compositions. His ethereal production is sublime. Recommended for any novice listener, but fans already own this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"One flaw","review":"I have been a lover of Vangelis' music for too long to remember, have bought almost everything put out in his name and would give most of his albums five stars. I first had Direct on cassette and it is one of my favourites, probably because of personal 'hooks' attached to it at the time but also because it has a pleasing unity rather than being just a collection of linked tracks. It is also the period during which Vangelis hit all the right buttons in dveloping his style. Its one flaw for me is that dreadful voiceover on Intergalactic Radio Station, which might have been a halfway decent track otherwise. Fortunately, as the last track on the album it is easy to cut off before it gets too turgid. I don't let that get in the way of what is one of his best works though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vangelis at his best","review":"I was very young when I listened to this CD for the first time. Now, many years later, I find it a timeless experience. It just somehow fails to get old. Even though my iTunes library counts thousands of records, I keep returing to Direct from time to time. There is something from Bladerunner OST in this CD but it sounds also sounds more classical, the artist's approach is more varied, more themes are used. For its time this is a very innovative record full of original ideas and sounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book sponsored by a drug company.....","review":"This book was sponsored by a drug company promoting their Hormone Replacement Therapy agenda. Post Women's Health Initiative (WHI) findings, this book is a laughable marketing attempt to sell estrogen as the designer drug that wil keep you beautiful, feminine and young.Estrogen/ Progestin combined therapy was initially studied for its efficacy in preventing heart disease and osteoroposis, and not evaluated for its youth and beauty enhancing value.

Both \\"I'll Stay\\" and \\"Good Thoughts, Bad Thoughts\\" are each cut short by about three minutes. It's a real bummer for the serious P-funk fan... While the sound on this reissue is cleaner, the EQ seems soft and lacks the strong 'punch' of the previous issue of this title. I am unsure if this is a result of too much high end, not enough bass, or what... While the artwork is an improvement, the bonus tracks do not offer anything that was not already available on Music For My Mother.This is an awsome album - however I cannot recomend this version...

The book certainly lived up to the promise by providing numerous perspectives of the interaction between Jews and people of African descent in the Americas. Especially fascinating was when the two cultures meshed in the same people: Black Jews. Conceived as a religious take on Black Jewishness, the book wisely steers clear of the political controversies discussed in many books already to focus on the sacred rather than the profane.Sometimes the writing could be ponderous and overly academic, but by and large intriguing, informative, and worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Praise from a non-Catholic","review":"Even though I am not a Catholic, I found this book to be engrossing - to read of the struggles of Catholic sisters to find their own identity is pertinent for all women.

At the Crossroads IS accessible, well-plotted, with full-blown, believable characters. The main characters are nuns, and -- surprise -- nuns turn out to be quite interesting people complete with personal problems, on-the-job conflicts, AND libido!

Well, if that's true, Ike Reilly pulled another \\"Wilco\\" by signing with a small label and putting out one of the best CD's of this year!That's where the Wilco similarities end. While Tweedy writes beautifully painful songs about his own struggles, Reilly spins fantastic tales about the demons, hopes and secrets in all of us (or at least people we know).

His descriptions of the past are like painted murals in our imagination. The images he creates with his words take us back in time when John Lennon and Paul McCartney were teenagers, in Liverpool, England, and the world was just learning how to rock around the clock. I couldn't put this book down. Besides his great writing ability, it is very obvious that Mr. O'Donnell has done his research well. This book will NOT insult the intelligence of any Beatles' fan. It will make the reader understand a little more of the genius behind the remarkable songwriting team of Lennon and McCartney.

It is hard to write characters that make you want to punch them in the face, but with Ellis and Donnette, mission achieved. I listened to this book on a long solitary road trip, and Taylor and Aunt Della (the more sympathetic characters) were engaging, as were the villans, but this is an unlikable, unhappy story. It does haunt you, and if you're looking for a tale of white trash revenge (where trash triumphs and solid morality is swept under the rug in exchange for immaturity, paranoia, and possessiveness), you've found it. Otherwise, I'd stay away.A note about the audio book - the story is told from different perspectives, and it was wonderful to have the different actors reading the different parts. The voicing of Della and Donnette was especially strong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run from this tidal wave....","review":"Nicely written details about small town Alabama. The author's end notes say that she tried to write about the special bonds of friendship between males. Instead, she ended up overshadowing that story with the story of two vile, scheming, and manipulative small-town women doing whatever it took to get their way; the touching, developing, story of Tim and Taylor was kicked aside. The sudden and inexplicable \\"ending\\" didn't really resolve anything...I was left feeling cheated out of resolution.I've heard nice things about Ms. King's writing. This was my first exposure to her work and will try another of her books. Maybe I just started with the wrong one?"},{"rating":"1","title":"dismal","review":"I finished this at 11 pm and almost got up to write a review to warn others. Absolutely dismal. It's unfortunate, though, because this writer does seem to have talent but the characters are stagnant, the plot is drawn out far too long and the ending! I actually kept turning pages to see if where the rest of it was! It's like she ran out of enthusiasm for the story and just decided to kill off the storyline.That being said, if the author worked a storyline with more ease and CONCLUDED the story instead of abandoning it, I think there is potential - just not this book.

I was looking for a more masculine ring, and this was it. Very sharp and angular, and the symmetry of this variation on the Celtic knot gives it a story as well. All I kept thinking when I was looking at the ring the past couple of days was \\"only $20 for this?\\" It's not going to wow anyone with its brilliance or worth, but if you're a guy like me (or just a guy in general) that's not what you're looking for. Instead, the symbolism, simplicity, and sturdiness it exudes adds a little something to whatever you're trying to represent in your outer image.Great value. If it holds up for a long time though and the black paint in between the notches doesn't fade or run, it will show its true value. No signs of it yet; had it about a week and even washed it under warm water a few times. Held up. Cheers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and Strong","review":"My Husband loves this ring! I got it for him as an engagement ring and he was very happy. When we got married, I got him a more expensive ring and it wasn't 2 weeks before it almost broke his finger (working out at the gym, lifting weights) so he switched back to this (engagement) ring and he wears it 24/7 and loves it still... now he's had it for almost 6 months and it is still just like new! he usually wears a 10.5 and I ordered an 11 and it fits perfect, so it might run a little small... so keep that in mind when you place your order!

I agree with everyone else that it took much too long for the characters to get together. By the end of the book, I was so worn out from the characters, that I finished the book with much relief. I was more interested though in the secondary story with Jon and Catherine. I like my characters to have a few bumps in their relationship, but Violette and Blake had a mountain and a half. I wouldn't recommend this one so quickly. Splendor is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finer Things","review":"Unfortunately this is the worst book of Brenda Joyce's I have read.

Heads are chopped off, whacked with golf clubs, and generally treated poorly. Meanwhile we are watching a so-so story with so-so performances (other than the Baldwin brother, who is nice and creepy). There is absolutely nothing done cinematically to produce tension - all the shots are standard medium shots, the lighting is uniform throughout, and the camera seems to have been frozen in place during the entire film. Booooring.How many times must we see, as a final shot, the protagonist walking away in slow motion while all behind him is devoured by flame? One more time, at least.

It started off good and had some good familiar actors like George Wendt \\"Norm\\" from \\"Cheers\\" and Daniel Baldwin, as interesting characters along with some good newcomers. Some of the scenes were slow moving and kinda boring but overall I was getting into the movie.....until the beating and hallucination scene's. I was so disturbed by the end of that sequence that I had to turn off the movie and couldn't watch any more. Usually I'll watch anything, but those images just stay with you and won't leave.

He also has other interests namely the mysterious Gond people who may have walked the earth when the earth was one joined land mass. However this book is so much more than that. India \\\\ Africa \\\\ South America are all experienced and observed from a most interesting angle. The author roughs it al the way. There are many side-splitting moments in this book. There is youth and vivacity in the words that flow. Tahir Shah is clearly in love with life.

It was, however, very disappointing.Firstly the author fails to fulfil his own brief: there is very little on Gondwanaland and what material there is seems added as an after thought rather than being the driving purpose of the journey. Second, it is full of implausibilites and unlikely situations; the characters Shah meets on the way are so incredible as to be untrue. Third, it is terribly paced with over a third of the book dedicated to Bombay, whilst the journey from Caracas to Buenos Aires only takes up 60 pages.I could continue, point after point, with criticisms of the book - but by now you've probably worked out I wasn't very impressed with it. Originally, I was going to give the book a two-star rating but the ending changed my mind.

I could not depend on it to navigate my way through the darkness. I have consulted with the directions/diagram that were included, to no avail. There is a certain way to 'thread' the strap through the mount and around the handlebars. It's just a silly design. A well thought out light, but a poorly executed mount. Foolish me, I bought two.

The author, who also wrote The Altar of My Soul, is a knowledgeable woman with much to offer. The story line flows nicely and is well written. The only thing I felt this book was lacking was more on the Grandmother and her spiritual teachings. From the cover of the book I had assumed there would be more on the young girl learning about the spirits from her Grandmother, instead most of the book is related to the awkwardness of a young girl growing up with conservative parents and wanting to know about love and relationships.All things considered, what we do get of the spiritual is well worth reading.

Marber explains in clear and compelling language why the emergence of these new financial markets will have an inestimably large impact on our economic and political futures. The book also makes excellent use of examples that really show just how startling is the recent growth and future growth potential of these markets. At the end of reading this book, you'd have to be crazy not to want to read more about this topic, and if you are an investor, crazy not to devote some portion of your portfolio to emerging market investments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review from a third world perspective","review":"I hold a position in a bank operating in Central America.

A well researched book with great sources of information for college students and proffesionals that want to participate in these markets.

The three stories (Digital, Dark Horse, and Dracula) seemed to be mildly lacking in something I can't place my finger on. The two little mini-stories (Flowers and the Detective Parts 1 and 2) were okay, but they don't \\"flesh out the relationship between D and Orcot\\" as the preview in Book 3 proclaims.

It is slim and silver with a good adhesive. The backing of the light stays with the adhesive.

Each barely puts out enough light to make them useful in any application. I used them in a glass lined display case for some rock specimens I have and they barely illuminated an area 1' x 2' x 2' (and I used TWO of them!!). A regular D cell flashlight provides better illumination. Additionaly, the light is a harsh white as compared to the normal 'warm' light one gets from a standard incandescent bulb.

Just make sure the surface is clean, use an alcohol swab or something similar. Then I put one under the lid of my toolbox in the garage.

AAA batteries are easy to find these days, and I had plenty in stock when the time came. But the three phillips head screws that keep the light together are an odd size. None of the many phillips head screwdrivers in the house fit it, not even my computer sized ones or the ones I had to fix sunglasses (the screws are somewhere inbetween those two sizes). If I have to buy a screwdriver to change the batteries on one light, it's not worth my time.

Second, and totally unacceptable, is that the batteries (at least on the ones I have) are NOT replaceable. After unsticking the thing from wherever it is mounted (thus marring the surface and destroying the adhesive), you have to unscrew three little screws on the back and pry/push (with some difficulty) the back off.

EVER!","review":"This album contains 5 of the best 100 songs ever written. Maybe AC/DC or Motorhead might be up to the same # of great songs over their catalog, but not on one album. I must say that after Uli Roth left, however, they were foothills compared to the mountains they were before. This album is EPIC. Without Uli, they are \\"Journey-like\\" and deserve the pejorative \\"chick band.\\" With Uli, they were brave musical pioneers, exploring heights of music that few had attained; they were Hendrix-like in their glory. Without him, they are just like any other weak band, very run of the mill. Klaus is their one saving grace, and he is the main source of appeal for most people who like them, but Uli enhanced Klaus' singing and took him to Beethoven-crazy, wild peaks. I like how just 'far-out' on the edge their music is on this album--the first time I heard it, the top of my head blew off. I was stunned, amazed...I had never heard such glorious noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Take it Out of My CD Player","review":"YOW!!!!! I have to confess that I had 'Fly to the Rainbow' on 8-track ages ago... one of the first albums I bought on my own... I haven't listened to in 10 years at least so this was a real score. These \\"Bonus Tracks\\" alone would be worth the money. Plus the keen book w/ lyrics and photos and the stylin' leather cover... you just can't go wrong here. All three of these albums are some of the best music ever recorded. It's a shame the Uli and the band couldn't keep it up. I got to see Uli's band in the 80's and they only did one Scorpions song as an encore: Dark Lady, and he tore it up! He's an odd dude and a genius, check him out at his and the Scorpions' best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A practical way to view applied statistics","review":"Starting from a tested model of customer behavior, the author shows how to use several statistic methods to analize the overall satisfaction.

The last thing I want to do is really push on the skin around my eyes to remove the mascara - I don't need to stretch it out. This is ok... but not good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"Simply put, this eye makeup remover doesn't work. It takes scrubbing to even remove eyeliner, and it does NOTHING for waterproof mascara. I can soak a cotton ball and swipe my lashes, and nothing comes off at all.The only good thing I can say about this product is that it's not greasy feeling. I've used other \\"oil free\\" makeup removers, but they're still greasy. This one is not. A quick water rinse afterwards and you're fine. There's still makeup all over your eyes, but at least your skin isn't greasy.Other that the lack of grease, there is nothing good to say about this product. It's inexpensive, but it doesn't work, so it's not a good value at any price. And it stings my eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not remove waterproof mascara","review":"I bought this one hoping it will remove my waterproof mascara, but it does nothing at all. It removes eye shadow and concealer perfectly, but with the eyeliner is not as smooth. It takes some rubbing to remove eye liner and, as I said before (and stated by other reviewers) it does nothing to your waterproof mascara.Definitely, I won't buy this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"When i bought this i thought it was bigger then actually is, but its a good product.

It is definitely worth the price at any price! Mario Frangoulis' enthusiasm and his love for singing is so genuine, heartfelt, passionate and contagious, that you'll find it impossible to feel down while watching/listening to this recording. Excellent selection of songs performed in a beautiful outdoor theater. And with the English subtitles, you'll find yourself reading in one language, listening to and singing along in another language and also taking in a visual treat of Mario's onstage presence all in one effortless, natural motion. Quite a lot of fun! If there is any downside to this DVD it's that it isn't long enough -- I would have enjoyed hearing much more of the concert and seeing a lot more bonus features. Hopefully there will be more on his next video....and there will be another, I'm sure of that, given this man's tremendous talent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent voice and music","review":"Hello, I have known Mario Frangoulis for 2 years. Sometimes I dream is his first album. His second international album is also good. He made a Greek album in Greece in 2005.

In terms of REGION, amazon.com says unknown but the DVD is working in the US, so it is region 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mario Is Brilliant","review":"This is a great DVD. The setting and the musicianship is first class. Mario has a great feel for the songs and the entrance of the great Justin Hayward for Nights In White Satin gave me goosebumps from head to toe. It is not region crippled so playing it here in Australia was no problem. If you've seen other concerts recorded in Greece you know what I mean I say it is spectacular and warm at the same time. The video quality is excellent. The price is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the Best","review":"Even though this cd is four years old,I still find it very satifying to listen to the awesome voice of Mario Frangoulis.The DVD is ultra beautiful and I have several in casea friend wants to experience a thrill of seeing Mario 'Live'More CDs have been made and I love them but Sometimes I Dreamis very special.We will be hearing more of Mario in the US so please buy this one before it becomes RARE."},{"rating":"1","title":"I need your help!","review":"\\"I can't review my purchase because I haven't had receiver it yet!I've veen trying to communicate with you by visiting your page onInternet, but I couldn't reach a way.

Of the 90 some pages only 30 were devoted to the author's childhood, ghetto experience and concentration time. The rest of the book describes her emotions and that is basically it, her emotions at starting a new life in this country. She tends to repeat herself through the book and it lacks continunity. I am sure she and her husband are very wonderful people but her book is lacking and was disappointing and would have been fine as a memoir for her family and close friends. The print is poor and the photographs as a result are not clearly visible-blurry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be sure you know what DVD zone you ar buying","review":"This was most likely my own fault for not reading the fine print, but this DVD is restricted to Zone 15, which means it won't play on my DVD player here in Illinois.If anyone knows how to get around that, I'd love to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratched","review":"The movie is a classic. However the dvd was scratched and got stuck several times:(, I didn't attempt to return it, I'll just get a new one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dissipation in extremis","review":"While the sprinkling of poor performances and more than a little stereotyping of Mexico's peasantry prevent me from giving it a full five stars, UNDER THE VOLCANO deserves more than a mediocre three. Albert Finney, of course, cannot carry the movie, but that doesn't make his work any less a wonder. Huston's direction, I'm in the minority but I don't care, is a tour de force. Years and years after seeing this movie, so many scenes are etched in my memory, from the floating toy skulls in the film's opening credit, to the final crushing moments. This is not an easy movie to take--watching somebody willfully self-destruct is painful. There's a good deal of humor in between the alcoholic forays, and they ease the burden. I recommend that UNDER THE VOLCANO be given a chance, just one viewing, and then decide for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh we try so hard","review":"there is nothing in the world that can compare to the depth and complexity of the book. The movie tries hard, with all the histrionics and well meaning ambition that Huston can muster. Albert Finney as the consel is a well meaning if dated choice. The speculation as to his actual sobriety during filming is a nice ancedote, but offers little insight into the day in the life of Firmin. J. Bissette is a poor choice as Yvonne, as she has all the acting ability of a brick, and cannot even pretend to the specifics of the role. Poor at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"low budget & low interest","review":"Is this an attempt to deliberately make a bad movie, one of those \\"so bad it's good\\" movies? Who knows. It takes talent to make a bad movie well, although I'm not sure you should know you're making a \\"good-bad\\" movie at the time, it just happens. Look at Ed Wood Jr., for instance, he though he was making masterpieces, and while today they are pieces of something, they're still pretty fun in ways not intended. This, however, is just plain amateurish junk, and while I had great hope while watching the opening credits (which are quite impressive) it went downhill after the movie started. Filmed on video, often dark and murky, hard to tell what's going on and is there a plot? Hmm, hard to say there too. Some guy gets changed into a vampire and walks the streets dining on all he meets. I guess he's in search of a queen (a vampire queen, that is) and if he ever found her I don't know because I couldn't take any more after a certain point. Not worth your time or money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Malpractice and our legal system","review":"An excellent and dramatic true story of how our legal system has gone awry in the way it interacts with the medical world. The author expresses the terrible toll that malpractice suits take on the individual physician, and on our society as a whole. This is an excellent book for all to read, but especially for physicians who often must run this gauntlet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never looked at it after the first time","review":"I just returned from amsterdam and I brought some internet materials that I printed out (different articles) and two guide books, I never looked at this one while I was there. I dont think it has a lot of really useful information, there just arent a lot of details provided - it feels like it tries to cover too much.My advice would be to decide on what you are interested in doing there: walking, museums, biking... and find for a book that is more directly related to what you are looking for. I feel I wasted my money on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect guide book. I loved it.","review":"I just came back from four great days in Amsterdam. I took this book everywhere. It fit in my bag nicely and wasn't heavy. We relied on it for tourist attractions, restaurants, and the handy little map. We also had other guides with us, but this little one had everything we needed. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for travel","review":"Great book for travelling. Small in size so fits in a backpack or purse easily without much weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"POSSIBLE SPOILERSNick Stahl's girlfriend is supposedly raped (not shown). He then kills the person his girlfriend identifies as the rapist (shown only in bits and pieces as a flashback).He is sentenced to a mental institution. The rest of the film shows his interaction with the staff and fellow inmates and we learn more about Nick's issues through flashbacks of his childhood.It this movie is intended to be a realistic drama, it fails miserably. There are a few interesting moments but it feels more like a PG-13/made for television movie that attempts to show the difficulties of lasting guilt.If you're hoping for a realistic story of what life might be like in a mental institution for violent criminals (like I was) you will likely be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Love Story","review":"Great love story. Touching and heartachingly wishful but with happy ending. Go and buy it. This book is a keeper in your romance library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the books... so far","review":"This was the first book (and my favorite still) that I read written by Karen Moning and it got me addicted to her stories. The main characters in the book are so engrossing without being sappy. Their love story reminds me of Julie Garwood's Highland books (The Bride, The Wedding, The Secret, and Ransom). I read the book in one sitting without stopping and wished that it didn't have to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grimm's story","review":"This was so much better than the first in the series, \\"Beyond the Highland Mist.\\" I was so disappointed with that book but I had heard that the others were much better. Thankfully, this one was. Grimm was wonderful as the dark brooding hero and Jillian was completely lovestruck by him. I loved how she constantly felt like a tongue-tied 13 year old whenever she was near and he kept trying to make her feel like she was a huge annoyance when really he was just trying to protect her. The only thing I didn't like about the book was that Grimm gave in too quickly. I would have like to see both characters struggle just a bit more.I also loved the reunion with his family. Very readable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved Grimm's Story!!","review":"I read her first book and was hoping she would write Grimm's story and she did. again this was an incredible book. Ms. Moning is a great stroyteller. Ofcourse now I want to read her other 2 novels. I am just hoping that one of them is about Quinn. It is a sin to have such a great character and not do something with it... Ms. Moning it seems always has a character in one book that you just want to learn more about!"},{"rating":"1","title":"best of the bunch. 2 stars, how sad is that?","review":"I bought all of the books off amazon because I am a huge fan of highlander books. while this was the best of the series, it was still pretty bad. They all pretty much have the same plot. Boy loves girl, girl hates boy, finally they do it, then they are in love. The men are larger than life, the women are emotionally damaged and them men complete their lives. If you liked the outlander series then you will hate these books."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so Romance","review":"The language used in some of the conversations was far too modern. It actually made me laugh in some passages because it was so far out of place for the time. I admit, it bothered me more and more as I continued reading.The heroine was pretty one-dimensional. Her only goal was to \\"get her man\\". Geesh! Get a life! How 'bout a bit more depth to this poor woman?It was a quick read and only mediocre for a romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"I love this series although this is probably my least favorite in the series it is still one of the best romance novels I have ever read. The hero in this book is a berserker, one of the great warriors who have mystical powers in battle. He doesn't think he is loveable but one woman has loved him all her life. It takes almost the whole book for him to see he deserves to be loved."},{"rating":"1","title":"the other stories was better","review":"This one is ok, but I do like Ms.Moning's books so I tried this one also. I don't like this cover.But of course I didn't judge it by it's cover only.. I've read it and I don't know but I think I like the timetraveling themes more and it was fun to read a little and find out more about Adrienne and Hawk.If you like timetraveling try \\"Kiss of the highlander\\", but \\"beyond the highland mist\\" was also good.Among the four books this one is the third best I think..."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Tame a Highland Warrior","review":"This was a quick read. I enjoyed it very much. It is not necessary to have read the previous books in the series to understand what is going on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ms. Moning does it again","review":"I really enjoy her story telling ability/style. Her characters come alive and jump off the page and her men are ultimate \\"hunks\\" Please keep this series going so I don't have to go a Highlander hunting in Scotland."},{"rating":"2","title":"Story ldea was good, too much cheese.","review":"I love the idea of the berserker....I wish she would have taken the story a little more seriously. The romance aspect of it is a little ridiculous. I loved the fae series because it was a little more serious and when I picked it up I didn't actually know she was a romance writer. So, I thought I would give this and first highland book a try. The virginal heroines are just stupid. A little more realism please. Too perfect is boring. Mix it up. The women have no substance in any of her books. Fae series was better, but still need more work. I like a happy ending, but she is tying up the ends too quickly too neatly. Having said all that, I still gave it four stars. She is a good writer and the back ground of the berserker really intrigued me. I almost wish she wasn't a romance writer...I think her work would be so much better"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"While this tome is probably adequate for beginners, it was not the technical reference this experienced developer needed.

The smell is light, the formula is light; it was just a good option for using a dab to stay hydrated without feeling greasy.Problem is, either they changed the formula or I got a bad batch. Now, even if I apply the thinnest layer to my face, using a dot smaller than the size of a pencil eraser, I get this weird greasy feeling all over. Shortly after that is what I call \\"the water stage,\\" where as if by magic, my entire face seems to have a fine sheen of water just sitting right on top. I seriously have to go pat dry with a towel, because it looks like I've worked up a sincere sweat.

Produced during the height of the black exploitation period, these images may be hard to look at during our current P.C. times. However, as a historical artifact of seventies pop culture and sexual liberation, it's an interesting item. The complete lack of sophisticated art direction is precisely it's strength. The garish interiors and un-polished men are period perfect. This work did not share mr. mapplethorpe's ultra refined visual taste and obsessive eye for artistic details. Museums and galleries were not the intended targets......it was all about arousal.

Satoshi Tomiie is among the finest producers in House music today, and the announcement that he would release a full album generated a lot of anticipation in 1999. In the end, however, it ranks among the biggest let-downs in dance music.Why did Tomiie, a house producer, make such an undancable album. There is so little groove here. Most of the tracks are plodding.The only reason I give this disc two stars instead of one is because it contains \\"Love in Traffic\\" and \\"Up in Flames,\\" two of the hottest tracks ever produced for house. Featuring the sultry vocals of Kelli Ali, these two tracks could live on repeat.Nonetheless, they aren't enough of a reason to buy the album, when one can readily hear them at the club or in some DJ's set (John Digweed resurrected \\"Love in Traffic\\" fever by putting Satoshi's Dark Path remix on his latest LOS ANGELES retrospective).Wish it could have been better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funky stuff","review":"I love this album, and since first hearing it, have become a fan of this group. Its sort of like acid jazz, but with more electronic help and modern sound. Has a real beatnick sort of feel. Their albums do contain some odd birdwalks, but the really good parts are deeply entrancing and beautiful, and the parts that rock a little harder are difficult not to dig.

Ozzy & Drix is an example of putting too many eggs in one basket. The 3D visuals are great, but every other aspect of the game comes up short.

James Bond wouldn't be any good unless his bad guys were incredibly bad, evil and wiley! Our heroes must overcome adversity! The tougher the bad guys, the more thrilling the film is and the more it holds our attention. As any actor learns...acting is not really acting...it's reacting! Our heroes react well to the charismatic evil supplied by Bacon. For thrills, producers must add a car chase or two, crash a plane, blow up a building here and there and roll over a few cars; for which our heroes barely escape with their lives. It's what we the mundane public crave, because we're not allowed to do it in our own lives.

The kidnappers grab child, the mother secures handgun, but gives it to the kidnapper's accomplice without shooting him (a kneecap, foot, or lower groin shot would have proven a reasonable enhanced interrogation technique) or calling the police during the 30 minute interval. Mother and daughter are reunited in a dark wood, but do not try to escape. Father secures weapon from second accomplice and the cell phone with the kidnappers telephone numbers (hey call the police), but surrenders both to the second accomplice - no enhanced interrogation or calls for help - really, really stupid. In fact, so stupid I cannot stomach seeing any more of this movie. I do not recommend anyone waste their time watching this film, even for free. Deserves zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly.","review":"This is one of those movies, like 52 Pickup, that make you want to take a shower afterwards.

However, trapped kidnapping way out of its league; cmon, do you think these kidnappers would really show their appearance to the family. the fbi would have a most wanted list. Also, the kidnapping happened way too quick; they come in the house out of the blue and kidnapp the daughter. besides bacon, the acting was so ans so. overall, could of been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"make it stop please!!","review":"Starts well, then turns into a over contrived mixed up movie with unplausible situations.

I mean to say that you have the acting talents of Kevin Bacon and Charlize Theron and Dakota Fanning. You don't get much better acting than that. However, the story line was bizzare, and the ending was over the top. In the middle though, there are some great tense moments and some good acting. My big question is what the heck is Courtney Love doing in this? She's shocking. Dakota Fanning does another excellent job as the kidnapped asthmatic child of Charlize and her real life boyfriend Stewart Townsend.Good movie. You should definately see this if you enjoy a good thriller, but trust that it's not going to be the absolute best one out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"This movie is great and keeps you wondering what is going to happen next.

Based on Greg Iles's24 Hoursand directed by Luis Mandoki. Kevin Bacon's family kidnaps the daughter of the Jennings. Very bad movie of the Mexican director who'll give us, two years later, the masterpieceInnocent Voicesthough. I wonder whether Luis Mandoki could do better with the material he had to work with. We never feel that the Jennings family is really in danger and the final scene on the highway is rather ridiculous, the extras gently walking between the cars while there are a shootout and a plane/truck collision in front of them. Shame. Already forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable Kidnapping Drama...","review":"The perfect kidnapping scheme is put into action by Joe Hickey (Kevin Bacon) for the fifth time as he and his companions kidnap Abby from the Jennings family. The plan consists of kidnapping Abby from the Jennings as Joe's brother, Marvin (Pruitt Taylor Vince), watches Abby for 24 hours. During this time Joe dictates to the mother what she should be doing to get the safe return of her daughter. While all of this is going on,, the father is self-contained as he is on a business trip. However, this time something goes wrong as Abby suffers from asthma. The cast performs well in this suspenseful action film, but it does not save the film as there is not much suspense in this predictable kidnapping drama. Trapped fails to convey a message as it jumps from scene to scene which ends up hurting the overall cinematic experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"watch on cable","review":"This is still entertaining despite its predictability.

I use this to carry my uniform in to work, pants and blouse. The bag is large enough to hold my uniform without crumpling. That is about where the function ends. I would have liked to have actual handles attached to top and bottom so that when folded for carrying the handles came together. Also, it would have been nice to have a means to keep the four corners, when in folded carrying mode, together-snaps would be fine.

Also, the arms the lock the plastic lids down to the base are very brittle and snap off easily. I can't get replacement parts either as its made in Isreal.

The highest praise I can offer is if I could get CD maxi-singles of all the tunes on here on Amazon.com on anywhere else I would. Like the Global Underground CD's but perhaps better in the sense there are more mixes, and interpretations to them I have yet to purchase a bad Euphoria CD(I have 4 of the 5).

The vocals were off and the instruments were poorly put together.. The entire band is a bunch of middle-aged nerdy guys... their singer is not the kind of guy i want to see singing about having a crush on his girlfriend's mom. Anyone who goes for catchy, 'it's a small world' kind of tunes, ya know, that's fine for you, buy this stuff. But.. if ya don't go for that.. Fountains of Wayne will sicken you most intensely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unremarkable","review":"Correct me if I'm wrong but didn't nerd pop die with Weezer in the mid nineties? This is pretty light rock/pop that has plenty of your catchy hooks and verse/chorus four minute pop standards but it's all just so predictable.You can almost visualise them in the studio putting the ticks in the box. Nice guitar strumming intro - tick, nice rhyming four line verse - tick, now let's build it up for the chorus repeat four times - tick. Finish. Next song and so on.An album of quite unremarkable quality really."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome.","review":"i love this cd. fountains of wayne are more versatile than you'd imagine -- they span everything from country-like rock to punk rock to acoustic. and the lyrics are beautiful, as well. go fountains of wayne!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome Interstate Managers","review":"I hate most music, whether its old or new, rock, pop, jazz, heavy metal, or rap.

The first three songs alone are worth it.First up,\\"Mexican Wine\\" a zen like story on sorrow and life and why you should get up in the AM; second,\\"Bright Future in Sales\\",a funny and all too true look at work and drinking,and why one leads to the other;and in third,\\"Stacy's Mom\\" which speaks to every teen boys fantasy of his friend's mom. The entire CD is infused with a good natured look at people---foibles,warts,and all.Like their other albums,they look at the work world, how we make a living and what it does to us.And unlike a lot of CDs you can make out the words that are being sung;it does not come out like so much mariachi music,evertything sounding like one long incomprehensible song. Take a listen;you won't be disapppointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shades of Squeeze, Simon & Garfunkel, Cars, Ben Folds","review":"This album was a gift, and I'm new to the whole FOW vibe. Had been listening to Radiohead's \\"Hail to the Thief\\" for over a month non-stop on my 1 hr commute, but since I've put \\"Welcome Interstate Managers\\" in my car's CD player, it hasn't been ejected. Two words: great songwriting. It's lightweight (on balance not as light as \\"Stacy's Mom\\" so don't let the single throw you) but it also has the feel of a mid-period Beatles album -- produced and engineered by perfectionists but conceived by gifted musicians. \\"Fire Island\\" sounds more like Squeeze than Squeeze, \\"Hey Julie\\" is \\"Me and Julio..\\" by Simon & Garfunkel, \\"Stacy's Mom\\" could have been a Cars song, and \\"Halley's Waitress\\" belongs on the 2nd half of BF5's \\"The Unauthorized Biography Of Reinhold Messner\\". Power Pop or whatever you want to call it, there are so many little gems to discover. Very addictive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure power pop genius","review":"Creamy layered harmonies with chiming guitars, tamborines, hand-claps and inspired lyrics. Who could ask for anything more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wanna drink some Mexican wine!!","review":"Excellent new CD. These guys are geniuses with lyrics and melodies. Fountains of Wayne are one of the best bands that has slipped under the radar (along with another cool band The Muffs). Hopefully, the new CD will bring them their well-deserved exposure to the mass music-listening population."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete [garbage]","review":"This cd is the biggest piece of [garbage] in rock ,pop history since presidents of the united states of america. I would take this cd if it was given to me . I mean the first single they release is the worst song on cd ; Stacy's mom.

When I first heard the song I knew imediently that these guys had \\"ONE HIT WONDER BAND!\\" writen all over them, and since Stacy's Mom we have heard no more of this annoying pop band (thankfully), but seriously, please don't buy this cd, this band and their songs are dissposable, crappy, and above all stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds Like Weird Al","review":"After hearing Stacey's Mom and Bright Future in Sales, I rushed out to get this cd. Unfortunately, I was disgusted after hearing the rest of the tracks. This is a joke. There is no seriousness at all to this album. The songs are so corny and such jokes that they sound like Weird Al Yankovich. This is definately one of those albums with two good songs and the rest god awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"two songs","review":"I gave this two stars for two songs:stacy's mom and mexican wine. I'm not just saying that because they're the hits, they're also the only good songs on this album. I tried to listen through the whole thing but skipped every one because they all started out boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"FOW does it again!","review":"I had almost forgotten about these guys (how could I?) until I heard \\"Stacy's Mom\\" on the radio. I was worried that maybe they had entered the world of mainstream pop, but that certainly is not the case. They have remained true to form and have put out a catchy, fun, versatile album reflecting their ongoing sense of humor and quirky insights into everyday life experiences. Every song has a Fountains feel, but incorporates many styles and influences. It's a great album and I strongly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They're back!","review":"Fountains of Wayne's \\"Utopia Parkway\\" is surely one of the best CDs of the 1990s. A few months ago, a friend of a friend (don't ask!) gave me a copy of the demo for what has now been released as \\"Welcome Interstate Managers.\\" And while I liked it, it seemed a step back in quality from \\"Utopia.\\" But the finished version of the album, which I'm happy to say arrived this morning, is absolutely remarkable--at least as good as \\"Utopia,\\" maybe even better. Witty, sometimes funny, sometimes moving lyrics wedded to truly inspired melodies that you'll have trouble removing from your cranium. Folks, this one's a keeper. Now, if we can just get some songs from this on the radio, where they belong..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare, underestimated, musical artist","review":"Don't be thrown off about reviews bashing the themes in their songs. They happen to be one of the few bands that have the balls to write about something other than just modern love and relationships. For those who like listening to something different than love pop songs, Fountains of wayne is your band. All of their songs on all of their cds are cleverly written and skillfully performed. I would recommend their cd to anyone, and shame on people that think just because they don't JUST write songs about their love life it must be crap. (big pet peeve of mine) Anyway, more good bands similar to Fountains of wayne include:-Fastball-The clarks-the beatles (its true, remember \\"yellow submarine\\", not a love song people)Stacy's mom is a great song, but its not one of my favorites on this cd. I'm sure all who buy this cd will realize that all of it is great music)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever....Very Clever...","review":"What can I say?I love the music. I love the lyrics.

They are clever and write catchy songs. I enjoy the album, but as the reviewer who wrote the \\"Uneven\\" review mentioned, the CD gets a little long after the middle or so. I personally would have been happier if the cd were 12 - 14 songs omitting some of those I like less. Still, it's pretty darn good and all over the place musically, sort of a pop rock version of the Mavericks. Who says that pop music can't be good?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect pop album","review":"As standard bearers of the power pop ethic, FOW has few peers and this album showcases what is so brilliant about their work. That said, the album really comes alive when the boys steer away from the driving rock formula and settle down with something a little more subtle and poignant like Halley's Waitress. A standout in 2003!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Debt owed to the Cretones","review":"Forget homage to the Monkees or the Beatles (how pedestrian other reviewers are)! The real ancestoral hertitage of this CD and this band is the late-70s/early-80s L.A. band called The Cretones. Listen -- if you can find it -- to Mark Goldenberg's vocal and lyrics on \\"Swinging Divorcee'\\" and you'll understand where both the music and the words for \\"Stacy's Mom\\" come from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great FoW album","review":"While I wish the FoW didn't take 3-4 years between albums, I'll deal if they continue to produce such consistently great stuff. I'm bummed that they chose \\"Stacy's Mom\\" as the first single - it pales in comparison to \\"No Better Place\\" and \\"Bright Future in Sales.\\" That being said, of the 16 tracks, 5 are fantastic (including \\"Hung Up On You,\\" \\"Mexican Wine,\\" and \\"Hey Julie.\\"). They could have left off \\"Peace and Love\\" and \\"Halley's Waitress\\" and this would be a master pop work.See these guys live if you get the chance. Not many bands are this much fun to see in the flesh. Let's hope America latches on to its most long-suffering and deserving band!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We Want Hooks!","review":"Why is it that out of all the songs they play on the radio NONE have any decent hooks?The whole POINT of Top 40 radio is that it's supposed to be accessible. And yet so much of it is dreary and boring.Fountains of Wayne makes music that is ripping up the Top 40 charts in some more fortunate alternate dimension. The mainstream radio channels in that universe play songs that you actually want to sing along with in your car, and Matchbox 20 is but a dream. Fortunately the lyrics are as good as the tunes. Most deal with the day to day struggle to find love and meaning while working at a job you hate in a world that makes no sense. Sort of like Radiohead after prozac."},{"rating":"1","title":"what the hell happened to wayne?","review":"ok what i first started hearing stacy's mom and i thought \\"hey this is pretty good i'll definatly have to pick up their new disk\\".so i did.what follwed was one of the biggest let downs i've had in the my time listening to music. sure their are a few good songs like \\"hey julie\\" and \\"hackensack\\" and \\"mexican wine\\" (those three songs are what is getitng my rating) but the rest of it is crap.stacy's mom started off solid but i heard i ALL the time on the radio and then everyone started singing it.the rest is just bad.what ever happened to the good ol fountians of wayne that made such great songs as \\"leave the biker\\" \\"survival car\\" \\"sink ott he bottom\\" \\"red dragon tatto\\" and \\"denise\\". i want my old non-commercial pop fountains of wayne back..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Fountains of Wayne was one of my favorite bands throughout my early adolescence. Their first two albums soundtracked a lot of my favorite memories between the ages of 12 and 15. I hadn't heard anything about them in a while, and they disappeared to the back of my mind. When I heard they had a song on the radio again, I got excited, hoping that their album would be as good as their others. Unfortunately, it is not, although songs like \\"Stacy's Mom\\" are ridiculously catchy. The one high point of this album is \\"Hackensack,\\" which its nice to see they finally released as a studio album, but I found even that to be a letdown, as I definitely enjoyed the live version better. Still, its nice to see that FOW is still around. It just surprises me to see that this album is becoming their most successful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"If you like this kind of music then there are much better albums for you to use your money on. I don't know, but I just didn't like the feel of this cd and it's music. I honestly don't know, I didn't connect to any of their music at all. I honestly think people have overrated this album thanks to the success of the song Stacy's Mom. It was a good song, but that doesn't work as an excuse for this cd. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catchy Melodies and Great Lyrics","review":"Most people know this group for their hit song \\"Stacy's Mom\\", which is catchy, fun and a little bit silly - yet great sounding. The rest of their songs are similar. Great harmonizing, guitar, and some of the most hilarious and ingenious lyrics ever. If you listen carefully I guarantee it will bring a smile to your face to know what they're singing about.\\"Bright Future In Sales\\", \\"Halley's Waitress\\", \\"Hey Julie\\", \\"Hackensack\\", and \\"Mexican Wine\\" are all absolutely top notch.This is the best kind of pop. Almost rock, and with integrity, not bubble gum, trashy or generic.If you've heard one of their songs on the radio, and liked it, give the rest of the album a try, I guarantee it's just as good, if not better. I've listened to this album over and over and never gotten tired of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfection?","review":"in the recent history of the achievement of aural perfection on a rock record, this, ladies and gentlemen, is fountains of wayne's _car wheels on a gravel road_, a collection of tunes so clean and shiney they all simply scream \\"absolutely perfect modern pop music!\\" \\"stacy's mom\\" is wonderful, but is just the tip of the iceberg. this record's only flaw are the last four songs (tracks 13-16), which would have fit much more comfortably as b-sides for the first couple singles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Power Pop Perfection","review":"This is an absolute power pop masterpiece! I was fortunate to get to see and hear them live at the St. Louis County Air Show. If you buy any pop cds this summer, make it this one.

Pursued by Israelis, the PLO and assorted other assassins, she eventually discovers they are searching for a missing $600 million in contraband diamonds. Meanwhile, a friendly U.S. secret agent finally helps her bring the tape before a Senate hearing in Washington.

That's what I started to experience about a third of the way thru this book. The main charactors, Luke and Jessica, talk, talk, talk, deep serious conversations that go on and on, and if they are not doing that, they dissect everything-- acting, directing, etc. On and on. I started skipping pages, and when I started reading again, they would still be talking about the same thing. I started skipping more and more, and finally I just didn't care anymore. These charactors are the most self absorbed, dull people I have ever encountered. Even the grandmother who had passed away was long-winded in her letters.

Goal achieved!\\" All I have to say now that I've read the book is I will just keep looking. This book is slow and while the characters are interesting they have so little to do you quit caring about them. I think any two people in real life would have more interest to me.

Now that he is gone, Fred seems to symbolize his departure by taking all their old rock songs, and turning them into pure rap.Not to mention the ridiculous fact that there are FIVE versions of \\"My Way\\" here, while \\"Break Stuff\\" has been stripped of all its edge, and turned into a silly techno song.And on top of all this, Fred has said that due to Sept. 11, he's not going to make the new album heavy like $3.

Most of the songs lyrics are over repetative where after two minutes of the same thing again and again you're ready to never play that track again. You keep waiting for the DJ to switch it up but the switch never happens until you switch tracks. I advice DL if you want a song don't waste your cash.

They were heavy, Fred could sing, and rap, but mix it up real nice. Significant Other came out, and showed a change in the Limp, which I seen as good and bad. They were a little less hard, more pop in their sound. They were still rockin though, and great for a pit... so I liked it. Chocolate Starfish pushed the limit. Few of the songs were of great Limp like the old stuff, and this album has killed everything. Significant and Starfish each had one nothin-but-rap song on them, and that was definitely BAD ENOUGH!!! Now, Limp has released an entire album which does nothing but turn their old hits, which were great freakin' songs, into worthless vocals over RAP BEATS!!! The best part of Limp old and new had been Wes' guitar rythyms.....so much for that. This is one deadly sin Limp should never have made!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disgrace","review":"This band was never good, but they used to at least be rock. Now they have gone completely rap.

No one wants to hear 5 versions of \\"My Way\\"! Some high points on the album: \\"N2Gether Now\\" and \\"Break Stuff\\". They are pretty cool, but just download them somewhere.

That being said this remix album effectively snatched away the only thing that I liked about Limp Bizkit: The Band. The songs are watered down that have not been remixed as much as they've been castrated. When you take a song like \\"Break Stuff\\" and set it up so that it doesn't even SOUND angry anymore there's a problem.

Most of the songs lyrics are over repetative where after two minutes of the same thing again and again you're ready to never play that track again. You keep waiting for the DJ to switch it up but the switch never happens until you switch tracks. I advice DL if you want a song don't waste your cash.

Not in the way it was aiming, but in the fact that Limp Bizkit has pretty talented group of musicians (Wes is good, theres no denying) fronted by a very big dumbass. This album is not good, at all. The remixes, of songs that should have been left alone in the first place, are pure garbage. They're repetitive, weak, and very annoying. The only thing Fred Durst proved here is that he has the ability to take talented mixers and rappers and turn their efforts into crap.

Okay, nowadays they've been trying to make another comeback with some poor effort of an EP and all that greatest hits stuff. That's not gonna success...

Well, maybe, IF they have fixed the problem, but since they haven't acknowledged the problem...I'm told some of the newer ones have some internal bits made a little different and may hold the batteries tighter, so maybe they're okay...maybe.don't use this light as your only taillight--use with a back-up. the cat-eye 600 is a fine light."},{"rating":"2","title":"TL-LD1100 LED tail Light","review":"I just got mine today but not from here the price here was a little to much.I only paid 29.00 for mine and I got to try it out tonight too.All I can say is WOW Love it too.Now If I can only fine a good head light for not to much money I will be set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely amazing, again.","review":"This is another amazing product from Cateye. I also have their EL500, a blazingly bright 4-AA electronic headlight ($33). The LD1000 has an upper and a lower bank of LEDs, including side flashers. There are four modes for each bank (solid, flash, streak, random.) It's extremely bright at night - almost a nuisance, but that's OK if I'm on a bike and you're in an SUV. It's also quite bright on a cloudy day (to grab a distracted driver's attention) and I suspect pretty visible even in daylight. If you've had regular $10 headlights and tailights, you won't believe the candlepower Cateye gets with is electronic LED lights. I do a frequent night or 5 am biking in cities, and this is so worth the $25-35 price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelente luz de seguridad","review":"Excelente luminosidad, algo focalizada, pero que se supera con los 10 led que la integran, los cuales tienen un brillo impresionante muy visible a larga distancia, cumpliendo con su funcion de brindarnos seguridad.

For the price, the LD1100 has a lot of light options and works well. The two rows of LEDs can be 'programmed' separately so you can tailor it to the kind of lighting you need. Like most LEDs, not super bright in the day time but some of the flash options it has can help motorists notice you."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT LIGHT","review":"We bought this light because my dad rides at 5am, and it's still dark out.

It didn't do a very good job and wasn't terribly easy to get at that perfect angle. I've found it far easier to use a razor blade edge to scrape off coralline algae (don't care for it on my glass) than to use the scraper and my tank is 24\\" deep.There's certainly something wrong with a product if you'd rather use a straight razor blade and shove your arm into your aggressive reef tank, risking being stung by your lion or scorpionfish, or bitten by your eel, than use a scraper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Wonderful scraper and tool.

She has obviously matured both as a singer and especially as a songwriter since then; but there are really fine songs to be found here too. Recorded in the late 1980's it's no surprise that there is the typical 1980's sound on most tracks, and fans of her great albums of the 1990's may find this album somewhat over-produced.For me the standout track is the catchy \\"Vox\\"; one the songs that sound the most like later recordings.Quieter songs like \\"Out of the Shadows\\" and \\"Strangest World\\" are also among my favourites.The album documents McLachlan's great talents as a songwriter, as a singer and also as an intrumentalist - she plays a lot of beatiful acoustic guitar and piano."},{"rating":"2","title":"great find","review":"wonderful songs, beautifully sung and (happy surprise) the words to all songs are included in case your French is a little rusty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collection of Sardou's best songs","review":"If you used to listen to beautiful french songs from the late sixties, seventies and early eighties, then this CD will get you back to these wonderful times.

This is the period I used to listen to these songs from Radio Monte Carlo on the AM band while studying in high school and then college.

Beware though, this is actually a metric part, so make sure it fits the frame you're putting it in. I had to go to the scrapyard and pick up a cheap Bosch frame to put it on, because my 15\\" Rain-X frame was about a half inch too short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaking Through is a poor source book for vocalists","review":"Breaking Through is one of many books written by so called 'famous voice teachers of the stars' who don't really have any solid technique and want to make money talking about their former now famous students. This book is filled with many quotes, stories, and advice from a wide range of people, some of who are familiar, others not, which takes up most of the space in the book. There is little in the way of Ms. Bennetts special vocal technique that we wouldn't get out of any other beginning book. This book has inconsistent and incorrect information. For example the author claims that there is no such thing as voice registers and then goes on to tell you how to eliminate voice registers. There in contradictory information in many other important areas as well. I have taught voice for 10 years in all styles of singing. In my opinion this book is poorly written, self serving and not a good source for vocal technique."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and self-promoting","review":"Althought there are some good points in this book, I found it very poorly written. Her explanation of breathing is detailed, but inaccurate. However, you can gain something from the general concepts. Her chapter on \\"How to find a good teacher\\" tells you to avoid teachers with poor motivations and poor techniques, but she never \\"paints the perfect teacher\\" as she promises. I found this pattern throughout the book.I was annoyed with the chapter on Gloria's \\"famous\\" students that did not add to the purpose of the book. The book was obviously not proofread. The all too frequent missing words and misplaced grammar made for slow reading.I must mention that I liked the section with vocal exercises and the explanations, as well as some of the voice care instructions. This book was a disappointment, with a few useful highlights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money!!!","review":"I can't believe that I spent money on this book. Besides the editorial mistakes, there is so much information in this book that is not correct. I know there are a lot of philosophies concerning solid vocal technique. I am a professional singer and teacher of voice and have worked with a number of teachers, coaches, and conductors. I have studied the different approaches for breath control, vowel modification, etc. This author is rather narrow in her views and she contradicts several of her own statements. If you want to learn to sing, find a good voice teacher and avoid this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting","review":"I really like this book, it does what the author says she is intending to do, which is give ideas for her projects or your own.

The pictures help stimulate ideas and although she has a different style than I do with the other women in the book who have their own styles, you're almost sure to identify with at least one of them.

They are just as much fun now as they were then. David Cassidy has a maturity of voice that belies his young age. Most of them are soulful and sexy and would probably be hits all over again. I'm 35 and loved most of these songs as a kid and love them as much today.Just sit back and let the music take you back to that sweet place in the 70s, which in my opinion, is completely underrated in terms of its music.

Although the theme song \\"C'mon Get Happy\\" was not a hit is happily included here to set the theme as well as two of David's solo hits \\"Cherish\\" and \\"Could It Be Forever\\" which shows a little insightful research could go a long way. I personally believe Arista should have recognized David's solo potential both then AND now and put out a separate solo greatest hits for him. Curiously absent are any singles from \\"Crossword Puzzle\\" which may have spawned no hits but neither did \\"Bulletin Board\\" but the cut \\"How Long Is Too Long\\" (a great song though!) is in the mix here. The collection DOES include most of the Family's biggest hits and it DOES make for a fun listen! All the power house tunes are here so C'mon Get Happy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious Teen Pop","review":"The late 1960s and early 1970s were the golden age of teen pop and the Partridge Family were one of the prime purveyors thereof. This greatest hits album lets you relive this wonderful era with melodious songs like the singalong I Think I Love You, the catchy Doesn't Somebody Want To Be Wanted and the surprisingly mature I'll Meet You Halfway, a really soulful song. Other lovely pop ditties include It's One Of Those Nights, Cherish, Could It Be Forever and the great hit Looking Through The Eyes Of Love. I think that this album includes some of David Cassidy's solo hits because he became a star in his own right in the early 1970s and did very well, especially in the UK. The music is pure pop heaven and compares well with the clinical stuff that passes for pop and rules the airwaves nowadays.

The second was ok, but the third one was very bad. I love the hard hitting humour and the excellent mix of black comedy and extreme violence. The other robocops had too much comedy and the violence was toned down and more slapstick. Robocop had a unique view of the future where the landscapes had turned into run-down cities infested with crime. An excellent film with a great performance by Weller - Weller being his no emotioned self... in a good way! To finish with I recommend that every owns a copy of this movie because it is a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brilliant Satire","review":"To the casual filmgoer, this film may be little more that a entertaining sci-fi/action picture. But to the more perceptive cinephiles, this is a great satire. The plot revolves around Police Oficer, Murphy(Peter Weller), who on his first day in a new precinct, gives persuit to a group of criminals. Overly zealous, him and his partner follow the gang into a derelict steel-works. Murphy is brutally slain by the felons, and what is left of him is turned into Robocop; a half human, half robot, law inforcement officer. Paul Verhoeven, directing his second American film, satirizes both big business, and American industrial faliure. Big business, according to Verhoeven, creats a problem(crime, drugs), then makes a product to solve it(Robocop). In one scene, OCP unveils its new ED 209 enforcement droid, to the company's board of staff. The machine malfunctions during the trial, killing a man. This peticular scene, satirizes America's industrial faliure."},{"rating":"1","title":"robocop criterion dvd review","review":"this is a terrible transfer to dvd of a great movie, there is so much snow and digital messiness and the soundtrack is even lousy. do yourself a favor and buy the regular dvd version of robocop as it boasts an excellent picture and soundtrack. stay away from this version. it has less than 60 seconds of additional footage which by todays standards are nothing really gory. the quality of the transfer is pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robocop DVD","review":"I received a Robocop DVD case with no DVD in it.

Why reward them for treating their customers this way?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome fun!","review":"I love Robocop. I was a kid when it came out, but it is still a lot of fun to watch. Okay, so many people don't like violent movies. Well then this movie is definitely not for them. Despite its negative and sometimes overblown views of the hostility of Detroit, this movie is also a tale of the human spirit. This man, a decent and good policeman, has been put through hell, lost his family, his identity, and his independence. What I like about the movie is that he is not seeking revenge, but justice. The clever ending makes it so worthwhile. Excellent film, with the spirit of true heroism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Part of the Holy Pantheon of 80's Sci Fi","review":"This movie is one of those films that so many dismiss as part of that overtly violent stage that Hollywood flirted with throughout the 80's. Terminator (the first one), Aliens, and Predator. And of these, Robocop is close to being the most masterful. Injecting black humor about a crime ridden city run by corporations, and an automaton that finds his humanity again, Robocop is beautifully directed by the still relatively unknown Paul Verhoeven. It may have been his first real footprint onto a North American audience but it is perhaps his most complete film. The script is not particularly clever, nor does it need to be. It whisks the audience through at a deliberate pace and never lets up until the final moments of the film. It's unfortunate that the studios decided to continue the franchise with sequels as this is definately one of those ideas that is best suited as a single film. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little bit of the old utra-violence!","review":"This is an excellent film. It may seem tacky if you have not seen it. But this movie blends Sci-Fi, Action, and Satire together wonderfully.

Yeah it's a little on the expensive side for only a couple more minutes of features. But if you're a fan of this movie it's worth the money.Peter Weller makes the perfect cop turned perfect robotic cop in this science fiction thriller. The gore factor is typical of Verhoven and can detract from the film if visions of blood get you queasy easily. But if not the film has some interesting deep seeded messages brought out through the commentary. Who would know that Robocop is actually a Christ figure?

The only thing this DVD lacks is the Captions, but don't let that stop you from purchasing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The extra violence doesn't help much!","review":"First off i love Robocop. The original theatrical release is terrific. I bought this movie thinking it would be cool to have the directors cut. I now see why they cut out all the \\"excessivly violent\\" scences. They really aren't needed. This movie isn't really a \\"must have\\", maybe a must rent if you are a Robocop fan. All in all its still good, just not really worth the extra price."},{"rating":"2","title":"One more 5 Star Review! Why not?","review":"This DVD is very cool! Although I was dissapointed that the \\"Rated-X\\" violence scenes really weren't very long or super-special, this DVD is still an excellent buy. I bet if this movie was released in theatres today, all that \\"Rated X\\" footage would be in it - no problem. Compared to the violence in \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", this is nothing! The intro playing behind the menu is very cool, as are all the menu choices such as viewing the storyboards or the director's voice over. I thought the voice-over would be lame but it was very entertaining and informative! If you love Robocop - you own this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Collectible Steelbook","review":"Beware this is not the collectible steelbook edition. I had to return it. However Amazon's customer service is very courteous."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP-OFF","review":"I expected more violence for a supposed X rated film. What a rip-off. I spotted 3 brief extra bits and they are all at the beginning. Robocop is a good film but this DVD is crap. Robocop 2 is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extra violence does not make a movie better","review":"Putting back extra scenes that show more violence does not improve a movie and audiences are now voting with their feet as this directors latest films(Starship Troopers for example)have flopped.The extra and much bloodier scenes of Peter Weller's character getting his arm and legs blown off just make this film look even more cheesy and second-rate that it already was.Please note the example of the film The Sixth Sense-less is more.More suspense and story and less sadistic violence."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't waste my money....","review":"This is a good movie. But I wouldn't waste my money. MGM has this Unrated version in the ROBOCOP Trilogy that was released in 2004.

That being said;this is not a timeless classic which deserves to be a Criterion Collection Standard. This movie should only last as long as popular,topical entertainment value films inevitably do. There is nothing ground-breaking here,nothing particularly interesting cinemagraphically,just a C+ to B average piece of entertainment. When held against the stature of Verhoeven's 4th Man,(Robert Englund's favorite horror movie),and Soldier of Orange,this film even takes a HUGE step down from entertaining,to a personal embarrassment for Paul!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Alright","review":"Robocop is okay. But I don't really like it much. The setting is in Detroit. It's about a cop who is killed and then is turned into a robocop.

You might like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Criterion Collection DVD is best. Bad 1st transfer to Blu-Ray","review":"Outstanding film, sorry source material was dumped onto BluRay.

But, as was mentioned below, Amazon apparently no longer offers that case. Just a regular slip-cover cardboard sleeve and plastic case.That aside, awesome movie. Obviously. And for only $10.99, Amazon is offering the best deal that can be had.So if you're a fan of this movie and can wipe away the tears of not getting the steelbook case, you'll certainly love this set as it's probably sure to become the most complete release this flick will ever see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robo Rage","review":"Robocop was on Encore the other day and I had forgotten how AWESOME this movie is. What is better than a robot cop that just shoots everyone instead of arresting them?? Its not your typical 1980's shoot-em-up action film. I forgot how violent the movie really is. There is quite a bit of gore, so you may want to stay away if you're not into that kind of thing. The acting is so-so...as is expected with this kind of movie. But I forgot how good the special effects were for the time. Robocop looks pretty darn cool for a movie done in 1987."},{"rating":"2","title":"robocop vs ocp","review":"I liked this DVD version because it had the extra parts in it that VHS cut out like when alex murphy gets his arm blown off. it was a good movie the plot was great and smart. this wasn't a movie where they just put something together and leave you feeling sick that you bought it. the effects are good and the acting was great."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Starting to become annoyed...","review":"Now why on Earth would you buy this edition, if (like me) you were dumb enough to get the Criterion edition + the damn trilogy package?

I've heard MGM were interested in remaking \\"Robocop 2\\", but with Frank Miller's uncensored original sceenplay, and as an animated flick! Now why didn't I heard nothing new on that project?! Is it so goddamn hard to greenlight a production that will so obviously be MONEY?!!!Anyway, doesn't look like I'm stupid enough to pay this new edition too... or so I hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"a very gruesome movie!","review":"when i first saw this movie back in 1994, i did not seem to care about violent content in movies. But that was 6-7 years ago, and I haven't seen the movie since. i just rented the regular movie edition (R-rated not X-rated Director's Cut) on dvd, and I had seen the x-rated director's cut and thought it ruined such a great movie. But then I saw the R-rated version and saw still how much graphic and gruesome violence there was in this movie. I will never look at Robocop the same way. I will never buy this on DVD or VHS again. If u have a weak stomach that gets sick after watching body parts fly in the air and see a man get brutally murdered, then stay away from this gorefest. WORSE THAN THE SCREAM TRILOGY! If you want to see Robocop just rent the 3rd movie which is PG-13 and has less violence in it. Take my word for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just an ultra violent junk film.","review":"Robocop shows just why Paul Verhoven's films are doing badly these days.His penchant for eccessive violence spoils any possible story.Showgirls and Starship Troopers both flopped and Robocop gets negative comments from everyone that I have spoken to about it,a couple of dozen people all had the same opinion:- eccessively violent junk.And it is interesting to see the reaction when mentioning Paul's films,the eyes roll and the words come \\"oh,what a piece of violent junk\\" or \\"what was that supposed to be\\"?The public are rejecting your films so how about a non violent story Paul,or at least with reduced violence? It is interesting that people who make these sort of films hide behind words like 'satire' and 'art' to justify their films.The cumulative effect of sadistic and ultra-violent films and music has it's effect on our young with the youth suicide rate rising."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and nauseating","review":"Generally, a regimmicking of usually-better vigilante/cop action and sci-fi movies; nihilistic and glib comedy with a tacked-on happy ending claiming satire on capitalism (must film-makers and critics rationalise so?); gaping plot holes; generally unremarkable characters, plot and performances (the friendship between Weller and Allen being a rare exception); partially enlivened by slick direction. The appalling sequence in which a jeering gang trap and nearly-dismember Murphy is as stomach-turning and needlessly explicit as anything I've seen in any movie and several other sequences, such as Verhoeven lingeringly recording a man's melting and annihilation in toxic waste, which would be as offensive if not ludicrous, show, as in most of Verhoeven's Hollywood films, a sadistic and pornographic artistry cynically catering to the box office. Insane that this gets by with an R-rating while less offensive violence or simulated sex gets NC-17."},{"rating":"2","title":"This version is longer than the theactrical version","review":"The scenes that are longer are Mr Kenny's death, Bobby's gunshot wound to the leg, and Murphy's death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-ray worthless","review":"The BD was indistinguishable from the standard DVD. If you own a Blu-ray player, just buy the 20th Anniversary Edition, which looks just as good and actually has some features on it. This version has nothing, unless you count the addition of Cantonese subtitles. Pretty sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite a true release.","review":"This Blu-ray release of Robocop DOES NOT contain any special features, contrary to what the back cover says. It is only the movie(Uncut Version), a trailer, and subtitles. I had expected at the very least the same special features and documentary that are on my friends DVD release.I do not own the DVD release of Robocop, so I cannot compare the picture and transfer quality of the Blu-ray and DVD. However after reading about the many different DVD releases of Robocop, the special features alone make the Blu-ray release seem to worth about $5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steelbook","review":"So, does this release come in a steelbook. I heard from some people saying that they got a regular package. Can anyone clarify?"},{"rating":"2","title":"'The resurrection of Robocop'","review":"I bought this DVD at least a year ago from an internet importer. Living in the UK I found that this title along with many of my other choice movies is sadly abscent from UK retailers shelves.I was pleased to see that Robocop had been given the Criterion Collection treatment . The disc itself has a few extras including the obligatory trailers, but where I was disapointed was with the lack of deleted scenes, although it is a bonus to see the film in it's full 'Un- Rated' form with stomach churning heightened violence, the context of which is reassured by the directors commentary (which is probably the best part of this disc). The presentation is good with logical and informative menu screens. My only big complaint with the package is the lack of an anamorphic transfer which leaves the picture looking grainy in places, also the price of the bundle is a little inflated. That said this is becoming something of a collectors item so it is definitely worth getting hold of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biting sci-fi satire","review":"I see RoboCop as one of the truly great sci-fi films--a mix of cool technology, a dystopian future, a basic hero myth, and a thought-provoking commentary. Some people see The Terminator and RoboCop as two sides of the same coin; I'd say RoboCop is the mechanical monster movie with more of a satirical bent--and that's all to the credit of the smart script. Buried beneath Verhoeven's more-is-more filmmaking philosophy are simultaneous man vs. self and man vs. machine battles--but beneath THAT is a scathing social commentary on a future filled with media overexposure and consumerist overload. What a shame the limp sequels ditched the very premise (Man or machine? Human or product? If you take a brain out of the person, can you take the person out of the brain? Or, uh, something like that) that make RoboCop such a genre standout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Transfer","review":"Washed out colors and an overall softness of the image had me scratching my head.

Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon no longer sells the STEELBOOK version?","review":"One of the major selling points for me in buying this from Amazon was that it was on sale for $8.99 and I believed that Robocop 20th Anniversary was only available in a Steelbook case!

It is, in fact, a plunge drill guide for rotary tools, which is intended for use on flat surfaces, not corners. The Milescraft tool for working in corners is actually the 1002 model.

No stars!","review":"Don't let the big names fool you. This is a dud. The great actors had no direction whatsover. There was lots of innuendo and build-up but no climax! The whole thing smacks of a highschool film art project. The director must have made this with his pocket money. The only good thing about this flick is that it eventually does end and go back to the video store, where it should rot on the shelf. I am more forgiving than the average film viewer, I mean I really want to be entertained. I'm not one of those jaded film snobs. But take my warning: The actors shouldn't have accepted this script (bad script, canned lined, very unbelievable)the characters shouldn't have gone into the ghost town (they were warned too, just like I'm warning you) and you shouldn't buy or rent this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"Looking back I can't believe I spent all that time watching the movie to see one crappy ending.

Or so I thought. Later when I watched the tape, I found I hadn't taped the end of it -it stopped where the car turned over while they were leaving town. Well, I've waited for 4 years to see the end of it, so today I watched it all the way through. And I don't know much more now than when I missed the end! I agree with previous reviews - bad plot!

It had potential, but never lived up to it. sigh...."},{"rating":"1","title":"What with the ending.","review":"I actually was getting excited for the ending to see what they actually faced but they never show or tell you what happen.

Watching the last part of this movie is like reading every other page in a novel and then wondering why the story seems devoid of relevant details.While the movie has promise and the suspense is entertaining for awhile, the abrupt ending and nonsensical plot developments (if it can be called \\"plot\\") seem to bank on the notion that the viewer's imagination and confusion is all that this movie needs to build a conclusion. Unfortunately this bank is empty. There is no pay off to any time or thought invested in trying to figure out what you've seen.

I think it's one of Fred's all-time best numbers; very inventive and always great to watch.There are also a few good dance scenes with Fred and Ginger Rogers. Some of the songs from this film became \\"standards,\\" such as \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\" and \\"Pick Yourself Up.\\"Those are the highlights of the movie. The script is corny with the typical marriages made out of \\"spite\\" angle, which seemed to be popular in this era.....but when Fred And Ginger dance, who cares about the story?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Swing Time","review":"George Stevens's classic Astaire-Rogers entry too often takes a back seat to the prior year's \\"Top Hat\\", and shouldn't, as it's every bit as good. The dancing sequences are unmatched in the series, particularly the \\"Bojangles of Harlem\\" number, and the gossamer Kern-Fields score includes the immortal \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\", and the overlooked \\"Never Gonna Dance\\", among others. Victor Moore provides appealing comic relief, along with \\"Top Hat\\" veterans Eric Blore and Helen Broderick. One of the screen's tip-top musicals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moronic","review":"I'm watching the film right now, and it is perhaps the most moronic and stupidly annoying film I've ever seen.

I know every line & every note, and I never stop being amused. But my DVDs of both Swing Time and Top Hat have one glaring, inexplicable, inexcusable production flaw: the sound levels are way off. Most of the dialogue is too low; most of the musical numbers blare. Both are out of range. So talk-talk-talk then--Boom!--deafening music. I should have returned both DVDs as defective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Dancing, Slow Plot","review":"This film has wonderful comedic players in it, but the script isn't very good. The result is--dare I say it--a movie that's not very amusing and a bit boring. The dancing and musical numbers, however, make up for the plot's shortcomings. For me, the highlight is at the beginning of the film, with the number \\"Pick Yourself Up\\". Astaire's minstrel number, in which he dances with shadows, is technically interesting, but didn't add to my appreciation of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE RESOURCE!!

The detailed exposition of the ravages of alcohol abuse is disgustingly tedious, and hints of the author's supposed familiarity with the stable of excellent pre-revolution Russian writers is as unconvincing as his apparent attribution of his alcoholic behavior to the social structure. In short, the editorial praise dredged up to sell this thing vastly overstates its merits, despite a few mildly interesting flights of hallucigenic fancy. Since the author died at age 55, he may have accurately portrayed his own struggle with depraved alcoholism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Railway to Heaven","review":"If dialectical materialism were turned on its head, something like angels would probably fall out. If you got drunk enough to cross Moscow a thousand times without seeing the Kremlin, something like freedom would happen, despite the State.

Next we tried the DVD \\"Your First Guitar Lesson\\" and it allowed him to experience the sensation of making music immediately.

I ended up selling back the other two and keeping this one on hand. Dan keeps things light and interesting. His voice didn't grate on my nerves either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe everything you read","review":"I too bought this DVD because of the other reviews saying it was slow and easy to follow. That is definitely not true. By 5 minutes into the DVD, Dan has taught you 3 chords and is already teaching you to play 2 songs. Instead of slowing down and breaking things down, he basically says \\"Turn off this DVD and go practice. When you're ready turn the DVD back on and continue.\\" As a beginner, I still have too many questions and have almost given up trying to learn the guitar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and boring","review":"I bought this for my middle school aged daughter who was just learning guitar. We sat down for the first lesson and she was bored to death. The author went into excruciating detail about the parts of the guitar, strings, how to change strings, etc. The presentation was slow and monotonous. We had to quit less than half way through the lesson, and she never actually got to the point of playing anything. This DVD had been the but of family jokes about boring presentations ever since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy Industrial Rock!","review":"If you are a fan of Trent Reznor, Marilyn Manson, Hate Department and Orgy then check out sweatysuedelips. This CD rocks with post-industrial grooves. My favorite track is the Kate Bush cover \\"Running Up That Hill\\" - could be a bigger hit then Orgy's New Order cover!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great intro to new technique/style","review":"This book is really great if you're curious about linear and new orleans style funk, and want to find out what it's all about. The exercises and techniques at the start of the book wont overload you so that you lose your interest, but they get progressively harder to ease you in.Great for building up independance and thinking a bit differently about how you look at the kit, and even better for leading up to David's other book, Code of Funk, which puts the exercises into song context. There's loads of groove exercises and random ideas for you to build on and David explains all his concepts really well.I'd say its best if you're already an intermediate drummer before getting this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collection...But You Have To Buy The Other 2 Volumes!","review":"There are some nice songs: \\"Read 'Em And Weep\\", \\"Ships\\", \\"I Made It Through The Rain\\", and \\"The Old Songs\\". The new song \\"Dirt Cheap\\" is good and listenable.However, you just can't buy this volume: You MUST buy volumes 1 & 2 to get the remaining hits. The packaging should have been better: no liner notes nor photos.\\"Ultimate Manilow\\" is better because it has more songs. It will save you from buying the other 2 volumes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barry Wins You Over!","review":"If ever you are in low spirits, Barry's Greatest Hits V.2 will go through your soul, move you, and lift you up and out. Classic Manilow singing some of his best hits. Sounds great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Track title discrepancy","review":"Although the review inlcuded here is for the correct album, the track listing included here IS NOT the corresponding track listing for the original \\"Greatest Hits Vol 2\\" release that the review and album cover posted here are referring to. It's for the alternate compilation released several years later."},{"rating":"2","title":"This mat is great!","review":"I bought this mat so that I do more with my scrapbooking and it sure is great!! It really is self-healing. I've used it several times and it still looks like new! Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bosnian Adventure","review":"The plot follows Phoenix Force to Bosnia where they take on a terrorist group led by a deranged individual whose entire family has been executed by the Bosian government. While two of the Phoenix team are captured Able team is pursuing the case from another angle, going after a biological lab run by an ex Soviet biochemist who has sold her wares to the highest biddsr, in this case a Muslim terrorist who is fronting the terrorists in Bosnia. Their goal is to release the biochemical weapon on the west. The story contains the usual track em down shoot em up and what is unusual is that all of this is accomplished withouth the help of The Executioner. A good, fast read typical of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"I downloaded this book onto my kindle dx and the music is easy to read on it and the fingerings are also easy to read but if you do not know what the keys are called then that can be difficult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small on my kindle","review":"I really like teaching from this book--it is a great method. I have a standard 6\\" kindle that I bought the kindle version for, hoping it would be helpful in lessons for a student that forgot their physical book, or new students that haven't ordered a book yet. However I cannot read the music on my kindle. I expected that increasing the text size would make the exercises readable from the distance of a music stand, but it only increases the actual text of the book--not the music portions. Sadly, I won't be able to use it like I was hoping to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had seen the real title","review":"The title provided by Amazon did not distinguish that it was Book Two. I did not want the second book, but rather the first. It was misleading, and I didn't get the book I wanted. I'll drive to the music store next time, to make sure I get the one I want."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality/tiny/ridiculously priced","review":"NOTE THE TITLE SAYS FOR LARGE DOGS! See my uploaded picture, a spoon is bigger than this! What a rip off!!I thought it was a cute idea beings I myself love designer purses. I was ok with price initially because it was cute and unique but when I received it it was SO tiny and cheaply made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than 'What to Expect When You're Expecting","review":"'Nine Magical Months' is a great educational video for moms-to-be. This DVD follows four expecting mothers through the different trimesters of their pregnancy, including a final part in the delivery room to witness a real birth. It contains helpful information such as do's and don'ts relating to exercise and eating as well as a checklist of what to pack for that big trip to the hospital when the time comes to deliver. The DVD does a nice job of presenting options for women who might choose non-traditional pregnancies as well. This would be a great idea for a baby shower gift and is a must-have for any expecting mom's library."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],M={key:0},H={key:1};function N(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",H,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,O)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(B,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-fb504fbc"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/57.md","filePath":"people/57.md"}'),L={name:"people/57.md"},G=Object.assign(L,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{R as __pageData,G as default};
