Stan Lynde, creator of Latigo and Rick O'Shay hits literary stride with \\"The Bodacious Kid\\". Actually, this is his seventh novel and continues a tradition of excellence.The year is 1882, and Merlin rides into Progess County Montana looking for a job as a cowhand. He is arrested for being a horse thief and pleads innocence. Sheriff Wilkes gives him two weeks to bring in the real criminal. Lynde adds in four characters, two sheriffs, an outlaw chief, and a pretty woman that turn this book into an amazing read. With decades of experience in snappy dialogue, Lynde creates a novel I was compelled to read.Like the Latigo Kid and Rick O'Shay, I can imagine the graphic novel/illustrated strip this could be.This is another feather in the cap, another notch in his gun, and another book for the Stan Lynde collection. Awesome fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Pictures; Very Little Said","review":"I don't think you could really call this a book--it's more like a scrapbook or photo album. I learned perhaps 2 things about AJ that I hadn't heard before. It is definitely NOT the tell-all book it has been hyped to be--which is probably a good thing. The pictures are great--obviously mostly from her personal collection, as there are pics of Backstreet Boys sleeping, and at family celebrations.

The game looks less realistic than the 1998 and 1999 versions on the old Playstation 1, and the announcers, formerly witty, are overbearing and just plain snarky in this version.

Hitz 2002 is only playable in 3 on 3 and 4 on 4, and the rink is quite small. This game reminds you of Wayne Gretzky for N64, also there are many more features with NHL 2002 such as career mode.

SEGA's NHL 2K2 for Dreamcast easily bested EA's NHL 2002 in terms of gameplay. EA's game is not as fluid or intense as SEGA's effort, and I would go with a wait-and-see attitude unless you are dieing for an XBOX hockey title today.

I ended up reading it in about a day and a half.

A most read for all Canadians but especially those who believe themselves liberal nonracist progressives. You might be surprized at Kwamdela's teaching.

As an African studies major, I was drawn to it by the reviews, and I quickly grasped the significance. The book strikes me in similar ways to Tayeb Salih's \\"Season of Migration to the North\\", with a frame-tale narrative that breaks the boundaries of the tale told by a rural village doctor who seeks to escape the banality of his existence. Swapping one fate for anothe, he winds up in Toronto--only to find the very problems he thought he left behind to become engendered in a newer, more subaltern way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Racism in Canada?

My feelings were aroused by a protagonist who feels literally \\"worlds apart\\" from the land he lives in. Kwamdela, quite frankly, is my role model, for his presence in Canada echoes the struggles felt by so many in the African diaspora. This book became a controversial topic in my country, Botswana, when it was temporarily banned from the curriculum for its alleged sexually-arousing references. So obviously it became a popular title!!! Of course, it found its way into my university's book group, and all of us decided it was a fine title for young and old alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"The keyboard looks and works great.

Her outlook on these holy characters from the Bible gave me a totally new insight into their world. I was also glad that she spun a good bit of the story around Joseph. Typically, he is usually given a small part in religious stories, so it was refreshing to read her point of view into this biblical character. The story was a bit short but overall I enjoyed it very much and would gladly recommend it to all my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely holiday tale!","review":"This book really got me into the holiday spirit. It's a beautifully told tale of Mary and Joseph, and once you start reading it's hard to put down.

However, it is my impression that the author describes the characters as shallow teenagers, with concerns belonging more to an American 21st century, than actual Nazareth in the year 4BC. She fails to inlcude in her story the dedication to prayer these two people probably shared, after all they were the chosen ones to raise God's only Son. The connection with God is hardly mentioned. Mary and Joseph spend a lot of time praying, in direct contact with God, Even at the birth, they were in the presence of the Lord, can you imagine the extasis of one 's soul in such presence! Mary and Joseph were spiritually evolved compared to the rest of humanity, not only they come off as merely man and woman in this story, but really shallow and silly at it.Needles to say I was very dissapointed...Sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Handmaid and the Carpenter","review":"A new take on Mary and Joseph.

Yes, good love story, if you're writing about someone else beside true historical persons. The only way I could get through the book was to change the names as I read. Ms. Berg made Joseph seem like a shallow person with little faith, who believed that his wife was a \\"loose woman\\". She made Mary seem childish and headstrong and whiny. Neither one of them were very sympathetic characters. It is always tricky when you are attempting to use real people who have a very important place in our religious history and beliefs, especially our devotion to Mary. If Ms. Berg wanted to wite an inspiring Christmas story, she could have done so without lamely using beloved religious persons. This is definitely NOT a book I am going to keep in my personal library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in One of My Favorite Authors","review":"When I saw a new Elizabeth Berg novel at my local library, I eagerly snapped it up, since I have enjoyed everything of hers that I have ever read. This time, however, I was greatly disappointed.The story here seemed contrived - forced, somehow. Perhaps this was because I knew the \\"real\\" story. Joseph and Mary were presented here as love-struck teenagers, which was sweet. I thought - hoped - that this book would maintain that sweetness throughout. It did not. Joseph \\"evolved\\" into a more domineering man, which was especially interesting in light of his own feeling of being cuckolded. The fact that he never fully believed Mary, nor did he hand himself over to faith, somehow undercut what could have been a beautiful tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"had potential","review":"I saw this book at the library and thought \\"hmmmm...interesting!\\" I was disappointed. I thought it had a lot of promise. I still think it could have been a great book but it definitely wasn't.

I guess my feelings on this book are summed up best this way: this book did not need to be written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas Love Story","review":"This is a good retelling of the nativity Christmas story.

Prepare yourself for reading every single review, trying to find those degrees, because there is no comprehensive index or cross-reference. None.For a book that lists so many schools (and there are a lot) and which must have taken a considerable amount of work to compile, this oversight is incomprehensible and crippling to someone trying to find a specific degree.

Although I prefer their modern setting films (Crime Busters, Go For It, Odds and Evens), this film has a more restrained sort of slapstick that non-fans will find easier to appreciate. The setting of this original is more interesting than it's sequel, but both films together form a natural pair, and are filled with hilarious send-ups of the western genre, lots of subtle touches, and the creation of an enduring comedy duo in Spencer and Hill that made them international stars! Fans should also check out \\"My Name Is Nobody.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Video, Bad Disk","review":"This is a wonderfully funny and enjoyable movie marred by a completely horrible release.

There should be a no star option for the rating of DVDs. This would definitely get it.I have this and Trinity Is Still My Name and its quality is the same. One of them has a cute quiz game on it maybe even both but I can't bear to watch them after just one viewing.What is worse is that there is no real alternative; this was not available in region 4 or 2 when I bought it.

The production, individual contributions, and gorgeous material are simply sublime.. Word is that the tracks were laid down in front of a live audience right after Set. 11th in NYC; the music is at turns gentle, sensual, earthy, and never less than honest and captivating.Releases such as this should should not go unnoticed, and I do hope that Ms. Baca receives the appropriate accolades that such a beautiful work of artistry deserves...Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Susana's new dimension","review":"I heard almost all these songs live in Peru before they were released.

I can't listen to most of the music I loved when I was a kid. It just doesn't hold up for me. But this album is different. It's been decades and I don't tire of it.Listen to just about any thoughtful singer/songwriter today and you can hear the influence of this album. It was groundbreaking.

But this one truly is a keeper in every sense of the word.Please bear in mind I cannot stand 'folk' music for very long. I don't care how talented a singer/songwriter is; the more limited the medium, the less attention they will be garnered in the long run. Since the release of \\"Blue\\", the 'girl w/guitar' has been done to death. So do yourselves a favour and buy this just to see how it's done.\\"A Case Of You\\", \\"Carey\\", \\"All I Want\\", \\"My Old Man\\" don't lend themselves to headbanging, but their simplicity and serenity lack peers. Whether it's lyrics or delivery, they are classics of the genre, and should not be casually ignored.Later Joni albums such as \\"Hejira\\", \\"Hissing of Summer Lawns\\", and \\"Court and Spark\\" are at times, equally good, but none had the cohesiveness of this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Songs are like tattoos","review":"Like another reviewer, I too was exposed to Mitchell through a VH-1 program.

It's something I would look forward to throughout the day, and I cannot think of a better album to go with such a special time in my life.Each song is a distillation of hard-won experience, and it amazes me that some years of living plus hours of writing plus weeks if not months of recording can equal something that still stands after all those hours are gone.Do yourself a favor, listen to this album.

Her voice is murmurous and so smooth. I think she has the best voice of any of them. And the songs are pretty good too, most of them simple arrangements of acoustic guitar and voice, occassionally augmented by the mid-song arrival of James Taylor (\\"Case of You\\") or Steven Stills (\\"California\\") on backing guitar, which fills up the space nicely. A few songs are on piano. Despite the some of the lyrics, it is an upbeat album in the end, written during Joni's prolific phase during the early 70s before she had wavered into jazz and before she'd quite ceased being official groupie of Crosby Stills Nash and Young. Anyway, Joni sings like no other on this album. I love \\"Case of You\\" and \\"River\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue--A Timeless Classic","review":"The first time I heard Joni Mitchell was at a concert in Louisiana.

Not empowered in the \\"feminist\\" sense of the word, but in touch with your power as a woman in a man's world, and feeling okay where you are at the moment. I don't know what it is about the powerful, mellow tones that Mitchell evokes, but it grounds me like nothing else. This is an old album, and a cherished one. I just bought the CD because I sold my well beloved casette and wanted a more updated format so that I wouldn't have to flip it over to hear all the songs. What an enchanting moment in time it is to push the \\"play\\" button and feel joined by a kindred spirit, a little less alone in the world, and a lot more at peace with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Changing","review":"This is the only album I have ever owned on vinyl, cassette and cd.

Sure there are sidemen, but pure Joni Mitchel, the soul of the young woman, her strained, almost oriental, guitar plucking, pour through the speakers. This album is spun of tears and laughter. \\"My Old Man\\" reveals an ironic portrait with full brush stokes of love, hurt, and honesty like you can only hear in a few rare gems like John Stewart's \\"Cheyenne\\" and Randy Newman's \\"Marie.\\" \\"California\\" is a good candidate for a trilogy set with John Mayall's \\"Walkin' Down Sunset\\" and a song he too calls \\"California.\\" The lyrics and delivery of the title song could serve to define the word 'blue' as well as anything you will find in any dictionary, or on Beale Street or in the French Quarter, for that matter. There's not a song here that is less than captivating, less than everything a song should be. The Stones were wrong. Once in a while it's the singer AND the song."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Case of You - Krall Cover Joni","review":"Always one of my favorite albums, last night I had the pleasure of seeing Joni's compatriot, Diane Krall in concert here in Santiago.

Mitchell's songwriting is sharp, her vocals crystalline and incredibly emotional, and yes, she even wrings smiles out of us (My Old Man, California) while simultaneously devastating us (River, the title track).Musically sparse, finely wrought...I feel it's her finest work.PS> And not to anger any of the Joni fans who like her jazzier stuff, but I just can't relate to her when she gets jazzy. She's an artist, and it's her right, but I don't have to like it. You'll say I miss the point, and that may be so. However, you also miss the point by not accepting her earlier work for the strengths it has. And that's as diplomatic as I can put it."},{"rating":"2","title":"no one can touch her","review":"it's incredible to know that this album was released over thirty years ago. joni mitchell has never stopped creating exciting music--thrilling her fans for many years. though blue is not my favorite joni mitchell, it possibly is the purest of all of her work. i remember her saying that she felt something like cellophane at the time of its creation...that anyone could see right through her in the emotionally-heightened period during which this music was created. it's incredibly beautiful music. it's incredibly honestly written. it's brilliantly executed music. no one can touch her as a vital creative artist. if anyone wants to experience joni to find out what all the raving is about, this is possibly the best place to begin.... but it's only a beginning. all of her work is worth pursuing....worth being absorbed and digested. as i have said...three times...no one can touch her. no one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album ever?","review":"And when I say best album ever, I don't just mean best album ever by Joni - I mean best album ever of all time!

Very few singers today can begin to approach the artistry of a woman whose career has spanned decades and to whom countless artists give an admiring nod as having been a profound influence on their own music.This is as good as it gets. I felt that way 30 years ago and I still feel that way today. If I had only one CD to take with me to a deserted island, this would be it.In my opinion, the only younger artist out there today that has her kind of writing and singing chops is John Mayer. He gives me hope that the timeless music of artists like Joni and The Beatles (to name only two of many) will continue to be made, however grim the music business might look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Older Record with Fresh as Ever Message","review":"Joni Mitchell is amazing.Being a 16-year old girl swamped by emotionless top-40 music and the pressure to be like the \\"role models\\" that sing it, Joni proves to be a refreshing escape TO reality. Listening to Blue for the first time through completely, I was awestruck by her ability to twist generally quiet instruments and concepts into such complex music with loud presence. I shivered with her lonely, aching piano on soulful \\"Blue\\", I danced to the upbeat and springy \\"Carey\\" \\"California\\" and \\"All I Want\\", I cried with her desperate wails on \\"River\\"--and so much more.The lyrics alone paint watercolors in the mind of the listener, the melodies draw them in. Joni Mitchell created a masterpiece of beautiful, poignant music that will never go out of style."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate the sparseness of the instrumentation","review":"CARY: The only track with bass & drums. Another additional benefit is the background singing.CALIFORNIA: This is the one with the steel guitar (at least it's something).MY OLD MAN: Right after \\"frying pan\\", there's a brief piano passage that sounds like Paul Bowles.A CASE OF YOU: It's a dud track and my guess is that this non-tune was written around the pre-written lyric."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious And Overrated","review":"I have no idea how this album EVER got such positive reviews. Joni Mitchell is perhaps the most pretentious, talentless artist of all time, and this album is one big snore.I grew up with this album (my sister played it nonstop), so I can confidently state that Blue is pompous, self-important, self-obsessed, me, me, me, and therefore BORING.Most people who say they like this album do so because they're supposed to. Stop the madness! Do not buy this album if you have not done so. Cheap Trick forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Smile Joni, its only Love","review":"Joni sounds oh so sad and depressed on this album, like she lost her best friend.

Damn those blues away!!!!!!!!!!!."},{"rating":"1","title":"very weak musically","review":"I think this album more than any Joni Mitchell album shows how weak she is musically and no sense of rythym whatsoever. She just seems to show off her vocal range within these songs and everything just seems disjointed and out of balance.

You first pick a player like Bart Simpson, Marge, Homer, Lisa, and etc. Then you pick up other people and drive them to their destination. That part's fun, then it gets worse. One flaw for this pretty good game is that the mission mode is unbelievabaly easy. I just picked up the controller and started mission mode and completed more than four levels! Another flaw for the Simpson's Road Rage is that the characters in this game look totally unreal and the heads look like bobbleheads. It just makes me want to punch the TV screen. Also, the mouths don't even match with the voices! Language in worse in the game than in the TV show, so don't get as a birthday present to a 5 year-old. Next time you meet them, they might just start saying \\"just shut up and drive.\\" DO NOT GET IT FOR YOUNG CHILDREN! Still, this game is a little above average. Maybe you should rent the game before buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad its amusing","review":"This game is amusing, stupid, and wierd.

Well, after this self-imposed waiting period, I finally broke down and bought it. Man am I sorry I did! The graphics don't take advantage of the Xbox's capabilities. The controls are buggy. Most annoyingly, as much as I like the Simpsons, the phrases are too repetative and the gameplay is just plain boring! Save your money. Rent it if you have to, but do not buy it.

So if you just want a Simpsons game, buy Hit and Run. And also, why is the price $75?! Are you insane? It's worth $10 at the most... This game was made in 2001 or something like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a chore to play","review":"This game stinks. The graphics of the people are okay, but the rest of the world stinks. The point is to hear people say stupid things pointlessly. Then you drive them to places and they pay hundreds of dollars. The cars don't even flip over. It's extremely repetitive. Hey haven't driven you somewhere 10 times already? That's what you'll be asking yourself. You have to do the same thing over and over again and get money. Then once you have the money you pointlessly buy people or areas. The worlds are terrible, but just like the T.V. show. Don't waste your money and get excited when you buy it, just don't even bother. Don't just try my review though, look at all the others on this site."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't see what all the complaining is about.","review":"I recently purchased Road Rage for Xbox after playing the Gamecube version with a friend. Yes, the game lacks depth. Yes, the dialog can get kind of annoying. Yes, the cars do not handle according to any of the laws of physics. And yes, the game is almost exactly like the great Crazy Taxi (the original, of course). My response to all the criticism, so what! The creators took something good (the Crazy Taxi concept) and wrapped it in something wonderful (the Simpsons license), like a chocolate-covered peanut, or a monkey in a cowboy suit! What the player is left with is a very simple, pick-up-and-play game that is especially excellent when company arrives. It has the same basic appeal as Smash Brothers. For the more open-minded, less gear-headed gamer, Simpsons Road Rage is a fine choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another lousy licensed game","review":"The Simpsons: Road Rage is, at best, a Crazy Taxi wannabe. This is the worst title I've played on the Xbox yet. The Crazy Taxi premise is okay - CT is one of my favorite games - but Road Rage suffers on many levels.The voice talent, while authentic, is very limited. Characters start repeating phrases within the space of a single run. It's annoying.The graphics are a cross between bad cel-shading and an intern's first attempt at 3D extrusion. Blech.The load times before and after each run are insane. I wonder if it's not a result of a \\"simple\\" port from one platform to another. This game was clearly not designed to take advantage of the Xbox's memory or graphic capabilities.Rent it, play it, then get it out of your system - literally and figuratively."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Underrated","review":"I can't believe this game gets so much heat for ripping off Crazy Taxi. SO WHAT!!! Crazy Taxi was a great game and The Simpsons : Road Rage is even better! Any Simpsons fan will definetly LOVE the tie ins with the show. You can go all around Springfield, driving various Simpsons characters that say hilarious things (\\"The leprechan told me to burn things\\" - Ralph, \\"Get out of the way Jerk\\" - Homer). You can choose from over a dozen characters, including the Simpson family, Apu, Ned and many more. The story mode is also challenging, having the player complete different tasks, not just taxi driving. The multiplayer mode I play all the time with my friends. You have to compete with other players in order to get customers and make money. Don't listen to the critics. Simpsons fan or not, you will love this game. Plus, its a bargin at the greatest hits price of only $20. Go buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy Taxi with an edge","review":"On one hand, this is a graphically inferior version of Crazy Taxi. Graphics aside, the game's fluidity and atmosphere are hurt by the fact it takes ages and ages to load each and every scenario, even if it is exactly the same scenario that you've just finished playing.This game does have its advantages over Crazy Taxi, though. For a start, it's more fun: You're actually encouraged to bump and destroy stuff. Then there are the loads of Simpsons characters and Simpsons related scenarios, and although they will ultimately wear out, they are fun.But the one thing that truly gives this game a significant edge over Crazy Taxi is its two player mode: Two rivalling taxi drivers fight it out to win customers, steal customers from one another (there is only one active customer at a time, and two hungry taxi drivers), and ruin as many things on their way as they can to hinder the opponent.The end result is fun, fun, and then more fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is a rental (from a huge Simpsons fan)...","review":"Graphics are well done, although you'll never get the level of character detail found on the actual Simpson's cartoon... Gameplay is very straightforward although I was able to get the car \\"stuck\\" easily by going off some jumps and flipping over.However, the game lacks the depth that games SHOULD possess for the XBOX platform... there are only 5 town areas and they are very quickly covered. Replay value is very low. Characters are well done (although they all have the same animation patterns). The voiceovers are the best part of the game in terms of entertainment value for Simpsons fans(\\"Thank you, come again\\" -Apu)..."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST GAMES I HAVE EVER PLAYED","review":"This game is great. It combines Crazy Taxi with Simpsons characters. Then, it throws in missions and bonus challenges. I love this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"It takes time","review":"I got this game at Target. It is awesome! It takes so long to get all of the characters, though. You have to work and get the money for them! So far I only have two locations and about 14 out of 17 characters. There is a mystery character and on New Years day it was Krusty the Clown in his clown car and the car had like a champaign bottle on it, it was neat, but the next day he was gone! :( Oh well, I can't wait until another holiday, maybe there will be a new character! I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes the Simpsons. It is absolutly awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Doh!","review":"This game rocks if you are a Simpsons fan. If not, don't buy it.

Here are 5 good reasons why this game shouldnt have been invented 1. The graphics are bland, their entrances to the car are absurd. (Hans Moleman doing a flip into a car?!) 2. The mission mode is unbelieveably sinchy. 3. They dont even have all of the characters. (No Patty + Selma, no Julius Hibbert, No Lenny + Carl to name a few) 4. The lines get dull + repetitive in 10 minutes and most of the lines are from old simpsons episodes. 5. This is just [an]... imitation of some game i forget the name of........ oh yeah, CRAZY TAXI!!!!!!

I thought it would be a fun alternative to a chalk or typical dry erase board. For the price, I was not impressed. The finish of the board had bubbles in it, and several spots where it was scratched off. The edging is not sturdy or heavy. This looks basically like your typical $20 white board, just black and $40 more (only I've never seen a white board with bubbles and scratches, even cheap ones). We returned it and are getting a classroom quality white board from a school supply website instead, for $20 less!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality for the price.","review":"The black metal edging around the outside of the markerboard is poorly manufactured -- it appears dented at two corners and the welded seam on one side is misaligned so that the board does not have a true rectangular shape.

If I offend or offended anybody, it's really not my fault.]Don't waste your hard-earn $$$ on this box set! Yes, the compilation includes many many great soul hits. But too many are re-recordings, and some of the voices in these tracks are unrecognizable. In other words, you don't know who the real singers are behind the mircophone. The best way to describe this boxset is: a little above-average Karaoke singers singing the soul hits of yester-years.Another interesting thing I like to point out is that the word \\"CHEAPOLATA\\" is printed on the back of the thin cardboard box that houses the 5 CDs. Is that the name of the Label? if it is, then it's extremely appropriate and self-serving!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Godai no fun","review":"I initially bought this game because it had to things that I liked: Ninjas and the ability to control the elements. Once I started playing I found that the game was lacking in several areas.First the camera, you can't control the view at all and so if you get into any of the platforming areas, you're pretty much blind because you can't see all the options available to you. You'll see one platform in front of you but not the ones to your left and right.Next is the control. While the combos are pretty cool, you can't change your direction of attack once you start it so if you miss, you're screwed.The weapons do degrade as you use them so it adds a touch of realism so at least there was some effort.The voices for the characters suck...a lot. Think of a bad voiced-over martial arts movie and take it down another notch and you'll have Godai. The story's pretty solid though. I would definitly recommend renting it before buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried to like this game but...","review":"I really did try to enjoy this game but I just couldn't. While the graphics are ok at best that is the only thing I like about this game. While it has many different weapons they weaken and break when you use them and are forced to fight without them. The game play hardly ever changes. Each element has the same type of enemies only with a different element. The game is also too short. Save your money for another game that is worth buying. If you are looking for a good action game this is NOT it. A game that I would highly recommend would be Dynasty Warriors 3. If you are still interested in this game I recommended you rent it to be sure because I bought it and I am sorry I did.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly Terrible","review":"This is hands down the worst PS2 game I have ever played.

And for $2 I got completely ripped off. I could have got two wendy's doublestacks for that.The graphics are horrible, the controls are terrible, and from what I remember of the only time I played it there is no save system. So I couldn't have even forced myself to play through it one mission at a time, because it's all or nothing. There's a possibility that I'm mistaken about the saving, but there were plenty of other problems to keep me from ever playing it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing good about this game!","review":"If you want a basic idea of this game, think of everything that makes up a good game and what a game would be like if it had none of those aspects. That would be this game. The characters are the stupidest that I've ever seen and their dialogue must have been written by a Devry institute dropout. Yes, it's that bad. The story also sucks royally. Probably the worst thing about this game is the controls because they make no sense. The buttons are not custumoizable and game rarely responds to your commands.

I think Romero is trying to be personal in this film, but fails in some areas. His most personal film is MARTIN, but that's another review.

The price has dropped since I ordered/returned this item, but I still think it would need to drop a little more to make this item a good value.

I damaged one of them this way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best out there!","review":"Though this is a decent product, there are many other of the same type that are much better!!!!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Gift for any occasion","review":"The Vin De La Vie wine glass charms are great, because they are appropriate for any wine lover. I am giving this product 4 stars instead of 5, because they changed the packaging. My first set came in a nice, clear box, so the recipient could see the charms without having to open the package. They now come in a little drawstring pouch, which is nice for storage, but it is just in a clear cellophane pouch with a cardboard header. In order to see what the charms look like, the recipient will have to open the package. Also, to make a nice presentation, you will have to go to a little more trouble to wrap them up. I bought these on sale, and for the price I paid, they were a good value. I would not advise paying full price for these, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Well, this was a freebie with the Reidel glasses which I gave my girlfriend as a Christmas gift.

They annoyed all of us, so we took them off!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Salyu, this time around, is too peppy.","review":"I generally adore Salyu, ever since hearing her voice in Lily Chou Chou no Subete (film). However, I generally adore her slower works and the minimalist approach: just her lovely voice and a piano would suffice. This CD is good, but seems over-produced: lots of drums, lots of riffs, lots of homage-sounding elements (Beatles, emo-bands), etc. I could completely be happy with an a cappella or piano version of this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Optical mouse doesn't work at all on this...","review":"My optical mouse by Logitech does not work at all.

Came quick too."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not similiar to other Belkin pad material","review":"I guess sometimes you just get what you pay for. In this case, you really do get what you pay for. The material in this small pad is cheap. It's not made of the same material of the Belkin pad which has a gel pad at the top. I own that one, and the material is much more smooth, and feels better. It has an extra two layers which really make it more comfortable. This mouse pad is like a one dollar item. It's hardly even worth 3 dollars, and I guess some people might think its worth that. But, overall its not something that I would want to use long term underneath my mouse, or anywhere under my hand.Pros- can't think of anycons- everything, uncomfortable material, seems cheapI would recommend spending more money on a nicer pad. Even one about the same price, you may get something more comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"good, i like","review":"the most noticeable thing u will notice is a smell on ur hands. u dont know what it is and it might take u a couple days to narrow it down like it took me. the mousepad has a weird smell to it. it DOES go away if that even matters to u or if u cant wait until then. i didnt even notice the smell was gone until i got the notification to leave a review for this. simple pad, good size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mouse pad for a great price","review":"For the price this mouse pad is great!

The price is right. The mouse pad is a good size and is sturdy. It stays put well on our kitchen table for our laptop. The only criticism is the terrible rubber smell when you first get it out of the bag. It was so strong that I had to put it down in the garage to air out for about a week. That helped and now I can only smell the rubber smell if I put my nose up to pad. But even now it is not near as strong as when I first got it out of the bag. If you have allergies or a sensitive nose you need to be warned, but the smell will go away with time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes my mouse track like a dream!","review":"I have a laser gaming mouse that I was just using on my desk.

This will do just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feels too slippery when you move the mouse","review":"I had high expectations for this mouse pad. The first thing I noticed is that it feels \\"slippery\\" when moving the mouse. The packaging says jersey-cloth surface. Then jersey-cloth must be a very slippery synthetic cloth. My old mouse pad has a natural cotton/synthetic mix and has a lot better traction, so you feel better control of the mouse. The second thing I noticed was the strong \\"tire\\" smell. I read the reviews, but I did not think it was going to be such an annoying smell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells for a while","review":"It's cheap and of pretty good quality.

Finally I smelled one of the mouse pads. Wow, nasty! I took the other two out of the package and they smelled just as bad.

I am upset not only with the seller but Amazon as well; this seller is selling unusable items and I feel I have been ripped off. I will take a buying hiatus from Amazon just on principle.

All and all...fully functional, just a strong rubber smell.UPDATE: Well, about 5 days have passed since I wrote the above. I didn't do anything. No fan, no leaving it in the sun.

As soon as I unwrapped it I was overcome by the stench of mothballs and an old lady's denture breath. Even after dousing it with Febreeze, I get punched in the face by its odor every time I sit down at my desk. This will be discarded as soon as I am done with this review.

I find that, for my purposes, this vacuum is only bearly functional. The hose from the vacuum seems a bit short. The capacity of the canister seems rather inadequate.

It does have the suction power but I bought it to use on the stairs and upstairs. I had a tool that would work on the stairs but it doesn't fit on the tube. I'm not sure what this machine is designed to do but the floor/carpet attachment doesn't do a decent job on either. When I use the crevice tool I wear ear plugs because of the noise is deafening.Other raters liked it for picking up cat hair but the hose and extension tubes act as a magnate and collect cat hair. I spend half the time cleaning the machine. Cleaning the filter is no picnic either. You need another vacuum to clean the filter and clean up the mess after the filter is cleaned. There must be better options."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sanyo Vacuum","review":"This canister vacuum cleans things very well. It has really good suction for the size it is. The only thing is the hose is rather 'stiff' but I am hoping it loosens up as I use it. It is really good on picking up 'sand', dirt, hair, and fuzz. It works great on laminate flooring and vinyl. I wouldn't really recommend it for carpet though other than maybe for 'spot' pick up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive vacuum for the money","review":"Very good suction power from such a small machine. I'm very pleased with it;s performance and very handy to use due to it's small size.Only one suggestion for improvement; the hose is made of plastic and somewhat clumsy as it doesn't have much flexibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable and efficient","review":"I was here looking for a new vacuum, as my Sanyo vac is now nearly 15 years old, and I've worn out the dust brush and lost the crevice tool.Other than that, it still works amazingly well, and in my house really gets a HUGE workout with mostly hardwood floors, a husband, a 17 y/o boy, a golden retriever, and 3 cats.After reading the reviews, I think I'll try and find a new dust brush and a crevice tool, as I don't think I'll find anything better for less than $500. Although considering I paid about $50 for mine lo those many years ago, it doesn't owe me a dime!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great gift idea!","review":"This is a rare book that is both hilarious reading and an indispensable refernce tool...just pick your location , look it up, and fire away.

But, the 9th edition will have all the updated FM numbers; which you are probably going to need to do well on SGT and SSG boards. Go to Banda books website and buy it there or if you are lucky enough to have a decent clothing sales store get the 9th edition there.To be honest though, this book makes the difference between getting a low 130s score and a high 140s score on your promotion board. The 9th edition is a MUST HAVE for the SPC and CPL looking to move up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check with your unit!","review":"This guide is **TOO** comprehensive. There is no way in a thousand years I could have memorized all of the information in the guide with the time I had available before my board. I bought a copy at Clothing Sales store and returned it both for that reason and because it was too expensive.My battalion had a more current study guide available. My unit narrowed down a lot of the subject matter in this guide, and then updated it. They also added information that was pertinent to modern day soldiers, e.g., they eliminated the trivia.Actually, even the other smaller commercial guides are a better product than this one. Search the on-line bookstores for the more up to date ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Braun KF510 coffeemaker","review":"I purchased this coffeemaker as I have wanted a Braun coffeemaker due tomy experience with their coffeemakers I have had, they really last.This coffeemaker makes great tasting very hot coffee, and very quickly.This coffeemaker has a built in water filter, however I use filtered waterfrom my refrigerator which works best for my use.I personally like this no nonsense coffeemaker without the bells and whistles.I would highly recommend this product as I am very pleased with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite coffee maker","review":"This is probably the 3th or 4th Braun kf510 I've had over 12 years. I like the design. Especially the ability to pour a cup as it is being made. Recently they are hard to find locally so it was just easy to order it on amazon and have it delivered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Braun KF510 - a disappointment","review":"I have had a Braun coffeemaker for the last 20 years and loved the coffee. I have had the basic aromamaster model which they no longer make. It brewed great coffee. I am very disappointed with the updated version - the coffee is not nearly as good. It has much less flavor. I am not sure what the difference is in the brewing process - but the end product is far inferior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carafe dribbles, plate burns","review":"After owning a Braun FlavorSelect for a few years, I broke the carafe for the second time (other FlavorSelect owners understand this problem). Rather than seeking out another replacement carafe for an aging machine, I opted for a new coffee maker. I LOVE the Brita filter, so I opted for the AromaDeluxe. Big mistake. The carafe dribbles everywhere and the warming plate is way too hot, burning the coffee. We're working around the problem by transferring the coffee to a thermal carafe when it's done (and wiping up lots of spills). If you have a FlavorSelect, keep buying new carafes until the machine dies. The AromaDeluxe is a significant downgrade in coffee making."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"This coffeemaker has so much potential, but makes rather watery coffee. It looks better than most coffeemakers out there and has fewer bells and whistles that tend to break with use anyway, and after reading the reviews I thought it would be good for my purposes- but not so. The plastic is made of inferior quality compared to my old Salton and I'm just hoping that I won't have to repurchase next year, but I've seen this kind of flimsy plastic in other products that break too easily or don't hold up to higher temperatures. When the coffee is brewing dribbles appear at the bottom joint where the swing basket sits and they drip down the side. This has never happened before in all the years I've been making coffee. To top it off, the coffee is really weak and I'm not a strong coffee freak but I have to use twice as much coffee as I used to to get the same strength brew. I had higher hopes for this one- too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good coffee","review":"Seems like other, similar coffeemakers at lower prices should make good coffee too. Sad experience says they don't. Have no idea why Braun coffeemakers make better coffee, but they do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, if we only could see the water gauge!","review":"After having looked for a simple coffeemaker that does not take up too much space on the kitchen counter and without all the unnecessary bells and whistles, and believe me they are hard to find today, we again settled for a Braun.We have now had this coffeemaker for a couple of months and are very pleased with it EXCEPT for the fact that Braun has managed to hide the water gauge so off to the side that it is practically impossible to see how much water you pour in.This is the 5th Braun coffeemaker we have, which in a way does not say much about the overall quality. However, we find that the construction of this new model coffeemaker seems sturdier than the former ones no longer manufactured models.The water filter seems like an unnecessary addition and we have already replaced it with the plastic insert that comes with the maker.Overall a good buy except for the water gauge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Braun Coffee Maker","review":"Purchased on May 3rd and it's now in the shop being repaired. The clip that holds the cover shut broke and I had to send it to a repair shop to be be replaced.

Not this time. We have had the coffeemaker for about one year, and from the word go, it was a little loose and touchy. Now, after just one year, it is impossible to brew a pot without coffee spilling all over our counter. I suggest looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Braun KF510-WH Aroma Deluxe 10 cup coffeemaker, White","review":"I love this coffeemaker. It's fast brewing, and I especially like the pause andpour feature. But my only complaint with this product is, that whenpouring a cup of coffee it drips all over. It is very annoying,so,while I like this coffeemaker, I would look for a non drip one next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"FROM THE BACK COVER OF THE BOOK:","review":"Miriam Therese Winter, an award-winning musician and four-time Catholic Book Award-winner, shares her experiences of becoming a Sister, working with starving children in Ethiopia and with refugees in Cambodia, of exploring mysteries of India and the wonders of God in her own backyard, of having breast cancer and having hope.

On some songs he just sounds like Elvis which is not easyat all. On other songs the key he has to sing in doesn't quite fitwith his but then he just sounds like Ronnie which isn't bad at all. I owna lot of his country CD's and really appreciate him as what hereally stands for which is Country music. Of course this tribute recordwith the incredible back up by the original Elvis team does a lotin raising its rating. It isn't a 5 star record but I think that a 4star classification is fair enough especially for the Jordanaires,Scotty Moore, D.J.

But here they do not so much whisper as talk \\"softly\\", and not always very softly, either--especially the one who sounds like a man. I had to grab for the voice credits, verifying (by traditional name standards, at least), that both \\"whisperers\\" were women. At least this has the right Idea. I am sick, and even tired, of \\"relaxation/meditation/hypnosis/guided visualization\\" being dominated by male voices. If I want to be told to relax, I want a woman doing the telling. Not for sexual reasons, mind you (not that there's anything at all wrong with that...)--but perhaps mostly for the inner little boy cradled deep in my subconscious, cut apart from The Mother Voice, never to be so nurtured again. Having a dorky guy voice tell me to \\"relax...\\" or \\"feel loved...\\" borders, no, it flatly trepspasses on creepy territory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"If you watched the movie, you will love the book more.

CBS only put it on the air because they had no other good sitcoms in the fall of 1962. What happened was a revolution in sitcoms. \\"The Beverly Hillbillies\\" went on to become one of the biggest hits in the history of television. It climbed to the top of the ratings faster than any sitcom in history. It is no wonder that forty years later audiences still love this show. With the exception of \\"I Love Lucy\\", not other sitcom has been so durable and successful in syndication. Thanks to Mr. Stephen Cox for writing a book about a sitcom that truly deserves such recognition. \\"The Beverly Hillbillies\\" was a runaway hit and a phenomenon.

The book contains: fantastic black & white and color photos, behind the scenes stories, great interviews with the cast, an episode guide and a detailed history of America's favorite hillbilly family.

It's a hard book to describe because the writing, not style-wise, but appreciation wise, is similar to A.A. Milne in the sense that kids can easily understand it, but those looking for crafted beauty in the words find it. Here's a sample: \\"It took me a long journey, two thousand miles, to learn to dig a post hole and to hoe a long row, to plant a tree, to kill a chicken and to build a stone wall, but the soil here is not like Wessex soils, the trees are stunted, the rivers run dry and the hillsides are clad in thick, coarse scrub covering the ancient conformations.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for roll play","review":"My daughter loves playing store so this was a big hit.

If you love Joan Sebastian's and Marco Antonio Solis' music you'll love this CD. It has a mixture of both their older songs and their newer songs. Marco Antonio Solis hasn't changed his style much since he began with \\"Los Bukis,\\" but he continues to please with his music, the CD does include Venia Bendita which he sings with mariachi. You are able to compare Joan Sebastian's style of years ago with songs like Julianita and Veinticinco Rosas and his style of today with songs like Tatuajes and Un Idiota. The tracks alternate between Joan and Marco Antonio so you are able to hear a different style with every song. If you are a fan of these two great composers and singers, and have been a fan throughout the years of their careers, I recommend you buy this CD. Some of their older songs are hard to find, and this is great opportunity to get your hands on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful product","review":"My daughter uses this product daily and she loves the taste.

I was not disappointed!9 of the 12 tracks aqre Tweedy penned, most of them instrumentals performed by Tweedy and Glenn Kotche. Several of them are truly mesmorizing, including the \\"Opening Titles\\", with guitar-distorts all over, \\"Frank's Dream\\", \\"The Wallman\\" and, best of all, the 11 min. \\"Finale\\" with it's haunting guitar riff and overlaying piano playing.There are 2 tracks attributed to Wilco: the \\"new\\" track \\"Promising\\" sounds like Tweedy solo, and the other one \\"When The Roses Bloom Again\\" is from the Mermaid Avenue sessions with Billy Brag, quite beautiful actually.As with many movie soundtracks, this is a \\"mood album\\", and I find it very engaging, altough it's probably not for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty ding dang good","review":"This is a great CD even if youre not a Wilco/Uncle Tupelo/Alt country completist.

This is a great piece of work by Wilco's frontman Jeff Tweedy. His instrumental tracks often remind me of other work done by equally great bands like Mogwai, Tortoise, etc.If you liked Yankee Hotel Foxtrot at all, you will enjoy this album. It has songs by Wilco and Tweedy by himself. It also has an Indie-Version of The Lonely One from an earlier Wilco CD.

She is able to name and put all the shapes in the correct spots, but we are still working on getting colors correct. We enjoy it because it is a nice, quiet activity that our daughter can do while we're finishing up dinner, etc.They are sturdy wooden boards. I believe there are 5 boards with 2 patterns on each board- so 10 total. Pieces include yellow triangles, purple circles, blue squares, green ovals, and red rectangles. Some of the photos include fish, butterfly, bird, kite, train, firetruck, house, etc. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the paint. I wish the pieces and boards were dyed instead of painted, especially since we've had other Melissa & Doug sets with chipping paint that we had to get rid of."},{"rating":"2","title":"A surprising hit!","review":"I ordered this for my soon-to-turn 2 yo granddaughter, because she was learning her shapes already, and I had a lot of faith in it just b/c it was a Melissa & Doug product. It arrived, and I wasn't at all sure that she would like it all that much...it seemed kind of boring to me. Well, it turns out she absolutely loves it!!! I guess she's just at that \\"puzzle stage\\", and she really does tune into shapes and what they're called. She's even figured out that two squares will fill the spaces meant for rectangles. This was a hit!! She will play with it for an hour or longer at a time!

It is really well made. My only complaint would be ALL of the boards require the triangle shape, and that is the one she has the most trouble with. If there was one without the triangle she could complete a board totally on her own. However, I think the minimum age for this toy is 2 years, so the fact that she can't manage the triangle shape at 18 months really isnt a product flaw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy","review":"My 4 years old son love this game it's so cool he enjoyed playing it a lot and as well as my nephews."},{"rating":"2","title":"A big hit!","review":"My boy/girl twins received this as a belated 2nd birthday present. I opened it up three days ago (they are now 26 months) and was astounded with how much my son LOVED it. He will match the shapes on one side of every picture, then turn them over to complete the other side, and back again. He identifies the shapes, counts them, tells me their color, etc. So far, he has not tired of it. My daughter isn't as into it (unless you count hiding the circles from her brother), but I think that's a personality thing, not a toy attribute. I'm definitely recommending this item to my friends with young kids and look forward to trying out the next level of Pattern Blocks with my son."},{"rating":"2","title":"20 month old enjoys this toy","review":"Great toy and it is educational when trying to teach shapes. My daughter likes to make her pictures and the parts will all fit back inside the open wood box when the child is done playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"2yo loves it","review":"We got this for my daughter when she turned two. She's always been really good at puzzles, and she already knows her shapes and colors from other puzzles. I got this set b/c the same shapes are used in different ways to create new shapes and pictures - this is foundational for art and creative thinking. If she plays with this by herself, it's pretty boring and she doesn't stick with it for very long. But when we play with her, we make up little games to help her start thinking more abstractly about the activity. She especially loves it when we pretend to use the wrong shapes so she can correct us. We have a couple of the p'kolino puzzles that try to teach the same thing, but so far she prefers this one.I do wish that the box came with a top. The pieces are always spilling everywhere. We also have the magnetic dress-up dolls - same problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for toddler's!","review":"My almost 2 year old really enjoys putting together puzzles. Great for learning shapes/colors. We have quite a few Melissa and Doug toys and she enjoys playing with all of them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hands on toy!","review":"My son is 4 and loves this toy. It comes in a sturdy case with several puzzles. It teaches shapes and colors. Even though my son is probably past that, its good for his hand/eye coordination. Plus its just a good refresher for him to use it. The one thing I wish Melissa & Doug would do with these wooden sets is make lids. The boxes are so nice for storage, but because of the lack of the lids, the pieces can fall out or easily be tipped over. If it had a lid, I could stack the other puzzles I have on top. These puzzle sets are not cheap. The least they could do was provide a lid so you can keep your pieces all together!Overall this toy is a fun one. Even my older kids play with it when the 4 year old is. He loves to play with this while doing his therapy listening CD and it helps him sit still and focus on something for a longer period of time. These toys are made well too and that is why I spend the extra money on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toy","review":"Did not play with this for long. Pieces got lost very fast.

It's a great toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply Made","review":"We bought this toy as it's:1) Melissa and Doug2) A Great toy idea for a toddlerUnfortunately, when we received the item, all the pieces were glued together! When we physically separated the pieces, half of the pictures/color got removed! Plus everything has a sticky, gluey substance on it now.REFRAIN from buying!!! This toy is a great idea and if they didn't use glue, this would be a great buy. Unfortunately, it's probably made in China. :(."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad quality","review":"I am very dissatisfied with the paint quality of the product.

For the price, one could expect a better quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for 2 yr old","review":"My daughter just got this for her second birthday and I wish we would have gotten one sooner. It is a little easy for her; we started doing puzzles with her at 1 yr. But she loves all the different shapes and puzzles - especially the train and boat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Children like it but not challenging","review":"My 2.5 year old twins like these pattern blocks but they are not at all challenging. I bought these and Infantino's Colors and Shapes Puzzle because my twins were getting frustrated with more difficult puzzles and I thought these would build their skill level. I think that the Infantino's were a better fit for them (my son moved on to more difficult puzzles soon after) . My twins do enjoy the pattern blocks, though, and younger toddlers would enjoy them even more, I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly a favorite","review":"I bought this toy for my 2.5 year old daughter on a great deal, not expecting it to be a big hit. I was wrong! She loves it. It's great for shape recognition and fine motor skills. The triangles are particularly more of a challenge to place into the puzzle. I love that there are several \\"scenes\\" because they are double sided. Great M&D toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Made in CHINA","review":"I guess I just assumed being a wooden toy that this was made here, but nope...sticker says Made is China.My review is like most others here.

Puzzle pieces are bright colored with 10 puzzles each."},{"rating":"2","title":"No stickers here!","review":"Length:: 1:20 MinsLove this set! The puzzles are painted on not just a sticker like some of the newer Melissa and Doug puzzles are. My 2.5 year old son loves it. He likes to stack the puzzle shapes as well. Great quality and perfect for toddlers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little overrated","review":"I bought this based solely on all the reviews I had read that this was a must have for your toddler. My two year old son played with it about half an hour when we first received it. He still enjoys playing with it, but it only holds his attention for maybe 5 minutes now. He is really good at puzzles, so maybe it's too easy for him. Once you know where to put all the shapes, you've pretty much mastered the whole box of patterns. It is cute and well-made, like all Melissa & Doug products, but this is not an essential toy for a two year old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chipping paint, terrible odor out of the box","review":"I don't like writing negative reviews, and I have a lot of Melissa and Doug products that I think are great. But right out of the box the paint was peeling off all the puzzles, and worst of all they had an overpowering, terrible odor that made my head ache. I don't want my children, or anyone else, inhaling that odor on a regular basis. I love the idea of this toy and would have kept it even with the chipped paint, but I couldn't get past how badly it smelled, and returned it. Perhaps the odor might dissipate over time but that's not very comforting to me. Really disappointing. I will say I have not had this happen with other Melissa and Doug products, maybe this was just a bad batch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toxic Smelling Toy","review":"As soon as I took off the plastic wrap I inhaled the strongest smell of VOC's. I knew this product was made in China before I even looked at the back of the box. This company should be ashamed of themselves. On one hand they promote toys that enhance learning but at the cost of the health of a child that could impair long-term learning. Babies and toddlers have soft scalps and are more affected by toxins then adults. I called customer service thinking that this may be an isolated incident. However, the rep nonchalantly told me to air out the toys for a few days first. I told her that isn't acceptable. My child will touch this toy and my infant has put the toy in her mouth. Melissa and Doug doesn't care about our kids as much as they care about turning a profit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate it with all my guts","review":"Some people are born writers; others, natural stylists. Some people come into the world with the enviable ability to philosophize; others are blessed with a no less enviable gift to think through an idea logically and clearly. Which puts G. W. S. Trow in an awkward position: for though he could not write well, he yet fancies himself a great stylist; and though his critical thinking is at best muddle-headed and derivative, he yet imagines himself an oracular critic of the sharpest distinction.

The book is really all about daily observances in life, the world all around us and how we react to it. It's all about taking a step back to really think about how we go about our daily lives, through the eyes of a comic genius.I'd suggest watching a few Top Gear episodes to warm up to Jeremy's style of humor to maximize the effect whilst reading this humorous book.Orale!Bubba Torres"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thouroughly Enjoyable","review":"I am a huge fan of Top Gear, and I greatly enjoy Jeremy Clarkson and his brand of humor. I bought this almost blind, and I was pleasently suprised by it. The book itself is a collection of his columns for The Sunday Times in the UK. His articles cover a wide variety of topics, including Enviornmentalism, Politics, Dining, Culture, and Celebrities. The humor is much different from that of Top Gear, but it is still utterly hilarious. Clarkson is a one of a kind Journalist, of the sort we dont really get here in the US. It has to be said, for any non British readers, some of the references may go a bit over your head, as alot of the articles focus on a headline of the day. Other than that, I have no complaints.

He just never seems to get quite comfortable, as is evident in the slow movements where his playing of the beautiful melodies never come close to acquiring the required sense of grace and elegance that they should possess. For a performer who so magically mastered the complexities of Shostakovich and Prokofiev, Vengerov has yet to resolve a set of very different challenges in Mozart's far less technically demanding concertos. Great sounding CD, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Genius on the wrong track... again","review":"A true enigma, Vengerov. In person one of the most extraordinary fiddlers I've heard. Yet, his recordings have been variable at best. For every Shostakovich/Prokofiev 1 (with Rostropovich, surprise!), there's a substandard Sibelius/Nielsen (with Barenboim, no surprise). For every delightful \\"Vengerov with Virtuosi\\" from 2001, there's, well, this misbegotten Mozart programme. From the lugubrious opening bars of the Sinfonia Concertante to the two concerti, this is terrible stuff - boring and unMozartian. What should be clear by now is Vengerov is more dependent than most on the musical opinions of his collaborators. When his is the primary musical intellect, you're likely to end up with something that sounds no way like the work of a great artist.... something like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst performance ever...","review":"No idea what EMI thought about to publish such a poor recording.

He is a huge rescue heros fan and we have been quite happy with all other products- until this one. The vehicle itself is great and seems durable. The issue is with the robot that attaches under the front bumber by three small magnets. You have to line the robots receiving ends into the magnet spots. Needless to say it is difficult for an adult, never mind a 4 year old. My son is extremely frustrated with this toy. The wench is actually a part of the robot, so that when he is installed under the bumber the wench is able to be used. However, because of the lack of strength of the magnet, the robot falls off quite easily which means the wench is useless. So, buyer beware- not a real great buy especially if your child is like mine and likes to hook up and tow other things with wenches, hooks etc...

It does - but it sticks to the things you could do in the Windows API several years ago.

Unfortunately the excess of equations makes it harder to find the equations that actually do matter to someone who simply wants to use the Kalman filter technique to solve some practical problem.

The book starts off slow, and I really couldn't get into it. In the beginning, there are several made up news article. One is about NATO collapsing, and he could have expanded on that.And it is kind of unconcievable that a wing of Polish F-15s (don't know if their talking about A or C models) would hold off Rafales, F-4s, Mirages, and Tornadoes for as long as they did.If you like political and eastern Europe allies books, you should read Cauldron, but if you like military or techno-thrillers, read Dale Brown or Tom Clancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah.

The setting is a bit OTT, but he can be forgiven for that. After all, Clancy has the same trend in his books. One thing, though. He had a small section relating to air raids ovn UK bases and territories. Wouldn't it have been slightly more realistic to have had a bit more action involving the UK's armed forces, considering the UK is only 21 miles from the French coast at its closest point.

The island makers, guards, farmers, servants, gardeners, seamstresses, candle-makers, stable hands, the list goes on of all those livelihoods would be stripped away by the king's new found self gratification by excessive charity.

Yet this same greed allows his path to cross with that of a loving, giving soul who has the gift to help the king learn how to find his own happiness. It is apparent that both author and illustrator have a deep understanding of the gift of giving, and have given us a wonderful story to share with our loved ones.

The price is low because they are selling counterfeit product. We bought \\"The Beatles - Past Masters (remastered)\\" from BellaFun.First, the printing is telling. It looks like they may have scanned original art and reprinted from there. The printing is fuzzy (pixelized) and off color. There is a typo on the back where the songs are listed and you don't have to work too hard to find it either! Next, the pieces were assembled upside down. Most importantly, the discs are scratched. My nephew, a Beatles aficionado, could tell you more of what's wrong but I think you get the picture.BellaFun (Lisa Laberto) may or may not know, yet the integrity of this vendor will be revealed as I try to get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"More flogging a dead horse","review":"Let's make no bones about it, this is not a proper album - it is a cash in.

I found the family tree at the back to be quite helpful, although it's too bad that I needed it. That indicates to me that perhaps the author made things a little too complex (in having too many characters who were too similar).I don't quite have the negative view of the portrayal of females, although there is only one major female character and she's a lightweight.The interweaving of our historical mythologies (norse, greek, etc) into this story was great. I'm a fan of Wright's other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less preaching, more writing, please","review":"The first book in this series was brilliant.

Heh heh heh.\\" I happen to agree with most of the opinions Wright expresses, but I'd really rather not be slapped in the face with them as a substitute for good story telling.

So I decided to buy him some. I LOVED the price on these, and from the picture guessed they were exactly what I was looking for. I guess I should probably say the blocks I have are BIG. Some are about 6 inches and the smallest are maybe 2 inches. Great for my 2.5 year old godson who has a newborn brother. Zero choking risk. The blocks I received are SMALL!!! Most are about one inch. Definitely small enough for a kid to get in their mouth. My godson still LOVES them. He built houses, roads and all kids of things. We even learned a few shapes with out him really knowing he was learning. I would recommend them for slightly older children due to the fact that the small size makes them a bit more difficult to stack for those with less developed motor skills. Over all I\\"m pretty happy with them I just wish they were a bit bigger."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL! A must for those who wish to actualize their practices.","review":"Yet another amazing work by Christopher Penczak. Unlike traditional spellbooks, Instant Magick stresses that practitioners can actualize their magick by using it outside of ritual circumstances. In all actuality, we are CONSTANTLY weaving magick and creating our reality. Penczak understands this well. This book is concerned with focusing thoughts and using Willed-intention to bring forth manifestation; to truly utilize our ability inside ritual and out. This book fills a much-needed gap, and I recommend this directly alongside \\"The Circle Within\\" by Dianne Sylvan. The two are very important works focused on taking ritualized magick to the next, and most necessary, step: letting be a living part of our everday existence. This book is a key, and I'm so happy to own it and pass it onto my own students :)~OakRaven~"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad book.","review":"If you've been practicing for a while, chances are most of this will sound like old hat to you. If you haven't, you'll get a brief course in concentration and meditation techniques that can be applied to day to day life as well as will-working. In either case, the book outlines how to combine those techniques with magick to imprint the specific mental states and energetic patterns in such a way that you won't need to put together a full ritual to make something happen. There are also brief tables of correspondences in the back that practitioners from every paradigm can make use of at one time or another. It's a worthwhile book to at least check out of the library, if not add to one's own library for use. You can definitely put a new spin on methods already mastered with some of the techniques Penczak describes in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magick","review":"It's definitely a keeper for me.

They also show a maturation of style and voice that put him in the company of very few as far as quality of performance and breadth of talent. This, in my opinion, is the better of the two solo efforts. Just Between You and Me was an 80's hit that touched a lot of female hearts, and \\"Warmest Rising Sun\\" is an unexpected pleasure.My best to Lou as he continues his musical career.

Finally I bought it and I am 100% happy with it, and I don't understand what this talk of \\"graininess\\" is all about. I find the video to be very sharp and clear, and better than the VHS video. But the DVD also includes a number of extra features - such as an MTV special with interviews with DM, and the original video that is on the screens.I think this concert captures DM at their peak - and I saw them live in both 1988 at the Rose Bowl concert, and on the most recent Exciter tour and have the dvd's of those concerts too, so I can compare.

The book is excellent - descriptive, vivid, horrifying at times, one of King's best. I am not even sure if those who produced the screenplay even read the book - perhaps they picked up Cliff's notes. Anyone who enjoyed this film did not read the book. I did. That's what ruined it for me. If Hollywood wanted to package this with a different title, this incredibly short film may be palatable.

You can't get in touch with, nevertheless well acted, actors.I do not see the film as a horror film. . . it doesn't really have any elements of suspense or chilling screws in the plot.

Included in this raspy, unruly set are the earliest known recordings of steel guitar whiz Jimmy Bryant, Louisiana crooner Jimmy C. Newman, and two tracks by Bakersfield bandleader Bill Woods, whose band acted as the cradle for West Coast bigshots Billy Mize and Buck Owens.

It was suppose to be the entertainment for her birthday party. Thank goodness that we decided to give it to her the day before her party so that we could hook it up and figure out how to work it before her friends got here. After assembling it we plugged it in and turned the power on, it started to smoke immediately, my daughter started screaming and smoked filled up my living room within seconds. We didnt even get to put a cd in. Total disaster. Needless to say, I took it back to the store the next morning and got my money back.

Basic plot: small town sheriff comes across an accident involving his small town's elementary school principal and a young girl fresh out of high school; he creates a story to protect both victims' reputations that ends up creating unexpected results. Although I thought Watson's highly descriptive prose was impressive, the book did drag at times as Sheriff Jack Nevelsen's thoughts went off onto seemingly unrelated tangents. I hadn't read any previous reviews and wasn't expecting the surprise finale. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 3 purely because of the creative ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small town standards are examined by White Crosses.","review":"White Crosses develops a theme of the sheriff as being the perveyor of the public image of the county. Jack Nevelson, the sheriff of Bentrock, Montana, has an image of what his town should be and what people in his town should be like. When the principal of the elementary school and a teenage girl are found dead in a ditch, he wants to protect his town's image. He concocts a lie to cover up the truth. What is true about his town and about him evolves into a good story.Larry Watson is a good story teller, but at times he wanders a bit from his task. He does bring the reader back to the story in his due time. He shows the reader that what seems to be - isn't. Inside of small little towns are secrets worthy of any story tellers attention. Bentrock could be a lot of places. He just tells the secrets of Bentrock. Who is the keeper of the secrets and the standards of your town? Is it the sheriff?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"This book was poorly written. The author begins going on topics that are quite random fairly often.The storyline was monotonous and had no progress until the end.Unnecessary cussing was used frequently.The only good thing I can say about it is the ending was a surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Potential, Not Always Realized","review":"I just finished White Crosses and it did have something to say about the human condition--the morality of seeking the truth. Someone should have told the Sheriff that \\"the truth shall set you free.\\" In the end, Nevelson should have realized that it was not his job to be the purveyor of truth and standards for his town. I did have trouble with Nevelson's characterization; I agree with another review that he was not a terribly likable character. (But then neither was anyone else.) All of the characters were a bit two dimensional and could have been drawn more carefully. I also did not care for the ending...but do find that the book has occupied my thoughts since reading it. I wonder if any of the other characters would bother to rewrite the circumstances of the ending (don't want to give it away) to salvage Jack's reputation?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book limped and finally crawled, thankfully, to an end","review":"When I read a book like this, I immediately look at the publisher--because maybe I could get published myself. It was that bad. Do you like to wait pages and pages for a narrator to fully analyze his motivation before something happens? Do you feel compelled to finish a book you started out of principle? Do you forget about principle when you think about real life? Do you want to read any more questions? Than don't read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick start but ends in a fizzle","review":"I can not imagine how this book got published! The author must be related to the publisher. I have never read a book in which so much was said about things of no relevance. A decent little story which could have been told in 25% of the words used, the sheriff wanders through all of his grubby history, leaving the plot dangling so long that I had difficulty picking up the storyline again. After awhile, I decided I didn't care much. However, I did finish it -- trying to at least get something for my money -- but I knew what I was up against after the first 25 pages. The only value I see in this book is to use in in a book on how to write, under a chapter titled \\"Don't let this happen to you.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Publish a Whole Book of Outline Questions?","review":"A bad example of regional fiction having no real regional identity (what was it like there?); having little or no original writing (\\"Don't like the weather? Wait a minute.\\") and worst of all, a thinly described, barely likable character whose mind wanders; who asks himself a lot of questions the damned author should have answered; and then up and dies. A poor plot outline made into a weak novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth continuing","review":"I admit I had to put this book aside and never got past the beginning. The tedious, tangential introspection of the sheriff deviated from the plot so regularly I found myself beginning to skip these parts. The sheriff's negligence in investigating the accident was so unprofessional, to the point of being completely unbelievable, I could not continue."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! I surly did not expect that ending...Loved the Book","review":"I am a very avid reader, and during camp I came accross this book. I could not put it down! I called my best friend to let her know she HAD to read it. I anjoyed the personal touch he gave to his characters. I felt I was a part of the book. It drew me in. I have not read any other of Larry Watson's book, but I know I will be heading out soon for Montana 1948."},{"rating":"2","title":"Towards ending the history of anthropology coverup","review":"In Peace's preface he writes of anthropology's historians Geo Stocking and Dick Handler \\"failures to consider the political beliefs and actions\\" of the anthropologists they chronicle--a charge that well summarizes the central devastating shortcoming of the history of anthropology for the past 30 years. This biography goes a long ways towards suggesting how anthropologists can reintegrate politics back into their disciplinary histories.

Could it be that Wendy Carlos reached moog genius status by the time she got around to 'Switched on Bach 2\\" ? As there is no narrative to this 'album', one may have to dig a little deeper to find out. Never the less, this collection of Bach compositions is a faithfully represented and artistic stroke of brilliance. I love it and I recommend it to serious music fans.

The music is still very good but this CD version would not play in our DVD player / burner.

It was necessary to copy the music from the cd to my PC and then burn a fresh CD to get it to play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but I don't like it","review":"I consider this CD to be a shallow version of music that originally had great depth. The sounds from this synthisizer are weak compared to great instruments such as the violin and the harpsichord. Each note is played with such precision, that all emotion is lost. It is lacking in range, layering and intensity. It is as if a machine read the sheet music and emitted the sounds from a simple toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Grail, where art thou? Art thou here?

The lady writer who hosts the program, walks around endlessly and pointlessly (often in slow motion), gazes into the heavens, lays out tarot cards wherever she has the possibility - and she has many. After 30 minutes or so her close-ups and limited acting ability reaches a critical level and the viewer is compelled to push the button.

I have a Dell Inspiron 600m laptop, which this is being advertising as working with. But I looked at the label included in the photo here and compared to my Dell AC adaptor.

BUT...mine is DC: 4.62 A (amps) and the adaptor for sale here is 3.34 A (amps). I believe that could cause significant damage to your laptop. It was very good of the seller to include the photos, but this does not fit an inspiron 600m--at least not one sold in May 2004. Perhaps newer or older inspiron models do use this adaptor.

The Infamous and Hell On Earth are one of my favorite albums of all time,but this is just ridiculous. The people who say that we're \\"hating\\" try to hide the fact that Prodigy SUCKS now. Hell,He's not even rhyming on most of his songs (this has been happening ever since The Infamy came out) and most of the beats are garbage. I'd jam Get Rich Or Die Trying anyday instead of this POS,and I don't even like 50 Cent. Sad to say,but they need to give up the mic because they obviously got rich and stopped trying........"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok cd","review":"First of all I wanna clear suttin up...My crew is Blood Money Productions and we have had this name for over a year so I nor did any1 else take the name from this cd...I thought this cd was aiight but nowhere close to being as good as old Mobb material.

In Blood Money, the first mistake was having their executive producer being \\"50 Cents\\" instead of themselves or at least the Alchemist, which was the joint producer of Eminem's Re-Up CD. From beginning to the end, you hear \\"G-Unit\\" instead of \\"The Infamous\\" which shown them being completely sold out from their own foundation. Of their songs on the CD, the best beat goes to \\"Pearly Gates\\". Interesting enough, the CD has the edited version of the song because Prodigy says alot of offensive things about Jesus Christ in the original version. Other decent songs are songs that been on other CDs. But this is a G-Unit CD and if you love G-Unit, then you would love this one. But being a Mobb Deep fan, they completely lost their identity."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS ALBUM WAS A FLOP","review":"due to the several set-backs this album failed miserably in sale's...the album has a couple good tracks, then it also had POTENTIAL..but all that 50 is worried about is making money, and this was an obvious FLOP...in one of 50's songs \\"Not Rich, Still Lyin'\\" he states he is going to have a \\"New Album\\" released july 18th, here it is july 12th and no news on this \\"album\\" someone needs to tell the people at INTERSCOPE that 50 is telling everyone one thing, and not delinvering it.."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLah expected much more","review":"I enjoyed maybe two tracks off of this entire album...the production was lacking and it just diddnt seem like the mobb...and wheres the single? put em in they place? bad choice obviously because i dont think anybody has heard it on the radio or seen it on TV...this album was pretty weak i expected quite abit more from the infamous Mobb... : /"},{"rating":"1","title":"50 cent needs to be dropped off to mars, along with yayo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I'll tell you why people are hating on this album.

Man rap has gotten dipressing. The second problem I have is P's verse on Pearly Gates, I am religous and I think it's retarted to be talking down on anyones religion.

That f***er 50 sucks, takes the old Mobb Deep and changes them to his style, when I heard this album I just felt like I was listening to 50's album. Not just because Mobb Deep aint the same anymore, the main reason was because 50 is nearly on half of the fockin album. And not just that, also Young Buck, Lloyd Banks and Fony Yayo. And maan... M.O.P not on one song. This is just a disapointment that mobb deep whent from \\"The Infamous - Survival of the Fittest & Shook Ones Pt. II\\" which is on my top 10 list over best hip-hop songs ever, to \\"Blood Money - Put 'Em in Their Place\\" which is one of the worst things I've ever heard and make me have a different feeling about Mobb Deep. The only song I can listen to on this cd is Pearly Gates, Havoc was good on that one, didn't really like Prodigy, his rhymes were not his usual. And 50... surprisingly alright (though I don't like him... The Game fan..G-unot). So these are my resoults.

Its good to see it flopped sale-wise because it does not deserve to move many units.I gave it 2 stars because i don't mind \\"the Infamous\\" or \\"Put Them In Their Place\\" but apart from that the album is garbageIf you wanna hear a good Mobb Deep album go cop \\"The Infamous\\" ... avoid this album at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"I am not hating on Mobb Deep because I like them a lot and I have all their albums even \\"Juvenile Hell\\".

But what is the point in putting out an album that is this wack???? I can't beleieve these guys are still talking like they are hard. Didn't Prodigy get knocked out by keith murray twice? Which member was it that got his chain taken? My point is why are you still trying to portray yourself as \\"gangster\\" when it has been proven different numerous times. And you both are 5 foot 100 pounds dripping wet. LOL. This is comical. Then 50 got his hands on theses guys and really took them to the pits. ALL OF G UNIT SUCKS INCLUDING THE GAME.

There are numerous annoying typos, grammatical errors and word omissions. Sometimes information is listed that contradicts something just mentioned a sentence or two earlier. I can't recall ever reading such an unprofessionally written book. The photos look like they were made with a copier, and are difficult to see.

When an editor fails to find that glaring mistake, it's worse.One tends to lose faith in the stories of an author who obviously rushed to get a book to press, with apparent lack of interest in both the English language and a decent ghost story.Instead of this book, buy Ursula Bielski's \\"Chicago Haunts\\" and \\"More Chicago Haunts\\".

Since you do that, you have to use the workbook to figure out what you need to buy, etc. Plus, there are tons of black and white pictures of the people. They went overboard showing all their friends. It seems like a book someone in your neighborhood would put together. Not very professional. Plus, the recipes. I found ONE recipe in the book that sounded good.

Perhaps the sub-title, \\"Growing Up in Sports\\" is a bit misleading, though it is appropriate. This book is about sports, but mostly about growing up, and in turn looking back on a life well-lived.McKean, a polished poet, is quite the stylist as an essayist. His words flow oh so smoothly. His insights are tremendous. Whether talking about basketball, visiting an injuried Vietnam War veteran classmate, returning to Italy, growing up in Tacoma, playing for a volatile, yet loveable assistant coach, McKean doesn't miss a beat here.Certainly one of the best books I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"McKean's Got Bounce","review":"Home Stand is a remarkable autobio, written with the unimpassioned look of a biographer and the heart of a poet. He creates absolutely no artifice as he takes the reader through his story.

This is a must read for all lovers of basketball and all lovers of the finely-written literary piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Discovery","review":"A friend emphatically recommended this album to me knowing that I am a relative new-comer to the Electronic/Trance genre. I was really pleased with this dreamy, eclectic, edgy and elegant sampling of songs. In fact, it played on repeat for several hours and I was amazed at it's range and beauty. It flawlessly moves between hard beats, middle eastern infusions, tech-y industrial sound and lilting rhythms. I look forward to expanding my musical palette with Mortal Loom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional Electronic Music with Depth!","review":"I just got this new CD, Addicted to the Tragedy, and it's amazing! \\"Electronic\\" does not do it justice - it's got Trance, GOA, mystical elements, and Chris & Cosey!

Originally released as 'Hot Rats', 'Waka/Jawaka' and 'The Grand Wazoo', these 3 albums represent a distinct period of departure from the otherwise lyrical offerings of the '60s. John Luc Ponty and Sugar Cane Harris deliver some great electric violin solos here. And, their presence here (on Hot Rats) underscores the new band line-up. Recently, I searching my Zappa collection to find some examples of his music for my somewhat conservative boss and ended up with 2 of these 3. I would have given 5 stars but I could not speak for the quality of this particular release although The music - composition, performance and production - is top notch."},{"rating":"2","title":"DEFINITELY some of Frank's best work","review":"If you don't own this music, you should. This is some of the best work of one of the most original artists of our time.At the same time, it should be understood that these are re-releases, and there is no original material here. The Zappa Family Trust are simply finding new ways to market old Zappa. There's nothing wrong with that. I'm all in favor of anything that will help keep Frank's material shaking up the air molecules. But I already own Hot Rats, Waka-Jawaka, and The Grand Wazoo. If you do too, there's no reason to buy this box set.That's the only thing keeping me from giving this 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 bad things about this game after 30 minutes of play","review":"Instead of being called \\"The Longest Journey\\" it should be called \\"The Longest Install\\". This 4 disk program was the slowest to install game I've ever seen. It must have took 30 minutes to do a complete install.Once I started playing, I was shocked at the profanity. It seemed so out of place. The profanity didn't add anything to the gameplay.The third thing that I didn't like was the Lesbian land lord at the main character's apartment. I didn't want to hear how fulfilled she was with her female lover.This game looks like just a nice adventure game but it's pushing a hidden agenda.I've only played this game for about 30 minutes and it has already become obvious that this game is not appropriate for children.It's too bad that you can't even play a computer game without the [...] agenda being slipped in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loooooonngest, most tedius Journey","review":"Cool graphics, but it's so tedious and contrived that it feels like it's taking forever!

Chill","review":"The individual from Provo gives TLJ just one star, claiming it \\"isn't wholesome.\\" Leaving aside the fact that this is the best adventure game I've played in years, with great characters and a story worthy of the fantasy/sci-fi masters, I want to address this charge. I will certainly grant that there is profanity in the game, though not really all that much; more importantly, to say it isn't \\"wholesome\\" isn't to say it's immoral. After all, J. R. R. Tolkien was a devout Catholic, but LOTR is far from \\"wholesome.\\" I wouldn't put TLJ on a par with Tolkien's masterwork, but like LOTR, it offers a compelling portrait of both good and evil, and along the way it makes a strong case that the purpose of art is to communicate truth. This is a far higher and greater thing than the tame white-bread ambition to be \\"wholesome.\\" As a gamer, I recommend this game without question or reservation, because it's fantastic; as a pastor, I also recommend it, because it will make you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Loved It!","review":"I love adventure games like Myst, Riven, Journeyman, and others. When I read the reviews of The Longest Journey, I knew I would enjoy it. What I found was a game that kept me in the seat for hours. I couldn't stop playing. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys 3rd person adventure games and who loves the above titles!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Adventuring Treat","review":"The Longest Journey far surpassed my expectations. This is a highly immersive game that will draw you in and leave you wanting more! The animation is very good, excellent artwork, the music and especially the voice acting were truly superb. Like all adventure games there will be times when you will probably need to consult a FAQ as there are a couple of puzzles that are abstract if you don't get the backround on them before attemtping to solve them. All in all a very enjoyable game and I am looking forward to the upcoming sequal \\"Dreamfall\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"I tried running this game on a PC with Windows XP and it worked, except the graphics were splotchy (for example, her clothing was invisible so all I saw was a head, hands and feet) and the saved games wouldn't load.

I must have forgotten to look at the rating when I bought it because I ended up throwing the game away after hearing the F-word over 20 times.

I read previous reviews about it's graphics, which are good however the content is not. It has a lot of profantity and touts adult situations that do not reflect good christian values. If you are a parent don't get this software for your child since it is written as entertainment but is really a reflection of the writers morals, ethics and mindset. I bought this software thinking that it was a good adventure like the kinda kooky Syberia which was actually fun. This is not fun and doesn't reflect wholesomeness.

I cant wait for the next one which is Dreamfall: The Longest Journey"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely great!","review":"I started to play this game about four months ago and I was hooked until it finished (and that was a lot of days afterwards). The game really starts quite simple, just a normal day of a \\"future\\" girl, but some things are strange, REALLY strange... And then it just gets more and more complicated, with the story evolving on every step......it is really a fantasy experiance of your life!BUY IT! IT\`S WORTH EVERY PENNY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for adults","review":"\\"The Longest Journey\\" has a wonderfully engaging story, and characters you care a great deal about. I did almost nothing but play this game for weeks. However, there were times when I really needed to look up hints, because some puzzles were either too complex or obtuse to figure out. Also, the language can be quite strong at times. Still, I am looking forward to the sequel, whenever that comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only disappointment were some of the reviews","review":"I had a great time with this game, though I admit I had to consult a walkthrough to get past certain obstacles, but that just meant it was challenging to me, and that's what I want. The graphics were good but not the greatest and the amount of dialogue is tremendous. The story is a bit convoluted but to me it made it all the more immersive, interesting.The game has a \\"Mature\\" rating, so it puzzles me why I read so many negative reviews about the game being \\"obscene\\" or that it had a \\"hidden agenda\\" since there were lesbian (minor) characters and mix race couples featured. Personally I found that feedback more offensive than the occasional f*** I heard on the game...One of the best inventory based games I've played, and overall probably the best game I've played in years. Very creative and engaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best game I played after Myst saga!","review":"I loved the story. I tell you right now it has a lot of information to follow and understand the story and game. April ( the main character) has to listen from a lot of wise people to get the puzzles and the situation solved. I didn't have a problem with that. If you played Myst saga, you learned how to be patient and take advantage of everything. And listen. And read a lot. This is a game of patient. The puzzles are not difficult but you won't solve fast. It's about the story and the solution. So be patient. Although I mentioned Myst, it's not like it all the way. But as in Myst, you have to listen to get the clues, to know where to go. You have to read information. So if you thought Myst was boring, don't get this one. April is a student who finds she's a shifter between worlds. This one and another one. And she will find out her destiny because of her gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one takes a while... which is okay by me.","review":"I have not finished this game yet. The conversations are unending. Much of the information in those conversations is interesting, but unnecessary to continue game play. Hitting the \\"Esc\\" key interupts and ends the conversations until it boils the questions down to the basic ones that are essential. These will remain available. The others will disappear.Third person graphics are okay, but I've seen better. Plenty of scenes, however.Storyline is pretty decent as well.Puzzles range from simple to \\"too much disconnected thinking\\" involved.While some might not like the length of this game, I found it an asset. I sort of felt like I was getting my money's worth. On this game, I like to avoid walkthroughs and keep it going as much as possible on my own.Running Windows XP, the game locked up twice. After a few retries, I managed to shoot through these hang-up points and continue on without too much trouble.Overall, nice game, worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good game for the patient","review":"Reading through these reviews, I felt like I just had to make my first amazon review ever, because I really liked this game. Yes, there are endless stretches of dialogue, which can be boring at times, but that's because the story runs deep and the characters are developed (for once). Also, the extra dialogue buries the key information in normal-sounding conversations, unlike other games where you know exactly what you need to do because you go to the only place the other character mentioned and use the only item they mentioned.TLJ is the the only computer game I've ever played where I felt I learned something about real life by playing it. So, yes, it is boring in places, but overall, I think it's totally worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth it","review":"I purchased this game as an impulse buy - I came to buy a different game and happened to click on this one out of curiosity. I'm glad I did; this is one of the best adventure games I have played in a long time.The storyline is epic, the execution grand; the graphics are beautiful, the voices well done, the script is excellent. The characters respond quite realistically, given their circumstances. The puzzles are good, almost all of which you can work out given sufficient thought (and remembering the credo: try to pick up everything!). There are enough plot twists to keep you guessing and keep you interested. This is one of those games which I almost couldn't stop playing long enough to go to work or to sleep, I was that much into it.My only complaint is that the ending seems a little too abrupt, leaving too many things dangling -- but then I guess that's also why I'm waiting so eagerly for TLJ2 to be released :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't really like this one","review":"I had heard such great things about this game but in all reality I found it very boring. WAY too much talk, most of it irrelevant. I finished the game, but skipped most of the really bad dialogue. I would recommend Syberia and Syberia II instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unstable and lame...","review":"This seemed like a good game at first but later it became clear that it's more like a boring movie. Conversations are SOOOO LONG that I wanted to tear out my hair - and I like the more story-oriented games; but this is waaay too much. It starts out pretty interestingly but slumps down quickly and never returns. Graphics and music are really good (that's why I gave 2 stars instead of 1.)The game is also unbelivably unstable - it crashed so many times that I stopped counting after 50. I must admit, I haven't finished it yet, so it may even turn into the best games ever evetually, but since it crashes all the time, I just don't see that happening. The patch is worthless, I couldn't even get it to install (I'm not sure if I have the latest version and cannot find out.)Avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Longest Journal -- er, I mean Journey!","review":"I'll make this short: This game is BORING! It has nice graphics, a so-so storyline, lots of unnecessary cussing/VULGAR language, and WAY TOO MUCH DIALOG!!! I can't tell you what the ending is, because I'm only halfway done and ready to fall asleep. SAVE YOUR MONEY! (I only paid [...] and it's not worth that!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"My suggestion - buy Syberia instead","review":"I didn't really like this game much. I found it rather too verbose, frustratingly verbose and boring. There is so much mindless blabber to wade your way through, and wade your way through you must as the clues are all in the speech.But worst of all was the ending which made a complete mockery of the entire quest and left me feeling drained and depressed.I say forget this game and buy Syberia instead, which I found so much more interesting and fun to play."},{"rating":"1","title":"No pause on the dialogue","review":"I was really looking forward to this game. The first hour was great... graphics are cool, April has witty, sharp biting things to say, then characters kept talking and talking and talking. And once they start you can't pause until they are done. I missed a big chunk of one explanation because the phone was ringing. (you can look in your dialogue log after) And the puzzles are way too easy. I wouldn't even call them puzzles, rather simple tasks to get you to the next long conversation. The story is pretty cool, I might keep playing just to see where it goes, but don't think of this as a game, think of it as a long movie where you get to click the mouse every once in a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicting","review":"I absolutely love this game. The Longest Journey is by far one of the best games out there if you are into great graphics, puzzles and good dialog (sometimes profane and a bit too much). I am literally addicted to this game. You don't have to worry about dying therefore you can take your time to search around and enjoy the two worlds. I found this game to run smoothly without any graphic or audio hiccups. Other games I would recommend that follow this same style game play are Syberia and Beyond Atlantis. Don't pass this game up! You won't regret playing it; in fact you'll probably turn around and play it a couple times a year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent adventure game","review":"As many have already said, this is a great adventure game because of the story. The characters are well-developed, so much so that by the end of the game you will find yourself with an emotional investment in them. This is a true rarity for any pc game, not just an adventure game. I was reminded of the feeling I get after finishing a well-written novel. You feel as though you know the characters and, in a way, you don't want the story to end.Admittedly, some portions of the game feature long sequences of dialogue, but they are worth the investment of your time. The story and the characters will get under your skin. The game is worth twice the discounted price it now sells for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carafe BREAKS,","review":"Carafe BREAKS, have replaced 2 in the past year, it's not me -it's the carafe!! spend your money on another model or different brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"GATE CMOS","review":"GATE ANALYSIS OF CHANGES OF FREQUENCY X AXIS GATE OUTPUT.

However, if you have some experience and are looking for a DVD that can give you a bit more assistance with getting down the basics of riding such as braking, cornering and so, this is not it.

Overall, his tempos were almost too brisk. One got the impression that he was trying to prove that he could play very quickly.In addition, his registrations were rather bizarre. For example, in the Prelude and Fugue in e (Cathedral), while the echoe effect of the fugue was intriguing, the prelude far from conveyed the majestic quality of the writing. The registration was thin and whiny.Perhaps the biggest disappointment was the Passacaglia and Fugue. This piece seemed to suffer particularly from Mr. Newman's registrations and tempo. Schizophrenic would be the word that comes to mind when describing it.I give this album two stars, only because Mr. Newman played all the notes acurately.

Being the sort of person I am( in my mind I can fix anything) I preceded with a length of 1 inch black pipe and a 3 lb sledge to try and make the brace wide enough to fit the bikes frame. Let me tell you, these things are tough. After beating the snot out of them, they fit perfect. 30 years ago the training wheels I bought could just be bent with your hands, not these. They would not fit out of the box, that was a slight minus, but to me just a challange. I am giving them the highest rating, because they are just so darn tough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy Training Wheels","review":"The problem I had with other training wheels is that they were not sturdy enough to last very long. So, I ordered 2 sets of Wald Training Wheels for both my kids. They are extremely sturdy, however the horizontal stabilizer bars were too thick to work on our bikes. I had to purchase two $8 sets of training wheels from WalMart to get the right size stabilizers. This modification, plus the addition of 2 metal clamps per bike ($1.25 ea) to hold the stabilizers in place, made them great! Even with the additional $21 for modifications, the price was still much less than other training wheels.

Assembly was easy, unfortunately the secure/brace bracket cut-out was not big enough to fit around the bar of my sons bike so I had to hammer them to fit, which scratched the paint off.

I figure it's a boys Mongoose bike and for the price of the bike it will be in a lot worse shape when he's done riding it than worrying about the paint that got scratched off from hammering the brackets in place.

He is riding up and down the quiet street in front of his house (usually with grandma tagging along behind) he is gaining confidence and riding much faster than at first.

The first half of this moviwe is not that good. The only real funny moment is provided by veteran Gangster film actor Pat O'brien playing Reynolds's painter obsessed father (\\"Last time you got up from that chair it was on fire\\"). But once Reynolds is committed to the loony bin for attempted suicide and he meets Deluise the film really comically takes off like a jet plane. Best scenes are the one where Deluise tries to help Reynolds jump off a high building and the climatic last scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"The End (VHS)","review":"This item was received promptly and was very well packaged. I am very satisfied with this item and will be a repeat buyer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Funny Side Of Death","review":"I have been a long time fan of Burt Reynolds, I have most of his works in my movie library. This movie had me laughing during the entire movie. Death isn't met to be funny, but he pulls no punches in the script. Robbie Benson did a 1st class job as the juvenile priest, Dom Delusise was classic as the lawyer, and patient. Overall this movie even though death is sad it is also a way to stay positive even in the worst situation. This movie is a must for any fan of Burt Reynolds."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Like Walt Disney Threw Up","review":"What can you say about a flick that pokes funs at death, suicide, schizophrenia, and the priesthood? Funny as all get out. Something of a departure for director-star Burt Reynolds this dark comedy goes down smooth despite the topics that are lampooned here. Possible reasons maybe Reynolds' easy going manner that we can forgive him for making light of the unforgivable. Co-star Dom DeLuise is absolutely brilliant as Reynolds' schizophrenic roommate at the insane asylum. DeLuise's performance pulls out all stops that you forget that you should be offended except so darned hilarious. On a final note my wife was laughing herself hysterically until Deluise spouted out a series of Polish jokes. There's some irony in this."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"P\\": IN YOUR PANTS FROM LAUGHING TIME!!!!!!","review":"This IS one THE classics along with \\"Young Frankenstein,\\" \\"Blazing Saddles,\\" \\"Texas Across the River,\\" and ALL of the hilarious older movies.When you're feeling down, pop this in your DVD player or VHS player and brighten up your mood."},{"rating":"1","title":"BACK TO THE BLENDER","review":"we love Dave (and Kelly). got 'em all, but this remix just dont make it!it should be thrown in the blender, turned on high and then down the drain. sorry Dave."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful feel-good book.","review":"This book will put you in the Christmas mood in July.

This is not your typical algebra textbook.Bolker focuses on mathematical modeling. The level is appropriate for college algebra and below (with some modification). There are more than enough problems to pick and choose from. Nearly one third of the book explores linear models and then goes on to exponential, quadratic, and some trigonometry. The emphasis on linear and exponential models is especially useful since those functions express two fundamental types of growth - by a constant amount or by a constant factor.Bolker also discusses necessary skills along the way, including estimation and calculator use, scientific notation, systems of equations, logarithms. Highly recommended as a reference for math teachers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true comedy masterpiece!!!!...","review":"This is what a comedy movies are all about, but don't be fooled; it surprisingly takes you through a range of emotions.

I absolutely love this movie..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Movie ever?","review":"After having seen many Gene Wilder movies as a child and recalling they generally were funny I acquired a few of them recently for my collection. While \\"See no evil Hear no evil\\" generally disappointed it certainly had its moments - unfortunately the same cannot be said about this movie. It was poorly acted, slapstick, pie-throwing humour which anyone with more than 6 years in school would find utterly depressing.There were not even 3 partly amusing scenes or jokes and the continued return to the movie director beating up his assistant while his management team sweet talked him was among the absolute low points. It is not clear to me who the target audience was for this movie when it was created - and an excuse could be if it was meant for 3-7 year olds... otherwise humour has certainly changed since these days...If the scale made it possible to give negative number of stars this would have been a prime candidate. Dont see it .. even if someone offers you money to do so!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you people serious? I think you need to see it again now that you're older","review":"For some reason I do remember seeing this film as a kid, and I thought it was great. But now, seeing it again, I don't know, I think it's really kinda dumb. I can't remember what the appeal was back then. Maybe it was because I thought Carol Kane was hot. And Gene Wilder was still kinda popular at that time.Try watching this again, believe me, it's not so great. I should have rented this dumb thing first."},{"rating":"2","title":"General recommendation for this maker","review":"I have 3 Sabrina Silver chains, though not this particular style, two of which I've worn 24/7 for a couple of years.

It's so bad I even get a rash on my tummy from prolonged contact with metal buttons on jeans.

There are great commanders on both sides such as Fabius, Marcelus, Sempronius and Scipio on Roman and Hannibal, Hasdrubal and Hanno on Carthaginian side.There are many details in book and every year is described on about 50 pages.

The laser focus of her brilliant talent was never before realized on film to this degree. Also, she had gained tremendous personal confidence due to the unprecedented audience response to the concerts she had done between her MGM films and ASIB. The love with which the live audience embraced her, brought new heights to her acting as well.The production values of the film were top of the line and it shows on this fine CD. It's a chance to experience Judy's talent on a more intimate basis without the visuals.A must-have for every serious Garland collector."},{"rating":"2","title":"what can I say...","review":"is the soundtrack of the best musical ever made to this day.... a must have!

It meanders all over the place, with no dates so you're often left to guess the chronology. Occasional reminiscences about bygone missionaries, their wives, church bells and so on. Not a travel book by any means. Although to be fair, the parts about flying boats and tropical diseases were quite interesting. If you are interested in the South Pacific, I'd reccomend as light fare \\"The Sex Lives of Cannibals: Adrift in the Equatorial Pacific\\" by J.

Edgar Hoover and John Foster Dulles. Where oh where are the good old days of the Cold War when we could blame all of our ills on the Reds at home and abroad? For the rest of us, this is a unique and fascinating personal account of someone who honorably stood up to all the forces against him, tells the unvarnished truth about one our darkest time, and reained his humor and wit while beating back the bad guys (plus the studio bosses). It reads like a riveting suspense story. You will turn the pages late into the night, wanting to know what comes next, how he won his personal war, wrote and produced some twenty of your favorite films, and never forgot to tell an entertaining story. Read and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A page-turner that is also history!","review":"Gordon's book, Hollywood Exile, combines tales of movie stars (Rita Hayworth, Ava Gardner, David Niven), the fierce political 'hangings' of the American blacklist (Gordon, a screenwriter begining his career, was both a victim of and a witness to this terrible scene), and, until now, the unwritten history of American writers, producers, actors and directors--temporary expatriots who fled the blacklist into France, England and Spain to work at their craft. Gordon landed in Madrid's mini-Hollywood. He tells witty, inside stories of scripting and producing such classics as 'Horror Express' and 'Day of the Triffids'. Moreover, he is an honorable man who did not turn in his principles as so many did. You won't be able to put the book down and you'll feel glad that such people survived that American crucible to write about it and its sequel in Europe for all of us who were not there.

The book is set in the modern era, in Russia, yes. But it deals with people who do not live in the same world we, the reader, do. It's a different world with different laws and regulations, different customs, different dangers. And it's a world that feels very intensely real.The characters are broadly sketched but individual, and moral quandries are thick on the ground-- not obviously at first, but more and more so as the book progresses. What seems to be a black and white divide between \\"good\\" and \\"evil,\\" between \\"light\\" and \\"dark,\\" becomes more and more shaded grey as events unfold.It's a book of explosions, frustration, desperate attempts at saving the world, and morality.

Based on those responses I bought both books and was sorely disappointed. Be warned, this IS a translation, and not infrequently the translational errors are so bad as to be funny.Translations are not the best form to critique a book from, but not knowing Russian... ANYWAY, the books' premise will not surprise anyone who has read the Anita Blake books or the like; good versus evil, a bit of metaphysics, brought together in a modern urban environment. So far so good, but the writing, plotting, characterization and so on seemed, well, simple-minded, pretentious, or just,(sorry), juvenile. The books are not truly novels either, but rather a collection of novellas, the sort of surprise I dislike. I could not believe that books reviewed so highly could be so bad.

I'm a horror guy, and the fact that it was \\"light vs. dark\\" sounded intriguing.I got into the story pretty quickly. I won't go into a summary, you can read that somewhere else. What I loved, though, was the amazing imagery. This book--I assume the whole series--really lets you paint your own vivid picture of what's going on. It describes things in great detail, but still leaves the scene open to your imagination. The story could have sped up a bit; I felt that with the time he had, the author could have expanded the story a bit. But there's two more books to do that, so I'm not too upset about it.Overall a great read.

I found the other two parts just as good and it really made me enjoy the movie even more. All in all a very good book and a very fast read, I'll definately read it again and I can't wait until Day Watch comes out in January!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gritty modern fantasy","review":"This book is a fine example of modern fantasy, where a magical world meshes with the gritty urban setting. The translation feels seamless to me, and modern Moscow is both realistic and exotic to a Westerner. The story follows humans with magical abilities who must choose to serve Light or Dark; and the Watches, Day and Night, that enforce the perilous truce between the two. It's full of intrigue and counter-plots, but being a thoroughly Russian book, it is mostly about Good and Evil with big fat capitals and being a modern Russian book, things are not exactly black and white."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stick With It","review":"As some of the other reviewers have stated, the translation is not great and appears to have been done by an English-As-A-Second-Language interpreter. However, once you get used to it, this book is hard to put down. The stories are spell-binding and addictive. Do not read it for poetic prose, but for the plot, characters, surprises, and suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Night Watch a fun fantasy novel","review":"I whipped thru this book really quickly, it was a fun read with a Russian backdrop that was really dark and interesting.

Lukyanenko's style is most defiantly Russian, like his 19th century counterpart Dostoevsky, Night Watch is dark, funny and fatalistic. If you are expecting a novel with easy answers, and well defined heros, Lukyanenko is not for you. The characters, and division of powers are morally ambiguous, and leave you wondering, who really are the good guys? It is a good literary reflection of the postmodern anti-hero, and how this Western philosophy is developing in post cold-war Russia. While I don't agree with the authors underlying world view, I still greatly appreciate his creative talents. I look forward to reading Day Watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing","review":"One of the best books I have read in a long, long time. I found myself connecting with the characters on a level I haven't felt in years. I could not stop thinking about the concepts laid down by the author about the boundary between good and evil.

(I am thinking of \\"In Search of Arthur's Britain,\\" which described the 1967 South Cadbury dig.)You will learn the truth about the earliest Robin Hood stories - he was a yeoman, not a nobleman or a peasant, his earliest haunt was Barnsdale, not Sherwood. There was no Maid Marian at first, etc.An excellent book for British history buffs and English lit types."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great research and outstanding writer","review":"Professor Holt has done an outstanding job with this book. I've had this book long before Amazon.com came into existence and was thrilled to see it listed here. Holt's meticulous research into Robin Hood has been referenced by numerous other authors and researchers into Robin Hood, yeoman archers, and life in Medieval and Tudor England. Holt has persuaded a fair number of very intelligent researchers in their assessments of who Robin Hood was and his status as a yeoman. I've had this book since 1991, with worn pages and all, yet I still can't put it down. Highly recommended. Like one of the other persons who gave it 5 stars, I give it a 10 stars. * * * * * * * * * *"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kazowie","review":"What a fresh sound.

It is 40 minutes long. There is a new remastered version, with extra tracks and bonus CD that is a Bruford infomercial.On the original LP, the two sides were completely different. Side A was a waste, and Side B was OK. It is all piano and drum music.The music on side A is peppy little ditties. Some of it sounds like circus music, other parts like what would be in a rodeo or for a Western movie. It's all just a bunch of silly inconsequential bits. Maybe something you would hear at a childrens concert.Things are better on the second side. There are some nice little drum solos from Bruford and piano solos from Moraz. Then there some very good discordant piano/drum duets.I bought the new remastered version of this CD based on the rave reviews given on Amazon. I am not too happy about it.Be warned, that most of the CD is not what you would expect from Moraz, and mostly not like what Bruford has done before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"Seriously, this is a classic!

That guy Rocco can PLAY! He just doesn't do it on this album. Besides swing low, every song is the same whiny 14 year old girl BS that every other band on the radio sounds like. What a waste of talent. Save yourself the money and just listen to any other whiny non-original music that has dominated the \\"rock\\" stations for the past 5 years. I thought I was going to hear a more blues/rock kind of stuff but they are exactly like everyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing new or original","review":"I have tried to give this cd a chance because of all the great reviews. I have listened to it in different places, moods, and came back to it again and again hoping that it would grow on me. However, do not buy this cd - it will be wasted money. It is less than average. I would rather take a chance picking a cd blindly out of a used box of cd's. The music is bland at best, has no originality, and I can only conclude that the great reviews are from friends of the band. Or as the reviews would suggest, K. S. fans.

The video may be remastered but the audio quality is poor and one has to turn up the volume to listen to the dialogue which makes the scary scenes even more so.

The opening sequence, displaying superb use of Disney Studios' Multi-Plane Camera, is worth the price of the DVD alone.The 53-minute documentary, \\"The Making of Bambi\\", goes far deeper than ever before in showing how difficult it was to get \\"Bambi\\" released during a time of world war and union strikes, and how people of the day did not appreciate this masterpiece in the way it would later be embraced for all time.As mentioned in books and on the VHS releases, Walt Disney himself considered \\"Bambi\\" his \\"personal favorite\\".

It has been completely revitalized and the audio has been given the \\"enhanced home theater\\" treatment which means you can watch it in a great new 5.1 mix or a restored version of the original mono soundtrack.

The DVD version of Beauty and The Beast has the same \\"plus\\" which actually killed the dark mood of the film. In Bambi's case, the bright colours gave it a more kiddish feel to it - the colours almost cartoonish instead of that rich realism we get from the origonal. But then that's just my preference.

For instance, we have Stevie Nicks singing seven wonders and gypsy, Christine McVie singing songbird, and so on.One of the big reasons why I got into Fleetwood Mac was the fact that over the years, I slowly became aware of the various voices and tones of the songs.Although I'm pleased that many favorable songs are in this collection like don't stop, go your own way, little lies, skies the limit, and hold me. However, other songs like say you will, and peacekeeper are not included in this collection.

To truly be called The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac, you would have to include at least, Black Magic Woman, Oh Well, Sentimental Lady and Hypnotized. There are many more quintessential songs from the pre-Buckingham/Nicks era that should be included, but those four were in heavy FM rotation in the early 70's. They exposed the band to a huge audience, which made their commercial breakthrough in 1975 possible. To exclude them and then title this release a \\"best of\\" is criminal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous Collection","review":"In case anyone is wondering, there was a Fleetwood Mac before the Buckingham/Nicks era, although you'd never know it from this collection.

One of those two tunes was a studio version of \\"Big Love\\" rather than the live version on this CD. I took the studio version from the Fleetwood Mac Greatest Hits CD. The other tune was \\"Diane\\", a fifties-sounding tune that didn't chart in the US but went to No. 9 in the UK. I downloaded that from iTunes.The tracks on this CD seemed to be generally compressed, something that doesn't always make me happy. There also could have been better volume balancing within some tracks, and some of the fade outs seemed a bit long.My impression of Fleetwood Mac was definitely increased after reviewing their tunes.

With 36 songs on 2 cd's not much missing on here except I would have included the live version of Oh Well (Lindey Buckingham on vocals) and taken off What Makes You Think Tour The One, but would'nt really change anything else. A real plus was the inclusion of the full Length version of Sara and Silver Springs. I would have to totally agree with previous reviewer that we need a best of early years to get Oh Well, Hypnotized, Black Magic Woman (actually a Mac tune, Santana more well known for it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great collection of 1975-1997 Fleetwood Mac!!!

All the tracks have been digitally remasterd, which not only means that Lindsey and Stevie sond crisper than ever, but Christine's voice is finally captured in all its glory. The addition of three live Buckingham tracks is quite a plus, particually \\"I'm so afraid\\". As usal, I have some complaints. How did \\"everywhere\\" and \\"say you love me\\" get in here? Recorded, they don't sound very good. I know they were hits but... Couldn't the versions from the dance be substituted?

There is enough great Fleetwood Mac material to fill at least 2 CDs -- but for some reason they included many bad versions of really bad songs (they don't have many bad songs after all) and left off many graet ones. Where is Angel (their best song) and we certainly don't need the live version of Lindsay Buckingham ruining I'm So Afraid. And how could they include the really bad obnoxious live version of Big Love? It is horrible. Since when is What Makes You Think You're The One the best of Fleetwood Mac - IT IS TERRIBLE. The live version of Go Insane is unlistenable (and isn't even a Fleetwood Mac song!!!!!) Other bad songs include: World Turning, Family Man (one of their worst songs), As Long As You Follow, No Questions Asked, and Skies The Limit are really really really BAD. This should have been awesome instead it is very very mediocre and unlistenable at times.

This is the album that contains most of Fleetwood Mac's best songs. There is \\"Rhiannon\\" that features Stevie Nicks on lead vocals. Go Your Own Way, Dreams,The Chain, Don't Stop and most of their best music. Beside defining 70's hit radio, they were highly influential. You can hear how the next generation of people were influenced by their songwriting style.

His condition seems to have come as a complete surprise on one level. On another level, he was right there.Warren Zevon has been one of the most literary of song writers; a close reading of his lyrics is always worth the extra effort. And whether he's trying to pull you in for a ride on a crazy merry-go-round leading you for a grasp at the cynical brass ring, or coming straight for your soul with a bullet of pure \\"Empty Handed Heart\\" feeling, he's always had the goods.Warren has long history of collaborative song writing, and in My Ride's Here he's dialoging with some great writers on what's coming up soon for him, and only a little later for the rest of us. Grace and humor under pressure. Start here and work your way back through the catalog; you can't go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"A comfortable listen for Zevon fans.","review":"Zevon fans probably will like this album as Warren once again stretches himself and his music. But I don't think they will particularly love this album. I've listened to Zevon since the 70's, and in that time I've heard really good stuff and some stuff that well... wasn't. This album reminds me a great deal of my favorites - Mr. Bad Example and Sentimental Hygiene. A couple of good love-lost songs, a good story song and some stuff about as far away from \\"Werewolves\\" as one can get. But it doesn't have a song like Piano Fighter that was just down right enjoyable or the raw energy and zest of Transverse City. This is one album where the whole is greater than the parts, I think.

Sure, David Letterman's vocal turn on the song is a little distracting, but, hey, Letterman has done more to keep Zevon in the spotlight (via his obvious passion for his music) than anyone since Jackson Browne, circa 1976.Other songs, including the rockin' \\"Basket Case,\\" and the wistful \\"I'm Leavin'\\" continue the classic Zevon tradition of catchy tunes combined with hardboiled lyrics.If you're a Zevon fan, pick this one up.

As an overall composition, the album excels where even Excitable Boy failed (don't let happy nostalgia forgive \\"Nighttime at the Switching Yard\\" or \\"Tenderness on the Block\\"), in that the entire album is just that good.Stronger points include the goof ball anthem of Hit Somebody, the neurotic, spooky \\"Whole Different Person when you're scared\\" (a great song to blair when your driving an empty freeway at 4 in the morning) and the almost-out-of-place but still stirring, \\"Genius.\\" But without a doubt in my mind, the title track bests them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"nu shooz -","review":"this is an excellent cd that came out in the late eighties. the album was a bit of a rare hard to get vinyl the cd is a must have for any mucis collector. should i say yes is still the great favourite and all tracks are excellent listening. highly recommended cd. a great piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Picture Perfect Prescription","review":"This is really a good book for people that want to know how to eat healthy and the foods that are good for your body.

The Japanese taiko is absent to the marjority of tracks (you really have to listen hard to find any). The traditional and progressive taiko of past albums is lost to forien rythems. It disapoints me to see Kodo leave its traditional rythmic roots; the reason I and I am sure most others have enjoyed listing for many years now; the pure fusion of traditional Japanese taiko in modern times.I would suggest any other Kodo album above Mondo head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mondo Head","review":"As a devotee and lover of taiko music I awaited the release of Kodo's newest CD for months. Kodo has ventured in this release away from the traditional sounds of taiko into a genre that is many types of African, Middle Eastern, and other drumming forms.I was sadly disappointed. I hope that Kodo returns to what brought them into the forefront of taiko drumming in it's timed honored traditions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody forgot to write the music!","review":"Even the simplest Jazz tune starts with a \\"head\\" (melody) which the group plays before it blasts off into improvisation.

I'm not and I find this to be a real waste of the Kodo drummer's talents. Many groups could have drummed on this disc, for the talent required of this music it really doesn't take Kodo drummers. What's more upseting is that they're responsible for writing all the music. It's just pop, and if you like pop then you can do worse, but if you're into world music, please try anything else in the Kodo repertoire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real fussion world music !!!","review":"Mondo head from Kodo is a real world drums experience.It is an excellent combination of sounds, tones, percusion and musical harmony.

I wanted to buy an mp3 player ($300) in February, and I had the money, but thought the player would go down in price by the time of my birthday. Money has a way of slipping away without me noticing... I once spent $100 in 2 weeks without noticing. I set the clock to open in 5 months after I stuck $300 in there. Opened right on my birthday, and by then, the price of the mp3 player dropped to $250. Kept me from spending the cash early, either on another product or a higher priced mp3 player.

However, after on eplay, I will probably never play the game again.I am a big fan of the pc game and assumed I would be able to play the board game with little difficulty. However, there were just so many issues. First, the instructions are pathetic. It lists game pices that don't even exist. For example. It told me I could build chariots, but there are no chariots included in the game. Second, trying to keep cities and improvements in order was confusing and usually got messed up during game play.If you are thinking of purchasing this game, don't bother.

They had a look of a grunge band before grunge was popular and they wore no cheesy spandex or make up.I would compare them to a more poetic version of Guns n Roses. This album is probably the greatest of 1989 and one of the greatest of 80s metal period. songs like \\"18 and Life\\" and \\"I Remember you\\" are great melodic songs but the song that is worth waiting for is \\"Youth gone wild \\" it is the ultimate party song. So damn it quit complaining about the 80s and buy this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"80's HAIR BAND","review":"WHAT CAN YOU SAY ABOUT THIS GROUP OTHER THAN TOTALLY DYNAMITE.

Most of the talk about it was that \\"Youth Gone Wild\\", \\"18 And Life\\", & \\"I Remember You\\" were so great. Well, they are. It seems that the rest of the album was overlooked. For a first record, this is excellent. \\"I Remember You\\" is one of the best ballads EVER. Everyone I know loves that song. \\"18 And Life\\" & \\"Youth Gone Wild\\" are songs that troubled youth (at the time) could recognize with. \\"Big Guns\\", \\"Sweet Little Sister\\", \\"Can't Stand The Heartache\\", \\"Piece Of Me\\", & \\"Rattlesnake Shake\\" are great tunes. \\"Here I Am\\" & \\"Makin' A Mess\\" are just fancy filler. \\"Midnight/Tornado\\" is a good way to end a album, even if it's not the greatest tune.

I remember having this one on cassette when it first came out. Some highlights are \\"18 & Life\\", \\"Youth Gone Wild\\", and especially \\"I Remember You\\". Sebastian Bach was a cool singer who probably gave the band more style than it would have had. Not to leave out the bass player with the nose ring to ear chain. The group is touring with KISS now, without Bach, so I don't know how it will sound. I would have rather got to see them with Sebastian. He does have a solo album out though.

This is great for parties, or anything really. My favorite is probably \\"I Remember You\\". Bach is so good at what he does that in recent years he performs on Broadway!

Also, the center feels the same as the buttons, so in the more hectic dances you have no way of feeling where your feet are (with some of the more expensive pads, you can feel the buttons with your feet and know where you are).Still, I have no trouble with the responsiveness and didn't really see a soft pad that looked to be better.

This time I cracked open the circuit board and was able to verify that the board electronics were working but the pad refused to sense. Clearly Naki has some manufacturing bugs to work out.

Kon Kan delivers synth-pop like it should be from the era that made some of us who we are today. Kon Kan has a unique sound that stands out from other synth-pop bands. Great dance songs are: \\"I Beg Your Pardon (I Never Promised You a Rose Garden)\\", \\"Bite the Bullet\\", \\"Glue & Fire\\", \\"I Can't Answer That\\", \\"Arts' in D Minor/Harry Houdini\\".

First of all, this will not make you fluent in Spanish. I didn't really like the layout of the A+ Spanish program and did not find it very user-friendly. The digital speech analysis is useful, but it doesn't come with a headset (You'll have to purchase one). The games were repetitive and not \\"fun\\" in my opinion.

NO RESULTS, NO EXPLANATION.The \\"Kidde\\" website has no mention of radon test kits anywhere. If you do manage to find the website where you can input the kit number, it's under an entirely different company name, \\"Dr. Home Air,\\" which is different again from the company name in the mailing address!

One should take action if it gets above 4.0 !After the system was installed, the documentation showed it went below 4.0.The mitigation fan recently broke and didn't want to replace it because I painted / sealed my basement floor when I bought the house (false belief that would stop the radon).I followed the instructions and sent in this test. I got back a reading < 4.0 (not a risk) which I don't believe was right at all. I later bought a continuous radon monitor. After a few days I got my first reading from it (around 10.0) and it kept going up everyday.It was around 20.0 when I had the mitigation fan replaced and then watched the reading go back down day by day (took about 2 weeks to get to safe level again).Would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick, easy to use","review":"I found this kit quick and easy to use. I got back a very low radon result, which confirmed what we had found when we bought the house several years ago. The margin of error is high enough that I think if I had gotten a result on the edge I would have felt like I needed a more precise method and a retest, but for a clear-cut situation like ours, I think this kit was sufficient."},{"rating":"1","title":"The hype is great! Not much else!!","review":"The price you pay for this radon test apparently includes the test fee. But you are still required to pay postage. Apparently the post office has enough trouble delivering the envelope that the company has an announcement about you maybe wanting to use FedEx or UPS instead of the U.S. mail. When I mailed my package, sure enough, it came back 10 days later for postage, which maybe fell off during processing? I put more stamps on and remailed it. A few weeks later, I got a letter from the company saying the radon test was too old to process. But here's the kicker - no refund for the price I paid! They collect the entire fee up front - $16 or so, and then never have to do the test or report results. So that made me feel scammed. How many of us really has $16 to waste?My two cents worth. Here's what I know: My $16 is gone, and I know nothing about radon in my house.Christine"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kidde Radon Test Kit","review":"Waste of time... I followed the instructions for the Kidde Radon Test Kit and received my results in a reasonable amount of time via email. However, my lab result was a 5 with an accuracy range of +-5!!!

If I would have known that there was a +-5 accuracy range, I would not have bought it in the first place. I checked online and found that the leading consumer magazine ranked the Kidde Radon Test last out of all test kits.

It was funny as we rolled the trash can out to the curb.....we could hear the toy playing even then!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not practical","review":"The nice part about this toy is that it doesn't take much movement to activate the music, however the toy bar isn't very stable and seemed to hit my child in the face a lot.

With any luck, I'll be able to return it for something safer and more enjoyable. The tail does not stay up and that defeats the whole purpose of a play gym. If I had put my son under Tigger's arched tail, the toys would have smacked him right in the head as the tail repeatedly falls down!I have read other reviews about people complaining about the turtle playing loudly at the slightest movement. Mine must be broken because it doesn't play at all!(unless Disney changed the turtle after all the complaints? I don't know).I see that there is a website giving this item away as a free gift. That's about what I'd value it at."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very impressed","review":"I am not very impressed by this Disney toy. My daughter is 3 1/2 months and gets very agitated because Tigger's tail will not stay up where she can play. As soon as she hits at the toys hanging down the tail falls where she cannot see them or play. This causes aggravation for me because I have to constantly fix the tail so she can play again. Also, the turtle plays music very loudly and at the drop of a hat and I have not been able to find an off button for it. However, the Tigger is very cute and very huggable so maybe it will be better when she is older."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO GOOD","review":"This product is not a good buy!

The pictures made it look like something I could eventually prop the baby on and later on, he could have a big stuffed animal to play with. When I took the item out of the package, it was flat and flimsy. I thought there must be somewhere that you could at least stick a pillow in it to make it look like the Tigger that was advertised. There wasn't a place to stick a pillow. Because it was so flat, the tail was hard to keep upright. I wish I'd spent the money on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Like It Looks Like","review":"This is nothing like we thought it would be. It is WAY smaller than they make it look somehow for one. Two, the toys hang WAY to low. Right smack in baby's face because the doll is really flimsy and the tail just sags down.

I think I may try to return."},{"rating":"1","title":"cuter than it is practical","review":"We received this item as a gift for our son. I have to agree with 2 other reviews: Tigger's tail doesn't stay up as it should, (falls backward, as though the toys make it too heavy). Also,I find my child to be annoyed by how 'confining' the toy seems to be while lying underneath, without much room to move at either side. The musical turtle is a bit loud, and goes off at the slightest movement.While there's no doubt it's cute, it doesn't seem to perform so well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adorable, but that's it.","review":"It's definitely cute, but the bar holds the toys too close to baby's face.

Andy Lambert carries on that same tradition. His gentle humor and understanding of the human condition makes the reader laugh, and more importantly nod in agreement, as he or she moves from story to story. These stories, no matter how far away they seem in the beginning, really are about Jesus and about us.

The exercises are okay -- but the presentation is boring. I would rather watch a class or at least a leader with a few other people following the exercises. And Mirabai Holland, though knowledgable, is not lively enough to keep me motivated through a half-hour workout. I do not recommend this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to love this book, but it irritated me instead","review":"I really wanted to love this book -- the story sounds so engaging and uplifting, with an inner-city child from the Fresh Air Fund opening up the life of a reclusive young woman. However, I ended up irritated by it instead: the twists and turns of the plot are so far-fetched, particularly the sudden and radical effect the child has on the life of the main character. The way in which the child suddenly appears and instantly rescues someone who's been deeply mired in agoraphobia for years just doesn't seem convincing -- the author is using a \\"deus ex machina\\" scenario to solve some very complex problems. The book tries hard to tug at the reader's heartstrings, but for me, the story just never rang true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Readable","review":"This is a hard book to review. On one hand, it is a very readable story- it is easy to while away a snowy afternoon turning the pages and absorbing yourself in this book. However, there are SO many faults with the plot. THe story is way too contrived- woman almost never leaves the house, does not speak to anyone over the phone except to place work orders, sees a little girl in her backyard, and within 8 days she is transformed. She's called old friends, made new ones, got a new job... And all because of a too precocious 9 year old girl! It has to be fiction. Never has there been such a neat, happy, ending, where all things are as they should be. Near the end of th book, Lucinda is remarking that she can't beleive it's only been a month...well, neither can we. It's totally impossible to beleive that this could happen to anyone.But plausibility aside, the book has its moments. The language is simple, and for anyone who does not wish to see a bad ending, this is perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shattered Sword: The Untold Story of the Battle of Midway (e-book)","review":"First let me say that the content of the book was excellent. I would be the first to recommend it in hardcover but the e-book version is horrable. It must have been scanned by the publisher and offered for sale without anyone checking the scan for errors. Words are constantly run together others are split and some are over written. The publisher has a lot of nerve charging $15.00 for a book that he didn't take the time to proof read.

For me, this was a completely different perspective (Japanese) on the battle of Midway. I came away with a deeper appreciation of the Japanese military culture - especially naval - that determined how the Japanese fought the war. I also had to change my opinion of Yamamoto.The only fault of the book, if it is one, is the detail that is sometimes overwhelming and unnecessary for a reader like me. But it was easy to skip over. I never lost track of the narrative.An exciting read that gave more depth to my understanding of WWII."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shattered Sword","review":"\\"Fantastic\\" is not enough to describe this book. The research which has gone into it and the amount of details presented is absolutely unbelievable.In the wake of this book, I don't think there will be any further need for continued discussion over the relative action of the US and IJN fleets and what really happened near Midway on that fateful day.The explanation of Japanese tactical and strategical thought which lead to their demise is clearly spelled out and it finally lets the reader understand the how and why of the action Adm. Nagumo took at the time.Altogether, I could not have asked for a better book on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting","review":"Picked up my copy at the 65th Anniversary seminar on the attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. Met Parschall and found him to be very knowledgeable on his subject and very entertaining.

This is one of the few revisionist history books that I really enjoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shattered Myths is appropriate!","review":"This is without any doubt the finest, most accurately researched book ever written about the Battle of Midway.The authors rejected all of the commonly accepted notions about the battle and instead studied the battle through the lens of Japanese naval doctrine and more recent scholarly works from the Japanese side to provide the reader with a much better understanding of this pivotal battle.Many of the circumstances which have been commonly accepted as facts are thrown out and shown to be plainly false.I recommend this great book to any student of military history and would also prescribe it to any potential authors as a framework to use which shows how a history should be written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift choice for a WWII buff","review":"I'll preface this review by commenting that I have NOT read this book myself. However, I bought this book as a Christmas present for my father. My father has an extensive library of WWII books, with quite a few devoted to Pearl Harbor and Midway exclusively. He e-mailed me after X-Mas with a one sentence review - \\"Pup, the Midway book is outstanding.\\" Considering the number of books he has read on the subject, that is a hard endorsement to come by. So, I am basing the review on his experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but repetative","review":"As many other reviewers have pointed out, the book is extremely authoritative on it's subject matter, and \\"shatters\\" a lot of old misunderstandings about the battle.

The authors combine original Japanese sources with detailed analysis to paint the true picture of Japanese carrier operations during the battle of Midway. Their opinions regarding the personality impacts of Japanese commanders is based on a disappointingly superficial reading of old source materials.

Outstanding, especially given that the authors are not professional historians. Massive, high quality work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Big Book and a Fascinating Read","review":"I usually avoid lengthy books but the subject matter is intriguing and the authors have extensive knowledge of the Imperial Japanese Navy of WWII. Their work is so engrossing and detailed that I was actually left wanting more after completing the book, but they've covered it all and then some. A wonderful read for those interested in this fascinating and critical encounter between the USN anf the IJN. The backstory and the countless details add such a richness and meaning to the well known history that I sincerely hope that the authors are planning additional works on related subjects in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed my understanding of the battle","review":"This book provides a well-researched story of the battle and gave me a whole new view of what happened.

It is a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pillow","review":"During my fourth month of pregnancy, my back and hips were killing me. I bought this pillow, and it was a lifesaver! I am a person who sleeps in one position, so it was very easy for me to adapt to the pillow. Also, I have a king size bed, so my husband and I aren't competing for space.The reason I gave it only 4 stars is because of the pillow cover. It is a pain to take off and put on so you can wash it, and it only comes in white. You have to make a pillow cover since Leachco doesn't have any additional covers for it.Overall, this is a great pillow but only for people who don't move around a lot a night!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LIFE SAVER","review":"I bought this in my sixth month after weeks of lower back and sholder pain that was bad enough to require physical therapy.

The head support is extremely padded and compares to a firm support pillow. After using it one night I was in discomfort from neck pain. I took it back. If you usually use a soft or medium support pillow, like I do, this may not be the best choice of a maternity pillow for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"This is such a waste of money. It is not comfortable, it is cumbersome. If you are a tosser/turner - this is not for you. It is very difficult to move around in bed and I was becoming sore staying in a stationary position. Once it is opened, it can not be returned and you can not try it out without opening it so buy at your own risk. If you are having trouble sleeping b/c of your belly, I highly recommend the pregnancy pillow deluxe...it is simple but makes a big difference and allows you to move around in bed more easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"This pillow is great!","review":"My husband found the Snoogle online and suggested I get it after he noticed that I was tossing & turning in my sleep often. I too found it in the Baby Depot. Everywhere else was sold out! It is really comfortable and keeps me in position so I don't feel like I am pressing on my belly. My non-pregnant sister tried it out and tried to steal it. The only thing I wish it had was a cover. I don't know how to wash it, but I have not looked at the care instructions yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"No More Back Pain, Good Support for Big Belly","review":"I have been complaining of back pain through my pregnancy. I only wish I had bought this pillow earlier. It takes very little getting used to and it pays off in dividends. I thought the pillow would be too high or that my arm would fall asleep and neither is true so far. It also supports my stomach very well, I don't feel the discomfort of gravity pulling it down while I'm trying to fall asleep. The best part of this pillow is that it keeps me in the left side sleep position. The only negatives are that we have a queen bed and it takes up a good amount of space and I am 4'11\\" and the pillow is provably larger than me, so it can be overwhelming. I would have bought it a lot sooner, if not for my frugal attitude."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best pillow for back pain","review":"I'm 6 months pregnant and this past week I haven't been able to sleep, waking up at 4am everyday due to back pain. I was skeptical about this pillow so before purchasing one I borrowed my friends. I used it last night and slept through the night without back pain. While the pillow does take up a lot of space it was totally worth it. The intent of the pillow is to make you sleep more comfortably, and if it has to be big in order to do that then so be it. I love this pillow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!!","review":"I am 25 weeks pregnant and have had this pillow for 6 weeks now. I sleep SO much better with it.

It was a pain to get comfortable with. It was like a tube that needed flattening. My mother bought me a bumpil from this little boutique downtown and paid about the same amount that I paid for my snoozle. This pregnancy pillow is awesome because it is so easy to get comfortable with and when baby gets here in just a few days, he can also enjoy the pillow because it opens up to a baby play area. Just My Opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality-Get if you hate your partner!","review":"After reading the raves on this and other websites, I was eager to try this pillow. I've had horrible times sleeping during pregnancy and was hopeful this would help. And it did, for about a month until the cheap materials showed it up. The portion of the pillow between my knees compressed into nothingness and was totally unsupportive thereafter. It's tricky to roll over with (I always had to wake up to do it) and the fabric is really rough and scratchy. It also did not offer enough support for my neck. Get this pillow if you never want to cuddle your partner again, it's so cumbersome, you won't be able to--it's like the Great Wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of a hassle than a help...","review":"I tried this a few nights before it got ole' heave-ho! It did not help me at all. I was better off with the regular pillow between my legs. I don't know why it didn't work for me, but it didn't. It was uncomfortable and hard to roll from side-to-side with. And it takes up so much space.... Don't recommend this at all... especially for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"great...","review":"only slept on it one night, but really enjoy it. i agree that it is expensive, but pillows all around are expensive... usually. this is comfortable and cradles my whole body... it does interfere with being close to anyone else in the bed... it forms a cocoon around me... but so far, i am enjoying that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"The pillow is a must have for preggy ladies, but the guys will love it also.

I was able to remove it to wash it, but it was almost impossible to put back on the pillow. I had to give it 5 stars, because it was truly a great purchase and was a huge help to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful product","review":"I purchased this pillow about 2 months ago and don't know how I lived without it.

I read this in one of the pregnancy books that you should train your body sleep on the left side to help circulate the blood flow better to the baby. Since I'm a back sleeper, it was incredibly hard to sleep on one side throughout the night. I started having neck and back pain. My friend suggested I use the snoggle. I have to said, it really helped. I had to place a small pillow under my head to elevate my upper body but overall I would definiately recommend this product to all expecting mothers out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifesaver and must have!","review":"Leachco Snoogle Total Body PillowThis pillow is excellent! I am 2 weeks and have been having trouble sleeping. I am accustomed to sleeping on my back so sleeping on the side is quite a task. I found myself waking up with back pains constantly. I purchased a body pillow (long pillow) to place in between my thighs for support but this only helped a little. After researching I saw this on Amazon and read all the great reviews. I used it for a couple of nights now and cannot believe what a great night sleep I had. This pillow supported my back, provided me support to allow me to sleep on my left side all night and was completely soft and comfortable. I really recommend for expectant mothers.

Then I started having pain in the neck and shoulder. If you could ask someone to take a look at your neck and spine, you would notice that they aren't in a straight line when you are using the pillow. The material doesn't contour to your neck and head. The pain went away after I switched back to my old pillow and using a pillow between my knees and ankles. The cover that comes with the pillow is made in a poor material.I bought this because I was a back sleeper and was desperate in finding a solution to help me sleep on my side.

Not only did the pillow help me avoid rolling onto my back, it also provides great support and comfort. Now 6 months pregnant I still sleep amazingly well at night. The pillow is great in all positions described/shown. I have not noticed it to flatten out either, its holding up really well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works at first...","review":"I adored this pillow when I first purchased it. I have had several abdominal surgeries, and it helped keep me positioned so I wasn't rolling onto my stomach, and was very comfortable.

It's way too expensive for the short life it had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big, too pricey","review":"I purchased this pillow and have never successfully slept through an entire night with it. It is really quite large and feels confining when wrapped all around you under the sheets. I felt like I couldn't move and couldn't get comfortable. Plus, the material is really scratchy and awful - forcing you to shell out additional money for a cover. Way over-priced. Mine sits in the corner of my bedroom. For $20 I bought a body pillow and ultra soft cover at Target and I love it and sleep with it every night.

My sister in law told me about this pillow and I bought it for my friend to try out. She's had it a week now and loves it, it has greatly improved her sleep. In fact, after about 10 minutes with the pillow when my friend went to the bathroom, she came back to find her fiancee curled up with it so I guess there are two fans of the pillow in the house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for pregnancy!","review":"This total body pillow saved me during pregnancy.

When we had to evacuate our house for a hurricane and pack up only the most important things, this was on the top of my list to take with me. I could not get a good nights rest further along in my pregnancy without it. Definitely worth the money.

It was a little awkward at first to fall asleep with, but once I got used to it, I had to sleep with it every night. As my pregnant tummy got bigger, it really helped me sleep at night. Especially during months 8 and 9. I actually would sleep well and the entire night. If you want a full nights sleep... Get this pillow!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life with Snoogle","review":"This wonderfully curved pillow was the first thing my sister recommended when I got pregnant; the girl knew what she was talking about. Snoogle hasn't left the bed in five months, much to the displeasure of my husband, who's had to reckon with less bed space and a somewhat cumbersome barrier between him and me.That said, it feels good to be able to sleep again. The pillow worked well in my first trimester, when I could still sleep on my back; it elevated my legs to relieve lower back pain. In the second trimester, it's a helpful wedge that cushions my abdomen and keeps my hips aligned. Bulky as it is, I don't travel without it; it gets its own suitcase!My gripe that knocks this down to a four-star rating is the pillowcase. Snoogle is expensive and comes with only one pillowcase that is horrendously difficult to take off and even worse to put back on."},{"rating":"2","title":"SPEND THE MONEY!!! YOU WONT REGRET IT!","review":"Oh my goodness, I dont know where to begin. This is the best invention since having bread sliced prior to purchasing it! The pillow is soooo comfortable. I was able to adjust myself without disturbing my boyfriend.At first he was unhappy with the price, but he too can admit that it is worth every penny. Anyone who says there is something wrong with this pillow obviously does not have a clue on how to use it. Ladies, spend the money, its worth every scent. You will not regret it. Unfortunately, I accidently forgot my snoogle in CT this past weekend. I really miss it. I dont think I can ever remember sleeping so comfortable. My girlfriend advised me to get the pillow, so I wanted to pass the positive feedback on its worth. PLEASE GET THE PILLOW, you and your mate will be much happier. The only reason I gave it 4 stars out of 5 is because of the color. I feel that it should have been another color that wouldn't get so easily soiled over time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as comfortable as I was hoping for....","review":"When I was about 6 months pregnant, I decided to invest in a snoogle because I was getting no sleep at night. The first night I had it, I thought it was heaven. But then I started getting headaches every morning and realized it was because of the snoogle. It wraps around you so that the top part is actually used as a pillow. I am used to thick, soft, down-filled pillows, and the snoogle is very hard and uncomfortable. I guess if you like hard, cotton pillows, it won't matter, and in that case, this would be a great item. But I just can't sleep without a soft pillow for my head. I am now back to using a regular body pillow along with my normal pillows, so this item was a waste of money for me. I am hoping to get some use out of it when I start to breastfeed - if so, I'll write another review then :)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hip and back pain alleviated!","review":"I would do a commercial for this thing if they let me! It is fantastic and it doesn't take up as much room in the bed as you would think. Before I got the Snoogle, I was about 5 months pregnant and suffering from fairly significant hip aches during the night. My back began to ache as well, and that's when I decided I needed to do something about it. Since I've been using the Snoogle my hip and back pain have been alleviated. I'm sleeping MUCH better (except for the whole bathroom issue at 7 months...) which makes for a much better day. Get this pillow - you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate this pillow!","review":"Bought this pillow a few weeks ago and it has been one of the worst purchases I've ever made.

If you move at all you run into some part of the pillow as it is too bulky to move with you. I did not find the head section of the pillow comfortable as I would prefer to have my normal pillow under my head at night. Unfortunately I could not get the Snoogle to turn out of the C shaped position so the head rest section would have to go under your regular pillow and sleeping on two pillows results in a very stiff neck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Big, Too Firm, NOT comfortable","review":"I don't have anything to add...it's very uncomfortable and didn't ease any of my discomfort.

I was having difficulty getting comfortable and sleeping at night so I decided to try the Snoogle. I have since returned the Snoogle. I felt I could not get the pillow in position to be comfortable. The top curve was in the way of my regular pillow and the bottom curve was never in the right spot if I had the long part of the pillow up against me. I also felt that the pillow did not support my belly very well because it is so thick-I felt uncomfortable with it under me.

However, I found that the pillow really flattened out with use, and I eventually just switched to using multiple regular pillows in order to get enough support. I am not a large person either (115 pounds before pregnancy), so it didn't take much. Once I made that switch to regular pillows, I found the multiple pillows were much easier to maneuver around. Now that I am in the final weeks and turning is really difficult, I would not go back to the snoogle at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adequite size with nice shape","review":"The pillow is quite large, which can probably fit for a person 6' tall. The shape works great with one side holding my neck well and the other side between legs. It does occupy quite some space, but not a problem at all for a king-size bed. The cover is white, which is easy to stain. Fabric is OK but not the most comfortable. Overall a good buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessary","review":"It's hot, unbendable, unforgiving, and no where near as comfortable as using an extra pillow from the guest room. Unfortunately, my husband got it for me as a 'gift' and I'm stuck using this horrible, expensive device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big and uncomfortable.","review":"I found this beast of a pillow to be way too large and poofy to get comfortable with. I had a kink in my neck after sleeping with it because it kept my head so far off the mattress. I also felt like it was way too big when I tried to use it to support my top leg when sleeping on my side. It was also a huge pain to try and punch into place after getting up to use the bathroom at night, which happens frequently when pregnant. By the time I had it arranged, I was wide awake. I had better luck getting some inexpensive down pillows that I could mold around me as needed for support, and that were easier to get into place after getting up in the night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended!","review":"My wife loved it-got it after reading another husbands review here- really helped her sleep during pregnancy- would definitely recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Pillow Ever!","review":"I can't imagine a better fit for a pregnancy pillow.

She loves it. I can't tell you how many nights prior she was tossing and turning trying to get comfortable... well now she is sleeping really well. The pillow supports her back and her belly. It comes with detailed instructions on the various ways to use it. And I especially like that it has a removable pillow case so I can keep it clean. Even as a man I had to try it out when we first put it on the bed... well I curled up with it in the early afternoon and I was so comfortable I fell right to sleep.. ha ha. I highly recommend this as a nice gift for anyone who is expecting in your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Near perfect gift","review":"Just what the recipient wanted but it took a couple of weeks to get used to it and mold it to their desire.

The Snoogle has really helped me be able to sleep on my side or sleep on my back but with the snoogle under one side so I'm kind of propped up on it. Sleeping became really difficult in the 6th month and I am very glad I purchased this pillow. One caveat is that you NEED to buy a cover with it - I didn't realize that and ended up trying to wrap mine in a sheet until I had a chance to get a cover. The material is very scratchy and rough by itself: Amazon sells a Snoogle with Cover for $65, but since I had to buy mine separately I ended up paying $82.96 for the exact same thing. Bummer.I have found that mine kept its shape decently well - it's certainly not as soft as my feather pillows, but I was unable to find something like this made of down/feather. Overall, I would recommend this pillow BUT don't buy this one: buy the one that includes a cover at the same time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this pillow!!","review":"The first night I slept with this pillow, I felt like I was sleeping all wrapped up in clouds... it was awesome. I love how versatile it is. You can use it when watching tv or reading and you can sleep on it SO many different ways. It does, however, put a damper on cuddling. My dog and husband are not crazy about having almost the bulk of a whole other person in the bed, but definitely worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This pillow is wonderful!!","review":"I am just about 6 months along now, and have had a lot of trouble sleeping since month 1. I don't know how I could live without this pillow! I don't think i'm going to be able to give it up after the baby is born! My husband is much happier now too, since I am no longer tossing and turning and waking him up. The pillow does take up a bit of space in our queen size bed, but it has never been in the way for him. Also the cover is really not too difficult to put on, I was able to do it in only a few minutes.Buy this pillow, it's more than worth the money!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for everything!","review":"I love it, love it, love it! I roll up part of it behind my back and lay the other part across my belly and I use it to watch TV, play cards, get on the internet...etc. I sleep with it at night to help alleviate leg and hip pain. And, when I have my baby in a few months I will be able to breastfeed while laying down by placing the baby on the long part of the pillow and using the curled parts under my head and feet. This pillow is so multi-purpose, it has become my new best-friend.Only complaint is taking the cover off. The cover that comes with this pillow is very form fitted and feels nice and smooth against your skin, but it is devishly hard to peel off for cleaning. Putting it back on is a lot easier though and I know there are other covers you can purchase that may be easier to use. Otherwise, I am completely happy with this pillow and would recommend it to others (pregnant or not)."},{"rating":"2","title":"i can't live without this pillow!","review":"I am only 5 1/2 months pregnant and not very big yet but i already can not live without this pillow!I have bought this for a friend that is a couple of weeks ahead of me and is having a tough pregnancy and since she got the pillow has had some good nights sleep!i would like it a little better if it was a bit thicker, but shape makes it easy to work with you in any position needed!

But if this is not and issue for you try it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Pregnancy Pillow Ever","review":"I started to feel a little uncomfortable around five and a half months, so I thought I'd give this pillow a try. It's rather big, but it doesn't take up as much room as using 3 or 4 pillows would. My husband and I have a full bed and with the Snoogle added to the mix we still sleep comfortably at night. The pillow wraps underneath your head and around to your back, which supports your back, then comes between your knees, which also releives pressure on your back, and lastly fits snuggly underneath your drooping tummy. . .it's perfect! I highly recommend this Snoogle for any pregnant woman who's starting to get a big belly =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for hip and back","review":"This is a purchase I made at about 5 months in my pregnancy when I was having bad hip, pelvic and back pain, the pain only got worse as I got bigger and this pillow was a life saver. I even turned it onto itself to make a great lumbar pillow for the car when we had to travel. I would have rated it 5 out of 5 if it wasn't for the sandpaper like cover that is included, it is really cheap and even tore in one of the curves. I have washed it a couple of times and just hang to dry, it goes right back on, but it is still stiff and scratchy. Overall worth the fifty dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"sleep saver","review":"Perfect sleep saver, pricey but worth every penny. Before I bought the snoggle I was sleeping with 5 pillows that all ended up on the floor in the middle of the night.

It takes up a lot of room, but overall makes sleeping easier at 5 months pregnant and I imagine will make the next 4 months much easier. My only complaint is that the cover/case is difficult to remove and even more difficult to put back on. It took me 8 minutes to get back on and was pretty frustrating. Another reviewer made the suggestion of putting a regular pillowcase over the \\"head\\" of the pillow to avoid having to change the original case as often. I would definitely recommend this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best pregnancy purchase yet!","review":"I love this pillow and can't imagine pregnancy without it now! I got this at the beginning of my 6th month and it completely changed my sleep for the better! I had been stuffing pillows around me, which were taking up too much space on the bed, falling off, and required lots of attention and maneuvering throughout the night. When I got this pillow, I could easily settle in and get comfortable and remain that way throughout the night. I just can't get over how comfy it is. I use the Snoogle along with the Boppy Wedge pillow, and place the wedge under my belly when on my side. The wedge is the perfect support size for me, while the Snoogle supports my head, neck, back and legs. The size is great, it doesn't croud out my husband like the other pillows did. I HIGHLY recommend this pillow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Body Pillow Not For All Preggos","review":"I bought this for my pregnant wife but she says it does not support her stomach the way she likes.

When I took it out of the box I was surprised at how large it was, but it doesn't take up a lot of space on our queen size bed with me laying with it. I am finding I fall asleep much faster with the pillow than I did without it. I love being able to lean slightly so it feels like I'm laying on my back while I'm still mostly on my side. It has take some of the pressure off of my hips while I sleep. I love laying facing the long part of the pillow and away from it. I have even caught my husband using it when I'm not!

I look forward to using it with the different layouts they gave with the pillow!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for tall people","review":"I am 5'8 and this pillow was not long enough to go under my head, between my knees, and under my belly. I was also very disappointed with the softness. This is a hard and scratchy pillow. It is also pretty thick, my head was up too high to be comfortable. I normally sleep on a goose feather pillow, so I prefer softness. I was in so much pain when I finally got out of bed after using the snoogle total body pillow. I returned it. I was very hopeful that this pillow would give me a good night sleep, since I haven't been sleeping well since week 16 of my pregnancy. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it","review":"I was doing well without any sleeping accommodations until I reached 20 weeks in pregnancy. The Snoogle works great for me. During the first nights I felt a bit weird but then you get confortable with the way the pillow is shaped and then you are in heaven. It supports my belly, the high for the head is good and I can also get confort on my back (before I was putting pillows for back support). I wish it would come with a better cover though.... You need to buy one separately, that will cost around $25 (which I did not buy).If you are pregnant, this pillow is a must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"works great","review":"Works great, my wife hasn't slept a night without it since I purchased it for her last month.

My back pain is about an 8 or 9 most of the time and makes sleep really hard. I got this pillow and starting laughing out loud because of the instant relief this pillow provided. It is like a big hug of support and love. I was amazed at how well this pillow actually works. It is extremely supportive, strong and comfortable. I felt like my back, hips, neck and shoulders were in alignment. The pillow is the perfect size to support my head as well. I'm so happy I got this pillow. My back pain went down to a 2.

The pillow is great for arranging in different positions for lounging. For sleeping, I line the pillow along my back and use the bottom loop to prop my top knee a little higher.

I read a lot of reviews before buying and most stated that it needs a pillow-case...which it DOES. I am not good at sewing at all - but what I did was take an old queen flat sheet from the closet - cut it 30 inches across and just sew the sides together and on one bottom...INSTANT cover that was super easy to make!"},{"rating":"1","title":"helps with knee pain","review":"No problems with the quality of the pillow or the pillow case.I haven't tried any other body pillows, so I can't compare, but it seems to help. Early in my first trimester, I started getting severe knee and hip pain at night. I still have some, but sleeping with the body pillow seems to help. I think the important thing in avoiding the hip pain is to keep my whole upper leg on the body pillow, so it isn't angling downward - at least I hope this will help.The pillow comes with a pillow case. Its a bit hard to get it on and off for washing, but I'm not sure how it could be improved - it's a snake shaped pillow - a zipper or snaps would make it easier to get on and off, but would probably be uncomfortable or wouldn't completely cover the pillow.Edit: I liked this pillow at first, but before the end of the second trimester it was very flat. Washing it didn't plump it up enough. I ended up using two normal pillows as body pillows - one between my knees and one to hug.

It fits my body and positions perfectly, and could be twisted and contorted all sorts of ways for lounging, reading, sleeping etc...

This is my first pregnancy so very quickly I found it hard to sleep on my sides 100% of the night... I usually flop between each side or end up on my back.I am not that far along right now so its hard to sleep with the pillow. I know it will be a lot better when I can rest my belly on it once I am bigger. but for now since I am still able to roll on my back i find myself in akward positions on the pillow and waking up with a sore shoulder.the cover is very itchy and you are going to want to take it off and wash it in some hot water with fabric softener to get that scratchy feeling out of it. And be patient when trying to shove the pillow back into the cover.The other plus is my cats totally love it! It is big though, so if you are sharing a small bed with someone it will be an adjustment.

Definitely worth purchasing!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stiff and uncomfortable","review":"If you plan to get this pillow you will need to buy or make a soft cover for it as the fabric is quite stiff and scratchy especially for those with sensitive skin. The shape of the pillow provides support for your knees and just slightly below but no support for the calves or ankles which is quite uncomfortable because your lower legs are left on a decline(this may be different depending on your height and overall body size, I'm fairly small framed and 5'8\\"). The pillow is very firm and I prefer a simple body length pillow for what I consider better support and comfort. In my experience (the two nights I tried to use it) I woke up more often than before I bought it in uncomfortable positions and neck pain. I personally felt a little bit trapped and smothered by the large design of the pillow. It's worth a try if you are desperate but I would go with your average fluffy body pillow first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps with back trouble during pregnancy","review":"I bought this item for a friend of mine who is pregnant and suffers from Sciatica.

The only thing that I find tough is the turning from one side to the other, but then, that kind of goes with pregnancy anyway. :-) And, I probably would prefer it to be a little shorter but it does scrunch up very nicely.

Only con is i get hot w/ it about 3-4 am , throw it off the bed and go back to pillow btw legs, pillow to hold, and pillow for head.

I use it in addition to my regular pillow to provide extra elevation for my head and neck due to bad heartburn. It provides pretty good back support just rolled up if you want to read/watch tv in bed. As others have pointed out, the pillow case isn't the softest material and it can be a pain to put on, but I think adding a zipper down the length would make the pillow scratchy and defeat its purpose.The Snoogle was a life saver on a recent vacation. Anticipating the reduced quality of a motel mattress and pillows, I packed the snoogle in the car and it was just what I needed to be able to get some rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helped a little","review":"This pillow does help me sleep most nights.

Couldn't figure out the belly support feature - just didn't help me. Doesn't come with a case which is $20 and all in all I think just knowing I am sleeping on a $40 pillow makes me uncomfortable!

I originally gave it 4 stars, taking one off because it's bulky and makes it difficult to roll over.However, after owning it for 3 months, the top (where my head rests) was completely flat and I had to use a second pillow under my head. It also ripped right on the inside of the curve where my shoulder hit it. On top of all of that, you can't purchase covers for it, so I was stuck trying to deal with a standard pillow case cover over the top which just got tangled and fell off every night.I wish I would have just bought a new body pillow, it would have saved me a lot of money and headache dealing with this huge thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so comfortable or easy to use.","review":"It did not help me in anyway, if you use this product, you will not be able to turn one side to another with ease, and I think everyone turns in bed frequently during pregnancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable","review":"It may just be me, but I found this pillow to be the most uncomfortable thing on the planet.

I got it at the beginning of my 2nd trimester, and now I'm nearing the beginning of my 3rd trimester. Within that time, the stuffing inside of the bottom part of the pillow has thinned out, making my legs too close together. I need more spacing between my knees so that my hips don't hurt when I sleep. Painful hips from sleeping on your side is SO annoying, if you haven't experienced it already, you just might if you are using this pillow. In addition to this, the head part of the pillow is too flat. I struggle with sleeping on this as a pillow because my neck hurts. Overall I do not recommend this product. I read tons of reviews on Amazon of different pillows, and this one was the cheapest with the best review. Don't fall for the same trap I did!!!

Trying to switch sides became a long process that inevitably woke up my husband and only frustrated me more. Using it as a back support was not at all helpful.

Getting a decent night's sleep while pregnant is challenging enough with leg cramps and the baby's acrobatics; the Leacho Snoogle pillow really has helped my back feel more comfortable and keep me from having to chase pillows with my legs throughout the night. When I think about how much a good night's sleep is worth, the seemingly high sticker price is well worth the money.

Be warned that you are buying something that you will have to live with. I highly recommend you buy a pillow that you have actually felt with your own hands prior to purchase. The curve of the pillow forces you to sleep with your neck in an unnatural position/curve, which caused me to wake up with headaches each time I slept with it. I initially thought I was going to have to get use to it, but it is impossible. Another trying thing with this pillow is it's size.

The first night I used it, it seemed okay. But from then on, anytime I use it, I wake up even more sore than without it. I think the reason is having the pillow under my head and between my legs but nowhere else - it seems to make me lay out of alignment so I wake up with a sore back, shoulders, neck, etc. I originally thought this one would be better than the J-shaped one (can't remember manufacturer's name) but now I think the j-shaped one would be better because then you can just use your own pillows. I actually think that I may just buy one of those wedges now and use that for under my belly and stick a regular pillow between my knees. So the Snoogle may work well for some people, but for me it actually made things worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Comfy!","review":"I really really like my snoogle! This is a great product for expectant mommies... I bought one when I was just 12 weeks pregnant. I have problems with my back and sciatic nerves and just couldn't find the right position to sleep in.... this helps! The snoogle promotes that great side-lying sleeping position our OBs all recommend, and it's comfortable no matter which side you have it facing. It can also be used for nursing, and for sitting up in bed when our noses get stuffy and we can't lay down! The only downfall is it doesn't come with a pillowcase, and I have already gotten makeup on its white cover while sleeping. Oh well. Definately recommend it. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful...","review":"This pillow has helped me to get a good nights sleep. I'm 6 months pregnant and bought the pillow after 20 weeks because I was constantly waking up on my back. It works best for me to hug the pillow because putting my back against it usually results in me waking up on my back. I don't find it to take up our whole queen size bed like others have said. It divided our bed, but we each still have plenty of room. The biggest downfall for me is that if I want to change the side that I am sleeping on, it is very difficult, half asleep and under the covers, to move the pillow to my other side."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my snoogle","review":"It's very comfortable and I love the versatility of it. However, I've had to combine it with a regular pillow b/c I don't think it's wide enough to use as a pillow for sleeping on its own.It also takes up quite a bit of space on the bed, so be prepared for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Night's sleep","review":"A friend of mine sent this pillow to me last month.

It saves from having to fill my bed with 5 individual pillows, and now my husband can fit!

When you can't get comfortable at all this pillow is a life saver. I preferred to use it more when I was laying around watching tv or resting verses while I slept. I was able to control laying on back so no need for it while sleeping. Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I have it","review":"While the Snoogle seems a little high for my neck at times, I am overall very glad I have it. I'm sleeping much better during the second half of my pregnancy thanks to the Snoogle.

Splurged on this pillow plus the jersey cover. My husband calls it the great wall of China. I call it a lifesaver! I love that I can tuck the bottom curve under my tummy. Feels cozy to be wrapped up in it. If you're pregnant, this really makes sleeping for longer periods of time much more bearable. Don't hesitate."},{"rating":"1","title":"flat, unsupportive and cumbersome","review":"I slept on this pillow for a total of one night and was up most of the night with terrible hip pain even though I was sleeping with the pillow between my legs for support. While it was totally unsupportive for what I needed it for (compresses pretty flat when you lay on it), it was also large and cumbersome and took up a fair amount of space. I decided to return it but have yet to see a refund from the company which shouldn't surprise me since it took them over three weeks to send me the pillow in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thing I have bought while prego","review":"I did not want to spend this much on a pillow.

I've always slept with a body pillow and thought this would be great. So, when it arrived, I slept with it that night. Lo and behold, as soon as I turned in my sleep the darn thing ripped at the inside curve on the bottom! I remedied that by tying a regular pillow case around it. I toss and turn so much, though, that after 9 months of use it is permanently twisted at the bottom. I love the shape, but they really need to improve the design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to say on this one","review":"I bought this snoogle to help me sleep but I am not too sure about it really. You cannot use a pillow with it and be compfortable and also you definatly cannot have a down cover on your mattress or the snoogle just sinks into it. It is hard to position compfortably. If you are a person who sleeps in one position all night long then you might like it. I dont know. I try everything to get a nice sleep and nothing workd so maybe it is me...but for 50 bucks, put a blanket between your knees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I bought this item because I knew a few friends that had used it. They gave me mixed reviews, but I needed to buy something since I'm almost in my third trimester and starting to feel uncomfortable at night. This pillow is stiff and the fabric was rough. I tried using it one night and ended up throwing it out of the bed at 3 AM. I wish I would have bought something more simple that doesn't come up to my head. I prefer my regular pillow under my head. I would not recommend buying this pillow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not life-altering like I'd hoped","review":"I was so excited to get this pregnancy pillow - I'd been told over and over again by friends and my midwife that I just had to get a pregnancy pillow, that I'd feel so much better once I did.Alas, that didn't happen.My major two issues with this pillow are this:- It's hot. Or, rather, it traps my heat, so I wake up much sweatier than I do without it. I don't particularly like being hot while sleeping, so I rarely use this as a result.- It's awkward when rolling over. I have to reposition myself to make it work, which means that I need to kinda sorta wake up to do so, rather than just readjusting while sleeping like I'd normally do.I also wish the pillowcases for it were cheaper - I can't see investing more money into this to use it more than I do, but because I end up kicking it to the floor midway through each night I try to use it, I would like something that's easier to clean.Mostly, I wish that I hadn't spent the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"very comfy","review":"this product is very comfy and i think will work well for me as i get bigger. I bought it hoping it'd help w/ my lower back/neck issues, but it didn't help too much. I stopped using it for awhile, but will plan to use it again soon.My only complaint is that the part where your legs go seems to go flat quickly throughout the night which causes my legs to ache."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rough material","review":"I returned this item. I was a giant pregnant lady that needed support, but the fabric is really rough on the skin. I am sure there is a cover out there, but that's more $. i ended up buying just a large soft pillow instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't live with out it!","review":"I started sleeping better my first night with this body pillow. Before I had anywhere from 3 to 4 pillows taking up a lot of room on our queen size bed. Now I use this plus one other pillow I use for under my preggo tummy - I sleep with the \\"spine\\" of the pillow along the back of my body - always. It doesn't work well for me when it's in the front. I saved the box it came in so when we travel I can take it with me. It may seem a little excessive, but hey, a good nights sleep is worth lugging around a pillow whether it's in the car or on the plane."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I am a belly sleeper and I never sleep on my side. When I could no longer do that and had to start sleeping on mhy side, I had pain in my hips and my shoulders and I kept tossing and turning all night. My back was hurting. I would surround myself with pillows but nothing really worked. This pillow is the greatest - I do not care if it does not have the softest cover or that it takes up a lot of room (it is still less than 5 pillows I was using before). My hips/shoulders do not hurt anymore and I can actually sleep thru the night. I think I would like to keep it after I deliver as well. :-) I really do think it is a life saver."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome for pregnancy!!","review":"what a wonderful thing for pregnancy, better buy two tho because it will be stolen by your partner.Pros:supports body completelyvery comfortablewraps around really well so it seems to suit all heights and sizeshelps keep you on your left side (recommended sleeping position for pregnant ladies)SERIOUSLY!!

I was sleeping on the couch because I had no support in my bed. The back of the couch was my support. Since using the snoogle I have been sleeping comfortably in my bed (my husband was thrilled) ever since. I will probably use this long beyond pregnancy. If I can keep my 8 year old away from it. I have also caught my husband napping with it. You have to get a snoogle. It has been one of the greatest gifts I have ever received. I can get a good nights sleep again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money whatsoever","review":"I bought this pillow because of back problems with my pregnancy. I don't toss and turn but I do tend to roll over once or twice at night. This does not provide the support to my lower back that I need nor does it allow you to rest easily. I had to wake up to roll over each time because the pillow does not allow you to turn easily. My husband was also upset by the size of the pillow because it took up a lot of room in our King size bed. I don't know about you but a pregnant woman and a giagantic pillow don't leave too much room for dad! I wish I could make a recommedation on another pillow to use instead of this - but the truth is that this discouraged me from trying any other pregnancy pillow - so I sleep with regular pillows again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little confusing, but worth the $$","review":"My husband bought this for me at 24 weeks because he said I looked uncomfortable when I was sleeping. I find the pillow takes up a lot of space, but I do sleep better with it. It definitely stays between my knees unlike the pillows I was using. I don't use the top as my pillow (curl it around my regular pillow), so it doesn't quite snuggle up to me the way it was intended. After using it for 8 weeks, i just figured out how to get some extra support from my stomach from the pillow. The pillow has kept it's shape well and I am definitely sleeping better. Now if I could just stop those middle of the night bathroom trips, I could sleep soundly through the night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cumbersome, Not Helpful","review":"My friend lent me her Snoogle for my pregnancy, swearing it was the most comfortable thing she'd ever experienced. I loved it for the first night or so, but then found myself getting repeatedly tangled up in it and unable to maintain the adjustments I needed to sleep comfortably (since the entire pillow is connected, when you move one part, the rest wants to move with it). I eventually curled it into an \\"O\\" shape and now have it against the wall behind the bed to prop myself up while I watch TV. I also found that it was stuffed too full to give my belly the under-support that it needed.Now I'm using a belly wedge and a regular flat, rectangular body pillow, as well as a couple of other supplementary pillows where I need them. A million times better than this un-tameable monster. Thanks, but no thanks on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love to snoogle with my snoogle","review":"The snoogle is pretty good. It's better than the full-body pillow I bought first; but of course it was also 5x the price. The main complaint I have about the snoogle is that it doesn't breath as well as it could so, being 8 months pregnant in June, snoogling can be a little too warm. It's not awful though, like I said - it's better than the first pillow I tried. At $50 it's somewhat overpriced, but if it helps you sleep it would be worth it and I do think it's worth a try. I use mine alot for naps and about 50% of the time for sleeping at night. Another potential problem is the size - my husband hates the snoogle b/c it takes up alot of room in our queen-sized bed; not a major issue, but I thought I'd mention it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not necessary!","review":"I did not find this item to be very comfortable at all! Maybe I am too petite for this item but it was not very plyable at all and became far too cumbersome. It just took up a great deal of space in the bed and was too hard and thick to use under my head. Furthermore, it did not supply enough back support so I prefered to use a heatable neck pillow to support my back. Honestly, you would be better served to purchase a bolster pillow for between your knees and a heatable (chamomile or lavender) beanbag pillow. Spend the fifty dollars on your baby instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for naps but not all night","review":"I bought this pillow and was very excited about it as I have always been a stomach sleeper and staying on my side was a real challenge. I slept with it for about two weeks and though some nights I would stay in position most others I would have to reposition the pillow several times. Not too much of a problem. I haven't slept straight through the night since I got pregnant. About 1/2 way through the 2nd week I started getting excrutiating headaches. I finally went to the doctor and she stated that they were caused from stress and strain. Turns out I spent the better part of sleeping hours \\"fighting\\" with the pillow to change position. I quit using it at night and my headaches have gone away completely. It is great for taking naps where your less likely to toss & turn. And I love it for laying in bed and reading. It's still better than having 6 pillows on the bed but I don't recommend it for people who naturally shift a lot in their sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"My wife loves it.","review":"My wife is 6 months pregnant and has had trouble sleeping due to extreme discomfort.

Now that I am 8 months pregnant I cannot sleep without it (I tried the other night and woke up sore all over). I bought a removable cover for it, but I use my regular pillow on top of this one and it props me up a little bit more which is helpful when sleeping on your side. I like that I can roll onto my back and it keeps me at an angle and I also roll to sleep on my belly (I am a belly sleeper) and it doesn't feel like I am squishing my baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"good to help with side sleeping","review":"I am a stomach sleeper and with pregnancy I really needed something to make sure I stayed on my side. This pillow was recommended from a friend. It definitely helps keeping you from rolling over, but just note that it is huge. I have a king size bed, so it is fine, but i would be worried if I only have a full size bed, as it is like adding another person in the bed! the pillow cover it comes with is not the best quality, but it does the job. It definitely pills after a while and is a bit difficult to get on / off to wash. I will not be using it post delivery, but my husband has been eyeing it and wants to use it! recommend if you are a stomach sleeper who tries sleeping on your side but keeps waking up on your stomach (which is what I was doing early in my pregnancy)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits every curve","review":"This pillow somehow manages to fit my body perfectly and doesn't leave me feeling like I need any other pillow for support.

I felt sooo relaxed. All my joints were loosened up and my hip and shoulder pain is gone!! I'm 5'7\\" and about 5 months preggo. I'm an average size and this fits me perfectly!The only thing I would change is the cover. It's a poly/cotton blend and it's rough and itchy.

Other than that, this is the best pregnancy product I've come across (and this is my 4th baby!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for petite moms","review":"I had heard from a friend that this is the thing to have so we shelled out $50 for the pillow. I'm only 5'1\\" and it is way too big. It's just too thick for being under my belly, and it's just cumbersome in the bed. The cover is cheap, extremely low thread count. The back support, however, is nice.I'd only buy this if you're absolutely miserable. Otherwise, I'm going to just stick with a traditional pillow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that helpful","review":"I wasn't so happy with this product for myself.

I was highly dissapointed with my purchase. At first I thought I got a deal because my pillowcost under 50 bucks. Come to realize when I got home that it came without a pillowcase! The company wants 20 bucks for their pillowcase which is at least 50% polyester. YIKES. I made one out of a King sheet I had laying around. I found this pillow extremely uncomfortable. My legs and belly were happy with it but my head and neck were not. Each time I try to sleep with this pillow I awake with a horrible pain in the neck, and a throbbing headache. It is just to big and fluffy and does not have enough give for my head to rest comfortably."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm in Heaven","review":"I wanted this pillow when I found out I was pregnant for the second time. I remember how uncomfortable it was trying to sleep with just regular pillows. Either I got shoved out of bed or my husband did with all the extra pillows I used to try and get comfy. I'm not gonna tell you this pillow isn't a bit bulky but it's worth it. It supports everything the way you want it too and it doesn't shift while you're asleep... I actually got a full night's sleep the first night I got it. This thing makes me feel cuddled and almost like how I imagine a cat would feel in a kitty bed. I can pull the open part together and snuggle in the middle... I love it! Definitly worth the price.

It is good quality. But for me this is very hard to use. Once you put it between your leg and back and head, you can't move or turn any more. It is bulky and it is too thick to support under your belly. I ended up using it only once and had such a bad night of sleep that I stopped using it. It is much easier for me to just put a thin pillow under my belly and another pillow between my legs. So while this is not a complaint about the product itself, I think the concept of using it is not something everyone will enjoy, and is an individual thing. So you may want to try it once and see if you even like it before you dish out $50 for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE the snoogle!","review":"I bought this in my 2nd trimester so that I could get used to it and I love it.

I received it for Christmas while pregnant with our 2nd child. When I was laying on it on the carpeted floor downstairs it was soooo comfortable I almost fell asleep right there (and I don't sleep on hard surfaces). However, our bed is a pillow top mattress cover (really soft!!) and unfortunately when I went to use it in bed, it was comfy at first, but then I woke up in the middle of the night with really bad neck pain.

I was tossing and turning and had back and hip pain from the weight of the pregnancy.. This is my 4th pregnancy and by far the most uncomfortable.. I never bought on before because I thought $50 for a pillow is ridiculous.. but this time I was at the end of my rope and needed to get some sleep and relieve the back pain.. I curl up into my snoogle at night and its lights out.. I am well rested the next day and no more pain.. The only problem for me is that I dont WANT to get out because I am so comfy.. I bought the basic without the cover.. I sometimes worry about how Ill wash it if needed.. so I have a king pillow case over the end where my head is.. If you have the extra funds I suggest the cover for it.. but if not a pillow case works.. save yourself 9 months of sleeplessness and get this pillow.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This pillow has been my saving grace.

It is thin and tightly stuffed (no give) so it's good for keeping the legs apart/hips in line, though a wider pillow at the bottom would be better. The top is just too uncomfortable--I prefer my own head pillow. So it's a struggle to use the parts I want and shift away the parts I don't.

These things detract from the game and make it frustrating to play. I really did try to look past the downsides, as I am generally easy-to-please video game-wise, but this one just wasn't as much fun as it should have been. The basic concepts were ok...you are exploring an underground temple, your son gets trapped and you must free him, amongst other quests, but the design was likely rushed to coincide with the DVD release, resulting in bugs and design flaws galore.

It's not even a good theory.Evolutionists believe that time and energy are the key to their theory, but that means if you took a pile of lumber, sacks of nails, bags of cement, spools of wire and placed them in a field and applied enormous amounts of energy that in time the items will have arranged themselves into a brand new house.

For instance, he argues that because the physical principal of entropy says that things tend to go from organized to disorganized, evolution can't happen.

The examples presented of real-life situations focus the abstract into a more tangible and personal level, forcing the reader to reexamine how he or she is and has been \\"faking it\\". It isn't just another sociological essay; it is an interdisplinary analysis of our society that incorporates philosophy, literature, theater, pop-culture, history and sociology. \\"Faking It\\" is a must read for anyone who has ever questioned their actions or felt alienated by their attempts to self-analyze.

It applies a few generic psychoanalytic insights to everything, borrows heavily from Zizek in places, especially in its reflections on Judaism, without anywhere acknowledging the debt, and the \\"wry wit\\" is not that witty at all, but indulgent and infinitely self-regarding.

Everyone knows that, especially children who have not yet learned they are not the only one on the planet, and their self serving rationalizations for not telling the truth are subscribed to by few. The author seems to think that applying moronic wit to the lies he perceives as being all around him somehow makes them OK, harmless, even essential in the functioning of society. This point of view, based on a level somewhere between an elementary school playground and a middle school boy's locker room, is disturbing, particularly coming from an educator.

New toasters have a heating element made from a thin conductive cord or wire wrapped around a heat resistant card that does not heat evenly or predictably, reguardless of their computerized controls.What the public needs is a simple timer controlled toaster, made with a thick wire element supported by ceramic insulators in a chromed steel body ( like a quality blender ) with slots that are wide enough and a spring capable of completely lifting the contents, wheather they are toast slices, bagles, or poptarts. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Got Burned","review":"This toaster is terrible.

I guess Kitchenaid needs to start testing their toasters before putting them on the market. We exchanged the first one for another of the same thing because we liked the design better than anything else out their, and the second one was just as bad if not worse.

Although this work is high fantasy in the tradition of Tolkien I find Duncan's work easier to read.

This disc and Baby the Stars Shine Bright are radio-poppy and seem tailored to European audiences. These discs simply lack the swing feel of the first record and the rock push of the second. Idlewild restored my faith.

If you see this book - just skip to the human face blend shapes section and see what I mean: ugly, anatomically incorrect shapes. This problem permiates through the whole publication. Don't let the cover image fool you (not the authors.)If you are new to character/organic modelling, I do not recommend this book. If your'e a little more experienced, there's a few chapters here that inspire especially later in the book.

Simmel's insightful thought, expressed in beautifully poetic language, has contributed directly to the development of organisational life-cycle theories, and especially that of I. Adizes. His way of looking at cultural development in terms of content versus form, of structure versus flexibility, of life energy versus constraints, as well as his categorisation of individual characters have proved very fertile when transplanted in the field of management. It is a pity that this debt has not been acknowledged more openly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read for Clergy!","review":"This title was recommended to me by a friend, and am glad as a pastor I read it. The author is right on target with his remarks aimed at over-worked ministers who struggle with finding energy to meet all the demands placed upon them. Jones is emphatic about clergy needing to have intentional, regular periods of rest and renewal. Drawing heavily upon the analogy of Jesus sleeping in the back of the boat during a storm, he insists that as disciples of Jesus we too need to find our way often to the back of the \\"boat.\\"This book is a great investment -- it's well worth the money and time spent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rest for those who offer rest to others.","review":"Dr. Jones has given professional caregivers permission to take the personal rest needed in order to help others find renewal and healing. He offers wisdom from personal experience combined with practical tools that offers relief from relational and institutional responsibilities. \\"Rest in the Storm\\" is a book that should become a requirement in seminaries and other universities that train people to be professional caregivers."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!","review":"I ordered this for my parents in Hawaii.

Every book is enjoyable and can be read in one sitting---except this one. The only mystery here is the reason this book was written. It started out great and had a reasonable plot---but at the end, it offered no answers! I felt cheated in a way. Normally, I like spy novels and stories, but they at least give you some of the answers---this book doesn't even give you one! While all of the other Murder, She Wrote books are great, this one is the one to miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was very disappointed.","review":"In comparison to the other books in the series, I was very disappointed by Murder in Moscow.

I generally like the unit, but it isn't out of my 30-day period yet and I am considering returning it in part because it generates a low-frequency vibration or hum when turned on. It isn't likely to be noticed by anyone, and doesn't get worse with volume increases. Probably 99.5% of people wouldn't care. It seems to be a good receiver for a low price. I gave it 4 stars because of the flexibility with the inputs - docked a point for the remote and the hum thing.

These albums are magnificen, and taken together breathtaking. Garland is in great voice, great spirits and emotional high pitch. My favorite album is the later \\"That's Entertainment,\\" where the classic M-G-M Pictures arranger Conrad Salinger enters the picture for a brilliant album which isn't exactly Capitol in feeling but more M-G-M Pictures. Don't miss that one--she is in full-bodied voice at that point, just before doing her legendary Carnegie Hall concert. Judy is a gem still shining brightly. And I met her once--a nicer lady more appreciative of her fans you would never find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible sound and terrible packaging","review":"Let me rant. This CD has 2 albums on it. 1 is mono and the other stereo!? I have these albums on records and they are both stereo. I feel ripped off. Also, these albums do not sound anywhere like the records in quality. In fact, they sound very boring and lacking of any sort of life. Judy did very big, exciting production numbers and the sound on this CD makes them sound stale and dead. I returned this CD and demanded my money back. The store clerk said I wasn't the only one.

One side will be barely toasted, the other side will vary from light brown to burnt! I'm not exaggerating. According to KitchenAid, it's not supposed to work this way and there is nothing I'm doing wrong. KitchenAid has been nice enough to replace the toaster a number of times. All of the toasters so far, have worked the same way more or less."},{"rating":"2","title":"True to Kitchenaid quality","review":"I just had to disagree with some of the other reviewers . Maybe their machines are defective but mine works like a charm . It was a Christmas gift that we use every day .

I have to agree that it didn't toast evenly but at least it looked cool and worked. Now, Kitchen Aid wants me to pay $52 for a pro-rated replacement (which is supposed to be Half Price)and I can buy it here for $63. I always thought people paid more for Kitchen Aid because of the reliability factor. A one year warranty on a $100 TOASTER makes no sense. I wanted something better than the $9.99 drugstore models and got a mediocre (though cool looking) toaster that lasted less than 3 years. I am VERY dissatisfied and will not buy another Kitchen Aid product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy!","review":"The item was delivered on time and the package and contents were undisturbed.

The HDT18PA is about the size of a mini fridge and sounds to me like any other dishwasher. Most annoying thing was the insruction manual since it did not even tell you to turn on the water before or after starting the dishwasher (so far I dont see it mattering). Vented drying (push the wash button twice when starting to toggle it on or off) doesnt seem to do anything, but my old dishwasher was the same way. It did a great job with even some pretty bad caked on rice and grease dishes. I did notice the rubber washer isnt quite big enough for my faucet, so we took one from my old rotating aerator and it worked great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haier Countertop Dishwasher","review":"It was awful. The setup wasn't what I had a problem with, such as some of the reviews I had read about it. The problems' I had with it were that it leaked and flooded my kitchen the first time I used it. All the times I tried to use it after that it would run for 5 minutes and 26ish seconds then shut off, on both the regular and heavy cycles and it NEVER completely drained the water from the unit. And I don't mean a little water was left, I mean the thing was full of water. Needless to say it didn't even clean them, I mean it didn't even run long enough for my Cascade Action Pac to dissolve. I had to tilt it in my sink in order to drain all the excess water from it when it finished its whopping 5 min 26 second cycle. It was nerve racking, heavy, and a complete waste of my time; I would say money too, but Amazon did ever so kindly reimburse me for the worthless piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your time and money","review":"I bought it on Nov. 27, 2006 and it was broken (water leaking at the bottom) after several months.

Since the warranty period already past, I was told by the representitive that they can do nothing with it. I think it must have design defects since the same problem occured for two new machines.

The cons are that the heat dry feature really is worthless, as stated in other reviews.I like it, it does a good job. It seems like it will last a long time. You do not need hot water, the heating element gets the water hot fast, just like a coffee maker. The quick release is handy. The huge drawback is that for such a large company, I have no idea why the instruction manual is so pathetic. You basically have to guess your way through it.On the heat dry, just open up the door and let them air dry. They are so hot at that point that they dry pretty quick. Overall, I am happy with this purchase. I hate washing dishes in the sink."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE","review":"This dishwasher has been a nightmare.

That's not your phone number? That must be why no one has gotten back to you.\\"; told that now the repairman would definitely get back to me and they would call back and make sure he had done so in two days. Etc.

I was very happy with the way that it worked until it just stopped. Partway thru a cycle it simply stopped and no matter what buttons I pushed it would not start again.It was just over warranty and I saw the problems that other had had and did not bother contacting the company. Instead I contacted some local repair companies. Only one would look at it and it turned out to be a design flaw. I could replace the same part over and over as it failed or give up.I can't afford either option so I am back to hand washing for now.The best advice I can give is that it seems to be the water heater is too close to a control card. Try making sure you always put really hot water in the machine so that the water heater does not have to run as much. That might be how we got more than a year out of our machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"It is true, the manual does not help much on the installation but once you figure it out, it works great.

So, it is cost effective to just buy two or three of them and use the non-working ones for parts. Once you get the sloppy assembly problems fixed, the machine will last a good while. Haier does not repair these machines under warrenty. They just replace them and all you get is another machine that won't work.

I looked in the manual and it said that the noises were normal. I ran the washer just about every day. After less than a month, the pump quit working. It would get through most of the cycle and then it would stop with all the lights flashing and just beep until it was turned off. When I opened the door, all the water was still in the bottom of the tub. All I can assume is that the pump failed. I drained the washer manually, and tried again with the exact same results. I am extremely disappointed with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coooooooooooooool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :-) *S*","review":"This book is really cool. I tells about before the animorphs.

Most of the story takes place on an Andalite Dome ship called StarSword. There are battles in space between the Andalites and the Yeerks. In this story, the Yeerk's mission is to take the Time Matrix, the most powerful time machine in the universe and also to take over an Andalite by making it a Yeerk host. The Andalites find the Time Matrix first, but the Yeerks do take over an Andalite, who just happens to be Arbron and Elfangor's prince. Elfangor and Arbron are the two main characters. Elfangor and Arbron go on many trips in space. They even go to the Taxxon home world, where the Yeerks take over Arbron and Elfangor's prince, and where Arbron gets stuck in Taxxon morph.

A blast! Ottman's music score totally blends comedy, suspense, mystery, action and romance into a really cool, Mancini-like jazzy trip. I can't stop listening to it. Similar to his \\"Usual Suspects\\" and \\"Goodbye Lover\\" in some ways, but still a total original and a big part of what makes \\"Kiss Kiss the movie\\" so much fun. The CD booklet has informative, in depth notes from Ottman and writer/director Shane Black.

I've used it about 3 times in the last 7 months. The front seat does not recline very much, not good enough for a new born and if the child in the back seat kicks the front it will move the seat, it does not lock good into place. So, besides these things its an ok stroller. oh and when I recieved the stroller one of the front wheels was broken, called for replacement, friendly customer service but I had to fax them my recipt but they sent me 2 wheels, so no complaints will the service.I have recently bought the graco duorider, hopefully it will be before Halloween, cause I'm not looking forward to using this stroller.I wish I had never bought this.

The step for the child in the back is a great addition to the stroller. My son loves to be able to get into the stroller by himself. I have had this stroller for over a year and had only the one problem. I would recommend this stroller to anyone.As an update, bought the stroller 4 and a half years ago and am still using it with my new son who is 3 months and out 9 month old foster baby.

It didn't explain this in great detail in the user manual.2. Finding out to setup AUX was also a pain.3. Programming the VCR to record a show is ridiculously hard. Instead of selecting start time and entering in the numbers on the remote you basically have to scroll to the correct time. Also after I succesfully completed the programing I didn't realize I had to hit the timer option and my show did not record. Come on JVC, most VCRs you just finish the programing and then once you close the menu the timer is automatically on.Conclusion: After two days of owning this product I returned it to my place of purchase. It felt like I was in a time warp and this was a VCR from the 80s. I was just suprised it wasn't a Betamax!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this VCR!","review":"I purchased this VCR as a replacement of another JVC VCR which stopped working after the blackout last summer. This VCR only comes with a 90day labor/parts warranty - in the past VCRs came with one year for parts. I rarely use this VCR and yesterday it recorded sound but no picture. I took out the instruction sheet and it said to use a VCR head cleaner if this happens and so I did - the VCR still does not work. I have purchased many JVC products in the past but this is by far the worst product they have made in my opinion. The remote control is hard to get used to for programming recordings. I don't know what JVC was thinking when they manufactured this product - I guess they figured that no one was buying stand alone VCRs anymore so it didn't matter.

JVC customer service says it isn't a defect and will only replace it again. Who wants another unit if it does the same thing? The auto function didn't work correctly - I finally had to manually program the channels. There is no backup battery system like on my current unit. If the power flickers, you have to reprogram everything. The display only show time and channel - you don't know where you are on the tape without pressing the display button and the display goes off after a few seconds.

After ruining about three tapes, I finally exchanged it for the same model. The very first tape that I put in got stuck and it has since eaten three more tapes.

Nothing is sacred, religion, sex, body image, politics- everything eventually takes a hit from this show. So, if you're bored by the same old, same old tame tv, give this a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"omigod this is awful","review":"Barely know what to say here. I saw one reviewer state that Six of Nine was the worst thing about this show. I think its worse than that. I think she's the best thing about TTR, and I'm not going beyond her visual appeal here, because there is none. The writing is horrible, its not the least bit funny, and although the animation is quite good,...its just terrible. I can't imagine that even 13 year olds would go for it. Maybe stupid 13 year olds. I gave it one star because I couldn't submit my review otherwise, but I don't really mean it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rifters","review":"This is an interesting way of presenting sci fi. The show is full of comedic adult content. From a perverted captain to a sex slave science officer.The show is alot of fun for anyone that enjoys parodies of famous sic fi movies and TV. Would recommend this product to anyone that just wants to sit back and laugh at the misadventures of the strangest crew the stars have ever seen.The biggest problem with the series is the casting change of Six every season. Gina Gershon did season 1 and I think she really did the best job out of the 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Clowns Gather","review":"Why has no-one I know ever heard of this gem?

I don't like Tripping the Rift.It's not very funny, original, or well written. You may see some \\"unique\\" plots (the first episode gave me a bit of hope) but you've seen almost all of these jokes before, and they were much funnier the first time. Imagine a lame children's show, altered at the last minute to include bad language and cleavage.Speaking of cleavage, don't let the \\"adult oriented\\" label fool you. It's relatively tame. This show is on the SciFi network, not HBO. The same applies to \\"edgy\\" storylines - the only thing that's funny is how weak and watered-down they are.The animation is competent, at best. Everything is minimal, simplified, and looks like plastic. Ships, backgrounds, etc. are designed in the most lazy and unoriginal way possible.This DVD is for FANS ONLY. If you already like the show, enjoy. If it's new to you, rent it first. Please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terry Farrell","review":"guys, you're both right... there are two versions of the original TRIPPING THE RIFT in existence, one with Terry Farrell and one with the other girl. anyway, the original RULEZ, and the TV series is quite hilarious, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Resource Unless You Have Gluten Allergies","review":"I bought this book after purchasing my Green Star Juicer. I thought it would give more juice recipes than it did. Also, I have a gluten allergy/intolerance and this book has several recipes using wheat, barley and rye. The whole point of my buying a juicer and a book to go with it was to have lots of healing juice recipes and other healthy foods.

The only way I'd recommend this book is if the buyer didn't have any allergies or food sensitivities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential for raw fooders","review":"I love the cookies and pies recipes in this book.

Well, if you're reading this Greg the movie with Anthony Perkins and Tuesday Weld is coming to DVD in September and will most likely be loaded with special features since that Fox just launched their \\"Cinema Classics\\" feature. Now let's see if the studio will release the original \\"Bedazzled\\" in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please release the remake !","review":"Fox-TV did a remake of this movie in September 1996. It features Grant Show and Wendy Benson (in the Tony Perkins and Tuesday Weld roles) and is really quite good, possibly even better than the original. Still no home video of it though. I have it on tape taken from the original TV broadcast, but it\`s chock full of commercials. The role of the girl\`s mother played by Beverly Garland in the original is played by Michelle Phillips (of the Mamas and Papas). Fox : Please release ! It would be fun for people to compare the two (like the two versions of Brian\`s Song)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Movie","review":"I can't see what all of the adulation is over this movie, I think it was really cheesy and the acting was terrible! I like Tuesday Weld, but she and Anthony Perkins really were awful in this movie. Terrible acting, silly, inane plot, I don't see why everyone thinks this movie is so great. I must agree with the reviewer that didn't like it, I was very disappointed after reading all of the positive reviews, it just was of poor quality all the way around, in my opinion. I would never recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Tuesday Weld, but this movie is horrible!","review":"Do not waste your time with this movie! I bought it because I'm a huge fan of Tuesday Weld (she is SO sexy!) and because of all the positive reviews, but this movie is laughable - and not in a good way! The plot is totally unbelieveable with huge holes in it every time you turn around. It makes the viewer groan throughout. It's rated R, but I have no idea why - it should be either G or PG (absolutely no nudity - not even cleavage, less violence than a typical TV show, and no bad language). The only possible appeal this movie would have for anyone is that it is so (unintentionally) campy!Honestly - all the positive reviews here have to be planted. I understand that tastes for movies vary among different people, but if you make the mistake of watching this - I honestly believe you will have to agree with my review. This movie simply has no redeeming qualities whatsoever...there is simply NO WAY it could garner so many really positive reviews honestly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly bad acting","review":"Is everybody reviewing the same movie?

As much as I want to own\\"Pretty Poison\\", \\"Double Indemnity\\", \\"Stolen Face\\" or evenEdward Cahn's 1957 B-movie \\"She-Creature\\" on DVD, I am NOT going to replace my $1200. Denon DVD player just so I can view these region 2 discs. It's the height of cultural sacrilege that nearly all of these films were American made and yet none have been released here on DVD. And since all they really care about is money, studios like Fox, who just now released \\"Pretty Poison\\" for the first time on DVD, could only rake in more of it if they had simply released the DVD in Region 0 format. That way, they'd gain worldwide sales."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"The quality of these products is great, the scent is beautiful & you get two full size products, not the smaller travel size. It's a good value. I would highly recommend it to anyone either as a gift or for themselves. Its great in the winter when your skin tends to be drier to have the lotion right there to use after you wash your hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly luxurious","review":"This scent can make you feel like a new woman. In the middle of a hectic day, I can wash my hands with Rosewater and feel swept away to another world. Applying the hand lotion keeps the scent lingering. It's nice and creamy, not too greasy, making it a wonderful compliment to the soothing liquid soap.If I had one thing to say that would be a con it would be the price. This stuff doesn't last forever... maybe that's because I'm using it all the time, but that makes it pricey for just being soap and lotion. The metal holder is nice too, but still doesn't make it totally worth the cost. I buy it every other time I buy lotion and soap for the bathroom.It does, however, make an awesome gift for a mother, sister, friend, mother-in-law, co-worker, etc. My mother-in-law loved it and is asking for more already!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Iron Heel bogged down by its own weight","review":"Jack London's efforts at social novels, such as \\"Iron Heel\\" and \\"Martin Eden\\" were failures, because they are very cardboard and unconvincing. Jack London, the master story teller of the juvenile boys adventure novels, had a social conscience, but was not very good with expressing the social issues of the day, issues which usually belong in manifestos, not in literature. Jack London was no Dostoievsky, a true literary giant."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book - take time to read it!","review":"One of the unsung classics. Although firmly rooted in the vernacular and zeitgeist of the early twentieth century, Jack London was ahead of his time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Diary of A Death Foretold of Labor","review":"I have read nearly all London's works. The Iron Heel is not as wellknown. He weaves a tale of fact and some fiction of the crushing ofthe union movement in Chicago. A diary of relentenless persecution, by friends and foes of organized labor and how it is done. A Marketing Strategy of Demonizing and Crushing The Poor Working Stiff, or any movement that questions motives.Interesting read"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Edition is Missing a Crucial Chapter!","review":"This edition is incomplete. The editors chose to cut out London's all-important Foreward, which sets the \\"novel\\" up as an incomplete manuscript discovered centuries after its writing. Buy the Lawrence Hill version, which has a biting introduction by a contemporary critic of the US and its antidemocratic secret police forces."},{"rating":"2","title":"A foreboding tale","review":"I have consistently believed that Jack London's social writings are even better than his fictional works. The Iron Heel actually gives a realistic though (on a time scale) exaggerated view of the oppression of individual rights under a government based on a symbiosis between business and the state. London predicted the rise of European fascism with chilling accuracy. London was brilliant to have seen the evils of an all powerful state, but he errs in believing the working class is the only hope against totalitarianism. This work will appeal to social thinkers, historians, literary junkies, science fiction addicts, the dispossessed, as well as people of mass wealth. It would be worth reading once, but it gets better with each subsequent reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious Cover Designed by Non-Reader","review":"The Iron Heel is a dystopian novel set in 1912 (written in 1908), predicting an onset of capitalist oligarchy and anyone buying this edition hoping for some BDSM titillation will be sorely disappointed.That said, this is a very interesting book. Although its characters are not nearly as emotionally engaging as those in either 1984 or Brave New World, it is well enough written (especially the violent climax - action, is, after all, London's forte) to be worth reading on its own merits."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great little powerhouse","review":"I have had this player for about a week now and I have to say that I am very impressed. It plays DVD-R disks that other players wouldn't even recognize. It also plays damaged sections of the disk without a skip or stutter. If you are looking for your first dvd player or an upgrade you can't go wrong with this JVC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clean Start","review":"My first DVD player, and a real pleasure. Silky operation, extremely easy setup (rational menus!!), and - especially - a very elegant user interface. Icons and status text are unobtrusive but clear, and don't get in the way of the movie experience. Having used a wide array of other DVD players, this is a huge relief - no alphabet-block, screen-filling GUIs!I'm using this player with a veteran 21\\" Toshiba set with no very sophisticated features, but the JVC seems prepped for the wide-screen set I'll someday get. Rock solid play - no skips and blips. Though I'm still exploring all its options, so far it's a genuine delight."},{"rating":"1","title":"It WAS the player....","review":"Yes, it was a problem with the N50. It would happen with all different output modes, and would come up almost on cue when I fast-forwarded through a section. I recently returned the JVC and bougt a Pioneer DV-563AS, and have had no such issues with the same movies in any player mode, progressive or not. This is a problem that JVC shoull adress, as it is a shame that an affordable player such as the XVN series with so many good features suffers fro this.Here is a review site (CNET) that talks about the problem on the silver (XVN-55SL) player.http://reviews.cnet.com/JVC_XV_N55SL/4505-6473_7-30459924.html?tag=pdtl-listSkip this one and go for either the Panasonic S55S or the above-mentioned Pioneer (unfortunately, both only available in silver)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice except on-screen instructions","review":"So far, so good with this DVD player: nice playback, quick transition to the \\"other side\\" of the DVD, and I even actually like the lit-up blue line on the front.EXCEPT . . . I find it very difficult to make out the words in the on-screen DVD-player instructions, settings, etc. brought up in various menus. The font size is too small and too unclear. If I'm sitting at an angle to the TV, there's no way I can read it. Even my very first VCR with on-screen instructions was easier to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plays everything but stutters sometimes","review":"I bought this player because I was so satisfied with other JVC products (like my TV). The unit has played all the DVDs I threw at it and without any hesitation loading (my old player had a lot of trouble loading). But then I noticed that during pans and fast action that it appeared as though the image was stuttering... If I stop the player and press play again right away the stuttering goes away for 30 to 90 seconds before it comes back- very ugly 8-(. I don't care about features when the play quality is this bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves bad taste in mouth for JVC products.","review":"Bought this DVD player in May and was very happy with it until about 1 mo after it when it stopped playing CD's and VCD's. It still plays DVD's, however. It's features are great and it's look is nice too. When writing to JVC, received bad customer service. Will never buy JVC products again.

The story is lovely and warm, deceptively simple and so engaging. It focuses on the loving interaction between the little penguin and the grown up as they go through the day to bedtime. The book is open ended--there is no gender identified for the child or the adult penguin, and the adult could be any loving caregiver. As for the illustrations, I love the bright colors and strong but simple images (in the same ball park as Lucy Cousins' illustrations as in her Maisy books or \\"Za-Za's Baby Brother\\"). When I read this with my children, we love to act out the lines, for example, \\"I like it when you hold my hand.\\" This book is particularly nice as a bedtime story. \\"I Like It When...\\" is such a gem--I give it as a gift all the time because I know it will be enjoyed by any young child and their caregivers, and it is rare for someone to already have it. I can't recommend it highly enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't help for AEPA...at all!","review":"If you have the AEPA in your future this book will not help you at all, and it should not even be listed on the cover of this book!

It was the best of INXS, with an edge -- and with better production. The three singles from the album, 'Sometimes' (my fave), 'Way of the World,' and 'Ghost of the Year' (which probably had the best public response) were all written by Ollie, but would never have reached our ears if not for Hutchence's incredible voice.This album directly followed the INXS album 'Kick' and paired these two friends, who had done some music for films during the 80's. While it didn't do well in the charts, this is one of those albums where every single song is good.If you're a fan of INXS, you'll love this album, plain and simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling waste of money","review":"Badly written, badly structured, and of minimal practical use.

Back to basics hard rock from Ace and the band, featuring Anton Fig on drums. One correction must be noted on these previous reviews: Peter Criss does not sing lead on anything here. Peter does do some background vocals on \\"2 young 2 Die\\" and the title track, as well as some cowbell playing on \\"trouble walkin\\", but that's it! It's Richie Scarlet on lead vocals on \\"2 Young\\", not Peter Criss. Just an FYI.

The cover of ELO's DoYa is not as good as ELO but it grows on you. If you were ever into Kiss around the 80's this has a similar sound, with Ace's own touches.

And it's the kind of new-age, oblivious breed of racism that is ironically based in a compulsion to be \\"diverse\\" and politically correct.The depiction of the black family was too stereotypical - and thus offensive - for words. It almost became a satire of middle-class liberal racism, because the story of \\"Malcolm and Momma Jo\\" is obviously the way that the authors perceive the lifestyle of a typical African American family. Sroufe, et al should be ashamed of themselves.These comments are meant to be constructive. I'm actually passionate about my psychology studies, have a 4.0 and hope to be a psychiatrist.

The authors' racism just shines through for the first 150 pages, and I doubt it will get better as I continue to read. And they're lack of self awareness to their prejudice is just scary.

Until now, I had not heard any of his recordings.First, something positive. Newman is a technician of the keyboard, he exhibits a lot of ability.Unfortunately, the virtuosity he displays happens to be his downfall. Everything is over the line of being too fast. Although he does not get to the degree Virgil Fox did, he still goes way over the line. Particularly for organ works such as those of Franck, Newman's excessively fast tempi kill much of the artistic value of the composer's works. His registration sounds off a bit too. Finally, the sound quality of the recording is not great either.I recommend staying away from this recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not last long","review":"I bought this for our office and was extremely dissatisfied with it.

My favorite songs are Gutter Ballet, Temptation Revelation (piano and guitar), When The Crowds Are Gone (excellent vocals by Jon), Silk & Steel (acoustic guitar), Hounds (haunting heavy rocker), and Summer's Rain (a good ballad).

This book is well illustrated, with pictures of the grape varieties themselves, different vineyards/countries and wine labels. I also like Walton's writing style: you can tell that he really knows wine and that it is a real passion for him. On occasion, he refers to the different grape varieties as though they are people!This is a terrifically comprehensive book, and if you already have a working knowledge of wine this book is a great addition.

A primer should contain more entry-level concepts. This book seems to be an attempt on the author's part to demonstrate his vast knowledge as a programmer. Ok, we're impressed, but it does not help us learn. He will give a cursory explanation of a concept and present a snippet of code. The code invariably contains some concept not explained in the previous text, but possibly addressed in subsequent chapters. This is not helpful. The text immediately after the code snippet also does not explain the code example, but merely moves on to the next topic. There are no graphics, no full programs examples, and no organization. Full program examples are crucial in a primer. This book should be renamed to \\"Advanced C++ Programming\\".

I use it so much because it goes into great detail in explaining the theories behind the code. On the down side, there are very few complete programs listed (if any) and the subjects jump around the book a lot (e.g., STL string). However, I find this helps in my understanding by forcing me to completely digest the subject before being able to make the code work in my programs.If you are looking for code snippets, this is not for you.

This book will help you the most once you have a firm initial grasp on the language. I found Lippman's coverage of most of the language very good. His coverage of objects, however, seemed a bit too terse. I kept waiting for him to say things he never did. That aside, however, this is a great book for the person who wants to shore up his knowledge of C++. This book goes way beyond any of the \\"21 days\\" kind of books.

Whoever made the decision to write this book this way should be forced to program in Prolog for the next 6 months or read the entire \\"War And Peace\\" while standing on one foot. You don't present material early in a book and then explain it many chapters later! This goes against the human thought proccess.

Both books are not for novices to C or C++, so any harsh comments on this book from beginners should not deter intermediate to advanced C++ programmers from reading it. This book is concise, logical, to the point, and no extraneous, redundant explanations. Just like what K&R's C is. Through careful reading, I was able to follow 95-99% of the material, which is much better percentage than I was doing with Stroupstrup's (maybe less than 75%). If you are a C++ practitioner going for job interviews, each page in this book is a gem, clearly written,concise interview questions. I was programming in C++ for 4 years before I thoroughly read this book, and I feel like I know everything about C++ at this point (ok, maybe 9 out of the scale of 1-10)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crud.

It served my purpose extremely well as a refresher to C++ after several years. Certainly, Stroustrup offers better coverage of more complex topics - however, as a general purpose textbook, this is good. Indispensable to me, more so than the second edition that I was still using. If you are a beginner or an exprerienced C++ programmer looking for a refresher, this is a good book.

There is almost nothing of value her for beginning C++ programmers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting but Variable","review":"This is collection of essays from the late George Mosse, the author of the outstanding The Crisis of the German Ideology. Compared with that book, this is a modest contribution but written with Mosse's typical combination of erudition, clear exposition, and insight. The different essays examine different aspects of European fascism, avoiding concentrating on Germany by discussing Italian, French, Belgian, and other forms of fascism. The depth of these essays vary considerably with the title essay being the most ambitious, a effort to sketch out the general features of European fascism (for more extensive efforts, see Stanley Payne's book and the recent long essay by Robert Paxton).

I was very disappointed after borrowing it from the library. The book rarely offered anything new or challenging. Many of the topics that the author highlighted are just common sense. Thus, a reader will walk away from the book and would not feel as if he/she had learned anything. To be fair, I did not finish the book, I finished 3/4 of it. But completing 3/4 of the book is quite a difficult task; it was quite difficult to stay awake and concentrated on the material. I felt obligated to write this review because I thought that the ratings of this book are very inaccurate and I should help potential readers from wasting their time/money. One star is the lowest rating that can be given here, but given a choice a 0 star rating would be more appropriate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just kicking open doors","review":"This book deserves some merit as a summary of important ideas.

Those of us old enough to remember the 80'S realize they were the worst of times for music and I realized that maybe RT was just having to go with the flow on this one! I will say that on a couple of tracks there are some great guitar solos that I found myself skipping to and for those who enjoyed the 80'S style of music would probably like this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"What if you had never heard of Robin Trower ?","review":"This is a fine release.It's not a sellout.It's not a copout.It IS a stellar guitarist of the 1st order on his musical quest.This has excellent songs, in a modern format.Sure, the guitarwork is present.Davey Pattison is the best vocalist for Trower, this side of James Dewar (now deceased).Glen Letsch is on bass. So the bass is brighter, then the older material.This release has some great songs : Climb Above the Rooftops, Turn the Volume Up, which rock in the best, Trower style.The beautiful , slow, If You Really Want To Find The Love, gives us the very soulful side of Trower's music.Jimi Hendrix had more commonality, then sounds with Robin.Hendrix felt that many fans stopped evolving past Foxey Lady.Robin Trower has fans who never crossed - The Bridge Of Sighs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful product!","review":"I only have good things to say about this product!!!

When it arrives in Sweden it has an american plug and needs 110V. The problem is, the power is so high, that there are no commercially available transformers to use. We ended up having to throw the whole thing away without using it.

We were going to have eight guests but instead only six were able to come. Ultimately, we were glad for that considering it would have been quite cramped had we had eight people using the grill. If you plan accordingly, however, that is not a problem.We are very satisfied with grill. We used the top surface to grill some meats and vegetables. Even though it was used for a while and therefore had a lot of burnt on residue, it was easy to clean. Also, the trays for the cheese were easy to use, the cheese slides of really well, and the trays and scrapers were also easy to clean as long as you don't allow the cheese to bake on.All in all we are very happy with it and just need to find more excuses to use it. A small suggestion: authentic raclette cheese is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"do it yourself grilling","review":"This is a great change of pace way to grill.

I was very excited to find this on Amazon.com, I ordered it and we have had some fun dinners at home.I highly recommend this Raclette grill. The only problem I've had with it so far is that the cheese trays are only allong 2 sides of the grill and therefore, the people at the heads of the table have to reach around to get their cheese ... but we have not found this too difficult or limiting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Perfectly!","review":"This raclette grill is great. I don't agree with the description that claims this is an 8-person grill, but is a good size for four. It cleans up easily, and the rectangular shapes of the top and the plates are much more practical than the oval models with wedge-shaped plates. The adjustable temperature control is a nice feature to have, too.One bit of advice...it will get warm around the table, so this is better used for outdoor cooking or used on cooler evenings. We had a raclette dinner earlier this week when the daytime temperature had been 100+ degrees, and my husband asked if my true intention was to make him the entree, since he was being cooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Racelette grill works great","review":"We purchased this grill after using a similar grill in Europe.

I tried to find out what the dimensions of the raclettes offered are, but without success. There was no answer to get anywhere. The dimensions listed on this page are obviously bogus, Amazon can not be contacted and Swissmar doesn't answer to emails. So finally I decided to just order one and was really disappointed: this raclette is much smaller than the raclettes I'm used to from home. The size of the grill plate is just 24 cm x 36 cm. The dishes are just 8.5 x 8.5 cm. The dishes are all lined up to the two sites, you can't turn the handles of the ones at the end to the front sides. If you sit around a rectangular table, the guests at the front ends of the table will have trouble to reach theirs.

They glow in the dark and it's very cool to see them fly across the room in the darkness. Score one for the novelty factor! They aren't that durable because the glow is just a paper covering over the dart and over time they come loose, so you have to be extra careful to make them last. In nerf wars, I don't use these darts because they are more fragile than the other ones and I care more than hitting the other guy than seeing them whizz through the room in the dark.I think it speaks volumes about it's popularity as this the only type of dart that Nerf doesn't make in 30 packs, but if you want glow in the dark darts, Nerf makes the only ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two boys' review: Negatives outweigh the glow gimmick","review":"We bought a packet of these glow-in-the-dark Nerf darts for our sons'Nerf Nite Finder EX-3.

My favorite poems include: \\"The Backslider's Prayer\\" which takes a spin off of Isaiah 6:8 \\"Here I am, send me\\" to \\"Here I am, send them\\".

Some of their features are pretty cool also. When a call comes in, it rings my home phone and cell phone at the same time. That way if I'm waiting for an important call - I can pick it up on either phone. I can also view all my incoming and outgoing calls on the internet, almost instantly. So, I can view my call log while I'm at work and see who called during the day. Also, the quality is just as good as my old land line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same problem with dropped connections.","review":"I have a Linksys 802B unit that works perfectly.

He told me to switch channels. Only problem was I told him I was losing the connection at the router on an ethernet connection. Nothing has changed except the router and my wireless phone. It is a 5.8 gig unit with that frequency on the base unit and the handset. Shouldn't be a problem.I changed my SSID,enabled the WEP, and changed my default password. Oh yeah, perish the thought, I forwarded a port.I think I'm sending this back and getting the AT&T; adaptor.

I am guessing with a new unit I will have the same issues. Internet connection will drop out periodically. Until they recall it or update the firmware. Will a firmware upgrade fix the issue? Maybe. When will it arrive?? I will probably be taking mine back. Might give AT&T one more attempt to keep me as a customer by calling their help line.

The router kept resetting itself (both the wireless and the ethernet) every few minutes, and seems that when it came back online it didnt use the security settings for the wireless account and so other people were able to access my wireless network. I currently use a Belkin product with the phone adapter provided by AT&T and thinks work just fine.

I have no complaints there, and signup with CallVantage was easy. Configuration is a breeze for those with previous Linksys routers. But the wireless sucks! This replaced a WRT45G which had excellent signal strenght all the time, with a signal of -50 dBm on average; with this router, in the same location as the other one, I get good-very good signal strength at about -70 dBm. Obviously wireless connection speeds suffer as a result of this. I forked out for some high-gain antennas, which was also a waste of money, as the singal strength didn't improve one bit. Also support is terrible - I don't think any of the Linksys techs I spoke to even knew they have VoIP products on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from CallVantage","review":"I had the following problems with AT&T; CallVantage:1.

Overpriced.5. There were taxes and fees on my monthly statement that weren't disclosed when I signed up.I have since switched to a company called Teliax and am very happy with them.

It's like a movie made by a college student, making it as he learns new lessons about movies. The quality of the images and of the sound aren't good (I know are the 70's). The stunts have their faces painted in gray trying to look pale, and black people have them in white, sometimes the film it's like a National Geographic report with a guy in V.O., explaining what zombies are. And the dialogues are irrtating. I think the new version (2004) it's a little better.

The main character, Mary, reminded me of some females that I have had relationships with: stubborn, professional, and sexy. The motive of the killer was believable because the author did a fine job of presenting his background in sufficient detail for the reader to understand how a killer came to be. There are some philosophical themes in the book that deal with race, politics, and society but they all are relevant to the plot. I appreciate that the author did not preach. I'm going to stay on the lookout for this author's next book because his first one was a fine effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and badly written","review":"The ideas this books deals with are truly important: internalized oppression and racism and what they can do to minorities.The execution is lamentable. On almost every other page there's an image that doesn't work, a sentence that doesn't scan. The sex scenes are silly when they strive to be erotic.It was painful to see such promising material delivered in such a slapdash way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I bought it","review":"I didn't know about this book until I read a review in the newspaper. The idea of a killer who chose his victims because they were not black enough intrigued me because I had never heard of such a plot before. So the originality criteria had been met. What remained was to see whether the author could fulfill the potential. He certainly did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Lively, Especially for a Thriller","review":"This book should be riveting, based on its premise. Instead, it is clunky and trite. The story isn't so much a reversal of a common theme as a parading of all the usual cliches, done in a slightly different manner. The characters are almost all unappealing or uninteresting, and Mary should have been drawn better. The book is fairly easy to read, but the author's skill is merely adequate, not up to the level of most thriller-writers, let alone Michael Connelly. Read The Poet if you want a story of psychological suspense. Most authors do it better than Sterling, so wait for him to develop into a writer before you spend money on one of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great start, mediocre finish","review":"Kudos to Sterling on his first novel! His writing style and character development don't give the impression that he's a rookie. I enoyed this book immensely for several reasons. The plot was very unique and the characters as well. It's imporatant in a thriller that the characters not be predicatable and Sterling accomplished that aspect with flying colors. The back cover made me get the book, the first chapter made me hate to put it down. However the ending left something to be desired. It was disappointing to see the book end in such a boring way. All the gusto that went into the first 20 pages, should have multiplied by the end. I felt cheated. Nonetheless, I do look forward to Sterling's sophomore attempt. All in all it was a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"CHILLING!","review":"I normally do not read mysteries, but this one caught my eye. I definitely had to read this one with all of the lights on in the house...even the cover way eerie! I think Mr. Sterling did a great job with this book. He paced it well and carried the reader through until the end. It is rare that the \\"serial killer\\" is black. He put a whole new spin to black on black racism. He is definitely going to give James Patterson a run for his money."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's old is new","review":"Underneath the main story of cop vs killer is a morality story as old as mankind and which will always be relevant. I'm talking about reaping what you sow. At the beginning of the story one of the characters commits a terrible act that sets into motion circumstances that are played out during the rest of the story. The character trys desperately to run from his shameful past but ultimately must pay the price of his misdeeds. The storyline is not new but the way that it is told is. When you think about it, no story is really new. So a writer's skill is equivalent to how well he fools us into thinking that it is, or in not caring that it's not because it's so well done. By those measures, this author deserves an excellent rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"It kept moving","review":"I agree with the majority of other reviews that this was a pretty good story. What I liked best though was the pacing. I hate stories that take forever to start. In this book, events took off from the Prologue and there were no real slow or uneventful chapters. What I would suggest to the author, though, is not to carry a good thing too far. I wanted the book to be a bit longer, but not by adding fat. Maybe an additional chapter or two focusing on the interactions between the killer and his father would have given the book more weight. But what there was of this book was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caught off guard","review":"I admit that most of my leisurely reading is mind candy. I bought Cookie Cutter because I figured it would be like other plots about serial killers and that I would be able to read it while doing several other things at the same time. No way. My underutilized mind almost exploded trying to keep up with all that was happening in the book. It was a close call but I survived. I won't take this author lightly again.

That's exactly what happened to me! I started on January 18th (nine weeks ago) and I finally quit in disgust a few days ago. What WAS true is that you lose your food cravings during the day (I stuck to protein and vegetables/salad during breakfast and lunch.) What is NOT TRUE is that your daily reward meal (usually at dinner) will enable you to lose weight. In other words, my food craving stopped, but I didn't lose weight! As a matter of fact, I started gaining weight in weeks two, three and four before again reversing. I agree in principle with everything said in this book (including the need to regulate insulin/blood sugar.)

My cravings for carbs increased, and I would binge for several days, then try again. IF you can stay on the diet, it will work, but a realistic lifetime eating program? NO WAY!

Eating nothing but proteins is no more healthy than an all sugar or fat diet."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste","review":"The Carbohydrate Addict's Diet plan is hogwash.

Also, this diet seems like it would be dangerous for diabetics. It has been a while since I read the book, maybe they address that topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A TREAT WHEN YOU EAT !","review":"I like this book very much ! I followed this diet with a friend and she an I were trying to lose weight . Guess what, THE DIET DID WORK ! The book tells you what you have to eat thru the course of the day with foods that are low in carbohydrates. You can decide which meal of the day you choose to have your goodies (TREATS).For EXAMPLE: If you want a Treat for breakfast it can only be with that meal. You can decide when you want to eat your treat, either it be lunch or dinner its up to you. But It will only be that one meal of the day that you choose. You CANNOT eat your TREATS in every meal. Of course, we incorporated EXCERCISE which also helped in the process to lose weight. I'm the type of person who likes VARIETY, so I have many books on diet and nutrition. So when I get bored with one diet I can choose another. When I do find the BEST diet for me, I will tell all you readers out there about it! Stay motivated and be forever fit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even 1 star, I'd give it -5 if I had the choice","review":"I tried this diet because, like Rachel Heller I have PCOS. The quiz said that I was severely insulin resistant (and an endocrinologist recently confirmed this). I followed this diet and if anything, it made my symptoms worse. I had horrible mood swings and could not concentrate because I had a foggy feeling. My blood sugar was at an all time high when I was on this diet and I did not lose any weight. I noticed an immediate improvement of my symptoms and a return of energy when I went on Weight Watchers and started eating several small meals a day balanced with both carbohydrates and protien and I lost 30 pounds within 6 months. Buyer beware, it didn't work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A passing fad!","review":"I tested to be a severe carbo addict and tried the diet for four days. Eating only meat and select vegtables made me feel light headed and sick. I could easily lose weight on this diet because the more I got into it the less I wanted to eat ONLY because it made me nausiated to think of eating some of the foods. My sweet tooth INCREASED because all you are allowed to eat are salty foods. What makes most people succesful on this diet is the fact they are consuming less and eating more veggies. Everyone is looking for the fast and easy way out -- there is none! Since most fat people like me have low self-esteem and little will-power, I'm afraid this too shall pass!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, I,ve found a solution to my weight problem!!!","review":"When I read the book.

And that is what I did, but nothing happened.I followed the plan strictly, even went to the plan D where you skip one of your complimentary meals. I was constantly hungry, but stuck with the plan D for three weeks since I thought my weight would actually start going down.But as I said, I've had it.

The low-carb breakfasts and lunches (the recommended times for the low-carb meals) made me crave carbs even more--all day long--and I loaded up at dinner.

There is no miracle diet for anyone; and this one proved to me that moderation is the key. (And, years later, I still have a problem with craving carbs--which I attribute to the fact that I \\"deprived\\" myself of them while on this diet--even for that short period of time.)

You anxiously await your reward meal, as visions of pizza and cookies dance in your head. However, after a full day of eating very little, your stomach is going to shrink. I know mine did. So, you race home, light-headed & starving, and begin shoving in the food as fast as you can before your \\"hour\\" is up. Only a few bites into your lasagna (or pizza, burgers, etc) you're stuffed. You have to wait 15-20 minutes to digest. But, guess what? The clock is ticking, and you still want to get that precious chocolate cake in.It's hard to enjoy your reward meal, because you can't take the time to really savor it. Generally, people eat dinner, wait awhile, then have dessert. You need a little time to let the food settle. An hour isn't enough time.

This diet is meant to wean you from carbohydrates - something that makes so sense to me or to the Food Triangle for that matter.I also question the wisdom of a diet that advocates skipping breakfast and lunch.

The problem with this diet is that during the day I feel light-headed and, as a student, have trouble with my memory. By dinner time, my reward meal, I am starving. For example, I can wolf down a bowl of pasta, a bowl of cereal, a huge bagel, and a peanut butter sandwich within an hour and still feel hungry. I hardly see how consuming over a thousand calories in an hour is going to benefit me. I know carbohydrates are the reason I'm overweight (seeing as how I eat under 1,500 calories a day and jog 5 miles without losing a pound), but it seems as if a fine balance between them and protein is the way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"worked for me","review":"I started this diet in 1993 and stayed on it for a total of 9 years.

It didn't work for me. The style of eating was not natural, and the tendency to binge on the one-a-day reward meal meant that my weight loss was non-existent. Last January I started the Zone diet, which is a sensible eating program that has a similar goal - stabilizing insulin and blood sugar levels. This is October. After 9-1/2 months, I have lost 58 pounds, 11 inches from my waist, and 9 inches from my hips.

Unfortunately, it didn't. I may have lost a pound or two, but nothing significant. I did really well during the day, but by the time I got to my Reward Meal, I had a hard time controlling my portions. I seem to do better if I count calories, because I think very hard before I put ANY food in my mouth. Since I didn't have to count with this plan, I know I ate too much at the Reward Meal.

The Yo-Yo book predates the larger trade book and if you are reading both together, you may get confused and not get the full effect of this eating system.

The only problems I ever have are when I decide that I don't need to follow the way of eating anymore, and then I begin to gain again.

(No pun intended) Well, I lost 32 pounds and am still losing. And I feel great. Lost most cravings, started paying attention to real hunger cues, etc. The plan is so versatile, I can fit it into my lifestyle easily (eating out frequently and irregularly) and don't have to tell a host/hostess -- I can't eat that. Usually I can eat anything because I plan ahead; using the reward meal whenever I want to. And if I don't follow it for a while, I don't feel I have to beat myself up. No guilt trip here.

I loved this last installment, because Sookie has grown to become so much stronger than the naive young women she was in the first women. In this book, there are no sex scenes, although there's sill sexual innuendo and potential partners, since the focus switches to the world of shifters and weres. I loved learning about the politics among the different groups, and seeing a new side to Alcide's character.

The narration, nonetheless, is smooth with good production values.If I had my druthers, I would rather Harris backed off a bit on Sookie's love life-- her sensual assessment of every man who gets near her starts to pall after a while-- I would also like her to tighten up the mystery a bit. The mystery took second place to all the supernatural high jinx and the book was not the better for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"You just can't help and eat them all up","review":"In this fifth installment of the Sookie Stackhouse series, I could not put it down, just like all the previous ones.

However, I miss the romance that existed in the first three books, and that is what lost this one book one star in the rating. I really hope Sookie and Bill get back together, or for Eric to quit being a jerk and realize he loves her. Bring back the romance and I'll boost up the score!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Book had some stains","review":"The book got here way before the projected delivery date, which was good. The book pages had some stains on them though, and a few of them were ripped. Not really a big issue though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Wonderful Book","review":"This book is chock full of action and excitement! It's a good link to the last book, and many questions left over from the previous 4th book are well answered, as well as new ones asked, making the reader eager to go on to book 6. The author has another winner!I have read some of Ms Harris' other series, but the Sookie Stackhouse stories are magical and entertaining!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Chinese Food Book","review":"Poorly written and barely coherent. Full of plot holes. The main character can't decide if she is sexy or a prude. Her ESP only works when it's convenient as a plot point. Lots of people do stupid things. I've already forgotten what this book was about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left me high and dry","review":"This is my least favorite installment so far out of 1-5 that i've read. I don't like how Eric and Bill took a back seat in this book (come back!). There was practically zero romance (for lack of a better word). The story line was all about finding out the sniper shooter and more development of the Weres (snooze). The ending was surprising though. Random but still surprising. Hopefully the next installment will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Good As The Others","review":"I didn't enjoy this one as much as the others. It seemed like it wasn't wrote as well. Ms. Harris appeared to want to get to the end of it in a hurry. The new characters that are introduced in this one aren't described well and the familiar characters don't form any kind of true bond with them. The newer characters (were-panthers) that were wrote about last book aren't developed anymore in detail either even though it's were-animals getting shot. I think the idea of the book was a good one but it was almost like Ms. Harris treated this as a middle book that she had a lot to get accomplished in and was going to do it in a very little amount of pages. Just too rushed. You have to read it though if you are a fan of the series because some things get said that I think you may want to know for the next book. I'll probably continue reading but if this is the way she is going to continue with writing the series then I may not read many more of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable as always, but......","review":"if you are interested in reading book 5 in this series than you're a fan and I can leave out a synopsis of the series. I just finished book four, which I felt was the best so far (I'm a Sookie/Eric fan) and I was excited to read the next book. Overall the story was very good, but not great. This particular story seemed more like a zig zagging grouping of side stories than one continuous thread.Also, there not enough sexual tension between Sookie and any one particular male character, in fact yet more male creatures \\"hot for Sookie\\" have been introduced, which is getting a bit \\"odd\\". Though my husband, who's read all the books already say's their a method to their madness so I'm willing to overlook that.But, all in all, even a \\"so-so\\" Sookie Stackhouse mystery is better than most other paranormal mysteries, so I'd still suggest it for other Sookie fans.4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Continues to entertain","review":"Once again a Charlaine Harris continues to entertain and capture the reader - great summer time reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle Edition has typo's!!!","review":"I loved the story, but was a little distracted by the typo's that appeared in the kindle edition. I previously owned a hard copy and didn't notice these errors before; they were mainly problems with word spacing in different sections. Perhaps the coding was messed up in the transfer to Kindle edition. Two words are commonly printed together, likethis. Irritating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not her best","review":"I enjoyed this novel but it wasn't the best in the series. There are many stories going on and Sookie's love life is up for grabs. This book is setting up different serarios for the future. Bill, Eric, Alcide, Norris, Sam and a new man/were all make apperances and confuse the hell out of Sookie. It seems as if they are all potential suitors but the reader gets to know them all a bit better and as far as I am concerned they all have to many flaws for Sookie(except Sam( not my favorite) and the new guy Quinn(we don't know about him yet)).I think this book sets things up for the future and let's face it, we all want her to have romantic situations with all of them but she isn't a slut (like Anita). Sookie needs to pick and choose. If you read this series you have to read this book, to many things happen. Overall it's a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I love the Southern Vampire Series, and was so excited as I waited for this latest to be released.I read it in 2 days and was so let down I wanted to cry!!!! What happened????????? By far, the worst book in the series. No substance, no fun, no adventure.Save your money on this one. If you must read it, wait for the paperback. I hope and pray the next one will be better, and will redeem this otherwise fun series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purchase of Dead as a Doornail","review":"This book series, this show is the best thing on the planet~ Cant wait for the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"This follows the story after the events of the fifth book. AN important thing happens almost at the end, not to spoil, but it has to do with Eric and Sookie. Very good and entertaining read, and as always the mystery was very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead as a Doornail","review":"I have never seen the HBO series \\"True Blood\\" which is based on these books, but I want to see it now. The book is lots of fun, and Sookie is a quick thinking, smart talking woman. The characters are well drawn. There is sex, lust, murder and mystery, which means there is something for everyone. The books make me smile."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit Disappointed","review":"I am a fan of the Sookie's series but I must say that I'm a bit disappointed with Dead As A Doornail. There's not much of a storyline in this one. It's more like a recap of the past stories and a preparation for what may happen in the latter ones than a story in its own right. While it's understandable that Ms. Harris needs to explain the roles and history of Eric and Bill, and many other characters, in Sookie's life to the new readers the first time each of them enters this story, I simply don't see why this needs to be done over and over again throughout the story. Also, while I like Sookie a lot and hope that she has someone who's deserving to love her soon, it's a bit too much when nearly all the male characters show romantic interest in her. I'm still looking forward to the next book in the series but hope that it can be much better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!!","review":"Another good book from Charlaine Harris!!!! True Blood series is the best vampire series ever and Charlaine differently keeps you guessing the whole time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A former favorite writer","review":"I am very unhappy with Charlaine Harris. She writes very strong words. I loved her books up until this one. I don't get it what was she thinking? There was no closure, no satisfaction. After wasting $24.00 I was extremly disappointed. I'll wait for her next book to be in paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't care to much for this one","review":"This was a disappointment after number 4 so I guess that has something to do with why I didn't like this one as much. I think it is my least favorite of them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and hard to finish","review":"If I had the option of forfeiting all stars I would have. This book was poorly written and hard to read. I haven't read any of this authors previous books, nor will I ever. This was like reading a 4th graders epic fictional final. BAD, BAD, BAD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sookie's got it, doesn't flaunt it","review":"Although Sookie seems to be slowly incresing her past and potential suitors (Bill, Eric, Alcide, Sam, Calvin, and now Quinn), I'm sure I am not alone when I say it is quite refreshing to learn that she doesn't fall into the sack with them as quickly as \\"some other main character who associates with vampires in another series that I need not name\\"! When I read the part where Sookie bursts into laughter at just the thought of bedding two vamps at once, I felt it was a not-so-subtle jab at a once favorite \\"some other main character...\\"! I like Sookie's world for the characters, (some who remind me of people I know), fantastic story-telling, and how nicely everything wraps up in the end. The only reason I did not give this review 5 stars is that I felt there was too much back-story involved. I already read the first 4 books, I didn't need a recap!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where is Bill?","review":"I've enjoyed all of the books in the series and this one is no exception. I do find Sookie maddening - she does a lot of illogical things and is still so immature that I keep shaking my head at her while reading. The most interesting thing in the series are the vampires in my opinion so to have them take a back seat was disappointing. Also, has anyone else noticed that Sookie's libido has gone into overdrive?If Definitely Dead follows Sookie and Alcide I'm not sure I'll be able to take it since I am a die hard Sookie/Bill fan but hey what can you do?For people who like light-hearted vampire stories this series is great and I highly recommend it. I've given 4 stars because the character development is wanting and there are many inconsistencies that someone should have caught."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoy Ms. Harris's writing","review":"I must say that before I read this book, I read some of the negative reviews given here. After reading, I must say that they were off. This is what it is, escapism reading. Not great literature, but really fun. I love the way she writes the dialogue. It sounded right in my head, if that makes any sense. To the nay-sayers: find something else to read. This is for fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Passes Time","review":"If you are reading these books from interest from watching True Blood on HBO, you will probably be disappointed. A lot of superficial story, no depth on interesting characters or relationships. Several \\"new\\" characters are simply plot devices that are killed off by the end of this story.I'm getting bored with this series. Consider Christopher Moore's Vampire books, like \\"Bloodsucking Fiends\\" as an alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charlaine is still my girl","review":"I love charlaine books, however this one is a little...off, I can't seem to put it into words, but I did notice a lot of you had plenty to say about the book. I read them all, and yes, I was happy that sookie and her boss got a little lips action, but Eric and Bill are my top concerns. I like calvin but he needs to move on to some other creature. Bill is kinda weak and Eric well Eric is never anywhere around when the real Stuff hits the fan, he always has someone else to do his bloody work. I still say Eric needs his own story. I lovvvvve Eric. and the Weres well, now that was an excellent story. and I cracked up over the Fairies. Poor Sookie and all the men who want to get with her. who to choose, who to choose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead as a Doornail","review":"I loved this book, Charlaine Harris is very good at getting you to leave reality behind for a few hours to enjoy Sookie's adventures."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wicked read!","review":"The fifth series in the Southern Vampire Mysteries by Charlaine Harris sees main protagonist Sookie Stackhouse embroiled in more otherworldly goings-on. Brother Jason had been bitten by a were panther in the previous installment, and seems to enjoy being 'blessed' by shape-shifting abilities as a result of the bite. Just as Sookie breathes a sigh of relief over this, she finds that a sniper is on the loose, targetting the shape-shifters, and Jason ends up being the prime suspect. Sookie needs to do something to clear Jason's name before the shifters turn on him. Sookie also finds herself unwittingly involved in werewolf politics in this novel.Readers familiar with the series will see known characters from the previous instalments as well as new ones such as shapeshifter Quinn. Sookie, who has always attracted other-worldly beings, seems to have more than her fair share of admirers in this installment! If you like this genre, then I'd recommend sinking your teeth into this one:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Character Development","review":"This is the first time I have ever read this far in a series and not gotten bored. I am loving all the characters and I find myself genuinely concerned with their safety... haha. This book was really good, I read it in less then a day. One thing to note, not one single sex scene in this installation. Interesting... why are bookstores putting this book in the 'paranormal romance' section when it is so not that. It should sit next to Anne Rice and Laurel K. in my opinion, and those typically go to horror. Even though Charlaine Harris isn't scarry by any means, she has definitely created her own genre, and it's causing chaos all across America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun!","review":"A friend recommended the Sookie Stackhouse books a year ago and I only got around to them this spring. I knocked through all of them in about 4 weeks along side a few of another vampire series. I totally enjoyed the universe Charlaine Harris has skilly created. Her blending of reality and paranormal fits well enough that you have little trouble believing in it. I found Sookie charming and quirky and the vampires and other-worldly creatures interesting and compelling.\\"Dead as a Doornail\\" easily rates up there with the others. I found NO disappointment in it and rather enjoyed the digression away from the vampire-focus and into the weres and shifters. I was particularly glad to see Alcide again (yummy), though I was less than satisfied with how their relationship was left hanging. Then again, if she resolves it we don't get to see him again! What's the saying? Leave 'em wanting more? Well I want more!A truly enjoyable read with non-graphic violence that I appreciate!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring! Hope the next one is better.","review":"Buy this one used or wait for the paperback. A real disappointment after the others were so enjoyable. I don't know what happened during the writing of this book because either Ms. Harris was not very focused on it or maybe she's just in a rut with her story line, but this book is dull and Sookie seems to be in a bad mood most of the time. Considering the character of most of the men in her life as written in this book, no wonder. This book focuses more on the shifter community and the politics of that group, and they all want to use Sookie for one reason or another. Hopefully the next book will be better. This is the third new book out this year by one of my favorite authors that was not up to par. Laurell Hamilton's new Merry Gentry book and Nora Roberts' latest In Death books were disappointing too. At least Kim Harrison came through with a really good follow-up to her first book, Dead Witch Walking. The Good the Bad and the Undead is a fun read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"A very much anticipated read for a major Sookie/Harris fan, and quite disappointing. The main \\"mystery\\" is weak and resolved almost as an afterthought. The usually charming and sensible Sookie is cranky, frenetic and unlikeable (gasp! I can't believe I just wrote that!), yet mysteriously alluring to almost every supernatural being in Louisiana.The reader is thrown into the complex, yet deeply boring world of werewolf politics for no apparent reason. Yawn.The most enjoyable parts of the book for me were the cameos by Jack and Lily Leeds from the Shakespeare series (and even that subplot just petered away) and the always, always entertaining Pam.I assume all of this \\"sound and fury\\" is set-up for the next book, which seems more promising. Go library on this one and save up your cash for Book Six."},{"rating":"1","title":"I believe I will skip this one","review":"I have read 8 chapters already, It's really sad to say that it didn't start getting exciting until Sookie's life was threatened. There have been new people? introduced without even finishing up the Bill/Sookie/Eric triangle. Which is what makes the book exciting to me. I am not a fan of were, so that is a bore and the fairy well she is interesting enough. I am going to try to read one more chapter and then..that's it. If it doesn't get better in the next book- I'm going to give up."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened with the narrator this time?","review":"I've listened to all the books thus far and I loved the narrator's voices for all the characters and her acting capabilities. In this series you here her stop, drink something, swallow, not change voices when a different speaker is being read and it's frustrated. What happened? Overall the story is entertaining, I do miss Eric from the story line, but it keeps moving forward. I wouldn't say it's a \\"Classic\\" but I do enjoy the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull as a Doornail","review":"I finished reading Book 5 in Harris's Southern Vampire Mysteries last night. I wasn't too impressed with it. There wasn't much vampire stuff in this one, and I find the Weres and the other types rather boring. The author should stick with the vamps- they're much more dynamic (I thoroughly enjoyed the fourth book, which involved the vamps to a high degree). And what's with every guy wanting Sooky? It's ridiculous!I give the book a 2-fang rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sniper is after the weres....","review":"and Sookie's brother is the one everybody thinks may be doing it. Add problems within the werewolf pack, Bill being back and the sniper thinking Sookie is a were and you have a grand old time in the old town.Get it, read it, enjoy it. Not as good as the others, but all the characters you love to read about are in it, so you should enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"exciting","review":"This book is so good and it will keep you at the edge of your seat.

We have Jason turning into part werepanther so that was interesting and how he coped was a lot better than most of us.I did like this book it had all the action I love but I have to say I was really disappointed in Alcide, I never expected him to turn like that. I don't want to say too much so I don't give anything away.What I love about Charlaine's writing though she may have several different situations going on not once am I confused. Another thing is that though you may suspect who or what done what when the answer is revealed it still surprises you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky Fun Series. Easy to read.","review":"This is a lovely series to read. It's easy and quirky. Nothing to in depth and I love that about books. I just want to enjoy the story and not have to think too much about the characters or plot line. She does a great job of balancing out the characters and I like how they have developed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Reading--","review":"Of the series, I thought this one was one of my favorites. With that being said......This version for the Kindle has SEVERAL typo's. A large quantity of the words are jumbled together. It isn't hard to read through them, but it is frustrating at times. There is also a scene where the author (or perhaps whom ever encoded this book) called one of the characters, who was in conversation, by the wrong name. I liked this book particularly because Sookie finally tells Eric what happened between the two of them while he was hiding at her house. There were also a few parts where I actually laughed out loud. There was a lot of repetitive information and the author sometimes lets the story line get away from her sometimes; however, if you have enjoyed the series up until this point, you will like this book and not mind paying $8 for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I love all the Sookie books...........this one too!

But her concern becomes cold fear when a sniper sets his deadly sights on the local changeling population, and Jason's new panther brethren suspect he may be the shooter.

After only 2 years of use, the shelf became bent and no longer remained attached to the sliding mechanism; and it could not be fixed.

I do have to say, Kitchenaid was good about replacing it. The replacement we have now toasted at the correct setting for about another 3 months. I say correct setting when speaking of the first 2 pieces. You had to turn it to lighter if you wanted to toast another piece as this time it burnt. Now it is again not toasting unless it is set on darkest setting. Our normal setting, at a little more than half way on the dial, doesn't even get the bread warm much less toasted. We're having to run it twice, and watching closely so it doesn't burn, to get toast. It also has the same problem of burning if we try to fix extra.

Only gave it 4 stars instead of my usual 5 because I'm still trying to figure out how to get my toast to my preferred brown color. It's still a little too light for me and I'm always fiddling with the control. However, with this toaster you can push the lever down again immediately after it pops up if the toast is not done to your liking. With every other toaster I've owned there was a delay of one or two minutes before retoasting."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"I can't get this toaster to toast, if by \\"toast' we mean that the bread actually picks up a brownish \\"toasted\\" color. Every slice has to be sent through two times. I tried returning the item and got great cooperation. A new one was sent to me, and I returned the old. But the new one is no better than the first.

It looks nice, seems sturdy enough, and stays cool to the touch. But it toasts poorly. One side of the bread toasts more than the other. So I have to pop up the toast 1/2 way through and turn it over. And now the pop up mechanism isn't working well."},{"rating":"1","title":"They don't make em like they used to","review":"This is the third toaster I have purchased in the last 12 months. I'm getting ready to send it to the Goodwill and purchase a fourth. I like my toast fast, brown and not all dried out. This toaster takes at least 3 minutes and two tries on the darkest setting to get the toast brown and by that time, the toast is as dry as dust. My father suggested I check the wattage on the toaster - it is 850W. He checked his older, less expensive and better-performing Kenmore, two-slice toaster and discovered it to be 1050W. We suspect that American toasters now have less wattage for either environmental or safety concerns. Whatever the reason, the toaster is unsatisfactory for making toast although as others have noted, it does a pretty good job on bagels. I'm going to try the Krups FEM2B next. It's the only 1050W two-slice toaster listed on Amazon (many of the toasters do not state the watts)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why doen't my toaster toast?","review":"I have never seen such a diverse difference of opinions about the same product as has been made about this toaster. I am now on the second KitchenAid toaster which performs exactly as the first one did. It doesn't brown (even lightly) English muffins when set all the way to the darkest setting. I have to put them in a second time and watch to make sure they don't burn. I think $50.00 is too much money to pay for that kind of performance. From what other reviews state, it sounds as though these toasters have been manufactured in different locations and to different specs. I wish I knew how to get one from the factory that makes them the \\"right\\" way. I have (since purchasing this toaster) read similar \\"bad\\" reviews going back several years.

Does a very nice job of toasting my bagels, bread, and whatever else we put in it. One reviewer commented on the fumes and smell. I experienced this for the first 4 or 5 cycles and then it totally went away... the only smell now is the sweet smell of some nicely toasted bread products!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and disappointing","review":"I know $40 doesn't sound like alot of money now a days but this toaster isreally cheesy looking, flimsy, very lightweight and knocks over if you pull on cord and it either barely toasts or it burns! VERY disappointing for a Kitchenaid product. I will never buy another appliance thru Amazon thats for sure! I am now strictly a go to the mall and see for myself consumer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Bagels","review":"I bought this toaster specifically for Bagels. For that, it is very good. The differential heating, where the cut side of the bagel will toast, and the uncut of the bagel will just warm, is a very good feature. The bagels come out well toasted, but not rock hard due to toasting on both sides.I am however disappointed with the regular Toasting feature. It appears that, due to the very wide slots in order to accomodate thick bagels, that regular white bread and English Muffins are held too far away from the heating elements in order to sufficiently toast the first time. The toast setting must be reset, and then you'll need to toast a bit more in order to have your final toast \\"well done\\" which is how I prefer it.If you are looking for the only toaster on the market which has a \\"Bagel\\" setting (i.e. differential heating) buy this model. It is superb for toasting your bagels. If you are just looking for an ordinary toaster, or don't do bagels that much, this toaster is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Toaster That Belongs in the Garbage","review":"I've tried two of these toasters from two different retailers, purchasing them ten months apart.I bought the first one and had the same problem as others here apparently have. That is, the toaster didn't toast.On the highest setting, the toast came out barely toasted (and unevenly so, to boot), requiring two rounds through the toaster to produce toast. On the lowest setting, it came out as if it was never in the toaster at all (i.e. the same temperature it was when it went in).10 months later, after convincing myself that the first was a fluke (and still really wanting a toaster that matched my other Kitchen Aid appliances - silly, I know), I tried again and bought the same model again.This one works just as poorly.I can't even describe my disappointment.

(I do sometimes wonder about those ratings!) I agree with others - on the darkets setting it sort-of browns my artisan bread and extra-large (Wolferman's) English muffins. However, the pop-up doesn't work so I burn my hand on the metal frame in trying to extract the bread. And, the slots are just as short as my old toaster so I still have to cut a small end off the piece of bread. Maybe it's OK for regular, American, thin white bread but I never eat that. Thankfully the toaster was cheap - and it's red, and matches my other appliances. The slots are wide enough and that is its only saving grace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Matches our appliances and that is about it","review":"Purchased last year to match the other KitchenAid appliances.

The second waffle is crisp but not brown at all on one side, and the other side is soggy...it's no longer frozen, just wet.Now maybe if this were a trend in how this thing \\"toasts\\", and if I really thought it was worth it, I could rotate the items being toasted when the cycle was half way done. BUT, it's never the same from day-to-day...except that this thing consistently fails at the one simple task it is designed to do: toast.

What I like most about the unit is the browning uniformity I see, and it's a very stylish unit. Does a great job toasting bagles, and is easy to clean-up. I would of rated it at five-stars, except that I've found the exterior finish shows smudges and fingerprints on my black unit. Maybe the red or white would be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A toaster that doesn't toast.","review":"You would think a $60 Kitchen Aid toaster would perform the simple task of toasting bread evenly and to the desired degree of doneness with no trouble. You would be wrong. As other reviewers have noted, it doesn't toast bread dark enough - even on the highest setting - and when it finally does (after two or three trips through) the outside of the bread is darker than the inside.This technological wonder replaces a $7 White Westinghouse toaster that worked for years until it was knocked on the floor and broken. It's only problem was that it was sometimes a little too small to fully accommodate slices of my homemade cracked wheat bread. Otherwise, it just quietly did its job - every morning.Kitchen Aid ought to be ashamed and embarrassed that they can't do for $50 - $60 what someone else can do for under $10."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like you toast brown this is not the toaster for you","review":"It seems that you can't get a toaster that actually toasts anymore.

After only two months of use, the shelf became bent and no longer remained attached to the sliding mechanism. It can not be fixed. The shelf is hooked onto the slider by two small prongs that broke off. KitchenAid does not supply parts or offer repair on the toaster line. The cost of repair is deemed cost prohibitive, as most consumers would not choose to pay a service center more to repair a product than the cost of replacement itself.KitchenAid offers a 1-year warranty, from the date of purchase, on most new products. I was told that \\"according to the model and serial numbers provided, the unit was manufactured outside of the 1-year warranty period\\".

You must set the browning to darkest for the first toasting and then retoast. Always. The bread never comes out toasted the first time. What bothers me most is that the bread will burn if you forget to reset the browning to midway for the second toasting. And,no, you can't do two passes with a midway setting. The midway setting requires three passes.I'm also disappointed with this toaster because the toast browns unevenly. I have yet to get a piece of toast (even white bread) that is evenly browned on both sides or even edge-to-edge on either side.I do agree that it does a credible job on bagels.KitchenAid should market this product as a bagel toaster only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality is less than I expect from KitchenAid","review":"This toaster is more a decoration than anything else.

I absolutely devour every bit of fantasy related material I can get my hands on...but this movie was disappointing to me.I turned it off about 20-30 minutes into it...I was just too bored to stay awake.While I appreciate the puppet-work and the eerie atmosphere, this move REALLY could have used more dynamic dialogue to pull the viewer into the story.I was able to sit through the entire 12hr extended dvd version of Lord of the Rings without getting bored, but this movie just seemed to drag and drag to me...I couldn't get into it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want to scare a child.....","review":"I remember my mom popping this in the vcr when I was about four years old. Talk about nightmares. I couldn't bring myself to watch this movie for a long time, until recently I went out and bought it for my daughter. I know that it sounds like I'm contradicting myself when I say that it would scare a child, but I went and bought one for mine, but she loves it!! Also, after getting over my irrational, and ridiculous, fear of this movie, I watched it with her and ended up looking at it like an adult would. The puppetry is excellent, the best of Jim Henson, and for the time that this was produced, it is astonishingly very well in effects. It will still scare the pants off of any *normal* child, (which mine is, but she seems to like monsters and stuff!!) but is great if you like classic fantasy movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adult Fantasy for children","review":"When this work first came out my children were young and I as their father, watched nearly everything with them. This story catches your eye and you go with it and watch the effect on the children. The overall effect is in their connection to the little characters of the adventure, Jim Henson and Frank Oz and all the creators of these many elements in the story have a very good line on the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enchanted work of art. Not for everyone.","review":"I saw this movie when I was in college. I was completely spellbound. The creativity and story line were excellent. It seems that people I've spoken to either love it or hate it. If your not into childrens fantasy then don't waste your time. You won't like it. I have enjoyed reading the reviews on this movie. It reminds me that in this world no matter how much I may like something, nor how many others may like it as well, there will always be those that hate it.

The incredible puppeteering and its seamless combination with costumed actors makes a movie that stands alone as a true original that has yet to be recreated, and may never be.The story isn't bad. The plot is predictable and the music is no different from any other movie that aspires to be the epic story of prophecy fulfilled. But you can't tear your eyes from the film because of its beautiful, richly-detailed world. Jim Henson and his team made thousands of puppets and props for the movie. They were succesful in creating a perfectly-delivered, believable fantasy world with distinguished characters you could care about set in intriguing, original environments.All-in-all, the DVD is well worth buying. But stay away from the nasty VHS. This movie demands letterbox.-- JJT"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie, surprisingly \\"un-dated\\" for a 80's film.","review":"The muppets and costumes are stunning, characters are well-rounded and creative, and Fizgig(the little furball who looks like a deranged Shih-Tzu dog!) is alternately adorable and hysterical. It also managed to look very \\"un-Muppet\\"-like for the most part(with the notable and probably deliberate exception of Fizgig), a plus in my book, as Muppets are fine for funny stuff, but not fantasy-drama!My only major gripe is the somewhat lame ending, which pretty much left me thinking \\"Oh, please!\\". It also may be a tad slow and too scary for the kiddies in some parts(I know that one-eyed wizardess and the mind-draining scene near the end of the movie sure scared me as a kid!), but is otherwise a wonderfully told (and well-acted) fantasy tale. Definitely worth watching despite its few drawbacks."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dark Crystal","review":"It's a Jim Henson movie, that's really all I have to say. If you havn't seen it, you should. This is a must see."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are reviewers thinking?","review":"I finally saw the Dark Crystal with my son after I'd heard of it from my youth, but never saw it. The technology was interesting and supposedly ground-breaking for the day, in animatronics and puppetry, but aside from that, it's all downhill. The story was simplistic and uninspired. The characters aren't developed much, the scripting is dull and the presentation is so, so slow. My son couldn't relate to the narrative factor, asking mainly \\"when are the characters going to actually talk?\\" I was bored to sleep, literally on several occasions during the movie, and by the time it ended, I was relieved that the whole event was finally over. My wife's one comment after sitting through the movie was \\"well, that was just horrid.\\" So, what in the heck do the other reviewers see in this clunker? It's a mystery to me and I have to feel that it's a lot of Jim Hensen is a genius-like feelings without actually taking an honest look at what the end-product really is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange, dark, and unsuitable for children...","review":"I think the title sums it up. I can't believe Henson made this film. It's entirely too dark and strange for my liking. It still scares the hell out of me to this day. I can only imagine the effect it would have on a small child. If you want to watch something of this genre, whether it be by yourself or with your kids, get The Neverending Story or one of the Star Wars films. This isn't worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oldies","review":"This movie I bought because I had never seen it.

I remember being tense, scared, thrilled and enjoying this movie at the same time. So did my girlfriend, so I bougth it to see this once-cherished movie.The one good thing I will say about it is, the puppetry work from Jim Henson was really incredible. The movie, sad to say wasn't.The plot was interesting, but weak. The dialogue was non-existant in most of the movie, very little amount of words. It was disturbing, and creepy. There was little substance in the characters, and they were all one-dimensional.I give it one extra star for the puppetry work of Henson. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better left as a fun childhool memory","review":"Ouch - I bought this thinking that my kids would enjoy it. I had fond memories of this being a fun show, a little strange, but good for little kids. Oh my this was so bad - my 8 year old was rolling his eyes after 3 min into the film, that past week has been then talking about how bad the acting, and special effects were in this show. Definately not a high point in Jim Henson's portfolio. Better left as a fun childhood memory, because if you watch it now the happy feeling will be gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark Crystal","review":"It's kind of scary. Don't get this film for your little ones. I definitely would not recommend it for children below 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enthralling in its fantastic realism","review":"Perhaps not very well-suited for young children, Dark Crystal features several warped and mangled creatures and few, if any funny moments. Nevertheless, that is not the centerpoint of the plot and the entire film. Dark Crystal is good fantasy at the highest point in its evolution. Rather than creating an extrremely complex plot that will ultimately crush everyone's brain stems, Jim Henson created a world. Populated entirely by imaginary races (no humans, not even puppets), the world is so atmospheric and so enthralling in its sheer scintillating liveliness that one has no choice but sit and be fascinated. The craftsmanship is simply divine (I am still trying to figure out how Eugra's orrery, the celestial contraption in her cave, was originally done). This is an excellent fantasy film which does not find itself too high-brow for the average fantasy lover, and does not descend into the fluffy cuteness or simplicity of pseudo-fantasies. I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jim Henson & Frank Oz's 1982 Classic Fantasy adventure","review":"This work is perhaps one of the best fantasy adventures brought to the big screen during the 1980's. The combined imaginations & talents of Jim Henson & Frank Oz bring a fantasy world, unlike ANYTHING you've ever seen, to life. Worthy of such classics as Frank Baum's \\"Wizard of Oz\\" & J.R.R. Tolkein's \\"The Hobbit\\"; this 1980's classic, much like Disney's own classic \\"Fantasia\\", is only now, coming into it's own years after it's original theatrical release. With the re-release of this work on DVD with additional footage & extras make this a perfect addition to the library of a serious fantasy enthusiast."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Collector's Edition\\" not worth $50","review":"This movie is one of my favorites, but there just wasn't enough \\"extra\\" features to justify the Collector's Edition price."},{"rating":"2","title":"An old favorite Newly discovered","review":"I've always been a Jim Henson fan and I picked up this movie for that reason and for the nostalgia associated with it.This movie is a story told entirely by puppets, though they are lightyears beyond the Muppets. The detail on the characters and in the world itself [all created by Jim Henson] is fantastic. The sets are all alive and vital with just enough movement to capture your eye and draw you into the world without taking away from the story.The plot is driven by simple directives like Good VS Evil on the surface but there is more to the story than that. There are characters in this story that fall somewhere in between in the grey area where good and evil meet. That is the crux of the story. Good and Evil coming together to form one whole being capable of both.It seems very deep, but don't be afraid. This story is packed with action and adventure, mystery and love. Buy it. Watch it...over and over....It's all in all quite wonderful to behold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly Odd.","review":"The Dark Crystal is quite possibly one of the strangest movies to ever come out of the Jim Henson Creature Shop. That being said, it is probably also one of the best. This movie portrays the classic struggle of good versus evil with the side of good facing seemingly insurmountable obstacles. While I enjoyed this film as a child (although some parts were a bit scary) I find myself enjoying it even more as an [young] adult. What originally appeared to be a struggle between good and evil now shows itself that all people have both good and evil inside of them, and the two work in a natural harmony. In a day of pure digital characters, it is exciting to see Muppets in action. As far as digital technology has come, it still lacks the realism these characters portray. I highly recommend this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where are these kinds of movies today?","review":"Craft has all but been forgotten in today's rooty-toot filmfactory world. However, this film, which I am overjoyed to seereleased on DVD widescreen, has real \\"art\\" quality. Jim Henson, sure, but what of the brilliant and determined artists of the creature workshop? From 1977-81 they really achieved something. The conceptual design and execution belongs on a wall, and it soon will, on a shelf in my living room, next to my Kubrick collection. Overly-underappreciated."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Jim Henson Masterpiece","review":"This story of a young gelfling takes you to another place and time on an adventure to restore the land to its previous beauty. Jim Henson's use of all puppet or Muppets from his creature shop was outstanding. This is a film I would recommand to anyone who like a good fantasy story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scarring","review":"This movie seems very popular with a lot of fans, but I have something different to say. I've seen it, once, when I was about 5 1/2. Maybe adults get a kick out of it, my 10 year old brother (at the time) enjoyed it. So, if you're an older viewer than maybe this movie is good, but please, keep it away from young children. This movie terrified me as a small child and I ran out halfway through nearly in tears. Please, doen't be overly anxious to share this with your kids, it may be best to wait a few years. It is one of the most terrifying memories I have as a little girl and I certainly wouldn't wish it to happen to anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"A true letdown","review":"I bought this video because I normally like scifi/fantasy stuff, and the reviews were good. Unfortunately, it stank. The plot was very predictable, which isn't a problem sometimes, because movies have to run a specific way. I understand that. BUT, the journey TO the end of the plot wasn't worth taking! I felt like I was begging it to just be OVER! Not only that, the special effects were ho-hum, there was absolutely NO dramatic tension, the main character is a little brat. Here's an example. He's journeying with a little dog-thing, and it just helped unbury him from a big pile of rocks. It starts barking. He shushes it. It starts barking again. He yells at it, \\"Fat lot of help YOU'VE been!\\" Starting to get the idea?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nightmares....","review":"Call me crazy, but this movie gave me nightmares. The characters (I know, they're fantasy, they're supposed to) look creepy and strange. In one scene when an old skeakse (vulture creature) dies, it's voice is all raspy, and it literally falls apart. That alone was enought to fuel a bad dream :( And since the characters are puppets, the way they would run, I don't know, just looks strange in it's own way. If you're creeped out by wierd looking creatures in a wierd environment, stay away. To those who like the movie, hey, no hard feelings, the plot was good and it was good fantasy, the way it haunts me just overshadows that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Good as Everyone Makes it Sound","review":"I viewed this movie with the camp program I work at. The children there are ages 5-11. Well, not only did I not enjoy it, but the children didn't either. Maybe 5 kids, out of the 30 actually watched it. I tried to watch it, and after 5 minutes, I was bored of it. I found it hard to sit still and watch it. There was absolutley no point to the movie, and the complex script, made it hard to understand, not only for children, but for adults as well. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, unless if you like stories that are extremley fantasy, and make no sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative, predictable, preachy","review":"I assume most other reviewers are hard core Jim Henson fans. I can think of no other explanation for the glowing reviews for this predictable, poorly paced fable. I had high hopes for this movie, but it lacks a compelling story, interesting charachters,and wit."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie scared the pants off of me as a child!","review":"This is the #1 nightmare-causing movie of my childhood. Any issues in my life right now probably lead back to this movie. Even the nice characters disturbed me. There's something scary about those puppets! I really just wanted to write this review to remind parents to leave the night-light on after letting your children see this! It's creepy! Whew, that was theraputic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay..not great","review":"I bought this for my twins... We have many movies and dvds. I was expecting great things based on the reviews (I mostly relied on reviews because I don't remember seeing it or people talking about it...now I know why!) My kids didn't like the puppets. I, who grew up with Jim Henson (and Kroft.. and all the other weird 70's stuff) thought it was kind of stupid, too. The themes (save your race/species) were too advanced for young kids and the dialog and characters were too boring for older kids/adults. Bummer. I was really hoping for more than this. I think one of the best things about a kids movie is that it is good enough for the adults to like, too. We don't watch it at all. Stick with Mary Poppins, Toy Story, Shrek, The (original Disney) Jungle Book, Nightmare before Christmas, etc. these are classics for a reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't if you haven't already...","review":"Let me just say this: I'm not giving this movie this rating because of anything technical -- nothing having to do with color, sound, effects, or otherwise given.Personally, I'm a lover of all things anime, fantasy, and sci-fi, and it amazed me that I had never heard of the Dark Crystal. Well, I went and got this movie expecting to be enthralled like I am when I see \\"The Hobbit\\" -- based on what these reviews said.Let me just say this: if you aren't already a lover of this movie from seeing it years ago, and haven't already built up years of appreciation for it -- don't bother. In terms of modern fantasy, I saw the ending coming from the first 20 minutes of the movie, and the story was mind-numbingly dragging at times.But, I'm just one viewer, and obviously against the massive tide of ratings. Just another perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"An All Time Favorite","review":"This movie is one of my all-time favorite movies. I seen it as I was a little kid - it's definately safe, as long as you're not offended by pure imagination ;) - and I have never stopped loving this movie. I'm 21 today and I would completely enjoy watching this.The Never Ending Story, Labrynith, Legend, and The Dark Crystal. These are beautiful movies, beautiful stories, and the way a good story and movie should be. Definately, by all means, get your kids (and yourself) these movies. They will never be forgotten!"},{"rating":"2","title":"These ain't no muppets","review":"The late Jim Henson, not to put too finer point on it, was an absolute genius. Not only did he take a piece of green felt, stuffed it, added two ping pong balls for eyes and turned it in to the world's most popular frog, he also concocted this wildly imaginative film that makes for enchanting entertainment whatever your age. When the 'Dark Crystal' was shattered, the universe was split in to factions - the Skeksis ( boo hiss ) and the Mystics ( hurray! ). A prophercy was written that a Gelfling would return the shard and restore ballance to the universe, the main character in the film is a young Gelfling, his name is Jen, he forms the focal point of the film. The 'Dark Crystal' soon develops in to an extremely unusual fantasy adventure, boasting imaginative visuals and a thoroughly entertaining tale. This is a must have video/DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A spiritual journey","review":"This tale follows the spiritual coming of age storyline. Its struggle of good verses evil leaves me enchanted.The puppet master, Jim Henson, brings this world to life and leave me longing to jump into the television & share the adventures of Jen.I have watched this film since I was a child & will continue to watch it over & over & over. No child or adult should resist losing themselves in this world.A beautiful, mysterious masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":".","review":"It's not quite as compelling to me as it was when I first saw it as a wide-eyed and easily frightened little kid, but this movie is so chock-full of imagination, aesthetic brilliance, and amazing sets and creatures, that it is difficult to even think of giving it less than four stars. It is quite dark and scary for a children's movie, but I would never for a second suggest that any parent deprive their child the experience of seeing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an improvement","review":"As my first \\"Superbit\\" title, this is a disappointment. As the description states, the film is scratched (not an issue with the transfer, but still diminishes the film). The high-rate of encoding did not improve the video - in fact I found it dark and murky.The biggest disappointment is with the audio, which has inconsistant volume in standard stereo - bass and score drown out voices in loud scenes, which are also muted compared to quiet scenes. This requires periodic master volume adjustments.In all, not worth the cost. I admit I've not seen the \\"Special Edition\\" DVD. If it's worse than this, buy it on VHS."},{"rating":"1","title":"An old memory","review":"I was there in theater when this movie came out.

Just so we're clear, I LOVE this movie; I'm pretty obsessive about it. I've seen it 8 times in the theater (6 when it first came out) and own every single edition on every media platform, including PSP and iTunes. So when I finally sat down to watch the Blu-Ray edition, i noticed pretty quickly that they've changed the dialogue; Jen suddenly speaks a line in Aughra's laboratory that I've never heard.Between this and the edited editions of Erik The Viking and The Last Unicorn, I'm wondering how much of my childhood is left intact. Shame on whoever decided to alter history. It wasn't necessary and this is not what I paid for."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good reason to ensure your kids watch good tv!","review":"If you care about what your kids watch, this is good enough reason. This is an epic tale of good vs evil, but also that others, no matter how seemingly insignifigant, can help you on your way. I saw this when I was 7, and goobled it up right away. With all the people claiming to believe in God, teaching religion, this is nowhere near as scary."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this movie!","review":"I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out and fell in love with it. It's the age-old fight between good & evil, in the world and within each of us. I was very excited when this became available on blu-ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie","review":"It's a great movie for all ages. The craftsmanship and creativity of the storyline and visual art is simply unparallelled. We are spoiled these days with CGI. This movie shows us how things can be made to look unearthly and dreamlike even without computer graphics taking over the scene. I'm not anti-CGI or anything, but I am pro-hands-on craftsmanship, and this movie is saturated in that! Jim Henson and Brian Froud were a remarkable pairing! So meant to be!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great film!","review":"The reason i loved this film was for its simple mythos. It had a very interesting history at its core, but one to which we earth folk can relate: the struggle of the meek against the oppressor. It is a classic tale re-told on a planet whose life-force has been tragically torn apart centuries ago. This schism resulted in two kinds of beings, one shallow and power-hungry, the other gentle and wise. With the former in control of whatever lay in their vision, the wise people live far from away, where they have conscientiously raised a special boy to fulfill a prophesy of world-restoration. Themes like this have been seen throughout our hstory and the \\"history\\" of this film is a very sharp and interesting protrayal of an age-old idea. I highly recommend it. The story is tight, the effects provoking and realistic, and the mythos deep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Crystal review","review":"This movie brings so many good memories, unfortunately that they don't make movies like this anymore. Incredible movie, beautiful fantasy for everyone, I really recommend this movie to all lovers of fantasy/science fiction (I also bought Labyrinth to complete my Jim Henson Collection...awesome movie)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Crystal","review":"This is a magical fairytale for kids and adult alike. You cannot beat Henson productions for imagination and the wonderful puppetry. The puppets are infused with such character that you forget that they are controlled by puppeteers and see them as living things. The story is the usual triumph of good over evil, but who doesn't like that, especially on a Sunday afternoon with a bucket of popcorn! A brilliant film that has to be seen by all.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Henson reaches new heights of visual artistry!","review":"In this too often overlooked masterpiece, Muppet-master Jim Henson breathes life into a world of mythic proportions. The storyline only serves to showcase the visual genius of the film.

It is a shame that this film has not recieved the widespread recognition that it deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"WICKED MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is one of my most favorite mvies of all time.

It comes in a cardboard box that looks nice on the outside, but its cheesiness becomes apparent when you open it up. Inside is a little notepad, a piece of film embedded in a card, a little note written by Jim Henson's daughter, and ONE lonely disc. Said disc offers ZERO improvement over the previously released (and MUCH more reasonably priced) \\"Special Edition.\\" Compare this to the FOUR discs you get in one of the Lord of the Rings Extended Editions for significantly less money!

I think rechargeable LED candles are a great idea, but these LED lights are made very poorly. There was at least one candle in every set that didn't work at all (a total of 4 candles from 3 sets that didn't work) and then a couple that keep very short lived charges and flicker out (within two hours) much sooner than the rest. I called and emailed Viatek with no response. After the third call, someone picked up the phone and said that they would send replacements. They never did, and a follow up call went unanswered as well. Also, the yellow light emitted by these candles is very yellow compared to a real candle flame, it isn't natural looking. If you plan to mix yellow LED candles (like these) with real candles, the difference will be glaringly obvious. Go for a -warm- white LED candle as opposed to the yellow LED candle (they do exist)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liked them while they worked","review":"I bought these from a shopping channel and was excited when I saw them demonstrated. When I received them one of the candles would not charge. I emailed Viatek and they informed me they would send a replacment which I did receive 2 weeks later.

If they had worked I would have kept them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frenetic Flickering","review":"I purchased a set after seeing a similar product at a restaurant.

Unfortunately the Viatek candles aren't nearly as nice. The Viatek candles give a light that is too yellow and flickers too much. They just don't feel like real candles. They're also a pain to turn on and off. You have to remove the \\"candle\\" from the glass holder and push the button on the bottom.

It has unfriendly menu commands on the camera, even deleting a picture is not easy. The most frustrating was trying to down load the images to the computer. The Camedia software does not reconize the camera. I spent 6 hours over a period of two days and drained the new batteries in the camera getting the pictures down loaded. I still have to hunt to find the file the pictures are in the USB drive, it's not stright forward operation at all.

Once I read the manual and learned how to use this camera it has been nothing but fabulous to me. Even though it like other digital cameras eats a large amount of batteries- so you will need to make another purchase of a battery charger, which has at a very low price, by the way.

The best part about this camera-the downloading through USB! What a breeze! The software that it comes with is easy to install and very helpful if you read the instructions. Still I was hoping for more with the software package. If you have win 98, you still need to donwload the driver from the disc that it comes it. The quality of pictures blew me away at first.

Most of the reviews are positive so I basically want to focus on the negatives, because I missed following comments in these reviews:1) Looks good to me except the sliding lens cap. The lens cap is the poorly designed feature in this camera. They could have reduced the weight/size of camera by using just a cap on the lens part only. I find the operation of this lens cap quite inconvenient and unecessary.2) Also remember that the AVI files (movies) can not have sound in it.3) Distant pictures are a little blurry too.4) You need to get one 64MB card too to get reasonable number of shots, which is currently free after mail in rebate if you buy before 1/31/02.5)The value package also boasts of giving the battery charger which is non-olympus brand and really a cheap one.

In my opinion, this is where it ALL comes together. Joni's voice has matured. Her guitar work, always unique with her experimental tunings, has become splendid. Her poetry has become so breathtakingly intimate, with imagery so concrete, that she transports you to other worlds. These things alone would make this an extraordinary album, but here Joni has surrounded herself with so many other outstanding musicians (can anyone say Jaco?) that this becomes one timeless musical feast for the ears as well. I've been a Joni fan for a long time and I've loved several of her albums, but for me, I'll take this one over all of them.

It's not likely at least. Hejira is Mitchell's masterpiece (yes, Blue and Court & Spark and arguably others qualify for that description, but Hejira is a work of such remarkable depth, beauty and originality that it even stands above Mitchell's other amazing achievements).How can one describe this work? Impressionistic folk-jazz? Poetry in musical motion? I'm not sure, but now nearly 30 years old, Hejira refuses to sound dated, continues to roll down a mystical highway and comes to rest in only one place -- at the top of the list of great popular music triumphs of the 20th century, and, so far, the 21st.

The part that really upset me was that the screw that was on previous models that you turn to reduce the spray wasn't long enough to work. What they want you to do is buy a separate spray head, (which did not come with this rotor), figure out which one you need, and replace it. After I had already spent about thirty minutes getting this rotor in I wasn't in the mood to spend more money and time messing with it.

Okay, here's the problem, I picked up The Showdown's first album, \\"A Chorus of Obliteration\\", because it was a catchy metal album with some excellent leads. It took me a while to get into, but I enjoyed it. But here, with \\"Temptation Come My Way\\", you might as well be another copy of Avenged Sevenfold's \\"City of Evil\\", which is just bland formulatic arena rock. I downloaded this CD, because I wanted to hear how it would be. Well, it was deleted from my hard drive after I listened to every track on this album. I am so disappointed with this CD. If you're into southern rock or radio music, you'll cream yourselves over this. Old Showdown fans, don't even bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comment on B.

I agree with the other comments; it really gives virtually no instructions (which wouldn't be a problem if it were not advertised as giving complete ones), the patterns are not very interesting, and it ought to have at least a few photos. Once you've done one or two yourself, you could easily make up this kind of pattern yourself. I also agree that there are newer styles, including spirals and other \\"full-kippa\\" designs, as opposed to solid color with a border, that should be included, along with extra instructions for increasing. The color chart is a nice touch, and it makes for a pretty cover, but the colors aren't very accurate.

I rank this up with Anchorman, Happy Gilmore and National Lampooon's Vacation in classic comedies that I have seen.If you enjoyed this movie, I also recommend watching a similar but lower budget film called *iggaz With Hats, excuse the title.

On the other hand, it's probably very realistic for someone going through the process while juggling a family. Her writing is accessible and insightful, and at times I found myself identifying completely with her and her thoughts on the field (though, granted, in some ways the book is outdated). A book I will likely re-read.The person who said she was run-of-the-mill clearly didn't identify at all with her, which is not a failure of her writing so much as their imagination, especially given that they recommended Melvin Konner's \\"Becoming a doctor\\", which is a far less eloquent/evocative book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing more than a bland personal account","review":"It's always bemusing to see the medicos who have developed writing/journalism/media as a \\"side\\", for many of them are very ordinary.

If you are looking for brilliance, try Melvin Konner's \\"Becoming a doctor- a journey of initiation through medical school\\", or for farce Samuel Shem's book aboout psych. residency, \\"Mt.Misery\\".

Even \\"outtakes\\" are great because you just add text and a bad photo makes the slide show even more enjoyable. Highly recommend this product--you can have your slide show done literally within minutes. Adding music, transitions, text, pan and zoom can all be done by simply checking a box. The music can even be timed to last as long as the photos. You can burn a DVD then even create and print a custom label using wonderful templates included. My first attempt at creating a slide show was easy, fun and rewarding using this product--best price value. My family and friends are all using this product now too."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT PRODUCT-GREAT PRICE","review":"I bought this for my 17-year-old daughter.

In my opinion this book is well-written and data is presented in intentionally fair manner.

He does not take the diseases lightly in detailing the effects of them. In addition, he gives natural alternatives that work with the body instead of against it. He sites a plethera of sources.

Almost every page in this book has something negative to say about vaccination despite the overwhelming evidence of the many benefits. People are free to make their own choices, but relying on others being imune to disease because their are vaccinated as an excuse not to get shots will only last so long... At some point, as these proponents of no vaccination grow in number they will see someone close to them get ill or worse die because of their lack of foresight.I strongly recommend reading up on the the myths and misconceptions of vaccination on the CDC or Health Canada website.

Byrd's \\"ALONE\\" gets off to a slow start, but as soon as Byrd is left alone, 123 miles from the nearest humans at Little America, during the Antarctic winter, the real drama begins. In 1934, long before science ascertained the real effects of constant darkness on the human psyche, Byrd, in this autobiographical expose, makes it very clear how the lack of sunlight, isolation, and carbon monoxide poisoning can push a man to his utmost mental and physical limits. To top it off, Byrd has a writing style so descriptive and soulful that it makes the reader feel as if he were right there with him as an invisible observer. Anyone who likes to explore the dormant, but always present, dark recesses of the human mind has to read this book. As a result, Byrd unintentionally takes us also on an exploration of the mind, not just the brutal conditions of the Antarctic. Great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irratating prattle","review":"The review titled \\"Alone\\" with his ego - from 2003, said all there is to say about this book.

There is a double zipper at the closure, and for a little added protection there is a rim of fabric that covers the zippers. The fabric is robust, it looks like it should last a long time. The thing I like least is that the sleeves on the front are quite close together, forcing meto pin my elbows to my waist while manipulating the film and reels; I find having my hands so close together is an awkward arrangement.

May not seem like much, but you're forced to work with your arms extended uncomfortably high. Also becomes a problem trying to feel around the bottom of the bag.The metal hoops are oval shaped, so you only get about half the useable space that you'd think you'd get from looking at the picture. You don't have corners to put rectangularly shaped things in, so everything is pushed into the middle.It is light tight - no problems with fog the 2 times I've used it.

I am certain that this is because of the cheapness of the product but why would Pelican even bother selling a DVD remote at all if the user must stand so close to their XBOX 360 that they could actually push the buttons on the console instead? This kind of defeats the whole purpose of a \\"remote control\\" in my opinion. I contacted Pelican to see if they would give me a better product, however, their customer response was completely unsatisfying.

I cut myself shaving my head with this thing more times this last time than I ever want to experience.I think it has something to do with tthe push vs. pull. When you use this, you push the blade over your head as opposed to pulling the blade over your head.I'm gonna stick to my regular blade to shave my head."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of money","review":"the HeadBlade head shaving razor doesn't shave any better or easier than any other razor that i've used and at age 71 i've used many different blades. it looks cute but is rather awkward to use. i'll pass on cute and use the $1.00 throw away that i've been using for the past 5 shaves until its too dull to shave with, then buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it...","review":"I bought this device and pack of razors at the suggestion of a friend.

It takes allot of getting used to and I never got good enough at using it to get a good shave. Be careful with this thing. It doesn't take much inattentive shaving to get nicked. This might be a good product if you practice allot with it, but after a really good nick, I went back to a regular razor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really not that impressed","review":"I bought the headblade and had high expectations for it, but it is not worth the cost. I like to have my head smooth after a shave, but the headblade did not remove any stubble. The design would work well with other blades like a Mach 3, but the blade it is supposed to be used with does nothing. I was very disappointed with the headblade and will go back to straight shaving with a Mach 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"How do you get the hair out of the blade?","review":"I bought this at CVS about 5 years ago after seeing it featured on a TV show. Someone reminded me of it recently, so I decided to share my experience. I've been using a Mach 3 razor for many years to shave my head, and I think it works just fine. I tried this thing, and immediately noticed that there was no easy way to tap the hair out of it. It got clogged with hair and there was no leverage to tap the hair out like there was with a normal shaped razor like the Mach 3. It just got clogged up. I returned it to CVS. Useless compared to the Mach 3. End of story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Danger!","review":"I know some people rave over this gadget, but I really did serious damage on the first use.

A friend recommended this and I thought it looked like a novelty. but it was cheap so I tried it out.NOPE.In no way is this better than an ordinary razor. First of all, you have to learn to shave with both hands because you can't reach everywhere with one hand like you can with a long handle razor. Secondly, this was the first time I have ever cut my head shaving.This thing is a joke. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like being shaved by Wolverine then washed by Edward Scissorhands","review":"I spend a bit of money on razors so decided to give this a go. After all the websites seemed fairly positive. I lathered the head, put on the lotion then shaved in one direction, front to back. You may as well have shaved me with a cheese grater.I'm not new to shaving the head, have been doing it for years. Just thought this would have been better. Alas shaving with a two blade razor is like stepping back to the 1980's. Most razors have five blades, at the worst four.I would really not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Headblade...ouch!","review":"I just threw out my Headblade. I used it for about 6 months. 95% of the time it worked great...it's the other 5% that was hard to take. If you have a perfectly round head, you should be okay. But, if you have any scars, mesquito bits, etc., lookout! ...because the headblade will remove them and it is quite messy and it hurts! What I have found works best is a Panasonic electric razor or if you want a really smooth shave, just use a Gillette Ultra...I have never been cut using either of these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Shave But Shady Design","review":"I was just given one as a gift and used it today. I can see it will take a little getting used to so I took it slow and easy. You don't use a lot of short strokes like a regular razor. Long strokes are what works best while using little pressure.I got a very close shave although I need some practice to get the sides good.They only negative that made me give it a 4 instead of 5 is the cartridge mounting system. There is no button to release the cartridge. You must carefully push it to the side too free one of the clips then pull it from the HB. The mounting bracket is plastic and will break with repeated use. Of course they sell replacements on the website but they charge $5.50 for THREE!Kinda shady but good product otherwise.Side note: There website says the new Rolex model ships with Gillete Sensor mounting clips. I plan on calling them to see if they can sell me some of those so I can use a better cartridge. They're not listed on the website."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect shave every time!!!!","review":"I have been using the Headblade for over a year now and love it!!! I have never shaved my head with anything else. It is definately a different feel than using a regular razor so I can see why other reviewers that are used to using regular razors had some trouble.The Gillette Atra blades are soon going to be discontinued but will be replaced with a Sensor razor blade and adapter---I e-mailed the Headblade company to find this out. The new adapter that will allow Sensor blades to be used will be available sometime in early 2006, according to Headblade.If you purchase this razor be sure and purchase Headslick too. Headslick is the company's shaving cream. Traditional shaving creams are too foamy or thick(gel) to work well for shaving your head. Headslick works perfectly!!A great design and cheaper here than in retail outlets of the companies website."},{"rating":"1","title":"HeadScalp Razor","review":"Tried this and shaved considerable skin off my head and pulled it out of the razor.

For a grandmother who wanted to introduce her granddaughter to the pleasures of stuffed cats (my granddaughter has all kinds of stuffed animals EXCEPT cats, because in general makers won't warrant the age thing, owing to whiskers, noses, and eyes), it's a challenge to find a great cuddly safe stuffed cat.

It was sad when it failed my already low expectations. The animation is poor and rather flat. Not much action, not much detail, not much of anything. Then the plotline. It withstood a whole 5 minutes before I turned the machine off. The dumb bird wants to design a webpage for a girl he likes but can't because some blobs creature called it first. Not very exciting.

This book has a split personality. The first third of Masterdating attempts, using gross generalizations and analogies, to offer dating advice to women. The second two thirds of the book is a strange mix of time worn cliches and new age philosophies.

I jumped ahead to #21 The Trench Soldier and found an author at the end of his creativity, but worse, the laziest interpretation of one of the most documented wars in history. A realistic portrayal of daily life in WW1 trenches would have been interesting to a history junkie, and might have redeemed the time spent reading it. Instead, the author inexplicably tossed off made-up \\"facts\\"about weaponry, and even referred to defending the Maginot line (wrong war altogether).Perhaps other eras were worth the author's effort. The concept of the series, of a man doomed to live forever as a soldier, from Roman times on, was well imagined and the first installment is recommended.

It's comprehensive, and along with the Solomon book, and the Kerman/Tyson offering in the small New Grove edition, you cover a lot of info. It's well-written and doesn't get too lagubrious, in spite of it being translated from the German. I found the subject matter spurred me on anyway.

The album contains three of their best songs ever as the first three tracks: Roll the Bones, Dreamline, and Bravado. All just excellent, terrific songs and up there with any of their finest moments. Some of the lesser known songs on here are also some of my favorites, especially the awesome Ghost of a Chance and Neurotica. Overall an excellent album and a taster of the riches that were to follow with 1994's Counterparts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rush","review":"C'mon!

Nope, can't recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I alone? This is Rush's worst.","review":"I must come from a different planet. I think Presto is fantastic and horribly underrated. Counterparts is a 50/50 album. Have the stuff is excellent, half is junk. Roll the Bones is just lame.

(2 stars for 2 good songs)","review":"I love Rush, I really do, but even now, when I tried to give it a listen, it still sounds like the worst thing that Rush has done (beside Test for Echo) I am really surprised that Rush fans love this album. I just don't get any kinda of vibe from this album. Even though Dreamline and Ghost of a Chance are good songs, the rest seems like filler material. I give it two stars for those two good songs, but otherwise I really can't recommend this. If you want Rush from the 1990's, go with Counterparts. Its easily a 5 star effort and the best from that decade"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rush falls off a cliff with this one","review":"Rush's worst album since Caress of Steel brought to an abrupt end a very strong run of releases that had begun with Hemispheres in 1978. Nevertheless, the album is not without its positives. Dreamline is one of the band's great songs, and there are other good ones, like Bravado, and You Bet Your Life. Face Up, The Big Wheel, and Where's My Thing make for passable filler. The rest, though, is unlistenable garbage, whether it's the strikingly awful rapping in the title track, or the dreadful run of songs \\"Heresy/Ghost of a Chance/Neurotica\\" that surely represent the three worst consecutive tracks -- ever -- on a Rush album. When an album has stuff on it that is so terrible that you'd be embarrassed to play the CD in front of other people, it's pretty bad. When it's a RUSH album that does this, its pretty depressing. Download Dreamline and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rush at their most uninspired.","review":"My this is a toothless old affair. Easily their worst album. The real Rush was over after \\" Hold Your Fire\\". If this was anyone's first experience with the band I don't see how they would find them interesting. By this time they had moved so far away from what put them on the map anyway. If a group debuted with a record like this I doubt any self respecting label would give them a shot to do it again. For fans of tired millionare rock only"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent remastering job","review":"Of the four recent Rush remasters, this is near the top. A big improvement on the original--if you are a serious Rush fan or have a good stereo, it is definitely worth the money.

But other than \\"Heresy\\" and the instrumental \\"Where's My Thing\\", the rest of the album is forgettable mainstream rock. Though fans of the 70s material may appreciate the (near) absence of synthesizers they might still find parts of this CD to be extremely boring. The completist will want to pick this up, but most of the good songs from this album are available on the live set Different Stages.[This review is based on the original 1991 release, not the 2004 remaster; the sound quality on the original is just fine.]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Except for three masterpieces, it all blends together","review":"Funny how time puts everything in perspective...When Roll the Bones first came out I thought it was great--their best album since Signals. BUT, I've been listening to Rush's entire catalogue recently and this one really pales in comparison to most of the other albums. \\"Dreamline,\\" \\"Bravado,\\" and \\"Ghost of a Chance\\" are some of the best work they've ever done (especially lyrically), but the rest of the album sounds very commercial, trite, and bland. But of course, compared to most other bands,it's great...I just expect more out of Rush."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away.","review":"I am a Rush fan and a completist, which is the only reason I bought this CD in the first place. I figured that since the remastering was done this year, the sound quality might be a slight improvement over the 1997 remaster. I compared the two versions side by side, and was surprised to hear immediately that the new version is vastly inferior.

This is probably Rush's most commercial release ever, even more so than 'Permanent Waves' 11 years previously. Tracks like 'Face Up' and 'Dreamline' are as radio-friendly as any music could possibly be, but they still have that unique Rush stamp on them. 'Ghost of a Chance' is the most 'indulgent' track, combining two songs into one and has some wonderful solo work from Alex. Neil and Geddy are once again at their brilliant best, and I rate this as one of Rush's best five albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"The theme flows completely from the first to the last song.","review":"A great album. As an album, I think this one hangs together thematically more than any of the other ones I've heard.

Just buy the album and listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entering the nineties","review":"This cd has three songs on it which were played on the radio quite a bit. Dreamline, which is the opening song, is a really good one nice echo guitar work and keyboards. Roll the Bones was played quite a bit, too. It's a little funky( a little annoying in one part but still is an outstanding track. Ghost of a chance is another song which got a lot of airplay. Good guitar line with excellent slowdown part which helps the song rise above the others. The rest of the cd is good with perhaps the weakest track being neurotica.It's not a great cd but has some solid cuts on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not their best, but still a strong album","review":"Roll the Bones is an album that I personally will always come back to when I'm in a slump. The music isn't the best Rush has ever produced, but that in no way makes it bad. In fact at some points the lyrics are genius, plain and simple. So even if it doesn't live up to A Farewell to Kings, 2112, and Hemispheres, it is still a worthy addition to any Rush library. My personal favorite songs in this album are \`Roll the Bones' and \`Dreamline', both of which flow with great energy and reach great power.If you enjoy Rush and see this album for under $10 make sure not to pass it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Greatest Rush albums","review":"This was the first Rush album I bought and was certainly not the last. When I first heard this album I was blown away by the song structures somehow simple yet complex. Every song on this album is awesome (unlike most of counterparts) and I'm glad this is the first Rush album I heard. \\"Dreamline\\", \\"bravado\\", \\"roll the bones\\" and \\"ghost of a chance\\" are easily Rush classics but the other songs which some have reffered to as \\"fillers\\" are just as good especially \\"bet your life\\" and \\"the big wheel\\". This album seems to be part \\"hold your fire\\" and part \\"counterparts\\". I think \\"Roll the bones\\" is the last great rock n roll album and certainly one of Rushs' very finest.5 outta 5!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock and Roll the Bones Rush style","review":"Rush's first album of the 90's is similar to 1989's Presto and just as good. \\"Dreamline,\\" the album's first track, is one of the best songs the group has ever written as it ties magic and mysticism with the subject of youthful minds wishing to stay young forever, plus it has a catchy intro, great hooks, and a solid guitar jam in the middle. All of the songs on this release have strength and will leave you with something to think about. Musically, the band mix the keyboard and synth sound with driving guitars, and continue their technique of showing how they can still evolve by adding a rap bit to the title track, and they pull it off with hipness and style. Some complained that the band didn't do anything outstanding with this release. Maybe that's true or maybe Rush were preparing the way for 1993's Counterparts, one of the best albums of their career, but they also didn't do anything ordinary either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a great album...","review":"To be brief-if I was making up the \\"desert island list\\" of the handful of albums I could have with me, Roll the Bones would be on that list.

A backwoods mother orders her boys to kill,while she watchs and approves. They kidnap 3 city girls and abuse 1 to the point of death. The remaining 2 must now take revenge for their fallen comrade, and revenge they take. Most of the blood shed take place at the end, with 1 scene in the very begining. While watching you feel for the girls and really want them to put this deranged family in there place(which they do).

This is real annoying. The label and jacket identifies this as 'Some People's Lives' but it is not. Atlantic Records really screwed this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"No one could listen to this.","review":"This is a review of the audiobook only. School is ended and until summer camp starts, my 8 year old daughter has to go to work with me. I stocked up on audiobooks to keep her busy. We both were really excited about the one on Teddy Roosevelt, and started with it first. I set her up listening in the lunchroom and I went back to work. After 5 minutes she showed up in my office saying that there was something wrong with the tape, like it was in slow motion. We played it on another cassette player. We played the other tapes. They're all the same. Lloyd James reads this book one syllable at a time and sounds like a 5 year old that is trying to sound out every word. It goes so unnaturally slow that I thought the cassette spool must be warped. One star is too high."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent entry in the Amos Walker series","review":"\\"The Midnight Man\\" is a bit darker than usual for an Amos Walker novel. Death hangs omnipresent as the intrepid Walker tries to bring a cop killer to justice before he is killed by the police. Along the way he encounters black militants, a bounty hunter, a sex-starved cop's wife and more dead bodies than he would care to count. Author Loren D. Estleman runs his hero through the wringer in this adventure and it is a great ride indeed. Walker is everything a great P.I. ought to be, tough, sarcastic, somewhat alcoholic and beholden to a his own private code of justice. He is Phillip Marlowe updated for modern times.This \\"I-Book\\" edition features the added bonus of an essay by the author regarding his inspiriations for the novel. Addtionally, it also has an Amos Walker short story, \\"Redneck\\" that comes along at the end like the desert to a fine meal. Overall a very worthwhile package."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second best in the Walker series","review":"I thought this was the second best in the Walker series (Silent Thunder being my favorite). It is dark, violent and provides an interesting window into Detroit in the early 80's."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great lullaby album","review":"Siente is a thoughtful, internationally-oriented album of \\"night songs\\" from such varied cultures and countries as the Basque region of Spain, Ireland, Indonesia, Brazil, and the Sephardic tradition.Musicianship is impeccable, with Hilary Field taking center stage on guitar and backed by violin, flute, accordion, mandolin, English horn, bass, and cello on various tracks. Like Mae Robertson, Patrice O'Neill has just the kind of warm, angelic voice required for the task, and her renderings of these musical selections from varying cultures are all believable, an accomplishment considering the wide variation in their backgrounds. Siente offers an interesting and engaging approach both to lullabies in world music and to classical music ensembles for children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful baker","review":"I purchased this as a gift for my son because he really enjoys the quality and results of cooking and baking with Emile Henry products.

It has a great scent: light and citrus-y."},{"rating":"1","title":"the usual suspects","review":"I remember Ebert complaining that the problem with the twist at the end of The Usual Suspects was that it negated the film - that nothing in the movie actually really happened. True enough, but the tale spun in The Usual Suspects was so entertaining that it didn't matter. Fascinating characters, excellent dialog and action. The same trick is employed here but it's not effective because: a) the trick was not done well, b) the characters are absolutely inane and the acting is appalling. I'm concerned that people who find this brilliant are hankering for something so intellectually robust that they can elevate themselves to a state of intelligencia by \\"getting it\\". There's nothing worth \\"getting\\" here, folks. It's a poorly planned mind-trick that is just not interesting enough to be worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good of Kind a la 'Siesta', 'Solaris' and the sort","review":"Why was this film so widely panned in the U.S. It is NOT incomprehensible, nor poorly acted or filmed. My guess is that the temple dogs of media neither \\"get\\" or allow material that challenges the ego mind or the consensual model of reality, unless it's marketed as hokum or horror.Folks who get A Course in Miracles or any other spiritual map which exposes the illusions of the ego-mind-body time space trap will both enjoy and understand this subtle outing about a mind in crisis and another mind joining his in order to come to a higher understanding of being.MacGregor, Gosling and Watts are affecting. The Asche and Spence score is not much different than their sonics for \\"Monster's Ball\\"... effective, but not memorable. I'll be glad when films get off this whole ambient schtick. I like the old thrillers and dramas with melodic background a la Herrmann and Donaggio. I suppose it's always in cycles."},{"rating":"1","title":"unfortunate","review":"This movie was touted as a \\"dramatic thriller\\", and turned out to be anything but. As supernatural as War and Peace (and twice as hard to follow), Stay is more of an indy-artsy-sad movie than true thrill ride.

Save your money, and your sanity...skip this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not Satisfied with knowing nothing.....(1.5 Stars)","review":"I know that some people may see this low review and instantly dismiss it, but I beg those few to hear me out. I wanted to love this movie, I like all kinds of films and the movie's premise and dark style drew me in and led me to buy it. Let me start and say Ryan Gosling is one of my favorite young actors, Bob Hoskins I've loved since \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\", and director Marc Forster is a good one. That being said the film doesn't ultimately make any sense, atleast in my mind. If that doesn't bother you, then that is fine. The acting is good, there are some intense scenes, some people may be dead, or in a dreamlike state but I couldn't honestly tell you to save my life. What I do know is that I truly love movies..and I have never left a movie feeling so ultimately unsatisfied as I did after \\"Stay\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Must Have Not Seen Something...","review":"This movie started off on a slow but understandable pace, although the actors I considered wooden and uninteresting except maybe for the college student himself because you wanted to know what was going on with him.Yet as this movie progresses instead of building up to some answers all you get left with are many more questions and thus stop enjoying the movie and just growing irratated with it. You have no idea what is really going on and in the end it is just one huge twist that will leave you bitter you even picked up this movie in the first place.So yes maybe I missed something- I must have since many of the reviews on this film are glowing. Yet I will not lie- I did not understand the film. Hardly did I ever and I don't plan on watching it again.

The movie is well-shot, but compelling imagery does not make a great feature film. For those who are interested, the plot was lifted directly from the much creepier, much less artier, and much more emotionally compelling, and much more realized 'Jacob's Ladder'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange Little Movie!","review":"Didn't enjoy this movie and wouldn't recommend it at all! Too confusing and difficult to untangle the plot lines and figure out which scenario was real and which one was not, except for maybe the beginning and ending.

Ripoff!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great cast but what a mess!","review":"Who put this mess together?

I found myself at the end recalling all the things Ryan Gosling said (\\"I hear voices\\") and got really juiced at how it all fit together so perfectly. It's maybe one of the best endings to a movie ever. Quite the sudden and stunning denouement. You gotta love a movie with a denouement...and Naomi Watts."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best recent films I've seen in some time.","review":"First of all, the editing and cinematography in this film is masterful. I can't recall a film oozing with this much style: camera tricks, rapid editing, filters- you name it and this film has it in excess. In fact, I'll go as far to type that this is one of the most aesthetically gorgeous films I've watched in quite a while. This film is not all style and no substance, but I will state that the ending was a letdown. Anyone that has seen anything like \\"Mulholland Drive\\", \\"Dead End\\", or \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" will figure out the movie within the first 30 minutes or so. The film works because it has excellent replay value due to the aforementioned editing and cinematography. You'll pick up new things after subsequent viewings and things will start to click. The acting in the film is more than plausible and I think the script is fairly decent except for the predictable ending. I recommend this film to anyone that likes psychological, mindbending films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than impressed","review":"Movie arrived and I was less than impressed from the get go. It was rated as \\"in good condition\\" when I purchased it, but when I pulled it out of the shipping envelope, the case looked really old and damaged. The cardboard movie cover looked like it had water damage and was stuck to the plastic case. I had to spend 5 minutes getting it off, tearing it in the process, before I could even open the movie case. The disc was floating around inside when I finally got it open."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purchased this on the basis of other reviews","review":"Let me tell you, I will be in the minority on this film. First of all,it's a mess. You assemble fine actors and a reasonable story. Then constrain them with horrible lines and bad writing.All of the charactors have had some distrubing incident. (like that will make them more interesting)I guess it was to give them a common thread.I watched hoping this film would get better,but by the mid-way point I didn't care.The ending if you call it that, was the most disappointing.If I was suppose to be entertained I wasn't. Don't waste your money renting this grooner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's blame it on brain activity.....","review":"For some reason this really devastatingly horrible film has some kind of following starting to form. It's a group of people that for one haven't seen a little movie named \\"Mulholland Drive\\", and think that because you like this movie you are, per se, 'intelligent'. I say this because the most frequent attack I hear in an arguement over this movie is 'You didn't like it because you didn't understand it; because you were confused'.Not true, I understood it, I understood it quite well. If you're watching this because you're waiting for the next big 'cult' film since \\"Donnie Darko\\", pass; or if you're watching it because that guy off \\"The Notebook\\" is a main, pass. Because folks, this movie is truely horrible.There is only one good thing about it, the cinematography. In my opinion, this is one of the most pretentious movies of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"stay away","review":"I totally agree with Steve Mcintosh's review. Couldn't have said it better. A movie should not be rated as a great movie simply because of its visuals but rather it should be rated highly based on its synopsis and plot. One other thing - for all of you reviewers out there who write stay is a good movie and who recommend seeing it a second time you couldn't be more wrong. I would only watch a movie a second time if I really enjoyed watching it for the first time. Seeing a movie a second time to understand it better/more completly really suggests that the movie was a horrible piece of work whose audience cannot even follow in one round. This movie however, is not totally and utterly horrible - it is possible to sit through it (unlike other movies I've seen, namely, in the bedroom, closer and match point) if you really have the time and are curious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is a really really bad movie.

Stay starts with a great idea: a troubled young man who surprises his psychologist by being able to predict the future. But as the doctor (McGregor) rushes to try to save his patient (Gosling), the movie evolves into what looks like the first-time project of a film student who's bent on impressing the audience by showing off how many special effects he can get from his camera. What happened to Marc Foster when he directed this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Story that I had expected was very different","review":"Now I'm curious about mental disease.So I bought this because I thought this is a kind of film like \\"girl interrupted\\" or \\"above the nestle\\"This story could be arresting as it could make you confuse.But it's very ambiguous.I can't express with words what this film is.It was like day dream.But it's involved several people at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind-blowing!","review":"Stay starring Ryan Gosling, Ewan McGregor, and Naomi Watts is a tricky, strange, and fascinating film to say the least. Stay is still a bit confusing and you are never really sure which story is real, the end or the beginning but I liked this movie because you the viewer is left to ponder who's reality is the most accurate. Naomi Watts turns in another star-making performance and Ryan Gosling steals every scene he is in. If you enjoy a good and well-made pyschological thriller then Stay is for you. I highly recommend checking this film out, it's thrilling!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does The Job","review":"This hard drive case gave me a nice backup drive because of a harddrive I pulled out of a broken laptop.

I *was*, however, expecting it to at least work. I've tried this enclosure with both Windows XP and Linux, with one or both of the USB plugs on the Y-cable connected, every USB port on my computer, praying ...

If you need a real remote, pick up a Sony universal remote and buy yourself a TiVo, it's well worth it.

Stay away from this remote!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Remote!","review":"I love my guide remote, people are always asking where I got mine. I actually got off eBay for about 20 bucks.The remote is easy to use and has tons of functions.The only function I've not been able to access is the PIP feature for my Big Screen. :(The remote never downloads on the first try, usually in about 4 attempts.If you find its only downloading 3-4 out of 7 days on the guide, you'll have to adjust the settings on the members web page, you'll need to disable the critic picks, and show summary report.You'll then have enough room on its small memory to download a full 6-7 days of programming.I wish the buttons lit up.

Alas, after that, it just wanders around grasping at allegory. It's sort of wacky. Sometimes it's almost funny. I wish that Jerry Lewis hadn't agreed to do this -- he can be so funny, but in this one, it just seemed needy and grasping.Oh yes -- having had a suicide in my immediate family, that plot thread dampened my excitement - sort of scary actually.

I am just to dumb. And, I am much to dumb to understand this movie. If you like a good story, its not for you. If you like movie's where things happen, its not for you.

I still watch the this version about once a year and still notice some new metaphor or motif every time. Some very dark humor here -- Lili Taylor attempting to hang herself with a pair of panty hose is hilarious. Taylor is wonderful throughout, as is Vincent Gallo who plays an aspiring actor. Seems to me like this was an unusual role for Depp -- he plays a rather average sort of fellow, who finds himself among some real eccentrics. While others may feel that those eccentricities are a bit over the top, in some ways this made them all the more believable to me. Too bad the soundtrack isn't available -- it includes an Iggy Pop song that I'd really like to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is unbearable","review":"First of all, let me establish that I am a huge Johnny Depp fan. Alright? Okay then...next, this movie was one of a kind in that it was so unbearable to watch that I became sick of life and tried to hang myself with pantihose as was done in the film.

I can see why only 20% of the phone reps make all the money. There's so much cutesy nice crap out there that just doesn't work. Being in sales means being money hungry and agressive. This is definetly the best book I've read on phone sales. Joes main concept is simple. Ask good questions, and get them to reach into their pocket and give you the money!This book isn't for the squeamish. I love this guys style and techniques. You're either a top producer or your not.

That's an entirely different approach, and this type of selling would not work for you. If you make 100+ cold calls a day and can close your product either on the inital call or within a couple of weeks, this book will be perfect for you.

As you know, most of the training you get at work is mostly useless. These so called managers who never sold a thing in their lives think they know how to sell. We all know that's a big joke.

Phils crappy vocals aren't even the main reason why this disc sucks either, some of the stupidest guitar riffs i've ever had the displeasure of hearing are on here.

Maybe they'll redeem themselves sometime down the road."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes a seasoned metalhead and Phil lover to fully appreciate.","review":"As has been said, this one is not for the timid. This is the angry part of Phils soul in the form of extremely aggressive and emotional hardcore/thrash hybrid. A truly emotionally captivating record, requiring a very deep understanding of Phil and his goals in music. Unless you know how to feel real hatred, desperation and anger you cannot fully appreciate this album. Not to mention, some of the most badass in your face, pumping heavy metal riffs written, and no surprises considering both phil and bower worked on this. Stay away from this unless you know how to listen to music. This is one of the best. Relentless and draining. Get this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bites Down to the Bone.","review":"This beautiful example of Hard Core Punk mixed with Deep Hard Rock is just what the Dr. ordered.

Another freakin Pantera. They sound just about the same, maybe a little simpler. They sound like that late eighties, early nineties metal. Band sounds decent, but the vocals just [stink]. His screams is just downright annoying. He never wants to change his tone. Always that high pitch screech, and then a death metal growl. I'm pretty disappointed in this album. I'm not a Pantera fan, but I guess I was just hoping for something that I knew in the back of my head wasn't there. Oh well, live and learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me????","review":"Maybe some people who are desperate to hear something new and heavy are fooling themselves into thinking this is a good album...or group for that matter. How could any self-respecting PanterA fan like this crap??? There's hardly any material in this CD to make you wanna pick up a guitar...or make you drop your jaw because you have no idea how they play that. It's just plain and boring. So it's fast....big deal...so he screams a lot...big deal. Where's the music in it? It's crap people make up when they first start playing guitar and they have no idea what they're doing.

Superjoint is one of the greatest extreme metal bands on the planet, and it holds true to Phil's direction of The Great Southern Trendkill. This album has some really good stuff on it, like It Takes No Guts, The Alcoholic, and Everyone Hates Everyone. If you dig Pantera's really heavy stuff, check this out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard as it Gets!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"When this cd first hit shelves I bought it. And have been listening to the thing everyday now. This music takes metal to a whole new level it's intensity is relentless and takes Slipknot out of the picture of being the hardest band in metal. This cd is over 54 minutes of nonstop hardcore violent music, just the way I like my music. I have listened to all Phil Anselmos side projects and to say the least this is the best after Pantera. Superjoint Ritual may not be better than Pantera but they are sure as hell harder. So if you like hardcore music like Slayer and Hatebreed this is your ticket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phil at his Heaviest!!","review":"This album kicks the crap out of \\"A Lethal Dose of American Hatred.\\" All around better music.

More expensive does not equate to a better product.I was surprised when both openers did not live up to the hype and had to be returned. The OXO opener did a very poor job opening a can and left jagged edges.The WMF had a very sharp burr on the bottom of one handle which had the potential to leave a nasty cut on the hand, had it not been seen before use. It also did not do a great job opening cans.The Smart Living openers have a nicely rounded rubber grip as well as a very nice ergonomic rubber twist grip to open the cans and feel great in the hand.

What a shame! Anybody knows that coherent communication and Soliton are dead since WDM became commercial deployment in 1996. On other hand, the author did not cover anything applications which are succefully beaten the coherent communication and Solition and are widely applied in the current optical communication systems (e.g., CRZ, DPSK modulation, high capacity DWDM....). It seems the author is not in touch with the industry for many years and is repeating the older and dead topics.Moreover the software contained in the CD-ROM is completely useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried to give it a zero star","review":"This is a horrible book that presents a lot of scattered topics but fails to bound them together.

It isn't even worth discussing the plot, poorly contrived that it is, because twice in the book the so-called hero \\"takes the heroine by force\\"(he even uses those words. They have kind of a marriage of convenience for the sake of her orphaned niece, but on the wedding night, Anton forces himself upon Laura. No reason, apparently other than it was \\"his right\\" or something. Later on, in jealousy, he does it again. Both times it is described in terms that sound like rape. There isn't anything romantic about sex that isn't consensual, it is rape and that's all it is. I'm glad this book is out of print. It should stay that way. The copy I got is going right into the trash where it belongs. I believe that I have read some Yvonne Whittal Harlequins in the past, that weren't like this one but I wouldn't buy any more of her books after reading this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way over-priced for such poor quality","review":"I bought this garlic press because it was stainless steel.

I do not understand why individuals go about attempting to destroy scientology. I have objectively reviewed this religon.

Dissing Hubbard and his many followers is a profitable enterprise, not unlike the news rags at the supermarket checkout stand which jump out with assertions of 2 headed coyotes and celebrity madness. I have been a Scientolofor several years, and the training and therapy that I have received from Mr. Hubbard has helped me triple my income. Not by ripping off unsuspecting seekers who are dragged into a Scientology church or mission, as Corydon might have you believe, but by making me more productive and efficient at my job (plumbing) and life. Don't listen to naysayers. Find out for yourself.

This book tracks the bizarre life of a very strange man and his legacy, the church of Scientology."},{"rating":"2","title":"MADMAN!","review":"An excellent book for anyone who wishes to know what goes on inside $cientology, and just who L.

I figured the book was just some structureless compilation of ex-scientologist's little stories. (Tilman Hausherr, in his well written review in this thread, sees the book this way.) For years, I didn't bother to read it. Recently, I picked it up again, after having read many other books critical of Scientology. I now think my earlier view of Madman or Messiah was mistaken. There is a substantial chronological, autobiographical structure to the book, in which the long quotations from other ex-scientologists play a supportive role. The richness of detail and the clarity of presentation make this book one of the best of the many good books by ex-Scientologists about Scientology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not serious","review":"Author plays with fear and paranoia.

I would advise reading 'What is Scientology' or one of Hubbard's basic Scientology books before or after reading this one to truly understand Scientology. When you look at it fairly, Scientology actually isn't as bad as this book makes it out to be.What are the author's motives? The large majority of educated people who have viewed Scientology from an unbiased view point have found nothing wrong with it.

I can say truthfully that this book is full of lies. L. Ron Hubbard was a great man and has been viewed as such by many world leaders and dignitaries. He was an amazing humanitarian and someone who has created a beautiful technology that anyone can use to better any condition in their life. I think that anyone claiming otherwise is probably hiding actions of his own that he could be upbraided for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ranting and raving","review":"Don't waste your money on the ranting and raving of Mr. Corydon.

OK, so the critics are right; Jon is more organized and better documented. ***BUT*** Bent manages to dig up more dirt!!! I liked the detailed desciptions of L. Ron's dabbling in \\"Magick\\", and Satanism as practiced by L. Ron's hero, Aliester Crowley (British Satanist). The one part of Bent's book, here, (actually very frightening) that really shows L. Ron for the EVIL man that he was, is when he told his oldest son, L. Ron Jr. (Ron Jr. is quoted), that REAL power comes from nothing less than EVIL itself. $cientology was started by an evil man, and the evil continues to this day. Any doubts!?!? READ this book!!!!

This book claims that it gives a sort of anthology of Lewis's works, with selections slightly longer than those from other anthologies (such as A Mind Awake or Words to Live By). Unfortunately, this book seems to be littered with excerpts that, to be fair, are indeed longer than most excerpts from other anthologies, but the selections lack the context necessary in order for the selection to be understood. This often leads the reader wondering what is meant by what he just read, hardly something desirable, especially given Lewis's extraordinary clarity on most occasions. This book represents Lewis in a bad light. A useful anthology is A Mind Awake. More useful, but also more expensive, is Words to Live By (both by Lewis).

Just like when you are in a dance club. To top it off, the songs fade rapidly. It gives you the impression that the recording engineer wanted to \\"split\\" from the studio as soon as possible. The only thing that saves this Cd from getting 0 stars ( aside from the fact that it's the lowest score amazon lets you give) is it's half-decent songs.

Photo finish is great, and even though the plotter seems to want to let the ink dry for 3 minutes after printing, I have no smudging problems at all if I bypass the drying time.The only thing I should mention is even though I bought the \\"stain\\" version of the paper, it still is shiny, and doesn't work extremely well with the overhead lights as I have where the prints are being mounted. Paper is significantly duller than the \\"high-gloss\\" paper though, so I guess I can't complain about that.

I couldn't agree more. It's true, Con law doesn't lend itself to the E&E; format. You are much better off writing a kick-ass outline based on the Chemerinsky book. Be careful though, Erwin Chemerinsky has at least two Con Law books published by Aspen- one is a casebook called \\"Constitutional Law\\" (in red cloth binding) and the other is the hornbook called \\"Constitutional Law: Principles and Policies\\" in a black paperback. That's the one you want.Aside from this one bump, the E&E; series is excellent, and extremely useful for Civ Pro, Contracts, Torts, Property and Crim Pro.

Gemignani has presented a useful method for small groups (6-12) to examine their relationship with God. The author begins at the beginning: God loves us and seeks us. From there he shows how we can respond to God's love through prayer and development of a personal rule of life. Getting to know God within a small group is beneficial because we learn to help one another. My church implemented this method six months ago. Participants are very responsive and praise the content and thought-provoking questions after each lesson.

I was looking for a book with more simple and practical explanations mainly on how to mathematically calculate roof framing.I found the book \\"measuring, marking and layout\\" to be much more helpful and valuable, as well as several other books on roof framing specifically.

It doesn't even have rafter tables for different pitches of roof. There is way too much text and the reference to the diagrams is confusing. This book goes way too much into details to do even the simplest thing. The math in the book reminds me of my Trig class, but do you really need to do all that math for one little common rafter. That's what a rafter table is for. I am very disappointed in this book. It has pictures of odd roofs, but I find the description of each roof hard to understand.

They are also nice as night lights by supplying a good amount of light without using a ton of electricity being that they are LED's.

The batteries for the emergency backup are button cells (like you would find in a calculator/watch/car remote--a small stack of them). To get to them, you have to destroy the device; not very green Sylvania and super wasteful.Sylvania (or whoever makes these) redeemed themselves with the Model 72488, which has li-ion batteries (AA's) that are accessible and last an incredible 4-5 days when the power goes out.

While this flaw is easy to get past - the battery life is not. The unit is marketed as a rechargeable \\"emergency power failure\\" flashlight.

They make a nice nightlight, and the FIRST time the power goes out they do a good jobs as emergency lights. BUT It is one time thing for the emergency light and flash light because either the unit does not recharge the battery or the batteries are bad and will not recharge. Same problem with all three! So save your money and buy some cheap night-lights and a good flashlight."},{"rating":"1","title":"DREADFUL. Sent them both back.","review":"These are dreadful. Read and heed the many negative reviews. They cover both outlets (duh)!I ordered two and have returned them both. One didn't work as a standby light at all.They both had rotary switches that were so tight a pair of pliers was required to move them.Amazon should really stop selling these.And if there is anyone still alive at Sylvania that remembers what quality products were once sold under that brand name, they would be ashamed of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of junk","review":"I have owned this product for 1 month.

They're attractive and work very nicely as a night light and emergency (power outage) light. This is typical of a great idea that doesn't actually work in actual practice.I bought a large number of these for many outlets in my large house. Right out of the box, one out of ten failed.Now they've all failed. Ten out of ten. I've had these about four months and it was just money thrown away.They are useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dies way too fast - not what it used to be","review":"The battery won't hold a charge after just a few months. I guess they were better years ago but everyone seems to be throwing these out now. My Eveready rechargeable has held a good charge for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 for 1 price and one failed in only 3 months","review":"I got these from local supermarket at buy 1 get 1 free deal, after only 3 months, when the power failed in our community, I found out one of them already failed. It still work as a night light when plug in wall outlet but the battery do not store charge at all. I pull it out from the wall socket and the light will not even last 2 seconds. If you buy multiple of these like me, hopefully you still have at least one working unit when power fail. But if you only have one unit, good luck with that."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAVEAT EMPTOR!","review":"This product is great in idea, but Sylvania created a piece of junk, here. I purchased three of these lights. Within 45-60 days, they would not function as a flashlight, as they should, when detached from the electrical outlet. Furthermore, in case of power failure, they also do not come on, utilizing their built-in, rechargeable batteries, as they should. Now, these are nothing more than expensive night-lights; each of the three I purchased broke. I will not be purchasing much else from Sylvania, if this is the type of quality they let escape their manufacturing plants."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quits working after about 3 months","review":"At first these lights worked great. It was very handy as a quick flashlight where I didn't have to worry about the batteries being dead as with standard flashlights. The one time we lost power it was great to see these all lit up around the house. But now we've had 3 out of 5 units quit working - they no longer hold a charge. They'll function as a nightlight, but if the power goes out or they're unplugged from the wall, they don't function. They end up being expensive nightlights. I cannot recommend them - spend your money on another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Batteries","review":"The batteries lasted only a couple of months on all three lights. Very poor quality for a name brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst products I never buy","review":"I buy a 3 pack of these thing. I connected all of them in differents parts of my house the same night. At the morning two of them burned out together with the outlet. The third one works partially. Served as an backup light only the first week.It leave me with a bad taste, for continuing shopping by internet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Last","review":"Don't waste your money. These lights are alright (not great) when new and gradually loose their ability to hold a charge in about a year. Unless you test them frequently you will find out during a power outage that they are dead. Even when they were new the light was not all that bright and the battery did not last very long before needing a recharge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed in 2 monts","review":"LIke other reviewers, I found the nighlight feature great, but a little too bright, still not a problem. Also great flashlight option - very strong. However after having this plugged in with the nightlight feature turned on 'auto', after about 1 1/2 months, the flashlight part no longer works. It is now only useful as a nightlight. I am very disapointed with this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 out of 3 ain't bad - or is it?","review":"I bought these units as a 3 pack and I find that 2 of the 3 units still function after less than a year. It would seem to me a unit designed to be a failsafe power failure device should be capable of being plugged in, left alone, and available when needed, which should be infrequently.The unit probably suffers from inferior quality cells and should probably be cycled on and off on a regular basis. They last just long enough to satisfy the warranty period.I noticed other people mentioned when this unit is plugged in to a normal duplex outlet, the other plug becomes unusable which is absolutely true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Battery died in only a few weeks; battery (and LEDs) not replacable; manufacturer does not honor warrenty; covers both outlets of the plug-in."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY. SAFTEY HAZARD","review":"After buying these in a three pack from BJs a few months ago two do not work. They did not just stop working. The battery blew up inside. A few weeks ago a family member was upstairs and heard a loud bang. After a lot of searching of what could have made the noise we figured it was this light. It did not work anymore and when it was shook you could hear something moving inside. A few weeks later I was sitting at my computer and heard a loud bang from the direction of another one near me. I unplugged the light and could hear a fizzing sound. I unplugged the third one and put them both in the outside trash. Do not buy these for your own safety. I don't think the explosion of the battery inside could cause a fire. But don't risk it. If you reading this you can already see that too many people have issues with them. I will be writing to Sylvania. They should stop selling these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery doesn't last; too bright for a night light","review":"I had a hard time finding places to use these, because they are so bright. Ordinarily a good thing, but not for a night light.Today I tried to use one as a flashlight, and discovered that, although it has been continuously plugged in for the last 17 months, the battery did not have enough power to yield even a faint light. Out of the socket, no light, nada. In the socket, very bright LED that would have made a good flashlight. (Yes, I know about the different control settings.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"I purchased 3 of these to use in case of a power failure. I plugged them in per instructions. Had a power failure and none of them worked. Have gone back to having flashlights placed around the house so I can grab one in case the lights go out again. This product is not worth the time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nightlight too bright, batteries' life too short","review":"Bought a three-pack of these at Home Depot about nine months ago. On two, the batteries no longer hold a charge, so they're useless as flashlights/emergency lights. On all three, the nightlight is too bright - bright enough to read by in an otherwise darkened room. In addition, the design blocks both outlets in wall plate."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got a lemon!","review":"I don't know why we didn't return this, because after it's been plugged in overnight it only was good for a night light. The flashlight has never worked. So after reading the other reviews I feel I have a lemon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suits the needs well","review":"Gives sufficient light as a night light and is very bright as an emergency light - however, without an adapter, takes up both outlets of a standard wall socket and extracting the plug from the unit can be a little tricky - but not enough to dissuade me from recommending it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good back-up light","review":"I have four of these and I use them on my house. The flashlight is of a useful brightness and the emergency light aspect is excellent on a region where power sometimes goes out at night.The plug is not polarized, so you can point the night light portion up or down, and I do both. The plug position is such that the light covers both power outlets if you have an inline 2 power outlets faceplate, thus rendering the other power outlet useless. This is the only reason I did not give a 5-star review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Junk!","review":"Five months ago, I purchased ten of these to make traveling through the house safer during a power outage. After a few months, three stopped working. I returned them and received three more. As of this date, out of the ten, only one continues to work, and it is ready to go at any time. I have found, over the last several years, that Sylvania products have become extremely inferior to other products, most especially their light bulbs.Previously, while out of the room, one of Sylvania's regular 60-watt light bulbs, which was in a fixture above my dining room table, burst. This caused one piece of the element to fall into a solid oak dining chair. It burned a 1/2 inch long by 1/16 inch deep hole in the chair. I shudder to think what could have happened if the piece had fallen on a place mat or if there had been cushions in the chair.I will most definitely never purchase or recommend any Sylvania product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Power Failure Night Light","review":"This light serves triple duty: a night light, a constant on light and a flash light. We lost power twice last year and wish we had the light then. Not only will the flashlight be useful when the power is out, but it can also be found in the dark due to the battery backup. We bought several for around the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"These are absolutely worthless and Sylvania knows it. I bought three and two wouldn't hold a charge from the start. The third held charge for a few months but then died. I complained to Sylvnaia and they sent several coupons. Unfortunately, I used some to buy replacement units....which also turned out to be defective. If you want expensive nightlights buy them but don't count on the flashlight working when you need it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy!","review":"The idea is great but this is worthless, the \\"battery\\" (I took it apart and it's a sort of capacitor not a battery you can replace) stopped charging after three months making this thing worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEFECTIVE DESIGN - DO NOT BUY !!!","review":"We have four of these lights, and after 6 months ALL of them lost their battery-backup capabilities as others have posted.

Whole apartment was pitch dark and this light didn't light up even though it had been charged for two days. What a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone need to purchase this flashlight!!!!!","review":"Every time I needed a flashlight, I found it in each room. This product serves as a rechargeable night light & emergency flashlight. Each light bulb consume only 0.35W of electricity. This product will make a great gift for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"necessary item","review":"Looked all over for a product like this. It provides emergency lighting when the power goes out and is an excellent night light under normal conditions. The price was reasonable, delivery excellent. Would recommend the LED power failure light to anyone who has been left in the dark when the power goes off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't recommend it","review":"It's better than nothing, but there are other items on the market that, in my opinion, are better designed. The Greenlight LED 3 in 1 offers 8 hours of post-power illumination to this one's 3, doesn't monopolize the outlet, and is 5 bucks cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not reliable","review":"Purchased one, and the battery failed. Giving the brand the benefit of the doubt, I purchased another. My mistake. The second one failed within a couple of months. What's the use of an emergency light if it's not available in an emergency?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice while they lasted...","review":"This is a great little product that does just what it says. However, the batteries only lasted for about 6 months. Now, if the power goes out or if they are unplugged to use as a flashlight they just go dead. They are not an expensive night light!Also, you can only really use these in the vertical position (as shown in the photos) if your electrical plugs are vertical and the unit will cover both plugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"No quality","review":"We ordered a total of 16 units and within six months eight of them had ceased to function at all, three would only work when plugged in (the rechargeable batteries ceased to hold charge) and the others were returned new.

DO NOT purchase, as they will certainly become non operational before a year is up!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best choice","review":"I purchased 3 of these (3pack) and am quite disappointed with the product(s). Of the 3 one will not charge as an emergency flashlight but can be used as a night light,another fails to turn off when there is adequate background light. The night light is far to bright and the fixture when in place prevents using the second outlet port. Maybe I'm spoiled by the nightlight that I purchased over 10 years ago that worked until quite recently. I certainly would not buy them again as there seem to be far better choices for about the same price.."},{"rating":"1","title":"POWER FAILURE LIGHTS THAT FAILED!","review":"Purchased 9 of these in 2007 and plugged them in all over the house. We had a power failure last week that lasted for several hours. 5 of the 9 DID NOT WORK AT ALL. Ok as night lights but not very dependable for power failure lights. Less than a 3 year longevity is not very much considering the cost. Very disappointing. (I have a couple of a different type that I purchased in the 1980's and although not LED, they still worked!) I will look for another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"sylvan nite lights","review":"i saw these lights when i was in berlin ohio. these are the coolest night lights when electric goes out nice flashlight comes on and night light is bright also. i bought 6 for xmas presents and everyone loved them. they were actually cheaper on amazon than straight from sylvania. i plan on buying more of these also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Power failure mode failed after 6 months","review":"We bought one of these 6 months ago and have had it plugged into an outlet in a hallway, where it's a great little nightlight. However, the power failure mode on it no longer works- when it's unplugged, the flashlight part will not turn on. There's no problem with the light itself, as you can plug it into the wall, turn the switch to \\"on\\" and have the flashlight part come right on. I suppose it's just a really bad battery or something that died after a few months.We are still using it for a hallway light, since in light sensing mode it works very well.

Really poor design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery has very short life","review":"I bought two of these about a year ago. They work well as a nightlight, but a recent powerfailure showed that the battery is poor. They no longer held a charge and failed as a power-failure emergency flashlight.

Be careful to not jostle the coffee maker after you fill it with the maximum volume of water, or water will dribble down the back of it and form a puddle on the counter.

We make two or three pots of coffee a day. Our first one broke in less than a year. The internal tubing that carries the water sprung a leak. We thought we got a lemon and ordered another. This time in less than a year the heating element went. My third one broke today also after less than a year. Once again the heating element went bad and the water won't heat or pump. While on the surface a great coffee pot for the price, it gets pricey when you need to replace it this often. I think it's time for me to find another brand of coffee maker."},{"rating":"2","title":"coffee machine","review":"I have only had my coffee maker for about 24 hours but so far it is my favorite ever.

It was a good, basic coffee maker. It also took less ground coffee than other makers, to make a decent cup of coffee. The coffee was hot and stayed hot in the carafe, which I liked. I didn't have many of the other problems that people had. Mine just quit one day. It was working perfectly the day prior. I would expect a \\"Best Buy\\" to last longer than 15 months.

Bought it on 8/12/10. Within a month it was leaking clean water out the back. So much for Amazon's guarentee, 2 days late! Wrote the vendor and have been trading emails for another month.For as cheap as this pot was, just send a new one for good customer service. Today was the last straw. I knew it was taking to long so I went to look at it. Got there just as the top of the filter opened and ALL THE GRINDS and water spilled all over the counter and floor.DO NOT BUY! A real piece of junk. And I also thought B&D; made good products.Tony DiVito"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and easy, but a little slow","review":"It was just what I looked for: a simple and easy to use coffeemaker for a reasonable price.

I need to suck it up and buy a new one."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than my expectation","review":"The brewing is quick and the warming plate function is good, hot enough for me. Only one thing is that when you want to put more water to brew, when you life the 'one-piece cover' on the top, the vapor/water of last brew will fall to the back along the machine body and to cord, so I always wipe after doing that, in case the water into the cord storage. Anyway it's good go use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Product","review":"Soon after purchase coffee began leaking all over the counter top.

They talked about it brewing at the right temperature and being inexpensive. They were right about the coffee it makes, it's good. But, like other reviewers pointed out, this thing is junk. I haven't had all the problems others have had, but the spring popping out when cleaning and the \\" dribble pot \\" syndrome makes this coffemaker a loser. Like another reviewer I will buy another pot and keep this one for backup. My biggest mistake is, that I walked into a store and purchased it.

The one I have stops intermittently during the brew cycle, the rim on the hot plate cracked after just 1 month, you have to use more coffee than with other coffee makers and it takes about 12 minutes to make 6 cups of coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can make excellent beans taste horrible","review":"I bought this to replace a Gevalia coffee maker that i broke the carafe on. No matter how i ground/measured the coffee in this maker, I could not get the coffee to come out tasting right. The beans and filters i use are top notch and I have had no complaints using them in other people's coffee makers. My one thought is that the water heater they use may not get the water hot enough to extract the flavor from the coffee. Unless you don't mind good beans that end up tasting like Folgers, i'd go ahead and pick up something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"DAMAGED GOODS","review":"ALTHOUGH I LIKE THE BRAND OF THE COFFE MAKER I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT THE MACHINE WAS DEFECTIVE WHEN I RECIVED IT .

Granting dissonance is not for everyone, there are brief airs of musical interest, but they are lost in what can be described best as organized noises. After listening to this, one will be left with two impressions: a piano lesson with Ornstein must have been unrivaled, and it is better to have borrowed this CD then to have bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"?? quality","review":"I have had this item replaced several times, because it has not worked or had something on it broken.

That, plus the opening with the heart beating strongly, the quest for an \\"Eden,\\" the silver \\"chalice,\\" which the narrator finds in Asiz's frozen hands, the strange story of the rope eater, the birth canal experience in which the narrator slithers through the glacier, looking for a way out to paradise only to return to hell make me think there's more to this story than I have quite figured out to my satisfaction. That's one of the reasons I like it so much. The details ring true without self-conscious display of scholarship. The narrator remains enigmatic, and I am hoping someone has some insights into allegorical interpretations."},{"rating":"1","title":"disgusting","review":"Once I found out just what a \\"rope eater\\" was I put the book down and disposed of it.

I enjoyed this novel, which is remarkable not only for its language (superb descriptions) but also for its lack of profanities, its avoidance of anything remotely sexual, its optimism... I began to think that I was perhaps in soft-sell religious territory. It emerges as one of those rare contemporary books which a Ned Flanders could give his boys to read... Well, all that aside, it is a fine narrative and the journey across the ice is a true literary tour de force."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it","review":"Got to page 150 and did not think it would ever pick up the pace. Sad when the side stories are more interesting than the main! We get page upon page of descriptions of ice flows and ice bergs. The author does a great job of showing how dull the environment is, but in turn makes a dull story. Like listening to someone go on and on about how dull their trip turned out.The characters are pretty flat and somewhat generic, with Aziz, the three handed man thrown in as a heavy handed (no pun intended) metaphor of madness (we get many of these!).Would like to know more about Kane, the protagonist.The whole story is pretty unbelievable. A group of misfits (some criminal) brought along on a scientific discovery tour?However, I think this book might make a good movie with the potential to develop the characters and the storm sequences (dogs washing around on board is a powerful visual)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging, Fast, Fun.

Chellie has a very engaging writing style, making the book both enjoyable and easy to read. It was loaded with useful, practical information. It was not only thought provoking, but laid out an easy to use program, which if followed, will lead to greater financial success. I thoroughly enjoyed the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This is a very well-written practical book for improving your finances and building a business. There are no exercises, no miracle cures, just good practical advice for taking action to improve your finances and build a business. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Useless blathering. I read the first half closely, expecting something useful, skimmed the rest of the book, and then literally dropped it in the waste basket - something I cannot recall ever doing with a book I have purchased. Don't waste your money or, more importantly, your time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good stuff","review":"although the purpose of the book is a good and extensive one, review the literature about supervenience in a cross field way (mind-body, ethics) and the different perspectives about the realism-anti-realism, most of the time what is achieved is a kind of impressionist and empty view of the debate where the main players are mentioned but not rightly debated. The chapter about ethics is especially weak and the model presented in the end of the first chapter seems more like a dream of what supervenience should be than what was proved to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"Jeff Kuhn and Bryan Garner have taken what is usually a mundane and tedious topic and made it simple for the average weekend golfer to understand. Best of all, they kept it priced reasonably for that same weekend golfer. Buy this book and keep it in your bag - your friends/playing partners are sure to follow your lead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Good","review":"Although this toy does come with some nice stencils and activity pack, it does not have any place to store them and there is no way to attach them to the table so it is hard for my daughter to hold the paper steady. If I had it to do over I would not buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paradiso is paradise!","review":"Paradiso is another good book in the Divine Comedy trilogy. However most people never get past Inferno. The first two are good, and Paradiso most definetly holds up to its counterparts. I would also like to add that Allen Mandelbaum does an excellent job translating the Divine Comedy, as well as the Aeneid of Virgil. Paradiso, translated by Mandelbaum is easy to read, and very poetic. I am sure it is just how Dante himself would have written it, had he written the Divine Comedy in english."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well Wrought but not Fun to Read","review":"John Ciardi's footnotes were excellent. I would not recommend the Paradiso or Purgatorio to anyone, though all should read the Inferno.A.D. 1300 Heaven is an interactive laser light show set to vocal music--or, more accurately, that is how it is presented to the poet so he can grasp it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I stopped reading a third of the way through","review":"I thought this was going to be a great book. I heard good things about it and it started out great. But, then I was just completely bored and not into it. I kept waiting for something to happen and maybe it did; I just wasn't patient enough to stick with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea but flat writing","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. The plot is intriguing and could be turned into a good book if the writing were more mature. I don't read romances but I think this should be classified as one. It reminds me of high school creative writing classes in which the teacher says \\"okay, you have the plot, now flesh it out with descriptive details.\\" Immature writers include flat, boring details like \\"he smelled of soap and clean oil,\\" representative of so many of the dull descriptions in this novel. Those details always seem to be stuck in there just because there needed to be some descriptive details, as if a computer could have stuck them in without any passion or feeling for the characters or story. The editors really should have required many, many more rewrites. Pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like Lifetime movies...","review":"If you like Lifetime movies, then you may like this novel. It is about the repercussions arising from a doctor giving away his Down's syndrome daughter (Phoebe) at birth and keeping the secret from his family, including his wife. This coincidence-filled premise is particularly hard to believe.The gradual estrangement that occurs between the doctor and his long-suffering wife over the years was effectively presented, but other relationships and characters are not: after 30 years of timidity and safety, the nurse Caroline takes Phoebe and flees to raise her; Paul, the son of the doctor, hates his father despite a presentation of kindness of care; the doctor suddenly takes in a pregnant runaway to look after; a Fabio-like character (Frederick) swoops in to sweep the doctor's wife of her feet.This book appeals more to the emotions than the intellect, but is not effective in doing so. I can not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too melodramatic for me","review":"The beginning of the book seemed like it should have said 1864 instead of 1964 because in the 60's people were not this ignorant. Maybe it's because I am a nurse and the character of the nurse was absolutely cliche, as was the doctor.Somehow, I put that aside and started reading because it was an interesting plot. Another reviewer said that you never got the perspective from the daughter, and I agree, the book suffered from that. Also, WAY too much detail and sideplots.Not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maddening, Dysfunctional Characters","review":"I yelled, \\"No!\\" at this book as I read it. There's not one decent character in it. David never overcomes his deception that sets the whole thing going. At any point he could confess with some honesty. Instead he feels overly guilty and responsible for things he is not responsible for. Norah has affairs and extreme escapist behavior. Paul steals. None of the relationships are healthy. They all become cold, distant and anger filled and have unhealthy hidden feelings. These things creep into Caroline and Al and others, too. All the characters and their love relationships blur into one another. All the characters are escapist in one way or another. The problems in one appear in others for no good reason. Even strange little quirks like concern with smelling the scent of the person a character is kissing jumps from character to character to character for no reason.In short, this book frustrated and irritated me. Somehow I finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good enough!","review":"In the beginning of this book it seemed like an interesting story was going to develop, but unfortunately it became dull and basically the same theme was repeated throughout making it a tiresome read. Towards the last half, I just wanted the story to end. It went on too long. Don't waste your valuable reading time on this one!"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],x={key:0},W={key:1};function N(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",W,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",x,"See more"))],8,M)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(B,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-77d7a62a"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/28.md","filePath":"quotes/28.md"}'),R={name:"quotes/28.md"},P=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
